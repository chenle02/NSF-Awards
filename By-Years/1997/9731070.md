9731070 Donahue This award will support the partnership efforts of the National
Alliance of State Science and Mathematics Coalitions and the Educational
Commission of the States (ECS) as a one-year "proof of concept" project to build
state-level reform infrastructures in three states. The proposal identifies a
model for infrastructure that entails eight critical components. These
components involve a coalition of leadership across educational, business, and
policy boundaries: a seasoned process for reviewing and assuring alignment of
state policies with standards-based reform; a process for responding to gaps in
systemic reform strategies; a process for assisting districts in the state as
they select and implement standards-based curriculum, mechanisms for focusing
resources in the state on systemic reform; mechanisms for collecting, analyzing,
and communicating data on various performance indicators; and mechanisms for
using such data in formative fashion to adjust systemic reform strategies. The
NASSMC/ECS partnership presents a powerful opportunity of joining the efforts of
mathematics and science educators (represented by NASSMC) to the policy levers
in respective state education systems (represented by ECS) to create important,
reform capable networks.
