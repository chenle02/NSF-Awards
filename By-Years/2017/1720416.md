Much of computational mathematics relies on the task of constructing computer-
based models that predict a physical property, such as expected capacitance of
an eletrochemical battery or power output of a wind turbine. A computationally
stable way to construct such a computer model is to build new mathematical
functions. This project aims to provide rigorous mathematical foundations and
robust computational tools for generating polynomials and subsequently devise
efficient algorithms for using these polynomials to build functions. The
objectives of this project provide insight into the related mathematical fields
of analysis and applied approximation theory, and aid computational scientists
in building robust simulation models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Approximations built
from an expansion in orthogonal polynomials are classical tools in applied
mathematics. These approximations are frequently the bedrock of algorithms for
computationally solving differential and integral equations. The generation and
manipulation of such expansions in one variable has been the subject of a great
deal of theoretical and computational research in past decades, and there are
constructive algorithms for most problems of interest. Far less is known in the
multivariate non-tensorial case, for which there are only a few restrictive
computational tools for generation of multivariate orthogonal polynomials. The
research of this project focuses on theoretical development and computational
implementation of methods for generating multivariate orthogonal polynomials on
non-tensorial domains with non-tensorial weights. Mathematical investigations of
this project involve fundamental contributions to the theory of multivariate
orthogonal polynomials, and design of robust algorithms for generation of
multivariate orthogonal polynomials. From a practical standpoint the algorithms
and methodologies in this project produce expansions in an orthogonal series and
will be useful in various engineering design, optimization, and reliability
contexts.
