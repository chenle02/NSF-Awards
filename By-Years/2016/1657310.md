This research investigates ethical implications of information technology user
experience (UX) practice, and the identification of methods which can be used to
effectively surface ethical concerns in education and practice domains. The
specific focus is "dark patterns," a term for UX design practices where user
experiences are manipulated, using knowledge of human behavior and the desires
of end users in order to implement deceptive functionality that is not in the
user's best interest. The research will investigate how professional UX
designers and students employ or avoid ethical forms of decision making,
resulting in intentional or unintentional use of dark patterns in their final
designs. The goal is to document how designers make decisions in relation to
ethical concerns, and to understand what degree of awareness they have of the
immediate and broader impacts of the designs they create. The work will result
in identification of a toolkit of methods that increase ethical awareness in
professional practice, while also informing the formal education of UX
designers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Studies will include professional UX designers
and students working in differing settings on varied problems. A triangulation
of artifact analysis, field studies, user surveys and interviews, and cognitive
protocols will be used to improve generalization to real world settings. Two
phases of research will identify the nature of ethical awareness in relation to
dark patterns. In Phase 1, corpora will be created that comprehensively document
ethically-centered design methods, tools, and approaches alongside critically-
focused and everyday designs that exemplify dark patterns. Phase 2 will build
upon this comprehensive understanding of dark patterns, and document how UX
practitioners and students perceive ethical issues in their design processes and
output. In addition, we will document how end users experience dark patterns.
The resulting understandings of ethical awareness will be used to identify areas
for practitioner and pedagogical focus. These studies will expand our
understanding of the potential impact of using value-centered design methods to
increase awareness of the ethical implications of design decisions.
