9322778 Warner This two-year award supports U.S.-Belgium-Italy cooperative
research in fish ecology and fisheries. Researchers from the University of
California, Santa Barbara (Robert A. Warner), University of Liege (Pierre
Lejeune), and University of Padova (Andrea Marconato) will conduct a comparative
study of fertilization rates of benthically spawning nearshore fish. Using a
series of benthically spawning wrasses available only in the Mediterranean, the
investigators will study the fertilization rates and sperm release. They will
then conduct field experiments to demonstrate the relationship between spawning
rate, sperm allocation, and the demands of male defense. The project takes
advantage of facilities at the European marine station for underwater and
oceanographic research in Corsica, France. It brings together U.S.-Belgium and
Italian expertise and experience on an important economic topic. Fisheries
worldwide depend on accurate estimates of fish fecundity and production. This
study advances understanding of the fertilization process and factors related to
increased production. This information eventually will be applied by fisheries
in order to increase production. ***
