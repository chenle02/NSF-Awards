The objective of this research is to analyze the developmental regulation of
mitochondrial ATP synthase biosynthesis and function in the parasitic protozoan
Trypanosoma brucei during its differentiation from mammalian to insect (tsetse
fly) host specificity. This differention is accompanied by mitochondrial
biogenesis, derepression of the mitochondrial genome, and a swith from
glycolytic to respiratory energy metabolism; and is advocated as a model system
for mitochondrial biogenesis in eukaryotes. The subunit structure of the enzyme,
and its regulation by inhibitor or activator proteins, will be examined in
different developmental forms of the trypanosome. These experiments will be
accompanied by cloning and structural analysis of enzyme genes and gene
transcripts, and a test of the possibility that editing of these transcripts
occurs in some developmental stages. It is intended that the combined result of
these studies will reveal the molecular basis and regulatory mechanism of the
developmental shift in ATP synthase activity that occurs in this system. In
addition, this research has potential to contribute generally to knowledge of
regulation of polysubunit enzymes in differentiating systems.
