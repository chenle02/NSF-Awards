The problem addressed in this project is that of fitting a smoothing or
interpolating surface to data values associated with scattered points in the
plane. The surface function provides a visual impression of the data, thus
enabling its efficient evaluation. It also enables the computation of integrals
and values or derivatives at arbitrary points. Surface fitting methods are
useful in almost every field of scientific inquiry, and are particularly
important in meteorology, geology, geophysics, geography, and engineering
design. Criteria for judging the value of a data fitting method include
faithfulness to the data, a pleasing appearance of the fitting function,
computational efficiency, storage efficiency, user- convenience, and user-
control of parameters which define the fitting function. The objective of the
proposed research is to produce a surface fitting method and software package.
The software is to be placed in the public domain and distributed to the
scientific community through the ACM Algorithms Distribution Service.
