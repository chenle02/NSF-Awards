Young 9504863 The proposed research has to do with dynamical systems using
probabilistic methods. More specifically, the investigator plans to study the
statistical properties of chaotic dynamical systems; to develop criteria for the
existence of natural invariant measures in nonuniform hyperbolic settings and
find mechanisms that lead to exponential mixing properties. Dynamical systems
theory is the qualitative study of (autonomous) systems of ordinary differential
equations. These systems model various natural phenomena such as turbulence,
fluid flows, and ecological systems. Although relatively simple locally, the
global picture of a dynamical system over time can be extremely complicated and
chaotic; dynamical systems theory seeks to understand this global long time
behavior in a systematic and rigorous fashion.
