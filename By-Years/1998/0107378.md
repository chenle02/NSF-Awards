The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S. scientists and
engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research abroad. The
program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique
or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.

This award will provide twelve months of support to Dr. Gregory D. Smith to work
with Dr. Steve Weiner at the Weizmann Institute's Kimmel Center for
Archaeological Science in Rehovot, Israel. This project involves the
reconstruction of paleogeochemical environments of cave shelters in order to
assess the completeness of their archaeological records. Authigenic minerals
identified in situ at prehistoric sites will serve as paleoenvironmental
indicators. They will be purified and their solubilities studied under varying
conditions in order to predict past diagenetic conditions. Armed with such
knowledge, archaeologists will know better how the archaeological record is
affected or altered by post-depositional chemical diagenesis. It is expected
that results from this work will be applicable not only to prehistoric cave
archaeology, but to other areas of archaeology as well as geology.

Dr. Weiner is the director of the newly established Kimmel Center, as well as
professor of Structural Biology at the Weizmann Institute.
