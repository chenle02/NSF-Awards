NSF Award Abstract - DMS-0129714 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical Sciences:
New Applications of Soliton Theory in Nonlinear Optics
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract DMS-0129714 &lt;br/&gt;Kaup
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this project is to investigate
methods for describing certain nonlinear integrable systems in terms of
collective modes. A collective-mode description uses only a few parameters to
describe the important features of a system, and the evolution of the system can
be well understood in terms of the evolution of only these few parameters.
Various nonlinear optical systems of current technological interest, such as
second harmonic generation, three-wave parametric interactions, stimulated Raman
scattering, and two-photon propagation, will be studied. We seek to determine
forms of collective modes that may be useful for these systems, and then to
determine how parameter values for these collective modes may be gleaned from
input data. New types of collective modes, called virtual solitons, have already
been discovered in second harmonic generation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose
of this project is to develop new ways to express solutions of the complicated
equations describing interactions of laser light with matter. Simple
mathematical expressions that give exact solutions of these equations are known
for some simple pulses and certain combinations of such pulses. Some of these
pulses are the same type as the optical pulses that are used to transmit
information in optical fibers. In this project, we will develop ways to express
other solutions of the equations in a more explicit form than is currently
available. In the process, we will find new classes of useful pulse forms and
broaden the class of well-understood solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
