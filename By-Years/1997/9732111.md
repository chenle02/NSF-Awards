This Chemistry Division award provides support for a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in the Chemistry Department, Harvey Mudd College,
directed by Dr. Robert J. Cave. Eight students will participate each year over
the next three years in a 10-week summer program. The program will focus on
women students. The participants will be exposed to a variety of research topics
across all the fields of chemistry and will be introduced to safety practices.
Other program activities include tours to a variety of chemical firms and
seminars presentations by Harvey Mudd alumni. Students will be required to
report research results in the form of written and oral presentations, and they
will be encouraged to present their research at conferences such as meetings of
the American Chemical Society and the Council on Undergraduate Research.
