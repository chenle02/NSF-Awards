9711970 Castleman The project is a study of electrolyte systems that contain
halogens, nitrogen and sulfur molecules which are important to the atmosphere.
The main focus of the work is to study the uptake/dissolution of electrolytes in
aqueous systems and related gas-to-particle processes via a molecular cluster
approach. The thermochemistry and reaction mechanisms of electrolyte systems
will also be investigated for a smaller set of electrolyte systems which have
high relevance to atmospheric phenomena. The main emphasis will be on halogens
(as the acid forms), halogen oxyacids and salts, and on some related electrolyte
species composed of nitrogen and sulfate compounds. Two spectroscopic approaches
will be employed to study the processes associated with electrolyte dissolution:
(1) resonant electronic state energy change upon solvation; and (2)
photodepletion. A time-of-flight mass spectrometer system configured with
appropriate tunable lasers will be used for the research. Results from the
project will provide new information on the relative importance of competing
chemical and physical processes that occur via molecular aggregation. These
heterogeneous processes have potential importance for understanding the uptake
of atmospheric molecules by polar stratospheric ice crystals, and for
elucidating gas-to-particle conversion mechanisms that occur in the lower
troposphere.
