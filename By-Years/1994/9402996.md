9402996 Ho This SBIR Phase II project is for the continued development of a very
sensitive and portable fluoroimmunoassay device that uses disposable cells
having a polymer antibody support capable of multichannel multicomponent
analysis. These devices are potentially useful in many medical and clinical
diagnostics seen in intensive or emergency care patients. Physical Optics Corp.
will develop a highly parallel and sensitive fluoroimmunoassay holographic
optical waveguide for the monitoring of biological systems. This unique latex-
based waveguide has excellent optical quality and an established
immunochemistry, making it stable and reliable for sensing applications because
the polymer-based waveguide probe is inexpensive and disposable, and the
waveguide cartridge is suitable for one time assay. During the Phase II program,
the proposed system will be specifically used for therapeutic drug monitoring.
