9222322 Knapp This award will fund Undergraduate Design Projects to develop
custom devices for persons with disabilities. This group will work with
therapists and patients at a rehabilitation hospital which focuses on physical
disabilities. Ten projects per year will be undertaken by the groups and reports
on the completed projects will be included in a publication that will detail the
projects completed at all institutions participating in this program. This type
of experience is important since not only will it provide meaningful projects
for the engineering students to complete as part of their education, but it will
also benefit a population where customization is usually required of many
rehabilitation devices. ***
