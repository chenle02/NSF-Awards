Armed by an understanding that the fundamental mechanism of accretion is angular
momentum transport due to magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence driven by the
magneto-rotational instability, it has become possible to investigate at a
detailed level the astrophysical properties of accretion onto black holes. With
previous NSF support, this team has developed a suite of Newtonian and general
relativistic MHD numerical simulation codes suitable for exploring the global
properties of accretion flows onto black holes and the jets they sometimes
generate. This collaborative project, led by Dr. Krolik, will now extend prior
work to consider accretion thermodynamics and energetics, the impact of large-
scale magnetic fields, and how an accretion flow oriented obliquely to the black
hole rotation axis at large distances interacts with Lense-Thirring torques.
Emphasis will be placed throughout on creating quantitative links between
dynamical simulation data and observable properties.

This work should provide genuine guidance for the controversy over how much
large-scale magnetic flux may be brought deep into the accretion flow. It should
also reveal how accretion flows stressed by magnetic fields with intrinsic
large-scale structure may differ from those without. In addition, computing MHD
stresses within the accretion flow is essential to the question of the extent of
disk bending by gravitomagnetic forces, and it should soon be possible to
calculate disk structure with sufficient resolution to address this issue.

Both simulation codes and data from specific models will be made available to
the community, strengthening the software infrastructure of the discipline. The
project will provide graduate student training in numerical simulation
techniques. Successful public outreach efforts based on simulation results will
continue, including planetarium shows and television documentaries.
