9220603 Cooper Flexural creep and attenuation experiments on glass-ceramics and
synthetic (Co-Mg) olivine-basalt partial-melt aggregates indicate three-to-four
distinct anelastic loss (attenuation) mechanisms. These losses interact to
produce an attenuation "band" in space. The nature of these losses, if
understood, could form an unequivocal foundation for recognizing the attenuation
effects(s) uniquely associated with partial melting. Therefore, an experimental
investigation of the effects of quasiequilibrated partial melting on the
attenuation behavior of polycrystalline silicates will be done. Seismic-to-
subseismic frequency experiments will be performed in both shear (reciprocating
torsion) and Young's modulus (reciprocating flexure) formats in order to isolate
the effects of a steady-state melt morphology on S- and P- wave attenuation. The
experiments will be applied to synthetic aggregates of olivine, olivine-
plus-(olivine-saturated) tholeiite basalt and aluminosilicate glass-ceramics.
