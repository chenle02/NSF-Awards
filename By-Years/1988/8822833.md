Scientific progress is a multifaceted process, involving experimentation,
observation, theory, publishing, informal discussions, and formal meetings. The
current proposal seeks support for the latter of these activities, namely for
the partial support of the Santa Cruz Summer Workshop on "Supernovae," which
will be held on the campus of the University of California in Santa Cruz from
July 10 to July 21, 1989. Approximately 120 to 150 participants are expected.
Topics to be discussed include Supernova 1987A, presupernova stars, the
explosion mechanism, supernova spectra, nucleosynthesis in supernovae, and other
related subjects.
