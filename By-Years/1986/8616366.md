It is the goal of the project to determine the feasibility of performing
electroorganic reactions in supercritical fluids. The synthesis of
dimethylformamide, a Kolbe reaction, and the synthesis of p-aminophenol, from
nitrobenzene, have been identified as suitable candidate reactions. Initial
studies in this project will focus on the phase behavior of the solvent mixtures
of the reacting systems. In subsequent electrochemical studies, solution
conductivity, surface overpotential, and reaction selectivity will be
determined. The goal is to identify combinations of solvents, electrode
materials, and operating conditions where the reactions can be efficiently
performed. Operation in the supercritical region may lead to enhanced mass
transport, increased selectivity, increased reactant solubility, and improved
product separation.
