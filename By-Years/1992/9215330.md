Modeling of the perturbations of atmospheric emissions due to gravity waves and
tides at mesopause altitudes (85km) provides insight into the coupling between
chemistry and dynamics in this region. Without theoretical models to serve as a
guide, ambiguities will exist in the interpretation of nightglow observations of
gravity waves and tides. The Na-D nightglow has never been modeled in terms of
gravity wave forcing. The modeling of the effects of gravity waves on the Na
layer, as revealed, in lidar measurements have until now only included dynamics
and not considered chemistry. We propose to model gravity wave-driven
fluctuations in the sodium nightglow by developing a model that incorporates
both dynamics and chemistry. This new model will use the most recent self-
consistent model of the sodium chemistry, including reactions involving neutral
species, ions and cluster-ions. The dynamics will be based on linear gravity
wave theory but will include the generalized effects of eddy diffusivities. Na
and OH nightglow measured with an all-sky camera system will provide us with the
horizontal wavelength and period, and azimuth of propagation and the relative
intensity variations of the two nightglows for comparison with the Na nightglow
fluctuation models and OH nightglow.
