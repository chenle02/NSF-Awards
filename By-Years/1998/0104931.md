Iron plays an important role in the function and productivity of aquatic
ecosystems, either directly, via effects on biogeochemistry and nutrient
cycling, or indirectly, via effects on plankton community composition. Dr.
Brzezinski and Ms. Franck would like to explore the ways in which iron
availability can regulate diatom production and macronutrient cycling in the
Polar Frontal Zone in the Pacific Sector of the Southern Ocean and in the highly
productive upwelling areas off the coast of California and Peru. All are regions
where large diatoms blooms and net CO2 drawdown can occur, but where iron (Fe)
and silicon (Si) availability may play a role in regulating the timing and
occurrence of these blooms and the magnitude of CO2 uptake. In this work the
investigators will quantify the effects of Fe availability on Si and nitrate
biogeochemistry, as well as look for mechanisms behind the observed effects,
e.g. how Fe availability alters Si and nitrate uptake kinetics, diatom species
composition and species-specific Si uptake.
