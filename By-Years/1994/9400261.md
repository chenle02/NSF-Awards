9400261 Jakus The objectives of this proposal are to develop new processing
technologies for the generation of comprehensive residual surface stresses in
ceramic components and to evaluate the effects of controlled residual stress
gradients on quasisatic and dynamic damage resistance of residual stress
strengthened functionally gradient ceramic materials. By using special
processing methods the surface layers of specimens will be made to densify
faster than the interior, causing these layers to undergo creep deformation at
the densification of the interior. By using the appropriate temperature and load
conditions the functionally gradient ceramic materials can be produced. The
proposed research will be conducted in collaboration with NRC Italy, NIST and
Norton CO. %%% The objectives of this proposal are to develop new and novel
processing approach for understanding and developing the new generation of
functionally gradient ceramics. The proposed research has potential and will
contribute to the National Science Foundation Advance Structural Materials
program. ***
