It is proposed that the PI be Kenneth Poeppelmeier (Northwestern) and an
executive committee consisting of J. M. Honig (Purdue), Jeremy Burdett
(Chicago), Robert McCarley (Iowa State) have the major responsibility of
administering the grant. The funds from this grant would be made available to
cover travel and living expenses of student and faculty participants during the
entire period of the program, and travel and subsistence for scientists chosen
as lecturers during the first week of the program. Funds also would provide for
travel of all student and faculty participants to return to Northwestern at the
end of the summer period, when each participant can present a report on the
results of his or her project in a symposium format. This symposium would be
held over two day period, and would be vital in furthering the participant's
overview of the program, their ability to organize and report research results,
and to impart a professional orientation to further work in the field of solid
state chemistry.
