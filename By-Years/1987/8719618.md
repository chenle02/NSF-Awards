This renewal proposal of NSF grant ECS-8501433 is for the study of new excimer
and anti-Stokes Raman laser systems primarily in the VUV and XUV regions of the
electromagnetic spectrum. The proposed research will utilize the unique
capabilities of two different complimentary approaches of electron beam and
laser-produced plasma excitation developed during recent years at Rice
University. A new class of molecules, the ionic alkali halide excimer, was
recently predicted and discovered by the PI. Their spectroscopy as well as
mechanisms leading to their production will be investigated. Possible excitation
schemes include Penning ionization processes to a second ionization potential
via collision with electron-beam-produced metastable helium and neon atoms.
Optical excitation of these highly-excited states through excimer laser ablation
of molecules from solid surfaces and soft x-ray excitation of alkali vapors will
also be studied. This is a novel approach since this excitation technique has
thus far only been applied to atomic systems. A search for new triatomic rare
gas halide excimers will also be carried out to clarify their kinetic behavior.
In addition, new pumping schemes for known lasers as well as the development of
novel laser sources based on new spectroscopic information will be investigated.
One such scheme will utilize a novel optical excitation technique employing
glass cones (axicons) in order to optically pump the rare gas excimers. This
could result in simple milliwatt average power tunable VUV sources. Other
proposed schemes include anti-Stokes Raman lasers in the rare gas excimer,
atomic oxygen, and the collisional excitation of quasi-metastable quartet states
of the alkali atoms.
