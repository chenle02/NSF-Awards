This study will focus on the heat transfer in the vicinity of the reattachment
of a free shear layer. The research comprises both theoretical and experimental
studies to: explore the flow field of a subsonic turbulent radical jet which
reattaches on an adjacent plane surface; determine the heat transfer between a
subsonic turbulence radical jet and an adjacent plane surface; and explore the
manufacturing and applications of a radical jet reattachment.
