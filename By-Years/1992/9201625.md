The work aims to develop understanding on toughness microstructure relations in
selected polymeric composites. The matrices investigated are the polycarbonate
and polybutylene terphthalate. Improved understanding of mechanisms of
toughening associated with crack wake effects and crack front toughening is
sought. The fracture toughness will be investigated by J-Integral fracture
mechanics test methods. Direct in situ observation in the microscope of
deformation and fracture ahead of crack tips will be also conducted to gain a
physical understanding of the toughening phenomena.
