Spray forming process offers a great potential for near-net shape manufacturing
of metal-matrix composites. A special experimental system will be developed to
investigate the effects of process variables such as droplet size, velocity,
temperature history, undercooling and impingement surface condition on the
formed geometry, microstructure and yield. Also investigated will be the effects
of splat phenomena and inclusion of reinforcing particulates on the resulting
microstructures. Several hypothesis on the solidification mechanism will be
examined, and the results will be incorporated into available mathematical
processing models.
