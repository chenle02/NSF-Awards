Interfacial phenomena have become a frontier in polymer science, and much
excitement is being generated in a wide variety of the areas dealing with
molecular organization and self-assembly of surface-active polymers, forces
between surfaces with adsorbed polymer chains, interface-mediated chain
conformations and polymer- segment density profiles at interfaces. This is a
project directed at the polymer-chain transport on monolayers at the interfaces
of air/water and oil/water and toward such interfaces. With the interfacial
dynamic techniques of 1) surface-fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, 2)
surface quasielastic light scattering, and 3) electrocapillary-wave diffraction
in conjunction with the interfacial static techniques of neutron reflectivity
and spectroscopic ellipsometry, the investigators will examine (1) polymer
lateral diffusion on the interface of air/water (A/W) and oil/water (O/W); (2)
polymer monolayer viscoelasticity at A/W and at air/polymer interface; (3)
polymeric interfaces and effect of copolymers as the surfactants; and (4) extend
chain diffusion studies to electrophoresis of polyelectrolytes with the
technique of electric-field-modulated Forced Rayleigh Scattering.
