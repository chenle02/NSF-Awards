Ms. Phyllis Brady is the Director of the Child Development Programs in the
Education Office of Santa Barbara County, California. Ms. Brady proposes three
years of leadership training in science and math education for 90 elementary and
pre-school teachers from Santa Barbara, Ventura, and San Luis Obispo Counties.
The teachers would be drawn from schools with large minority enrollments, and
the training would focus on modifying existing instructional materials, and
developing new materials, that address the multicultural, socioeconomic,
physical disability, and gender equity issues. The proposed workshops will
provide the participating teachers with an excellent background and experience
in science and math content, and the most current teaching methods in early
childhood science/math education. This training experience will allow them to
develop strategies for improving equity of access to science and mathematics for
children of diverse backgrounds. They will then train and work with the other
teachers in their respective schools to extend the impact of their training. The
cost sharing for this project (not including substitute release days for
participating teachers provided by their school districts) represents 17% of the
NSF contribution.
