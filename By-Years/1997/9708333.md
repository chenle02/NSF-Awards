ABSTRACT 97-07330 Armbruster, Thomson, Wolfe, Wilson Collaborative research:
Floral function and phylogeny in Penstemon: tests of pollen presentation theory
This research examines the evolution of floral traits within the plant genus
Penstemon, a member of the snapdragon family. The investigators will derive a
"family tree" of Penstemon using DNA sequences to estimate genetic similarities,
so that observed changes in floral characters can be interpreted with a proper
understanding of species relationships. Ecological research will be focused on
ways that Penstemon anther characteristics influence size and number of pollen
doses, and ultimately, plant fitness in hummingbird- and bee-pollinated plants.
An untested new theory predicts that when pollinating animals visit frequently,
plants that release pollen from their anthers in smaller doses per visit will
donate more pollen to other plants. As the first test of pollen presentation
theory, this research will help decide whether these models are correct and
useful. Improved knowledge of pollination mechanics can help improve the
economic evaluation of alternative pollinators of agricultural crops.
