Dr. Kevin L. Schey has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Schey's doctoral degree was from Purdue University under the
supervision of Professor R. Graham Cooks. Dr. Schey intends to continue his
research at the University of Chicago under the sponsorship of Professor D.
H.Levy. Dr. Schey's area of postdoctoral research will be the determination of
dissociation rates as a function of internal energy deposited for peptide ions
using laser desorption, ionization and excitation in a supersonic beam tandem
time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry
Program is viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to broaden
the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D's and attract them into meaningful
careers in contemporary chemical research and teaching.
