Instrumentation acquired through this project is being used to initiate a two-
semester Molecular Biology course in which undergraduates learn recombinant DNA
methodology in the laboratory. Major instruments include an ultracentrifuge with
two rotors, UV spectrophotometer, power supplies, DNA sequencing apparatus,
constant temperature shakers for bacterial growth, a scintillation counter, and
two microcomputers with hard disks. The instruments will be used in a series of
10-week laboratory exercises each semester for students in the Junior year.
These exercises will acquaint students with the growth of bacteria,
bacteriophages and plasmids, the subcloning of phage genes into plasmid DNA,
bacterial transformation with recombinant DNA, site-specific mutagenesis, the
construction of a genomic library, nucleic acid filter hybridization, and an
introduction to DNA base sequence analysis. The course prepares students for
active involvement in undergraduate research projects in Molecular Biology in
their Senior year. The faculty anticipates that this course will create such
enthusiasm that an increased number of students will consider scientific
research careers in the fields of molecular and cellular biology.
