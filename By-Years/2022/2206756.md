When neutron stars, which are some of the most spectacular compact objects in
the Universe, merge, they launch powerful jets that move nearly at the speed of
light. To predict the formation of these jets, it is necessary to understand how
accompanying magnetic fields are spontaneously produced during neutron star
mergers. The present award will focus on the so-called “dynamo effect,” which
accounts for the emergence of magnetic fields from turbulence. Understanding the
role of the dynamo effect is crucial for our understanding of multi-messenger
astrophysical sources and thus addresses goals of NSF's "Windows on the
Universe: The Era of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
magnetic field necessary for launching astrophysical jets may be generated in at
least two locations: in the shear layer between the neutron stars when they
first come into contact, and, if the remnant is a black hole, in the flow of
accreting material immediately following the merger. The goal of this effort is
to elucidate from first principles the dynamo produced by the Kelvin-Helmholtz
instabilities in the pre-merger phase, and the magnetorotational instability and
the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in the post-merger phase. The award will also
support engagement with the Princeton Pre-Doctoral Fellowship Initiative,
strengthen the current partnership of Princeton University with the American
Physical Society Bridge Program, and enable involvement of undergraduates in
synergistic research projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
