The area under study is seeing increasing interest as demands for higher
computing speed and more computing capacity increase. It is anticipated that
this particular area of integrated optics will become increasingly important as
single-mode fiber optical beam propagation develops, thereby putting more
demands upon means by which to control and handle the high speed of
transmission. Students educated in the general area covered by the proposed
effort are under great demand. They receive broad training in various techniques
used to fabricate optical devices and in the processing of signals used in
telecommunications generally.
