This award provides approximately 20% of the funds required to equip a
geochronology laboratory at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology
(NMIMT) that will be operated jointly by the New Mexico Bureau of Mines and
Mineral Resources and the Department of Geosciences at NMIMT. The Bureau of
Mines, the Los Alamos National Laboratory, and NMIMT are committed to providing
the remaining funds required. The laboratory facility will apply the
argon-40/argon-39 radiometric dating technique to determine the history of
volcanic activity during the Quaternary Period (with special emphasis on the
southwest US region) and to dating the sequence of volcanic tephra (ash) layers
within Antarctic ice cores to interpret global paleoclimatic and
paleoenvironmental cycles.
