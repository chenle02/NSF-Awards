This award supports Optics and Photonics Training for Inquisitive
eXperimentalists (OPTIX), a project to create an innovative, hands-on laboratory
environment at Willamette University where undergraduate sophomores and juniors
can work with research grade optics equipment in a dedicated space designed to
foster deep, inquiry-based learning. Students will complete carefully designed
modules that encourage creativity and independence, preparing them better for a
more rigorous and meaningful senior year capstone project and giving them vital
skills and motivation for a career in the STEM fields after graduation. Modules
will also be developed for local community college students at Chemeketa
Community College, and an optics related hands-on exhibition for the Gilbert
House Children's Museum in Salem, OR.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The optics modules
will require different levels of student sophistication, training, and
involvement. The most basic optics module will provide an introduction to
optics, and serve as a gateway to the more advanced activities. Students at the
sophomore level then continue taking three additional basic modules that
introduce them to more sophisticated ideas and techniques. The focus at the
junior level is on intermediate modules, some of which are extensions of modules
encountered during the sophomore year and others which lead into the advanced
modules that students can take in their senior year or as independent research
projects to prepare them for the transition into research labs. The
effectiveness of this initiative will be ascertained by assessing student skills
and attitudes before, during, and after exposure to OPTIX modules with the help
of an external evaluator.
