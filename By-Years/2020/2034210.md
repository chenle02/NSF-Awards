An award is made to James C Wyant College, The University of Arizona, to develop
a high- performance reflective microscope for biological research. This project
will advance biological research by simplifying the microscopic imaging system
and enabling new biological data collection not previously possible. The
microscope design will enable a better understanding of subcellular structures
and cellular processes. It will also have major societal impacts through
research, education, and research training of the future U.S. research workforce
on instrumentation innovation and biological sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
innovation project will address unmet needs for microscope imaging for
biological research. The microscope will provide new capabilities for high-
resolution imaging across the spectrum from UV to far-IR. The new microscope
will not only simplify the configurations of the current multimodal imaging
systems and data acquisition process over a wide spectral range, but also open
new doors to biological research not possible with current refractive and
reflective microscopes. The new imaging modality will enhance methods for
current biological data collection and enable the collection of new biological
data and information to generate knowledge and advance the field of
biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
