With support from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
Program Dr. David R. Tyler will investigate the fundamental chemistry of
organometallic compounds which have nineteen electrons in the outer shell of the
metal. These highly reactive species are generated in light-induced reactions of
stable organometallic compounds. The results of the study are expected to
provide a better understanding of the photochemistry of organometallic compounds
and may enable the use of 19-electron species as homogeneous catalysts. The
study will be divided into three subprojects: (1) The generation and reactivity
of water-soluble 19-electron complexes will be investigated. Of particular
interest are electron transfer reactions of the water-soluble complexes and the
synthesis of an "electron reservoir" for two-electron transfers. (2) The factors
that influence the stability of 19-electron complexes will be elucidated by
measurements of the thermodynamics of their formation. (3) The use of
19-electron complexes in homogeneous catalysis will be investigated through
experiments designed to probe reactivity toward dihydrogen and toward CO
insertion. The cyclotrimerization of acetylene will be studied to test the
hypothesis that 19-electron complexes can couple substrates on different metal
centers.
