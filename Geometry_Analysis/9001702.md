The principal investigator will study pseudodifferential techniques in the
study of degenerate elliptic equations with applications to geometry. He will
extend techniques to determine a spectral analysis of the Hodge-Laplace operator
acting on differential forms on complete asymptotic hyperbolic manifolds of
infinite volume and on geometrically finite quotients of hyperbolic space.
Related projects involve the study of the relationship between unique
continuation theorems for the Laplacian at infinity and the presence of negative
curvature. For many years mathematicians have studied the behavior of certain
differential operators on hypersurfaces which extend off to infinity. This study
has its origins in the calculus of Newton. In this project the principal
investigator will analyze operators which have large variations over very large
domains "near" infinity. In the past, only progress on operators which have
small local variations was made.
