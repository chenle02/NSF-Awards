Several fundamental issues concerning intermetallic alloys are addressed in
this research. Electron energy loss spectrometry (EELS) is used to measure the
lithium content in aluminum-lithium intermetallic phases to determine the degree
of lithium loss during processing and analysis. A parallel detector provides
faster collection of data and better statistics for chemical analysis. The
aluminum-rich corner of the phase equilibrium diagram for aluminum-lithium-
copper and phase equilibria in the titanium-beryllium system are under
investigation. The composition of second phases precipitates and segregation
behavior of alloying elements are considered.
