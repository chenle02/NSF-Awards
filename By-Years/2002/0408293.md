Cardiac arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation are a major cause of
morbidity and mortality in the United States. In this IGMS project, PI Greg
Buzzard will spend a year working with scientists at Gene Network Sciences and
Cornell University to develop computational models of heart cells and heart
tissue. He will work in conjunction with these scientists to implement and
refine a model of a single heart cell using experimental data collected at
Cornell University, to couple models of single cells in order to model heart
tissue, to use this model of heart tissue to study the mechanisms underlying
ventricular fibrillation, and to explore possible new approaches to the
numerical simulation of these models. Moreover, Buzzard will develop a strong
set of skills in biological modeling that will enable him to continue this
collaboration beyond the period of the grant and to take part in other
interdisciplinary projects.

This IGMS project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary
Activities (OMA) and the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS).
