High resolution laser techniques and high velocity resolution of particles in a
storage ring will be combined to test the validity of special relativity. The
relativistic Doppler shift experiments will test both the time dilation effect
and the isotropy in the speed of light. The experiments are based on two photon
spectroscopy, in which an atom makes a transition by simultaneously absorbing a
photon from each of two laser beams, one traveling in and the other opposite to
the direction of the atom. This allows internal cancellation of the classical
first order Doppler shift, leaving the relativistic effects as the dominant
term.
