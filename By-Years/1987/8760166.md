Engineering design is severely limited with shape memory alloys by the lack of a
simple, self-consistent set of predictive equations. Such a set of predictive
equations have been derived and tested for the shape memory alloy, Nitinol. This
theory has two parts: 1) a state equation, which uniquely and completely relates
stress, strain and temperature using 6 material specific coefficients; and 2) a
thermodynamics which relates the mechanical behavior (state equation) to the
heat flow properties. The state equation description of mechanical behavior has
been thoroughly tested. Preliminary tests indicate the same form of equation
applies to electrets and other hysteretic materials. The thermodynamic
predictions have not yet been tested by subsequent measurements. The Phase I
research is to test the thermodynamics. The Phase II research will use the
theory to study Nitinol fatigue, refine the form of the state equations, and
apply the theory to other hysteretic materials.
