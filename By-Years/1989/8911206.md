The objective of the study is to explore the long-term burial fluxes of North
African dust and equatorial Atlantic biogenic opal at two Leg 108 ODP sites.
Four causal factors will be focused on: insolation forcing, northern Hemisphere
ice sheets, tectonic uplift and linkages between equatorial and Antarctic
circulation. Stable isotopic stratigraphy will provide time resolution and
define the fluxes of opal and dust at orbital band (20 to 100 K.yrs.) and
facilitate comparison with other climatic proxies. Clay mineral analysis will
provide record of African aridity. Uplift influence will be assessed through
modeling using the General Circulation Model. The study is a continuation of the
PI's extremely productive line of investigation. It extends his previous work
further back in time as well as broadens the scope.
