This three-week enrichment program in molecular biology at Iowa State
University for twenty high potential rising 7th and 8th grade students will
stress both content instruction and science practice through laboratory
experimentation utilizing research techniques and equipment. Participants will
design, execute and present the results of an independent project and will
interact with scientists in industrial, government, and academic laboratories.
Twenty five lectures will cover relevant topics in chemistry, biochemistry,
cellular and molecular biology, and biotechnology. A college-level text will be
used as a reference. Participants will spend a minimum of 20 hours per week in
the laboratory, carrying out over twenty projects and developing research
skills. The preliminary results of their independent projects will be presented
at public forum. Career exploration will be emphasized through interactions with
scientists, visits to industrial and government laboratories and formal career
planning exercises. Participants will be encouraged to continue their
independent research project during the academic year by means of a mentor
program, access to research equipment, and a periodic newsletter. They will be
assisted in presenting papers at science fairs, symposia and junior academy of
science meetings.
