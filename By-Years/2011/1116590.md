Computers permeate all socio-economic activities of our times. The limitations
of our present silicon-based computational power are no longer residing in the
far future. The topic of this award is one that is relevant to finding new
directions for future computation, while at the same time enlarging our
understanding of physical systems suitable for quantum computing. The research
will address fundamental science questions, such as whether topological states
of matter can store, at non-zero temperatures, quantum (qubit) or classical
(bit) elements of information. The research activities will be accompanied by
educational efforts at three different levels: The PIs will provide solid
education and training to graduate students in the field of quantum information;
they will develop undergraduate courses at the interface between physics and
computer science; and they will use their expertise to help develop the "Future
of Information" module for techCAMP, a program directed towards middle-school
and high-school teachers.

Encoding information in topological states of certain many-particle systems has
been proposed as robust way to store quantum information. In these systems, the
ground state is not unique and its multiplicity is not altered by local
perturbations. As a result, when used to encode information, topological qubits
are less susceptible to errors than standard qubits. Although protected from
static perturbations, it is still uncertain how effective topological quantum
memories are in the presence of dynamical perturbations. The proposed research
addresses two important aspects of this issue. The first concerns the study of
loss of coherence in realistic setups, where both equilibrium and non-
equilibrium noise must be considered. The second is whether topological quantum
memories in the presence of thermal fluctuations are attainable in physically
realizable systems. Building on these investigations, the goal is to find ways
to improve fault tolerance in topological quantum information processing.
