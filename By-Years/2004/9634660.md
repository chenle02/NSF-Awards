Rauber/Abstract ATM-9634660 The goal of this proposal is to develop a physically
consistent understanding of the evolution of rain in warm tropical clouds. Our
proposed research involves: 1) the evaluation of hypotheses concerning the
initiation of coalescence; 2) the assessment of the importance of environmental
influences, such as vertical shear and entrainment, on the evolution of rain
following the development of the first precipitation embryos; 3) the
determination of the mechanism governing the formation of very large raindrops
in shallow warm cumulous; 4) the characterization of cloud microphysical
processes in terms of the equivalent radar reflectivity factor; and 5) the
determination of the dynamical mechanisms responsible for the formation and
rapid intensification of Hawaiian rainbands. Our studies include the analysis of
data from three field projects, the joint Hawaiian Warm rainbands. Our studies
include the analysis of data from three field projects, the Joint Hawaiian Warm
Rain Project, the Hawaiian Rainband Project, and the small Cumulus Microphysics
Experiment. The proposed research also includes modeling studies using the Clark
model, and Lagrangian trajectory models applied within kinematic fields from
both the Clark model and Doppler radar data.
