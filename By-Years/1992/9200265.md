This project treats time-discrete one- and two-dimensional sequences and arrays
with good correlation properties. Such sequences find applications in signal
processing and as aperture functions for electromagnetic and acoustic imaging.
Applications of two dimensional perfect binary arrays are found in 2-D
synchronization and time-frequency coding. Higher dimensional arrays are used in
channel coding and in cryptographic coding. This work has three topics under
study: perfect binary arrays, dot-matrix patterns with certain correlation
requirements, and periodic complementary sequences. These problems are studied
via their respective algebraic formulations viz. difference sets, relative
(divisible) difference sets and difference families. Various algebraic, number
theoretic and geometric ideas have been used recently with some success in
constructing these arrays and some generalizations.
