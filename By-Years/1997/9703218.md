CDA-9703218 Andrew Black Oregon Graduate Institute A Wide-Spectrum
Infrastructure for Software Research This award is for the construction and
evolution of an integrated, realistic software and hardware infrastructure for
software research. The infrastructure consists of a high bandwidth network
backbone, reliable disk storage service, and machines running appropriate
software such as commercial database management systems, communications software
such as CORBA, and other production software used in experimental software
research. The research supported includes both systems software (e.g., database
systems, distributed systems, software generation) and applications software
(e.g., speech recognition, neural nets, human-computer communications,
computational finance). These projects enhance their practical impact by
applying their methodology and results to realistic software platforms with the
major components chosen from the market place, e.g., the NT operating system and
several Unix flavors. The wide-spectrum infrastructure reflects the
heterogeneity in the practical world and it enables realistic experiments from
the above areas, which would otherwise be considered curiosities.
