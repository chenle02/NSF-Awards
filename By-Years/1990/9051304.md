The department of Biological Sciences attempts to provide maximum training in
laboratories using hands-on experience with instruments. Since data analysis in
biology is based largely on the collection of images (i.e. images produced from
molecular analysis of vital molecules from cells and those seen in various types
of microscopes) the acquisition of equipment for image analysis and quantitation
remedies a major deficiency in the department. With this instrument the
department can train students in the collection, storage, and interpretation of
data acquired from morphological studies of cells and their structural
components. Another application involves analysis of fossil remains. Such
training makes the students more computer literate and experienced with regard
to state-of-the-art image analysis. The university will contribute an amount
equal to the award.
