With this CAREER Award, the Chemical Catalysis Program supports the research of
Professor Daniel A. Clark of the Department of Chemistry at Syracuse University.
Professor Clark develops new catalytic methods for the silylvinylation of
alkynes. The first objective of this research is to utilize ethylene, an
abundant chemical feedstock, as a coupling partner to produce highly substituted
cyclic compounds that contain a diene. The role of ethylene on the
stereochemical outcome of silylvinylation of alkynes is carefully examined. The
second objective explores the use of vinylboronates as coupling partners with
alkynes to create more complex systems. This approach is likely to eliminate
waste streams as no pre-functionalization of starting materials is required. The
successful implementation of the proposed research is expected to positively
impact the fields of organic chemistry and agrochemistry, pharmaceuticals, and
the materials industry. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The CAREER award also provides
support for educational programs; specifically, the creation of workshops for
Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) educators in the
Syracuse and North Syracuse public schools. The goal of Professor Clark's
program is to offer access to lecture materials and chemical experiments that
can be implemented in a classroom environment by K-12 teachers. Professor
Clark's program is in line with the vision of Syracuse University (SU) entitled:
Scholarship in Action, a commitment from SU to sustained community engagement.
