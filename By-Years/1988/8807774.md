The objective of this project is to conduct research on a process that has the
potential for decontamination of water that contains organic substances in
solution that make the water unfit for its intended use. This is a renewal of
research that was initiated under an expedited award for novel research with
reference to NSF Grant No. 8612487, results of which indicated that high-energy
electron irradiation of water containing benzene, chlorobenzene, and
polychlorobiphenyls resulted in their degradation producing new compounds that
were in general more polar and therefore more soluble in water than the original
contaminants. However, it was also found that the presence of polyethylene oxide
during irradiation resulted in a substantial decrease of those fragments in
solution. This suggested the possibility that contaminant free radical species
formed during irradiation in the presence of a polymer are coupled to radical-
sites formed on the dissolved polymer and that contaminant species could be
subsequently removed by sand-filtration or some other conventional water
treatment physical and/or chemical process. The presence of organic contaminants
in water is a National problem of considerable significance as this presence
relates to usefulness of surface and groundwaters for municipal and industrial
purposes. It is possible that further research on this concept of linking a
radiation process with conventional water and wastewater treatment technologies
would provide a new system for decontamination of water polluted by the presence
of organic substances.
