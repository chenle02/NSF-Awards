This proposal deals with a new processing technique for forming flexible A-15
superconducting tapes with extremely high critical current densities and
magnetic fields. The processing technique involves melt- spinning of
superconducting alloys to form amorphous ribbons followed by annealing into the
A-15 crystal structure with very fine uniform grains. While such high critical
values, if achievable, are exciting, this has to be established, unequivocally,
using accurate measurements. The PI is, therefore, encouraged to work with an
industry or a national laboratory, where such facilities and expertise are
available, to establish this fact in the first year.
