This proposal seeks to explore the feasibility of developing a sensitive
miniature differential thermometric biosensor device using thin polymer films
(polyvinylidene fluoride or PVDF) displaying a pyroelectric response. By
utilizing such techniques as photolithographic etching, electrochemical
polymerization and microprocessor based data acquisition and analysis, the
principal investigator anticipates constructing and evaluating a simple enzyme
and immunochemical based biosensor device which is sensitive, quantitative and
incorporating low cost fabrication techniques. A distinct advantage of a
thermometric biosensor device is that a wide variety of analyses can be
performed and the specificity determined by the choice of biological processes
without the potential of interferences encountered by methods such as
spectrophotometry or fluorometry. Further, unlike calorimetric techniques using
thermistors or thermopiles, pyroelectric films can be fabricated to extremely
close physical tolerances by simple means and operated in a differential mode,
irrespective of the absolute temperature. In effect, it is proposed to evaluate
techniques that can significantly improve upon and simplify the classical
methods of thermometry and microcalorimetry.
