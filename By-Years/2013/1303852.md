Through this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program is funding Professor
James Larrabee at Middlebury College to carry out studies of metallohydrolases
using magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy. The five metallohydrolases
that will be studied are related to health and medical problems of current
importance for the society. The active sites of these enzymes are chemically
similar; specifically they include two metal ions bridged by carboxylate and
water (or hydroxide) ligands. The enzymes are studied by the research group of
Professor Larrabee in the Co(II) form, which provides an especially strong MCD
signal. One aim of the research is to improve our understanding of how
substrates interact with the metal ions in the active sites. Changes in the
metal environment caused by the binding of substrate analogues that function as
inhibitors to the enzymes are monitored by MCD spectroscopy and provide insight
into the mechanism of the enzyme. A second aim is to discover which amino acid
residues in the active site are important for the function of these enzymes.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding how enzymes function is of scientific
interest and, in the case of enzymes implicated in disease-related biological
processes, it may help with the diagnosis and treatment of the diseases. The
enzymes studied by Professor Larrabee pertain to the latter category and the
proposed studies are designed to advance the understanding of their mechanism.
The spectroscopic and calorimetric studies described in the proposal will
examine the metal binding and the electronic structure of the active sites of
the enzymes. Changes in the active sites induced by interaction with substrate
or substrate analogs that function as inhibitors will also be studied. The
proposed research is conducted at Middlebury College by undergraduate students.
Research experiences such as those undertaken by the Middlebury undergraduates
are known to encourage the students to further their science education and to
pursue careers in science.
