In this CAREER project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and
Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Alexander Star of the
University of Pittsburgh will study how to synthesize graphitic nanocups and
assemble them into nanocapsules that can capture and release chemicals and
materials. Graphitic nanocups doped with nitrogen atoms will be synthesized, and
the chemical derivatization of the nitrogen sites will be explored. Via linker
molecules with dual functionality, two cups will be assembled into a closed
nanocapsule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will enhance our fundamental
understanding about how to generate nanoscale structures and manipulate them to
do useful mechanical functions. The results of these studies could have many
important long term applications in which the capture and release of molecules
are important, including drug delivery, sensing, and contaminant sequestration.
The educational plan focuses on integrating experimental nanoscience into the
four year curriculum of the chemistry major and then developing a capstone
nanoscience course that students would take in their final year.
