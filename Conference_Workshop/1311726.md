Abstract. A conference on PDEs and Dynamical systems in biology will take place
on September 30 - October 4, 2013 at Department of Mathematics, Bar Ilan
University, Israel. The main purpose of the conference is to attract researchers
working on PDEs and Dynamical Systems to problems in biology. Modeling and
mathematical analysis in the areas of Cell Biology, Collective Motion,
Biomedical problems and Population Biology will be emphasized in the talks at
this conference. The talks will also identify biological problems where PDEs and
Dynamical systems could provide a novel insight.

A significant presence of young scientists is planned. The primary focus will be
the facilitation of interactions between young and senior researchers working in
the exciting and rapidly developing field of mathematical biology. The
conference organizers plan to invite about 25 participants: 10-12 plenary
speakers and 13-15 young researchers (graduate students, postdocs and junior
faculty). In addition, several minisymposia will be organized.
