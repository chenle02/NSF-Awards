9704835 Gong This project aims to understand structures and invariants of real
submanifolds in complex spaces. The investigator is to study a class of totally
real embeddings of real manifolds in the complex Euclidean space which satisfy a
certain second order differential relation. He is to investigate the global
topological property of such embeddings and the relationship between the complex
tangency of real submanifolds and the singularity arising from the structure of
real submanifolds with respect to the holomorphic volume form on the complex
Euclidean space. Submanifolds are higher dimensional analogs of surfaces in
space; complex spaces are generalizations of real spaces based on complex
numbers. Real submanifolds in complex spaces are interesting in that they
exhibit both real and complex number based characteristics. They also arise as
the boundaries of domains of holomorphy, meaning that they bound regions on
which a rather special class of complex-valued functions can be defined.
