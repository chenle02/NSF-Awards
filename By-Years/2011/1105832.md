Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS 1105832, Principal Investigator: Dmitry
Tamarkin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These research projects concentrate on issues
related to the microlocal approach to categories associated with symplectic
manifolds, such as the Fukaya category. It is anticipated that by applying
algebraic tools such as differential graded categories and higher categories,
will yield geometric simplifications by avoiding transversality and other
geometric conditions that can be hard to
provide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symplectic geometry is the study of the background
structure for the Hamiltonian version of classical mechanics. The study of this
kind of geometry was revolutionized in the 1980s by the use of analytic
techniques involving maps of surfaces into symplectic manifolds, a point of view
that led more recently to the Fukaya categories invoked below. These Fukaya
categories carry a lot of significant information about the underlying
symplectic manifold, and it would be useful to have a less subtle description of
them than the original definition.
