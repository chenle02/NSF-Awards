This project investigates network optimization problems from operation research.
A major goal of the design of efficient sequential and parallel algorithms for
problems such as the assignment problem. In addition, problems in the theory of
structural rigidity will be investigated. Here, the emphasis will be on the
development of efficient matroid algorithms for determining rigidity properties
of bar-and-joint frameworks and similar structures. Also studied will be
polymatroid extensions of the matroid algorithms that have applications to scene
analysis and computer vision.
