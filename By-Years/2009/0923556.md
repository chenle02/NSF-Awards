This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award funds the acquisition of a Roche
Genome Sequencer FLX Titanium System that allows massively high throughput "Next
Generation" DNA sequencing at the University of California (UC) Davis. This
system will form the core of a Microbial Diversity Sequencing Facility that will
serve as an active center for both research and education in microbial diversity
across the UC Davis Campus and with outside collaborators. Microbial diversity
is fundamental to many key fields of research at UC Davis including agriculture,
viticulture, microbiology, evolution, ecology, bioenergy, bioremediation,
nutrition, and pathogenesis in plants, animals, and humans. The Roche Genome
Sequencer FLX Titanium System will build on these strengths by revolutionizing
the research in dozens of labs across campus, facilitating productive
interaction between researchers investigating different aspects of microbial
communities, and recruiting new researchers to this field. In addition, the
system will be made available to others on campus and in the area through a core
facility in the UC Davis Genome Center.

The system will invigorate and shape diverse educational, training, and outreach
activities. Furthermore, the Microbial Diversity Sequencing Facility will
function in training undergraduates, graduate students, and post-docs in the
gathering and meaningful use of massive amounts of DNA sequence data. Finally,
the instrumentation will be used in partnerships with outside undergraduate
educational institutions to provide them with access both to the equipment and
to data that can be used as part of courses and research activities.

Research, educational and outreach activities produced through the use of this
equipment will be summarized on a project web site at
