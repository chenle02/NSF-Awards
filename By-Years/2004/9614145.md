This wide ranging research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface
Chemistry Program, addresses the fundamentals of ion/surface interactions, with
the goal of developing and implementing surface analytical techniques. During
the tenure of this three-year standard grant, Professor Winograd and his
students at the Pennsylvania State University will carry out measurements of
energy and angle resolved distributions of atoms and molecules desorbed from ion
bombarded surfaces. Postionization of the desorbed neutral species will be used
to develop molecular surface imaging techniques. Theoretical modelling of these
processes will be closely coupled with the detailed experimental information
obtained in these investigations. Applications of these methods to surface
structural analysis, compositional imaging of surfaces, and characterization of
electronic materials will be stressed. The use of ion beam methods to analyze
surface structure and composition is the focus of this research project.
Detailed measurements of the energy and angular distribution of sputtered ions
and neutrals will be coupled with theoretical modelling of these processes in
order to develop the understanding necessary to implement these methods as
molecularly sensitive surface imaging tools. Applications to a wide range of
problems in the areas of electronic device manufacture, pharmaceutical
discovery, and structural biochemistry are expected as a result of this work.
