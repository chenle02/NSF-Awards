The objective of the investigation is to systematically study the structure of
surfaces of semiconductor materials. The program will emphasize impact collision
ion scattering spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, and first principles
pseudopotential total energy theoretical calculations. Impact collision ion
scattering spectroscopy identifies the atomic species on the surface and
provides structural information on the crystallographic unit cell of the surface
atoms. The scanning tunneling microscopy provides an image of the surface on a
localized atomic scale in three-dimensional scale. Total energy calculations
give detailed information pertaining to the equilibrium atomic and electronic
structures. The research is relevant to the surface of semiconducting materials
used in integrated electronics, especially to the important topic of
metallization.
