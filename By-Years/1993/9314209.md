9314209 Kenney This award provides support for a mathematics conference designed
primarily for undergraduates. The goal is to introduce students to the community
of mathematical scholars through a series of student and faculty lectures
accessible to audiences with a broad range of experience and expertise. Special
efforts will be made to ensure an agenda which includes activities focusing on
first and second year students who may not have had exposure to higher level
mathematical concepts. The principal speaker, Professor John Conway of Princeton
University, while renown for his mathematical erudition, also has an
international reputation as a speaker and advocate of mathematics to the general
public. Additional speakers, faculty and students from the host institution and
nearby colleges, will also address the conference. It is expected that this
activity, perhaps the first of its kind, will be repeated on a continuing basis.
