ABSTRACT

Support is requested to allow young graduate students and post doctoral fellows
to attend an international conference on plant growth and development to be held
in Canberra, Australia from September 19-24, 2004. This conference is the 18th
in a series of conferences sponsored by the International Plant Growth Substance
Association (IPGSA). These meetings are held every three years and the last two
were convened in Makuhari Messe, Tokyo (1998) and Brno, Czech Republic (2001).
Plant hormones regulate almost all aspects of growth and development, beginning
with seed germination through the growth of parent plant to the development of
the flower and the formation of seeds that perpetuate the plant's life cycle.
This important international meeting will introduce younger US investigators to
this exciting area of research. The conference includes plenary sessions and
symposia as well as poster sessions where investigators display their most
recent work. The program promises to be exciting and will stimulate research on
plant growth regulators in the USA. These molecules have long been established
as important for U.S. agriculture, and our understanding of the cellular and
molecular basis of their action is essential for the long-term sustainability of
agriculture.
