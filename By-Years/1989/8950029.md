A one and one-half day workshop provides knowledge and practical experience in
using advanced methods of teaching design for engineering faculty who are
experienced teachers. The workshop demonstrates teaching the structured design
process developed in West Germany, integrated with stimulation of creativity as
taught at Cambridge University in England. Both the teacher/participants and
their students benefit by realizing that teaching and learning creative design
can be fun. Part of the workshop involves the evaluation of how these methods
may be applied by the participants in their own institutions.
