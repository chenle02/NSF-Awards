9625386 Moazzami In most building codes, there are very limited guidelines
regarding the proportioning of the shear walls and coupling beams. Consequently,
the response of the coupled wall assemblies to dynamic loads has been noted to
fall short of acceptable ductile behavior. This project discusses some of the
current practices in proportioning and design of coupled wall assemblies,
highlights some of the shortcomings of these methods, and proposes a new
approach that aims at a more comprehensive design of coupled wall assemblies. In
particular the hysteretic response of the coupled wall assemblies will be
studied based on a proposed mathematical model. The primary concern of this
study is to assess the magnitude of cyclic energy dissipation, and determine the
balance that must be achieved between strength, stiffness, and ductility
capacity of structural members in order to optimize energy dissipation in the
system. The outcome of this investigation is a set of design guidelines for
proportioning structural members for optimum energy dissipation and stable
hysteretic response.***
