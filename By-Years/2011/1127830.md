The University of Florida (UF) has developed the intellectual property for a
novel visible light activated transparent antimicrobial coating. NanoHygienix
LLC, a UF spin-off company headed by a UF business school graduate, is
interested in commercializing this technology for preventing surface-mediated
infections in hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, etc. The proposed research
program will leverage the expertise in materials science, environmental
engineering, chemistry, entrepreneurship, finance, marketing and business
management. The PI has expertise in engineering and scale-up of particulate
systems and their translation to various industry sectors including chemical,
mineral, microelectronics, nano and biotechnology.

The proposed technology has the potential to significantly reduce the incidence
of infections in hospitals and other healthcare settings. The PI is committed to
recruit students from underrepresented groups through well established college
and university programs such as SEAGEP and LSAMP. This project will promote
innovation ecosystem infrastructure development across campus by bringing
together engineering and business students and faculty. Project outcomes will
include invention disclosures/patents, peer reviewed journal publications,
dissertations, and presentations at professional society meetings. Ultimate
benefits of the proposed activity will be best practices for commercializing the
university innovations resulting in spin-of companies that will provide jobs and
contribute to the economic well-being of the nation.
