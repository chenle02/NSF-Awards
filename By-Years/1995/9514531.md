9514531 Chiba Finding the molecules that mediate cell-to-cell recognition among
the brain cells (neurons) is a major challenge in developmental neurobiology.
Direct experimentation on these important molecules is possible in a powerful
model animal, Drosophila (fruit fly). This research will take a full advantage
of the relative simplicity of the Drosophila brain, as well as the latest
genetic and cell biological manipulation technologies available in the system.
The goal of the research is to examine the basic molecular mechanisms of
specific cell-to-cell recognition events that precedes formation of a synapse, a
neuronal connection site. One model "synaptic recognition molecule", Toll, will
be used to assess how this and other similar molecules may regulate synapse
formation and its specificity. The results are hoped to provide insights to how
relatively simple molecular mechanisms may underscore construction of complex
neuronal networks in the brain.
