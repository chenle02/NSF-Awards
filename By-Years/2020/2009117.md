The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) will host a series of three
online workshops and one in person workshop to identify key science priorities
at abyssal depths and verification needs when Alvin comes out of overhaul. The
online meetings will be preceded by a widely distributed survey to determine the
research community's opinions on the key areas that remain under investigated in
the abyss and on what new and current instrumentation is needed to investigate
the deep ocean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The online meetings will be tentatively
organized around three themes: abyssal operations, trenches and transform
faults, and abyssal plains and seamounts. An in-person meeting will bring
together deep-sea researchers from all major disciplines and at different career
stages to synthesize the online meetings into two manuscripts, one that reviews
state of research in the abyss and defines the community consensus on research
priorities and a second that provides guidance to DeSSC, NSF, and NDSF in
planning a science verification expedition when the 6500mrated HOV Alvin comes
out of overhaul in 2021.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
