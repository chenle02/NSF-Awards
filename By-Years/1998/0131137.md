With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Oregon in Eugene will
acquire an X-ray diffractometer. This equipment will enhance research in a
number of areas including the following: a) development of novel multilayer
synthesis of metastable solids; b) characterization of metal-organic multilayers
with nonlinear optical properties; c) determination of the structure and size
distribution of gold nanoparticles; d) preparation and characterization of
inorganic semiconductor | conjugated polymer interfaces; e) low temperature
synthesis of new oxide materials using salt metathesis reactions from non-
aqueous solvents; and f) synthesis and characterization of novel metal
dichalcogenide superlattices.

The X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full
three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles,
and it provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of the
molecule relative to the neighboring molecules. These studies will lead to the
development of novel materials important to the electronics and optics
industries.
