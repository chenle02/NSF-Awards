The Computing Research Association?s Committee on the Status of Women in
Computing Research (CRA-W) and the Coalition to Diversify Computing (CDC)
Broadening Participation in Computing (BPC) Alliance will (1) partially support
under-represented minorities and women (URM+W) participants in established and
enhanced Alliance programs and (2) establish the CRA Center for Evaluating the
Research Pipeline (CERP). CRA-W/CDC Alliance programs broaden participation in
computing as they aim to make participants aware of the rewards of a research
career and the value of a PhD; to help participants develop self-efficacy
through increased knowledge, skills, and confidence; and to connect participants
to the research community and to each other to further their success. CERP will
conduct the first ever, longitudinal and national study of the factors that lead
to research careers for all undergraduate and graduate students in computing; in
particular, CERP will evaluate whether the Alliance intervention programs are
effective at increasing participation of URM+W in
computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The alliance's goal is to grow the URM+W
research community and positively impacting the career development of individual
URM+W researchers. These impacts include institutional change in response to the
Alliance's sustainability efforts and resources for the national BPC community
and for the nation in general for similar programs to encourage computing
research among the population in general. The project's evaluation efforts
through CERP will yield a national comparison database that will become a
powerful national resource for the CISE community and may also inform the wider
research community.
