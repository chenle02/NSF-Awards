This project is awarding scholarships to academically talented and financially
needy engineering students and is supporting the scholars through a variety of
structures and programs. Students from underrepresented groups are being
especially targeted for support. Scholarships are being awarded to a single
cohort of students who will be supported for a full four years. The project is
implementing a recruitment-through-graduation strategy by removing traditional
barriers to success for engineering students from underrepresented groups. There
are six primary strategies being implemented through this project: an in-
residence summer bridge program, renewable scholarships, opportunities for co-op
or internship experiences, peer mentoring, a freshman engineering program, and a
living-learning community.
