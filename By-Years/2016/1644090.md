The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to expore the
commercializtion potential of NSF funded research on nanocomposites based on
butyl rubber. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nano-composites have potential for numerous
versatile applications including coatings, adhesives, pharmaceutical stoppers
and medical devices. The rubber nanocomposites are recyclable, eliminating waste
during device manufacturing and after use. A similar rubber nanocomposite is
used as a coating on drug eluting stents, generating billions of dollars in
revenue which further highlights the commercial potential.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Butyl elastomer, a copolymer of isobutylene with a small
amount of isoprene, has outstanding low temperature properties and very high
damping, but has very high creep without crosslinking. It is likely that a blend
of poly(styrene-isobutylene-styrene) thermoplastic rubber and butyl elastomer,
reinforced with nanofillers such as carbon, silica or iron oxide, would be
promising nanocomposites for a broad range of applications. Future potential
improvements include replacing the polymer mix with a single poly(alloocimene-
isobutylene-alloocimene) thermoplastic rubber. This project will explore market
development and commercialization for various potential blends and applications.
