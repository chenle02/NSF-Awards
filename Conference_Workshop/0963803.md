An algebraic workshop will be held at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and
Technology (KAIST) on December 14-15, 2009. This workshop will be immediately
followed by the first American Mathematical Society and Korean Mathematical
Society joint meeting, which will be held in Seoul, Korea on December 16-20,
2009.

Interest in combinatorics has increased enormously because of its connections to
various fields such as algebra, geometry, number theory, physics, and
statistics. The workshop along with the joint meeting will provide a means for
research mathematicians, graduate students, and others interested in
combinatorics to explore new achievements, research trends, and problems in this
area.

The invited speakers are Federico Ardila, Ira Gessel, James Haglund, Sangwook
Kim, Bruce Sagan, Michelle Wachs, Ae Ja Yee, Alex Young (USA), Jae-Hoon Kwon,
Seunghyun Seo (Korea), Soichi Okada, Itaru Terada (Japan).

Most of our overall budget is intended to support graduate students and junior
faculty from the United States, including women and under-represented
minorities.
