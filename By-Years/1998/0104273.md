With this award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the
work of Dr. John D. Roberts at the California Institute of Technology in
Pasadena, California. The work will build on earlier work of the PI on
substituent effects on conformational equilibria of 1,2-disubstituted ethanes.
These equilibria will be studied by NMR using proton-proton vicinal coupling
constants, which depend on the average dihedral angle between the planes defined
by the C-C bond and the bonds from these central carbon atoms to their
substituents. The initial emphasis will be on repeating and reinterpreting
measurements on succinic acid (HOCOCH2CH2CO2H) and its salts reported by Prof.
Chidichimo at the University of Calabria. Extensions will include other solvent
systems, including lyotropic media, and other molecules, such as
aminoacids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research involves a fundamental
question in organic chemistry: What determines the angle of rotation about
carbon-carbon single bonds in organic molecules, many of which contain C-C bonds
that can be regarded as 1,2-disubstituted ethanes. These angles determine the 3D
structures, and many of the properties, of many organic molecules, including
those involved in biological systems. In addition to shedding light on an
important subject, the work is expected to provide excellent training for the
postdoctoral and undergraduate students involved.
