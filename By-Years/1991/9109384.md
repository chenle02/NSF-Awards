The human visual system uses a variety of cues to do the common but often not
easy task of identifying groups of visual targets into perceptual categories.
Visual attributes include such features as color, orientation, luminance,
spatial frequency, and so on. Two widely studied properties of visual targets
are texture and motion. This project will investigate some of the interactions
between features of texture and motion perception, how those interactions may be
important for perceptual grouping, and how the resulting data may improve
existing neurophysiologically plausible computational models for texture
segregation. A novel class of stimuli with multiple attributes has been
developed for these tests. Data from the proposed experiments are likely to have
an impact not only on visual neuroscience, but on image processing, machine
vision and pattern recognition, and scientific visualization.
