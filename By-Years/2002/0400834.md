This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial biology for
FY2004. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden their scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Geography and genetics of an RNA
bacteriophage." This project investigates the genetic structure of natural
populations of the bacteriophage phi6 (host: Pseudomonas syringae pv.
phaseolicola), a double-stranded RNA phage in the family Cystoviridae.
Cystoviruses that infect P. phaseolicola will be isolated from clover plants at
a range of geographic scales within New England. Nucleotide sequences of these
phages are being used to examine geographic structure, patterns of host
association, effective population size, dispersal patterns, and the importance
of genetic exchange in these natural phage populations.
