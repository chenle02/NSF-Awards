This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
produce low-cost gas diffusion electrodes with integrated flow fields for PEM
fuel cells used to power next-generation vehicles. The proposed gas diffusion
electrodes will increase both the power per unit mass and volume, and reduce the
overall cost of PEM fuel cells. The proposed research would eliminate the need
for intricate bipolar plates, reducing the weight, complexity and overall cost
of the PEM fuel cell whilst still maintaining the performance. Our proposed,
low-cost, gas diffusion electrodes with integrated flow fields for PEM fuel
cells will increase both the power per unit mass and volume, and reduce the
overall cost of the fuel cell. Success of this project will accelerate
commercialization of fuel cell technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well over $1
billion has been spent on the development of fuel cell technology for next
generation vehicles (NGVs) alone. The stakes are high and the potential market
for viable, cost effective fuel cells is immense. Initial applications include
micropower generators and alternative power systems for NGVs and portable
electronic equipment.&lt;br/&gt;
