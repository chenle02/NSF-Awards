Our continuing studies of the bacteriophage f1 will be concentrated on two areas
of phage biology , its DNA synthesis and its assembly. Both of these areas bring
to the fore the two fundamental biological problems for which the study of
viruses can be especially useful. These involve questions about the assembly and
interaction of multi-protein and nucleic acid structures and inquires into the
basic aspects of the higher order elements of cell metabolism. We have found
that the E. coli integration host factor (IHF) plays an important role in the
synthesis of the phage plus (viral) strand. It appears to act just after the
start of DNA synthesis, perhaps altering the structure of the DNA so that
synthesis can proceed. Available are appropriate mutant DNA's, purified IHF and
the usual components of DNA synthesis to dissect this reaction in detail. Phage
assembly depends on the presence and interaction of a cis-acting, phage DNA
signal and some phage and some host proteins. These are all hand and their
interrelationships under study. Currently, we are intrigued by a protein induced
in the host by one of the phage's morphogenetic proteins, pIV. This phage shock
protein is being cloned, sequenced and its role in phage and host metabolism
being ascertained by careful manipulations of this E. coli gene. This protein
falls into the class of host stress-induced proteins. Although still obscure,
this protein may provide the most valuable clue we have to date on the role of
the phage's gene IV.
