Continuing investigation of the thermodynamics of polymer blends will be based
on inverse gas chromatography (IGC). The technique of IGC was perfected and
brought to an acceptable level of accuracy in research under NSF grant
DMR-8414575. Polymer-polymer interaction coefficients, very difficult to obtain
by other methods, will be measured for several compatible blends. Interaction
coefficients of incompatible polymers will be studied using random copolymers
composed of the same monomeric units as those in the incompatible polymers.
Interactions between polymer segments are determined by the same factors that
determine polymer-solvent interactions. The latter interactions are
convieniently obtained by IGC on homopolymers. A large number of interaction
coefficients will be measured on blends, copolymers, and homopolymers and the
data analyzed to yield the individual effects important to mixing: contact
interactions, specific interactions, equation of state effects, and molecular
packing. The experimental base will be expanded by measuring relevant data on
low-molecular-weight mixtures; calorimetry, light scattering, and densitometry
will be used. The ultimate goal is to develop a comprehensive theory of mixing
of polymeric systems which is capable of predicting polymer solubility and
compatibility in blends.
