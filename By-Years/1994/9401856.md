9401856 Du Silicon oxynitride is an important structural ceramics. The Principal
Investigator wants to study the mechanism that controls the oxidation behavior
of silicon oxynitride. Comprehensive studies of oxidation on pure and dense
silicon oxynitride will be carried out. To achieve the project objectives a time
resolved laser reflectance technique will be used to accurately measure the
growth of the oxide layer during oxidation in broad range. Several other
techniques e.g. x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron energy loss
spectroscopy TEM will be used to perform the chemical and structural
characterization of the oxide-substrate interfaces. %%% Study of the mechanisms
that controls the oxidation behavior of one of the important structural
ceramics, silicon oxynitride, is proposed to be carried out using the time
resolved laser reflectance method and various x-ray and electron microscopic
techniques. ***
