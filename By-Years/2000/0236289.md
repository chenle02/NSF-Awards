The goals of this workshop are: (1) To assess the state-of-the-art and to
address the research needs in the thermal aspects of various material removal
processes, in view of the rapid advancements in new experimental techniques,
numerical methods, and analytical aspects (due to the availability of powerful,
inexpensive personal computers); and (2) To provide the thermal basis for
addressing "green manufacturing" which is so critical for the protection of the
health and safety of the environment and associated personnel of the shop
floor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the workshop will be thermal aspects of
various material removal processes, such as metal cutting, grinding, and
polishing. Various experimental, analytical, and numerical techniques will be
critically reviewed and research needs and opportunities will be
identified.&lt;br/&gt;
