The research in this 5-yr project will extend the longest-running study of how
tropical-forest productivity is controlled by climatic variation. In a network
of 18 0.5-ha plots across a Costa Rican rain forest, each year's forest
productivity (new wood, leaves, fruits and flowers) will be measured, as well as
yearly changes in forest structure caused by tree death and in-growth. The
measurements from the first 11 years showed that forest growth decreased
dramatically in hotter and drier years. Extending the record a further 5 years
will provide a globally-unique measurement series for assessing how a tropical
rain forest is responding to on-going climatic and atmospheric
changes.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Tropical rain forest plants continuously absorb
vast amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through the process of
photosynthesis, while at the same time re-emitting large amounts of carbon
dioxide in respiration. A decline in tropical-forest productivity, the balance
between these two processes, would increase the rate of greenhouse-gas
accumulation in the atmosphere, thus speeding global warming. It is therefore
critical to monitor these processes in tropical forests, but the existing data
records are sparse. By extending the long-term measurements in this Costa Rican
rain forest to span 16 years, this study will produce a unique basis for
refining current scientific understanding of how tropical forests are responding
to, and contributing to, global climate change.&lt;br/&gt;
