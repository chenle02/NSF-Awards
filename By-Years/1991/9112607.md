Funds are being sought to to purchase new refregiration equipment for Iowa
Institute of Hydraulic Research (IIHR) which will be dedicated to support
research on mechanical properties of ice, investigation into mechanical behavior
of rubble ice as a function of load, time and temperature, processes involved in
the formation of frazil ice and aufeis, and the mechanical properties of ice-
rich frozen soil.
