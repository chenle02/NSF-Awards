This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project seeks to fabricate a
novel nanotechnology spin-dependent tunneling (SDT) magnetic field sensor device
with increased signal-to-noise performance at low frequencies. The increased
resolution at low frequencies is greatly desired in a large number of
application markets. The proposed device is based on innovative methods of
modulating the permeability of, and/or the flux through, integrated flux
concentrators. These methods of "flux gating" (chopping or sweeping the magnetic
field which is sensed by the SDT transducers) are employed using on-chip,
microfabricated coil structures. The project explores the nature of frequency-
dependent (or 1/f) noise that is intrinsic to SDT devices, and offers an
integrated low-power method of noise reduction. SDT technology is at the leading
edge of magnetoresistive transducer development due, in part, to the fact that
its magnetoresistance can be more than 3 times that of the best giant
magnetoresistive devices, and more than 15 times that of the anisotropic
magnetoresistive sensors on the market today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The devices
for this Phase II is based on novel and proprietary concepts for the advancement
of small, solid-state, low-cost, low-power magnetic field sensors. The primary
need is for high-resolution magnetic field sensors that are more fieldable and
cost effective. SDT technology offers this high-resolution potential as well as
the low-cost advantages of silicon fabrication methods used for SDT micro-
sensors. Applications for these sensors include non-destructive testing,
security and surveillance, and magnetic media validation. Each of these very
diverse applications share a common need for the small, highly sensitive, low
power magnetic field sensing devices being proposed. The new devices will enable
each of these areas to expand into small portable applications and into areas
where cost effective low-field sensing has not been possible.&lt;br/&gt;
