limitations and possibilities of scientific achievement; the requirements of
sustainability (surviving); and the explanation science offers for human
behavior. An additional 21 programs will be repackaged as special broadcasts to
be distributed to over 200 public radio stations. Target audiences include
middle school and secondary school students, and adults.
