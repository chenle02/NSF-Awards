9520302 Pratt A numerical and analytical study will be undertaken of wind-driven
circulation around islands, including evaluation of the validity of the 'Island
Rule'. Classical ocean circulation theory based on homogeneous models has
provided insight into certain striking features of wind-driven currents such as
westward intensification. When the calculations are done in a domain closed to
the north, such as in models of the North Atlantic or North Pacific, the
interior circulation is joined to a western boundary layer whose transport is
determined by the condition of zero net meridional transport across the entire
basin. When a large island is present, it may also create a western boundary
layer (along its eastern coastline). The main goals of the this research is to
systematically determine the qualitative, wind-driven circulation schemes near
islands, to diagnose the associated dynamics, to assess the general
applicability of the Island Rule, and to perform a limited number of qualitative
case studies. It is anticipated that the Island Rule will provide a good
approximation to the true transport under a wide variety of conditions.
