PI: Miller&lt;br/&gt;IOB-0444896&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of
the most remarkable feats to be accomplished during the transformation of a
fertilized egg into a complex organism is the production of many different
specialized cell types, but precisely how this task is achieved is not well
understood. The multicellular green alga Volvox carteri is an excellent organism
in which to investigate this issue because Volvox is developmentally very
simple, possessing just two different cell types: large reproductive cells
called gonidia, and small motile cells called somatic cells. The glsA (for
gonidialess) gene is essential for the production of the large cells that become
gonidia, and encodes a protein (GlsA) that is closely related to human, rat, and
mouse proteins whose accumulation are positively correlated with cell
division/proliferation and cancer. Recently work from this lab showed that GlsA
associates with at least two other proteins (DP and Hsp70A), one of which (DP)
is related to a known regulator of cell division in both higher plants and
animals. The goals of the current project are to determine whether these
proteins, like GlsA, are also required to produce cells of two different sizes
and functions, and to determine how they do so. To accomplish these aims,
established molecular procedures will be used to 1) generate Volvox variants
that express reduced amounts of DP and Hsp70A and 2) to clone additional genes
that encode factors required to produce cells of different sizes and fates. It
is anticipated that these studies will provide insights into the manner in which
cell division and cell differentiation are coupled in Volvox, and perhaps also
in crop plants and humans as well. Furthermore, the students who complete these
studies will receive valuable training toward careers as independent
researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
