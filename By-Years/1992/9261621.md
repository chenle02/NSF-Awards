Efficient acquisition of 3-D surface coordinates would have obvious utility in
machine vision applications such as metrology for quality control, obstacle
detection for motion control, and target location for docking. Yet there is no
ubiquitous method for 3-D digitizing. Extant technologies suffer from a variety
of short-coming including near-field blindness, cumbersome calibration schemes,
limited resolution and data rates, weight and scale penalties, and high cost.
This research explores use of a new method for range finding based on
diffraction to develop a new class of 3-D image acquisition devices. These would
be effective alternatives to available technologies in ranges from tens of
microns to meters. Potential applications cover microscopy, endoscopy, eye-in-
hand cameras for end effectors, work area surveillance cameras, and production
line measurement cameras.
