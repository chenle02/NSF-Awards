Strommen Idaho State University plans to construct a new building for its
Chemistry Department, which has occupied space in a converted 1939 dormitory
since the previous chemistry building was demolished in 1992 due to structural
deficiencies. The new chemistry building will include 16,000 square feet of
research laboratory space for faculty research projects, for training students
in research methods, and for student research projects. The department has a
tradition of integrating students into faculty research, and numerous students
have co-authored publications with faculty mentors and have given presentations
at meetings of professional chemists. The new chemistry building will enable a
higher level of faculty research activity in chemistry at Idaho State
University, and will support exemplary research training for undergraduate
students. The new building will provide a safe and healthy environment for
research and training, and will provide appropriate conditions for state-of-the-
art instrumentation. The Idaho legislature is providing more than 90% of the
cost of this building, and this investment will benefit generations of
scientists and students. ***
