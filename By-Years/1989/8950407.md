The student laboratory for a three-semester, calculus-based, General Physics
course will be improved with twelve computer-equipped laboratory work stations.
Each work station will have a computer with a data acquisition interface card.
Students will use the computers to acquire and analyze data not otherwise
readily available to them. The University will match the award with an equal
amount of funds.
