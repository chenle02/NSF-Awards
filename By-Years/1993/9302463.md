In phase II, the fundamental microstructure/processing/property relationships
for ODS magnesium alloys will be investigated. Larger samples will be produced
while key process parameters are systematically varied. These samples will be
investigated microstructurally by optical and SEM techniques. Standard elevated
temperature tensile and creep testing will be performed in condition, the most
promising samples will be further processed by hot working techniques and the
same type of microstructural, mechanical, and physical property evaluations.
Successful completion of the Phase II research will provide the foundation for
future commercialization of ODS magnesium with elevated temperature capability
and improved modules produced by pressure infiltration. Pressure infiltration is
a low cost process and is expected to produce cost-effective ODS magnesium
alloys. Such alloys could lead to the development of more fuel efficient and
environmentally cleaner automobiles.
