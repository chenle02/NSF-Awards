As we approach 100nm technology, the impact of interconnect on signal integrity
is becoming one of the main concerns in testing gigahertz system-on-chips
(SoCs). Voltage distortion (noise) and delay violations (skew) contribute to
signal integrity loss and ultimately functional error, performance degradation,
shorter life and reliability problems. This research investigates a methodology
to model and test signal integrity in deep-submicron high-speed interconnects
that bind the internal cores in a SoC. The following issues are being explored:
a) the development of a unified integrity fault model, independent of
technology, that includes various problems occurring on the SoC's high-speed
interconnects such as crosstalk, overshoot, skew, etc.; b) the establishment of
a test generation technique that finds test patterns to stimulate maximal (worst
case) integrity loss on the interconnect network; c) the implementation of noise
detector (ND) and skew detector (SD) cells, to detect noise and skew violations
(integrity loss) over a period of operation; and d) the design of a cost- and
time-efficient readout architecture to transfer the integrity information that
ND and SD cells accumulate. As part of educational plan, we are: 1) developing a
two course sequence on ASIC/SoC design and test with emphasis on high-frequency
issues; 2) involving undergraduate students in general, and minorities in
particular, in VLSI/ASIC/SOC test research. 3) advocating for greater CAD tool
use in early stage of CE/EE curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;
