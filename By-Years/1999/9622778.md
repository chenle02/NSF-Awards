This starter grant award to the Virginia Polytechnic Institute will support the
research of Professor Paul A. Deck. The research focusses on the synthesis and
characterization of linear, homochiral organometallic coordination polymers. The
synthesis of a variety of such polymeric materials proceeds by synthesis of the
required monomeric and chain-end-capping complexes, followed by development of
conditions for carrying out the coordination polymerization reactions with
control of the degree of polymerization. The resulting coordination polymers are
then used as chiral Lewis-acidic catalysts for organic transformations, such as
enantioselective allylation and aldolization of carbonyl compounds, as well as
ring-opening of meso epoxides. The research will advance the fundamental
understanding of the synthesis of stereospecific polymers. Rigid, chiral
metallocene polymers have found widespread application in enantioselective
homogeneous catalysis
