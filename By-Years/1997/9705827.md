Forstneric will work on (a) the holomorphic automorphism groups of certain
complex manifolds, with the emphasis on Stein manifolds with infinite
dimensional automorphism groups (such as the complex Euclidean spaces); (b)
applications of the above to the construction of proper holomorphic embeddings
in Euclidean spaces with low codimension (such as the embedding of open Riemann
surfaces in the complex two-dimensional plane); (c) topics in polynomial and
rational convexity; (d) topological properties of pseudoconvex domains. The
research topics in (a) include the approximation and interpolation of
holomorphic mappings (or smooth mappings from real submanifolds) by holomorphic
automorphisms, the classification problems for finite holomorphic transformation
groups on low dimensional complex Euclidean spaces, existence and classification
of (complete) holomorphic flows on low dimensional Euclidean spaces and other
related manifolds, dynamical properties of automorphisms, etc. In many natural
and social sciences one tries to explain phenomena by choosing a suitable model
space (usually such a space is a manifold in mathematical language) such that
each point of the space represents certain state of the observed system, and the
laws governing the system can be expressed as algebraic or differential
conditions (equations or inequalities) on the given space. Global symmetries of
these model spaces (automorphisms in our language) often play a very important
role in understanding the structure and properties of solutions of the
considered problem(s), and they often help simplifying the problem by changing
it to certain standard (model) problem for which the solutions are well
understood. Often the natural model spaces are complex manifolds (as opposed to
the real manifolds), the simplest being the complex Euclidean spaces. Their
automorphisms have much more rigidity and are much less understood than their
real counterparts. This is our main motivation for studying g lobal
automorphisms of model complex manifolds and their applications.
