9357518 Reich This is an NSF Young Investigator Award. The research will
investigate the fundamental physics of materials at low temperatures. Focus will
be on low-dimensional and other systems dominated by geometrical constraints.
These include low- dimensional quantum antiferromegnets, arrays of
superconducting rings, and superconducting granular composites. %%% This is an
