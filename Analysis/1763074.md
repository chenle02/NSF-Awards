One of the models the PI is proposing to investigate is the Korteweg-de Vries
(KdV) equation. This equation was derived more that a hundred years ago to
explain the behavior of long waves in channels of shallow water. In the 1960s,
researchers at Princeton's Plasma Physics Laboratory demonstrated that this
equation exhibits a wealth of novel features, which have sparked the interest of
mathematicians and physicists alike. However, despite all the attention it has
received over the years, existence of solutions under minimal assumptions has
been proved only recently by the PI and her collaborators. One ingredient in
their work is the recent discovery of new conservation laws. This project
outlines several additional problems that can now be attacked using this
discovery. Another major impetus behind this project is to prove that
complicated transient dynamics resolve into simple dynamics in the distant
future. The physical significance of this phenomenon relies on its stability
under perturbations. While in the past, the PI has investigated deterministic
perturbations to the equations, the current project takes this theme in a new
direction by considering stability in the presence of (random) noise.

The project focuses on several problems that lie at the intersection of
nonlinear dispersive partial differential equations, completely integrable
systems, and stochastic partial differential equations. The PI's discovery of
new microscopic conservation laws for KdV has opened the door to treating three
seemingly unrelated problems of long-standing interest regarding KdV on the
line: optimal regularity well-posedness, symplectic non-squeezing, and
invariance of white noise. In addition, the PI is proposing a coherent plan for
establishing invariance of the Gibbs measure for the Landau-Lifshitz model and
invariance of white noise for the focusing cubic Nonlinear Schr\"odinger
Equation (NLS). This program involves establishing the analogous statements for
the physical atomic models associated with these problems (which the PI has
successfully completed) and then taking the continuum limit for the
corresponding rough data. This should reveal the physical renormalizations for
the Landau-Lifshitz and the cubic NLS models that would ensure well-posedness
for such data. As the Gibbs measure for the Landau-Lifshitz model corresponds to
Brownian motion on the sphere, this problem is also interesting from a purely
probabilistic point of view as yielding a Hamiltonian measure-preserving flow on
such paths.
