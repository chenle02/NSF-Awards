Numerical models of ocean dynamics will be used to address two key aspects of
dense water formation and modification process on the antarctic continental
shelves. They pertain to: 1) the export of dense water from the shelf; and 2)
its descent down the slope. These studies are justified by new hypotheses on
bottom water formation and seek to facilitate the parameterization of such
processes in global climate models. This modeling study is closely related to a
ship-based study that will investigate how the Antarctic Slope Front and
continental slope morphology determine the exchanges of mass, heat, and fresh
water between the shelf and the deep ocean, in particular those leading to
outflows of dense water into intermediate and deep layers of the adjacent basins
and into the world ocean circulation While the importance to the global ocean
circulation and climate of cold water masses originating in the Antarctic is
unquestioned, the processes by which these water masses enter the deep ocean
circulation are not. The primary goal of the experimental work is to identify
the principal physical processes that govern the transfer of shelf-modified
dense water into intermediate and deep layers of the adjacent deep ocean. At the
same time, it seeks to understand the compensatory poleward flow of waters from
the oceanic regime. This work will help to provide the dynamical framework for
the observations and synthesize the observations into a coherent whole.
