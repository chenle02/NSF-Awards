In this project, the PI will carry out measurements and analysis of chemical
tracers, Chlorofluorocarbons, as part of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment
(WOCE) hydrographic line, P-17S, which covers a large area of the southeast
Pacific Ocean. These measurements will be used to study the flow of thermocline
waters in the South Pacific Subtropical Gyre, formation of Subantarctic Mode
Water and Anarctic Intermediate Water, and their spreading properties, as well
as other ocean circulation processes.
