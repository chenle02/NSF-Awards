Advanced Optical Imaging for the Undergraduate In an increasing effort to expand
improvements in undergraduate training, the Department of Biological Science at
Notre Dame is initiating a program to integrate advanced bioimaging into its
core curriculum. This decision is stimulated by a pressing need to incorporate
innovative methods for recording, quantifying, and analyzing biological
processes. In addition, new technological advancements in applied optics,
electronic imaging, and computational-based image processing continue to drive
the frontier of biomolecular imaging into all elements of our lives from medical
diagnostics to science education and research. Clearly, if we plan to stay at
the frontier of this technology, we must provide undergraduates with the
opportunity to experiment, explore, and discover the power of applied optical
imaging. To integrate bioimaging into undergraduate laboratories, we are
carrying out a variety of experiments that combine the use of important new
biosensors and molecular probes with state-of-the-art electronic detectors,
high-powered confocal optics, and sophisticated software programs for the study
of dynamic cell, developmental, and physiological processes. These exercises are
training students in the nuts and bolts of electronic image acquisition,
processing, and analysis, while emphasizing the power of computer-based digital
optical instrumentation and its use as a quantitative tool for biological
investigation.
