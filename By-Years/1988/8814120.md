Effective diffusivities in zeolites show unpredictable variations with partial
pressure and temperature, sometimes exhibiting maxima or minima, as well as
having measured diffusivities which vary over orders of magnitude when the
measurement technique is changed. This project seeks to see if these
discrepancies can be resolved if we treat the sorbate in the zeolite as though
it were distributed between two states, with adsorbed species at one type of
site mobile and species adsorbed at another type of site immobile. It is
proposed that these two types of sorbed molecules, together with unabsorbed
molecules in the pores of the zeolites, make separate contributions to the
observed diffusion coefficient, which, with their different dependencies on
temperature, and the temperature dependence of the distribution of the sorbate
between states, should explain the observed variations in diffusivities.
Zeolites are important to numerous industrial processes in which adsorption or
heterogeneous catalysis occurs. One of the most important aspects of zeolites is
that they are able to add selectivity based upon size and molecular shape to
selectivity based upon differing affinities for the base surface of the zeolite
material. It should be possible to design processes which would take advantage
of the differences in diffusivities within the zeolites to improve conversions
or to increase selectivities; a better understanding of the diffusion process in
zeolites will help development in this area. Experiments at carefully selected
partial pressures and temperatures have been selected for specific sorbate
molecules so that the proposed explanation can be tested experimentally. These
experiments will be interpreted with the help of a mathematical model of the
proposed transport process.
