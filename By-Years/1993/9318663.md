9318663 Nash This project involves an award of funds to the PhD program in
cultural anthropology at UCLA for the purpose of supporting students' fieldwork
before their dissertation research begins. Students will be mentored by faculty
as they do preliminary field research to prepare for their dissertation
research. This project is important because it improves the scientific abilities
of students, and thus the scientific strength of the US, through providing
experience and practice in research situations. ***
