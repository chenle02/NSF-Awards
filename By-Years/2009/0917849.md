San Jose State University proposes to support technical services on R/V Point
Sur, a 135? general purpose UNOLS research vessel operated by the Moss Landing
Marine Laboratories as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory
System research fleet. They request support for basic services and operation of
a towed, undulating vehicle as specialized services. They will provide one
technician on each seagoing research project of R/V Point Sur to support
seagoing research projects and to maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified
users items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation. The budget
in this proposal is for the first year of a 3-year continuing grant.
