The principal investigator will study the relationship between a phase-type
distribution and its representations. A phase-type distribution is the
distribution of a hitting time in a finite state Markov chain. The central
questions are as follows. For a given phase-type distribution, (a) find its
order, and (b) find a minimal representation of it. Related goals are to study
special representations, and to find bounds on order base qualitative
information about a distribution. Techniques to be used in this study are
collectively called the "invariant polytope approach". This research will have
relevance to the study of queueing systems.
