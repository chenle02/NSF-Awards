A sequence of AlxGa1-xAs, GaAs hetrojunctions can be used to generate a series
of potential steps which are just large enough to accelerate conduction band
electrons above the threshold for impact ionization leading to current
multiplication of the form I=Io2n+. The smaller valance band discontinuity and
higher scattering rates can be used to suppress the initiation of impact
ionization by valence band electrons. The resulting structure is predicted to be
a low noise amplifier and to be insensitive to small fluxuations in the power
supply voltage. By picking appropriate layer widths the transit time can be made
to give a negative impedance at the desired frequency which can be used as
either an amplifier or an oscillator. It is proposed that tests be carried out
on the two wafers already fabricated by the National Submicron Laboratory at
Cornell and that additional wafers will be grown with appropriate variations in
parameters to improve the performance and enhance our understanding of the
stepped structure.
