The research team has developed a torrefaction approach for converting any
carbonaceous material into biocoal, which is a material similar in its
characteristics to coal. The torrefaction process comprises of the following
stages: (1) pretreatment of the biomass (shredding and drying), (2) fast
preheating that uses centrifugal forces for fast heat transfer, (3) a
torrefaction reactor that uses exothermic phase transition for self-heating, (4)
a downsizing stage, (5) compaction to produce densified biocoal suitable for
logistic, operational, and safety. Through control of the torrefaction process
(residence time, temperature) researchers can customize a biocoal product to
match a given coal type such as bituminous or sub bituminous coals. Through this
process the research team is also able to offer a synergistic approach between
the production of customized biocoal and an accurate assessment of the biocoal
performance in a specific application.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea behind this
project is to produce a clean sustainable replacement for coal, from biomass -
biocoal - as a drop-in fuel in all coal applications: liquid transportation fuel
from pyrolysis, energy through combustion mostly for power generation, and
chemicals through gasification. The total addressable market is about 1 billion
ton in the US in 10-15 years at a value of $150-300 billion. The technology is
called torrefaction which is a thermal treatment of the biomass at temperatures
of 200-300 degrees Celsius in absence of oxygen. Biocoal is a product that is
driven by environmental regulations and meets Renewable Energy Portfolios. If
successfully implemented, this technology may enable manufactures to customize
biocoal for a customer's specific system, reducing a number of risk factors with
high cost implications.
