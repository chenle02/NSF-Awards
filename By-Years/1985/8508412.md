This research focuses on three aspects of sensing for manufacturing process
automation for arc welding: sensor development and the status of sensors for
arch welding, integration of sensors, and sensor signal processing for process
control. The plan is three phased: (1) to perform a technological assessment of
process sensors for welding automation in the areas of weld tracking, arc
control and weld quality determination and to define limitations of these
sensors; (2) to develop and evaluate sensors which address the identified
limitations. Improved signal processing techniques, enhancement of existing
sensor designs and new sensor concepts including special optical and acoustic
emission techniques will be employed; and (3) to formulate and evaluate
methodology to integrate various sensor signals and process parameter
information for improved weld process control and weld quality assessment.
