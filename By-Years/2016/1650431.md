This award will help Drexel University transition its IUCRC Center for Visual
and Decision Informatics (CVDI) into Phase 2 operation for the next 5 years. At
the start of Phase 2, the CVDI IUCRC is expanding from three sites to 5 sites,
with the addition of two new sites. The Center seeks to continue its record of
sustained accomplishments in terms of strengthening and growing industry
partnerships, delivering innovation through intellectual property and
publications, expanding research competencies through increased faculty
participation, and broadening educational experience of students through
participation in industry funded research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research
program of the Center focuses on developing next-generation visual and decision
support tools and techniques that enable decision makers to fundamentally
improve the way an organization's information is interpreted and exploited.
CVDI's area of research is industry-relevant, attracts membership and has the
potential to improve US competitiveness in this area. The center's activities
will generate societal benefits by addressing areas of national priority such as
health, energy, cyber- and homeland-security. The innovations in big data
research will impact national economy by delivering value to both government and
industry. Through outreach activities such as Drexel Co-op Program, Greater
Philadelphia Louis Stokes for Minority Participation, the investigators will
connect with K-12 students and teachers, with particular emphasis on recruiting
women and underrepresented minorities into the STEM disciplines.
