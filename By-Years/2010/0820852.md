With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation program (MRI), Edward A.
Martinez from New Mexico Highlands University will acquire an FS 3100 Automated
Chemistry Analyzer (FS3100) with accessories, and a field Hydrolab Water Quality
Sonde, (WQS) to conduct water quality research and training activities at New
Mexico Highlands University, Luna Community College and Dine College. The FS
3100 will be used to analyze various nutrients such as ammonia, total nitrogen,
nitrate, nitrite, and phosphorous in surface waters, waste water, plant
extracts, organic matter and soil lechate. The WQS will be used to monitor real
time concentrations of dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity, alkalinity, and
temperature in a field setting. Five faculty members from the Forestry, Geology,
Engineering, and Environmental Science disciplines, from three different
institutions, will utilize the instrumentation in current and future research
projects.

These two instruments allow analysis of water in rivers, streams, lakes, home
and industrial wells as well as in municipal water treatment plants that provide
drinking water. This type of analysis is important for large populations to
maintain good health and for monitoring the environment, and also for teaching
and student training.
