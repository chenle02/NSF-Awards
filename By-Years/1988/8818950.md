This proposal focuses on the molecular biology of protein degradation in phage
T4-infected Escherichia coli bacteria. The specific aims of this proposal
include (a) the identification of T4 genes in addition to pinA that function to
block E. coli proteolytic activities. (b) The characterization of T4 mutants
that fail to block protein degradation. The methodology involves standard
molecular biological and biochemical procedures and, in addition, novel
screening and selection strategies based on the degradation of specific
proteins. This research should lead to a broader knowledge of virus - host cell
interactions, to an increased understanding of the molecular bases by which E.
coli proteases recognize their substrates, and to an ability to reduce
proteolysis in E. coli and, thereby, to stabilize proteins of medical and
scientific importance produced in E. coli bacteria.
