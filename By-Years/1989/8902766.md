Although there is much interest in shared memory multiprocessors, and there are
now successful commercial products for multis, scaling to large numbers of
powerful processors poses difficult problems. Most approaches either introduce
geographical locality to the user or limit the notion of shared memory by
supporting caches that may become inconsistent. Multicube is a recently proposed
architecture that provides hardware-guaranteed cache consistency, introduces no
geographical locality, and may scale to large numbers of processors. The goal of
this research project is to study the Multicube approach to building scalable,
large-scale shared-memory multiprocessors. The multicube architecture is based
on shared buses, multilevel caches, and cache consistency protocols. A novel set
of synchronization primitives has been proposed as an extension to the cache
consistency protocol. The project encompasses the study of memory reference and
synchronization behavior of existing parallel programs, scalability issues, bus
implementation issues, the implications of clustering of processors, I/O,
particularly swapping and virtual memory, and a variety of other architectural
issues for the system.
