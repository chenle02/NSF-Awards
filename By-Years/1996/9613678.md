This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at University of Florida acquire an
electrospray ionization ion trap mass spectrometer. This equipment will enhance
research in a number of areas including the following: (1) dynamic measurement
of neuropeptides in vivo, (2) synthesis and characterization of synthetic and
biological peptides and proteins, (3) electroactive polymers and
aquathermolysis, (4) biocatalytic synthesis and biocatalytic conversion of
aromatic wastes into useful compounds, and (5) analogs oligonucleotides and
nucleosides bearing non-standard bases and modified bridging groups. Mass
spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural details and
to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of organic,bioorganic, and
organometallic molecules. The addition of the technique of electrospray extends
the range of MS to proteins and nucleic acid molecular weights far beyond any
other technique. The use of electrospray ionization in combination with high
resolution provides the latest techniques available in mass spectrometry. It
affords the chemist one of the most powerful tools available for the
characterization of compounds. The acquisition of this capability in mass
spectrometry is essential for the prosecution of frontier research in many
fields of chemistry.
