Whether abiotic or biotic processes are primarily responsible for the patterns
within natural communities remains an important question. In streams, ecologists
have traditionally emphasized abiotic factors, but increasing evidence suggests
that biotic interactions structure lotic communities. In central Ohio streams, a
crayfish species replacement is undeniably occurring, providing a unique
opportunity to test rigorously those biotic processes controlling benthic
invertebrate distribution and abundance. Three potential mechanisms are to be
explored: differential reproductive success, differential competitive ability,
and particularly differential vulnerability to fish predation. Specifically, it
will be determined if the direct and indirect effects of predation and
competition can explain this species replacement. Field surveys, lab
experiments, and field manipulations will clarify how differential size, growth,
and habitat use influence each of these three alternative mechanisms. Because of
the ongoing nature of this crayfish replacement, it is believed that this is to
be a model system for studying biotic processes in streams.
