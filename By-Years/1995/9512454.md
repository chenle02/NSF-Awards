9512454 Adjouadi This proposal requests a confocal microscope, a high-speed
video motion analyzer, and two dedicated processors which will complement the
existing Onyx multiprocessing supercomputer with four R8000 RISC processors. The
integrated equipment will bring new research dimension in real-time vision,
cognition, and 3-D modeling with real-world applications. Research collaboration
has been established with Coulter Corporation in analysis and classification of
blood cells, with Baptist Hospital of Miami in surgical planning and nuclear
medicine, and with the University of Florida's Center for Intelligent Machines
in robot vision, motion analysis, and telerobotics. New visual/sensing
techniques will be developed and used in these projects for high sensitivity and
resolution, real-time motion analysis, real-time 3-D rendering and
visualization, and on-chip 3-D surface reconstruction and depth extraction. ***
