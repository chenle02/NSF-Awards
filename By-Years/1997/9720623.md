9720623 R. A. Mullen University of Washington Optically Reconfigurable Antenna
Synapses Dr. Mullen will evaluate the feasibility of employing polymers in lieu
of semiconductors in photoconductive microwave switches. If successful, this
work promises to increase the functionality of microwave antenna apertures. This
award will enhance the rf photonic program being established at the Univ. of
Washington by the PI. This research activity will be highly leveraged by the
experience, knowledge, practical insights and rf photonic diagnostic facilities
developed during the PI's 12 years of industrial experience. It will
significantly further the PI's career goals by nurturing nascent cross-
disciplinary collaborations and by expending opportunities to publish scholarly
articles and technical proposals necessary to attain an influential high-
visibility position within the university tenure system.
