Disk systems have long been a source of performance and
management&lt;br/&gt;problems, and they grow in importance as the years pass. Of
particular&lt;br/&gt;concern are the slow-to-improve mechanical positioning
delays. To&lt;br/&gt;address these problems, storage devices and host systems
have abundant&lt;br/&gt;resources and knowledge. Independently, engineers of
both device&lt;br/&gt;firmware and operating system (OS) software aggressively
utilize their&lt;br/&gt;local knowledge and resources to mitigate disk
performance problems.&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of this research is to increase
the cooperation&lt;br/&gt;between these two sets of engineers, which will
increase the&lt;br/&gt;end-to-end performance and robustness of computer
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will develop a deep understanding of
available device&lt;br/&gt;and workload information and how it can be
collectively exploited.&lt;br/&gt;Exploiting this understanding in real systems
will require more&lt;br/&gt;expressive interfaces and new cooperative
algorithms. Two concrete&lt;br/&gt;examples to be explored are: (1) device-side
specializations, such&lt;br/&gt;as freeblock scheduling, that have access to
system-provided&lt;br/&gt;information about priority levels and forthcoming
demands, and&lt;br/&gt;(2) OS-side specializations, such as track-aligned
extents, that&lt;br/&gt;have access to device-provided details about physical
data layout&lt;br/&gt;and firmware cache algorithms. In addition, the insights
generated&lt;br/&gt;by this research will assist end-to-end education and
thinking in&lt;br/&gt;storage systems.
