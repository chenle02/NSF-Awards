This project addresses a set of related, central questions in macroeconomics.
One set of questions involves savings and investment in the world economy. For
example, why are national savings and investment rates so highly correlated when
there appears to be highly integrated international capital markets? Another set
of questions involves the magnitude of equity premium and the variability of
asset prices. For example, how does the presence of uncertainty arising from
specific shocks to the economy affect the required return on equity and its
variability. This research is important because it will provide a better
understanding of how monetary and fiscal policy affect savings and investment
behavior. These issues are investigated using recently-developed techniques for
analyzing equilibria in dynamic, stochastic economies. The emphasis is on
obtaining quantitative model predictions, and comparing these predictions with
appropriate data. Although the models used are equilibrium models, the analysis
is not confined to environments in which equilibrium is Pareto optimal. In fact,
an important component of the proposed research is the analysis of economic
environments in which there are important constraints on the opportunities of
individuals to pool risks via financial markets.
