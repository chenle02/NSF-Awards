The project examines the synthesis and characterization of new polymers to be
used for membranes with improved characteristics for oxygen separation from air.
Polymers and copolymers are synthesized with main-chain Schiff-base/Co(II)
coordination. The polymers are modified to improve their long-term stability to
oxygen complexation. the objectives are to study the relation between polymer
structure and oxygen binding parameters. Membranes formed from these polymers
are studied with respect to their permeability to O2 and N2. UV- Visible
spectrophotometry is used to identify complexes with oxygen. Pulsed-laser flash
photolysis is used to determine complexation rate constants. The results should
have an impact on synthesizing novel polymeric materials for membrane- gas-
separations and possibly other applications.
