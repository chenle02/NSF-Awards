The proposed research focuses on developing a better understanding of the nature
of the active sites on sulfated- and tungstated zirconias for the isomerization
of light n-alkanes (n-butane, n-pentane, and n-hexane). To date, zirconia-based
catalysts have offered more potential for utilization than has been able to be
realized, in large part due to their tendency towards fast deactivation. The
reaction induction period, lasting only a few minutes for n-butane
isomerization, largely determines the future behavior of sulfated zirconia. The
proposed research will make use of an in-situ reaction technique, isotopic
transient kinetic analysis (ITKA), to determine the evolution of the
concentration and residence time(s) of the surface reaction intermediates during
the initial reaction period. Addition of trace amounts of olefins (1-butene,
1-pentene, and 1-hexene) during initial reaction will help to define the nature
of the active sites, and in particular "olefin-modified" sites that have
recently been identified. In-situ DRIFTS as well as other more traditional ex-
situ techniques will be used to characterize adsorbed species and the catalysts
studied. The educational component will be the traditional mentoring of graduate
and undergraduate students. A better understanding of the similarities and
differences of the sites on these catalysts for the isomerization of the
different n-alkanes may guide the design of more stable catalysts. Processes
built around the use of such solid acid catalysts offer possibilities for
replacing less environmentally friendly processes with liquid acids or solid
acid catalysts requiring the co-feed of corrosive compounds.
