9420612 REINERS Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an important greenhouse gas that is
increasing in concentration by about 0.3% per year. Humid tropical forests
account for 25-40% of the annual global emissions of N2O, and the conversion of
forests to pastures or agriculture initially increases the emission rate to very
high levels. These high levels of gas emission are sustained in ecosystems where
fertilizers are applied, but the rates of emission can drop precipitously in
pastures and unfertilized fields. Accurately estimating the atmospheric input of
nitrous oxide on a regional scale must account for such complexity and provide
estimates of the variance which is occurring. This project develops and test two
models which more accurately characterizes the regional flux of nitrous oxide to
the atmosphere from humid tropical forests.
