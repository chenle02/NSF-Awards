9732519 This REU Site will provide an exciting and engaging introduction to
research for 10 undergraduates each summer. These experiences will take place at
the University of Colorado's Mountain Research Station and will focus on the
behavior, ecology, and evolution of subalpine and alpine organisms. The program,
which has been shaped through experiences gained in previous REU Site grants,
has three components. The first is a week-long intensive introduction to
research, built around a series of field problems that are conducted with
increasing levels of independence. The second is a summer-long course that deals
with the practicalities of research and of going to graduate school. This course
operates in parallel with 9-week student projects done in association with
faculty mentors. The summer culminates in project presentations that are given
in a scientific-meeting format. Evaluations of prior REU grants show that this
program has been successful in encouraging students to go to graduate school and
in generating a summer experience that has a profound effect on the development
of the participants' scientific careers.
