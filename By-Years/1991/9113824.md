This award will support a workshop on Biodiversity, to be held at the Harvard
Forest, Petersham, Massachusetts on June 27 to July 1, 1991. The workshop has
two principal objectives: 1) To prepare a set of testable hypotheses relating
biodiversity at each of the biological levels (molecular, genetic, population,
species, community and ecosystem levels) to the other levels of complexity. A
50-page paper by the PI will serve as the basis of discussion. 2) To develop a
set of criteria for a proposed international network for the inventory and
monitoring of biodiversity, and to outline the elements of such a network. The
products of the workshop will comprise a document that will be forwarded to the
International Conference on Biodiversity that will take place in the USSR in
October 1991, for discussion and approval by that body.
