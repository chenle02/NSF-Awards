This project is concerned with the algebraic theory of quadratic forms over
fields of characteristic different from two. The principal investigator will
investigate torsion-free properties in the Witt ring using Galois cohomology
with coefficients in various Galois modules. He will also study quadratic forms
over elliptic curves defined over an arbitrary field. In particular, he will use
etale cohomology to investigate the Witt ring of such forms, especially when
defined over a local field. This project is concerned with the theory of
quadratic forms. A quadratic form is a polynomial function of several variables
which is homogeneous of degree two. Quadratic forms over fields of
characteristic other than two arise naturally from the symmetric inner products
on vector spaces over these fields. Thus the forms are intimately connected to
the geometry of the space.
