9400934 Haiman This project involves research into modules associated with the
Macdonald polynomials and the module of diagonal harmonics. The work promises to
establish new relationships between these objects and other parts of algebraic
combinatorics and algebraic geometry. Preliminary work has already established
the framework for the connections and has produced important new algebraic
identities. This research falls in the broad category of combinatorics, which is
one of the most active fields in today's mathematics. At its roots,
combinatorics is the study of systematic counting. Counting can be incredibly
difficult when the objects are difficult to list, and combinatorists look for
general methods for overcoming these difficulties. Today's combinatorics makes
use of a wide variety of the most advanced and modern mathematical techniques.
Although its roots go back several centuries, the field has had an explosive
development in the past few decades. This growth comes from its importance in
communications and information technology and from the success of modern
techniques to problems of counting.
