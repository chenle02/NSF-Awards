The Galileo affair raised fundamental questions about scientific fact and
methodological principle that continue to our own day. Specific debates about
the compatibility of science and religion, the potential tension between
politics and scientific truth, and the sometime-inconsistent demands of
sceintific research and social responsibility all may be found in this important
historical episode. Although there is an immense literature about the galileo
affair itself, the full story of its aftermath has never been told. This project
will produce a critical history of the Galileo affair from 1633 to 1992,
examining both the historical aftermath (which begins with the original affair
and ends with Galileo's alleged `rehabilitation` in 1979-92) and the reflective
commentary (which encompasses 350 years of interpretation and evaluation). The
project will combine historical and philosophical techniques to achieve these
ends, drawing upon empirical research, textual analysis, historical
interpretation, historiographical reflection and philosophial criticism.
