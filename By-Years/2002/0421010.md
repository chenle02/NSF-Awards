With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Johns Hopkins University
will acquire a sum frequency non-linear optical spectroscopy system (SFG) to
probe interfaces of nano, bio and environmental materials. This equipment will
be used to probe a) interfaces of organic thin films for microsystems and
sensors; b) dynamic surfactant assemblies at liquid interfaces; c) microparticle
drug delivery systems; d) lipid membrane interfaces; e) cadherin interactions in
cell membranes; f) interactions of hydrophobic organic chemicals with organic
surfaces; and g) identification of reaction intermediates in the reduction of
organohalides by zero-valent iron. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SFG system will be
used by post-doctoral fellows, graduate and undergraduate students. The presence
of a SFG apparatus at Johns Hopkins University will also impact the education
curriculum since three of the investigators teach courses in interfacial
science. This instrument will allow them to incorporate examples of laser
spectroscopic instrumentation and associated nonlinear optical phenomena into
these courses. &lt;br/&gt;
