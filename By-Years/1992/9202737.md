In this project, the PI, along with a post doctoral student, will study the mean
momentum, heat, and eddy energy balances in the upper equatorial Pacific. Data
collected during the NORPAX Hawaii-Tahiti Shuttle Experiment, which includes
both velocity and hydrographic measurments, will be used. Models of the
equatorial circulation will be compared, updated, and improved, using the
results of the data analysis.
