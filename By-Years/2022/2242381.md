The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase II project will be a disruption to the growing communications marketplace
(&gt; $4.7B market by 2026) which is limited by the capabilities of
semiconductor manufacturing processes and the cost of compound semiconductors
such as gallium nitride (GaN). This project will reimagine the semiconductor
manufacturing process by bringing compound and silicon-based semiconductors
together to reduce system costs relative to solutions using only single device
technologies. This project will assemble future systems for the burgeoning
communications and sensing industries in a proprietary technology platform to
support a shift in manufacturing technology that spans from lithographic
patterning to the assembly of the smallest constituent parts. Finally, the
project will enable low-cost, automated semiconductor manufacturing to help the
United States regain leadership in silicon semiconductor manufacturing while
helping US-based semiconductor foundries define new
markets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase II project is a first-of-its-kind analysis of failure mechanisms in
heterogeneous semiconductors and the design of unique mixed-signal circuitry
that improves the yield and reliability in integrated circuits. Heterogeneous
integration of semiconductors with different fundamental material properties has
been an emerging goal for “beyond Moore’s law” semiconductors. Radio frequency
(RF) and millimeter-wave integrated circuits will benefit in performance by
circumventing fundamental limitations with all silicon approaches. The project
will develop new approaches from materials to systems around an optimization of
devices to meet performance objectives such as output power, linearity, and
noise while leveraging the intimate integration with mixed-signal approaches
based in silicon to provide calibration, compensation, and predistortion of RF
imperfections. While low levels of heterogeneous integration have been
demonstrated in millimeter-wave bands, the integrated circuit technology will
require dozens and even hundreds of III-V devices integrated on a common
platform with millions of silicon transistors. The proposed effort will assess
the failure mechanisms associated with the assembly and operation of new
integrated circuits and approaches to mitigate these problems to reduce the cost
of bringing next generation products to market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
