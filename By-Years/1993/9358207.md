This NYI award will fund research on interfacial and transport phenomena related
to the pulmonary system. Surfactant physico- chemical properties and their
influence on pulmonary mechanics of obstruction clearance as well as droplet
spreading on thin films as a model of aerosol medication delivery will be
studied. This NYI award will also allow the investigator to continue teaching
and developing courses that use interactive software tools as part of the
courses.
