This project involves the acquisition of essential equipment to upgraded a
departmental tissue culture laboratory. As a result, the undergraduate
neuroscience program has been enhanced and there is a significant impact on
other undergraduate courses, including general biology, cell biology, and
special problems courses in biology, and undergraduate independent study
research. The core of the neuroscience program consists of lecture and
laboratory-oriented courses that emphasize cellular and molecular aspects of
neurobiology. Laboratory exercises complement the principles and techniques
being discussed in lectures by providing students with hands-on experience in
tissue culture and other commonly used techniques in biological research. Our
urban area is currently one of the most economically depressed in the nation.
Therefore, the project is also striving to increase the appeal of biological
careers to economically disadvantaged minority students from the city and
surrounding areas.
