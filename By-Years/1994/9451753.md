9451753 Kopec The project is developing a multimedia laboratory for students in
several introductory science classes. These laboratories are being used to
provide tutorial assistance and to provide simulated laboratory experience for
these classes. The project is being accomplished in two phases. In the first
phase, commercially available software is being used for the tutorials and
simulated laboratories. In the second phase, tutorials and laboratories are
being developed to more completely meet the needs of the students in these
courses.
