This award provides one-half of the funding needed to ship, repair and install a
used electron microprobe system in the Department of Geology at the Florida
International University. The University is committed to providing the remaining
half funding necessary. The award is made in response to a proposal submitted to
the National Science Foundation's program for Research in Undergraduate
Institutions. The instrument is being donated at cost by the University of
Arizona who will be acquiring a new system. The used system is not obsolete and
will serve the needs of Florida International University for microanalytical
capabilities in research projects in experimental petrology, igneous petrology
and geochemistry. The microprobe will also be accessible for student research
projects and open to qualified workers in the Miami region.
