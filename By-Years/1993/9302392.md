In this project, the PI will continue operation of the WOCE (World Ocean
Circulation Experiment) Data Information Unit (DIU). WOCE is a worldwide,
international program, with dispersed data holdings, and principal investigators
in many countries. The DIU serves as an information center for WOCE, provides
the means for tracking WOCE data sets, and acts as a central activity to
stimulate the development of the WOCE data management system. Activities of the
DIU include operation of an existing on-line information center, organizing
information about data sets valuable to WOCE, providing information necessary
for effective WOCE data management, and maintaining information about program
standards and formats. During the coming year, scientists at the DIU will add
improvements to the data-tracking system and explore the possibility of creating
an integrated WOCE data set.
