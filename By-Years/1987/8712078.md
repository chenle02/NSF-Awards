The objective of this research program is to further explore and exploit the
extraordinarily large optical nonlinearities of liquid crystals for novel
nonlinear optical processes and applications. Recent studies by the PI have
confirmed the possibilities of utilizing the orientational and thermal
nonlinearities in optical wave front conjugation with gains, beam amplifications
and other real-time adaptive processes such as ring and self-oscillations and
laser intensity switching, for visible as well as infrared lasers. Phase locking
of lasers, speckle noise-free phase conjugation, image correlations and
convolutions have also shown to be feasible. The proposed studies will include
the development of detailed theories for some new fundamental aspects of these
wave mixing results (e.g., beam and image amplification in a Kerr medium, multi-
beam interactions with diffusive-type nonlinearities, self-oscillations in phase
conjugations) and parallel detailed experimental measurements and documentations
of these processes. It is anticipated that several important theories, concepts,
and useful visible-far infrared nonlinear optical imaging, optical processing
and adaptive optic devices will emerge from these studies.
