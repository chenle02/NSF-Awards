The focus of this research is the synthesis and characterization of
functionalized fulleroids that have the potential to bind to the active site of
retroviral reverse transcriptases (RT) as well as the HIV protease (HIVP). %%%
With this Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER), the Synthetic Organic
Program is supporting the research of Dr. Fred Wudl of the Institute for
Polymers and Organic Solids at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The
focus of the research is the synthesis of novel functionalized hollow spheroidal
molecules, fulleroids, that have the potential to be retrovirus-specific,
biologically active molecules.
