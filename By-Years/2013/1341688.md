Antarctic coastal polynas are, at the same time, sea-ice free sites and sea-ice
factories. They are open water surface locations where water mass transformation
and densification occurs, and where direct atmospheric exchanges with the deep
ocean circulation are established. Various models of the formation and
persistence of these productive and diverse ocean ecosystems are hampered by the
relative lack of in situ meteorological and physical oceanographic observations.
This is especially so during the inhospitable conditions of their formation and
activity during autumn to winter transition and the polar night. The Western
Ross Sea, downstream from two of the largest coastal Antarctic polynyas, happens
to be a region where there continues to be net sea-ice production, as indicated
by satellite measurements of areal extent, duration and
concentration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characterization of the lower atmosphere
properties, air-sea surface heat fluxes and corresponding ocean depth profiles
of the Terra Nova Bay (TNB) polynya, is sought for a more detailed understanding
of the role of polynyas in the production of latent-heat type sea ice and the
formation, through sea ice brine rejection, of dense ocean bottom waters. This
observational program will simultaneously identify mechanisms responsible for
water mass modification within TNB and document aspects of dense shelf water
formation within a large Antarctic polynya system. This study will characterize
the water masses within a polyna over the course of an annual cycle using
moorings yielding in-situ column and near-surface oceanic observation.
