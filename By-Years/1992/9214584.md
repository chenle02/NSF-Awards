A high resolution field emission scanning electron microscope equipped with a
cryotransfer/state system and a x- ray microanalyzer is needed for investigators
in biological and related sciences at Cornell University. The instrumentation
will be used in a wide range of projects in agriculture, biology and related
sciences, and will be located in the Bradfield Hall Electron Microscopy facility
under the responsibility of the Principal Investigator who is also the director
of the facility. The 15 year old conventional scanning electron microscope AMRAY
1000, currently in the facility, cannot meet the specifications needed for use
in the proposed projects. While the instrumentation is necessary for the
proposed projects, it should also benefit other research projects in the campus
that may need high resolution SEM imaging of biological specimens or the
capability to examine frozen-hydrated specimens. The training/teaching program
that is currently i n place at the Bradfield Hall facility should make the
state-of-the-art equipment readily available to a wide body of researchers
including the faculty members, postdoctoral associates, graduate students,
undergraduates and technicians.
