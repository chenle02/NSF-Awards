9304480 Coleman This United States-Russian multidisciplinary cooperative
research project will involve field, petrologic, geochronologic and tectonic
investigations of intracratonal metamorphic rocks in the Kokchetav Massif and
the Maksyutov Complex of the Ural Mountains. Microdiamonds and/or coesite, which
form during regional ultrahigh-P metamorphism at mantle depths, have been
described from these rocks - their presence in regionally extensive complexes at
the Earth's surface may imply the operation of tectonic processes of profound
importance. Specific goals of the research include identifying and
characterizing the composition of crystalline inclusions in garnet and zircon to
establish the conditions of the ultrahigh metamorphism, delineating the P-T-t
paths of various rocks, determining the geochemical characteristics of
protoliths, and establishing ages of the metamorphic events through radiometric
dating.
