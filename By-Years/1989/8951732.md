Before the current advent of solid modeling techniques, computer- aided design
strategies did not substantially differ from the design strategies used with
traditional design tools: drafting boards and calculators. Recently, a wide gap
has developed in these strategies and today new approaches are available to a
modern mechanical engineering designer. These new approaches rely heavily on
powerful graphics workstations and integrated CAD software which are becoming
more and more affordable for routine design work. The project is concerned with
modernizing the sequence of design courses in a traditional mechanical
engineering curriculum by introducing three-dimensional solid modeling
techniques and integrated CAD systems into these courses, starting with the
freshman course on engineering design graphics and continuing through the senior
capstone design project. Modern computer-aided design laboratories will be
organized and educational materials developed that will support the concept of
designing a mechanical component in three-dimensional space and using the
created data base for direct analysis of its static, dynamic, flow, or thermal
characteristics.
