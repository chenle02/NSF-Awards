This grant supports the development of new statistical methods for analyzing
common cause failure data for complex systems, such as nuclear power plant
component groups. For the purpose of modeling common cause failures, the
research can lead to the development of a binomial failure rate mixture model,
based on a parametric shock model developed for power plant risk assessment.
Beyond this mixture model estimator, various results will be pursued, including
both non-parametric and parametric estimators; confidence bands and other
measures of uncertainty; general solutions for systems of non identical
components; and, pertinent limit properties. The mixture model will serve as a
point of departure to further research into statistical analyses based on
dependent failure models. This research also investigates techniques of mapping
that replace missing data with estimated data in the risk assessment, and will
help to characterize the uncertainty involved with various models used for the
mapping procedure using statistical theory in addition to Monte Carlo
simulation. The original binomial failure rate model has been criticized due to
the many existing databases for which the model fit is poor. The realistic
generalization in this investigation is more complex than the original model or
its non-parametric alternatives, but model fit can be greatly improved. There
exists a strong foundation of qualitative analysis in the engineering literature
(screening analysis, fault tree analysis, etc.), but little guidance with
respect to some quantitative aspects common cause failure research. If
successful, this research will contribute to quantitative risk analyses in the
nuclear safety field.
