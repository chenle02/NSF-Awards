Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Program: NSF 04-588 CISE Computing Research
Infrastructure&lt;br/&gt;Title: CRI: PlanetLab: A Community Resource Development
Program &lt;br/&gt;Proposal: CNS-0454278 &lt;br/&gt;PI: Larry L.
Peterson&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Princeton University &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This
community resource project will extend the PlanetLab testbed to approximately
1000 nodes at approximately 350 sites. PlanetLab is an overlay network providing
an environment for both research innovation in network services and a platform
for introducing new services to client communities. As a research testbed,
PlanetLab provides a geographically distributed set of machines, a realistic
network substrate that experiences conjestion, failures, and diverse behavior at
links, and realistic workloads at client computers. As a deployment platform,
PlanetLab provides researchers with a technology transfer path for services that
have community support and provides users with access to these innovative new
services. Users of PlanetLab are active in areas such as network architectures,
measurement and modeling, content distribution, and education. Broader impacts
of this project include enabling a wider community opportunities to engage in
cutting edge networking research, extending the host sites to EPSCOR states,
HBCU's, and liberal arts colleges; and engaging both industry and international
participation in this
effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
