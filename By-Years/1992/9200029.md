A summer internship program in physics for undergraduates in the industrial
midwest region will be carried out at Michigan State University. This is an area
of the country with many colleges and a large number of physics undergraduates
who do not have many opportunities for summer employment in technical and
scientific areas. This REU award is directed toward broad-based recruiting in
the region, and toward providing an environment for the selected students that
will encourage them to pursue research careers in physics. Each student has his
own research supervisor, who is either a professor in the Department of Physics
and Astronomy or on the staff of the National Superconducting Cyclotron
Laboratory (NSCL). The students meet regularly to participate in student and
faculty seminar series. The program includes organized social activities and
tours of research facilities.
