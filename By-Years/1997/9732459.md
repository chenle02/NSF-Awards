9732459&lt;br/&gt;Fry&lt;br/&gt;This experiment completes an exact realization
of Bohm's version of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen thought experiment.
Correlations will be measured between nuclear spin components of the nuclei of
two Hg-199 atoms created by the photodissociation of a mercury dimer with total
nuclear spin zero. A novel circular polarized laser excitation-ionization
technique, using a detector with near unit efficiency, will be used to observe
the two atoms.&lt;br/&gt;
