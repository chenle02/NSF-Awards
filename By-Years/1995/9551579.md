The principal goal of this project is to develop a novel and unique
undergraduate laboratory in control system. The laboratory provides hands-on
experience in the various steps of control systems design, aids students in
visualizing the abstract concepts covered in a control system course, introduces
students to the practical aspects of design, and provides an avenue to
synthesize theoretical materials developed in a lecture. This project is setting
up a computer-controlled control system design laboratory to support
undergraduate courses and design efforts. The laboratory includes four novel
design experiments, specifically designed to stimulate the students and to
demonstrate the practical and analytical issues in control system design and
development. The project is using this "hands-on" integrated capability to
provide a complete design and analysis experience. This includes model
development and verification, model simulation, control design, system
implementation, and verification of performance objectives. Modifications to
original designs can be included and parameters can be fine tuned. Students are
confronted with design and analysis activities similar to those faced by
engineers in industry.
