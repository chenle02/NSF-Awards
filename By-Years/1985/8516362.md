This project supports a workshop to evaluate research trends, opportunities, and
priorities in nonlinear dynamics. This is a key sub-element of the Dynamic
Systems and Control Program. The workshop is instrumental in supporting the
continuous process of apprising the program of new research needs in the
nonlinear dynamics field.
