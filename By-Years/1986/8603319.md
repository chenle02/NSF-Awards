Prior research has resulted in the definition of a new associative processing
system using a novel VLSI associative memory. The system, an associative
parallel processor unit with multi-operand processing capability, behaves as a
dynamically reconfigurable array of associative processors all performing the
same function with different operands on disjoint data sets. A simulator for
this proposed architecture has been built. This project focuses on the
exploration and evaluation of different algorithms of importance in image
processing mapped onto this architecture. The results of these simulation
studies are expected to aid in the refinement of the architecture such that the
resulting design will evolve into a fully parallel associative computer capable
of solving a wide and important class of problems. A novel architecture is
proposed. At this point in time an in-depth study of the architecture including
the evaluation of important algorithms mapped onto this architecture will
enhance our understanding of the significance of this new architecture.
