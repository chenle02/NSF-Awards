This award supports the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) and
Teachers (RET) Site in Astronomy and Atmospheric Science at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and Haystack Observatory. The program will provide
opportunities for undergraduate students and teachers from around the country to
actively engage in front-line research in many areas of astronomy, geodesy, and
atmospheric science. Program participants will work with individual faculty
members and/or observatory staff on focused research projects that last 10 weeks
during the summer. The program emphasizes an end-to-end exposure to the research
process for the participants. Many of the students will become co-authors on
articles published in scientific journals. The very nature of an REU/RET site
results in a broader impact, in terms of educational activities. To help broaden
the diversity of this program, student and teachers from within Puerto Rico will
also be able to participate in this program through a collaboration with
Universities within the Ana G. Mendez University System.
