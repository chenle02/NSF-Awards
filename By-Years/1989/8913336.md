The Cold Spring Harbor courses, Molecular Embryology of the Mouse, Yeast
Genetics, Molecular Cloning of Eukaryotic Genes, and Advanced Molecular Cloning
and Expression of Eukaryotic Genes will again be available this summer for
training both students and established investigators who wish to learn new
molecular techniques. These courses are viewed by the scientific community as
the most outstanding and effective courses of this type in the world. Some of
the most productive and respected scientists in biology have passed through
these courses. This award will support students who would otherwise be unable to
attend for training in both techniques and concepts which will enhance their
careers in basic research in biology.
