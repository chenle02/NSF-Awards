This project has allowed the institution to acquire a Varian 3400 Gas
Chromatograph to enable the sophomore level Organic- Analytical Laboratory to
incorporate a strong GC/mass spectroscopy segment into the laboratory. The
instrument is used with the department's Varian 3300/Finnigan MAT system.
Students are first instructed on these instruments in the fall term in order to
characterize unknown components separated from mixtures. Students make extensive
use of the instrument with the GC/MS in the second term to characterize and
analyze products in multistep syntheses. The need for the instrumentation was
heightened by an increase in enrollment in chemistry, and the physical
impracticality caused by both time constraints and caution in having every
student search for suitable chromatographic conditions on equipment which was in
hand. The institution has contributed to the project in an amount equal to the
NSF funds.
