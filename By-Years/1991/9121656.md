Vital functions of the body are controlled by complex mechanisms of the
brainstem, which involve both hormones and neurotransmitter substances. The
research to be performed by Dr. Myers as a result of this award will deal with
processes responsible for hunger, the act of feeding, the condition of satiety,
experimental anorexia, the regulation of body temperature, hyperthermia and
hypothermia. Special emphasis will be placed on the interaction between
mechanisms of hunger and of temperature regulation. In specific experiments, the
function of a newly discovered protein factor called macrophage inflammatory
protein 1 (MIP-1 ) will be studied. This substance is a potent endogenous factor
which has been directly implicated in the regulation of hunger and temperature
at the level of hypothalamus. The studies will focus on brain sensitivity to
MIP- 1 in terms of changes in temperature anf feeding, and the interaction of
MIP-1 with other neurotransmitters that are known to be involved in
physiological regulation of these functions.This research will contribute
fundamental scientific information about how hormones and transmitters in the
brain can modulate life-sustaining regulatory functions.
