Robotics and GPS/GIS in 4-H: Workforce Skills for the 21st Century is a-five
year scale-up project to use 4-H clubs to prepare middle school youth for the
STEM workplace. The project builds on and extends an existing research-based
ITEST project by developing and testing new national curricula to introduce
basic technology skills, foster problem solving and inquiry skills, and
encourage teamwork. A professional development model to support youth learning
of concepts focused on information and communications technology is designed and
delivered to adult volunteers, after-school educators, and parents. The
participation of girls and underrepresented populations is broadened through
opportunities for collaboration and social networking and infusing cultural
awareness within the project deliverables. The impact of these activities on
youth STEM literacy, attitudes and workplace skills is documented. Research is
performed to better understand how hands-on, inquiry-based robotics and GPS/GIS
activities presented in an informal learning environment can effectively
interest and prepare youth for the STEM workforce. Research questions include
measures of how educational robotics interventions impact youth STEM literacy,
workforce skills, and attitudes about STEM content. The research also
investigates the use of the 4-H robotics curriculum to positively impact
instructional practice of informal educators, their STEM content knowledge and
their confidence.
