9321619 SMITH This project will supply shipboard scientific support equipment
for the research vessel MAURICE EWING, operated by the Lamont-Doherty Earth
Observatory of Columbia University and dedicated to use in support of ocean
science research. The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides
funds for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe conduct of
ocean science research. This Program provides support for such items as deck
equipment including winch systems for the deployment and retrieval of scientific
instruments, navigational equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth
satellite receivers to pin point the location of research sites, communication
equipment including radio transceivers and satellite transceivers for voice and
scientific data communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats
for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites. The Project
Director, James Smith is fully qualified to direct this project having had
considerable experience in overseeing the acquisition and installation of
shipboard equipment. This project will allow the institution to modify two on
board cranes to give them greater reach, install sea water piping for science
use, acquire a GMDSS compliant weather receiver, acquire a SOLAS rescue boat and
davit and two GPS attitude receivers. ***
