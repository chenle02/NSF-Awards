(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The evolution of sociality is one of
life's major transitions, similar to the merging of unicellular organisms to
make multicellular life. In the highly social insect societies some individuals,
the queens, specialize at reproduction while others, the workers, carry out all
of the other tasks necessary for colony survival. This division of labor system
is the foundation of social insect societies, which are among the most
evolutionary and ecologically successful species on earth. The primary objective
of this project is to sequence the genome of an ant in order to identify the
genetic mechanisms that drive the morphological and physiological division of
labor. The harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex barbatus, is one of the best studied ant
species and is a model for basic ecology; it has been an inspiration for the
application of social insect algorithms into aspects of human life (from
computing to civil engineering). This project is composed of three complementary
approaches designed to identify genes responsible for whether an individual
develops as a queen or worker. Results of this project will shed light on the
genetic changes that have taken place that transform the lone individual into a
cooperating part of a larger society. Additionally, a sequenced ant genome will
provide a resource for the larger research community and aid in the exploration
of questions related to many major themes in the larger fields of ecology,
evolution, development and behavior. This project will involve students from
K-12 through all echelons of science education through previously established
partnerships, including those in developing countries (Mexico). Training the
next generation of scientists in modern biological methods and approaches is
essential and only possible with the public funding of genomic projects where
all resources are made open and accessible.
