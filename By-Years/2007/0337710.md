This project will investigate the potential of combining the representational
innovations of SimCalc in the core mathematics of change with the new
affordances of wireless Classroom Connectivity (CC). An intense program of
exploration has yielded dramatic new forms of classroom activity structures that
offer students newly participatory ways to be mathematical in group and
classroom activities, and teachers flexible new pedagogies that, together, may
point the way to standard classroom practice of the future when CC is common.
Student participation structures and attention are newly manipulable, and
teacher ability to manage the interplay between individual learning/cognition
and public social participation is likewise enhanced, especially through the
teacher's ability to selectively aggregate, manipulate and publicly display
individual or group constructions, as well as rebroadcast objects to the class
for further investigation and new cycles of harvest, aggregation display and
discussion. Two streams of inquiry are proposed: Stream 1 is convergent and
systematically experimental on stable technologies in sets of common teaching
experiments, producing carefully developed evidence on participation, teaching,
learning and relations among them, and new instrumentation that enables
researchers to measure/compare forms and levels of participation in CC contexts
and potentially relate these to teacher characteristics. Stream 2, continuing
the invention and exploration of the prior project, consists of three sub-
streams, systematically, but opportunistically, exploiting the expanding
affordances of evolving technologies to explore (a) new participation
structures, (b) the growth in teacher capacity to use CC productively, both as
individuals and as members of peer communities, and (c) dynamic representational
supports for effective teacher understanding and use of
CC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
