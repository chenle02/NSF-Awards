The goal of this project is to establish a new paradigm of scientific software,
electing quantum chemistry as the domain science. The new software does not have
a static, compiled code, but instead consists of an expert system and code
generator. At every execution, it analyzes the hardware and application
parameters, determines(parallel) algorithms, and implements them for one-time
use. This strategy not only allows unprecedented flexibility in algorithm
optimization but can also realize ideas that are impossible otherwise. Since the
approach makes no assumption about hardware or application, it is more
extensible, maintainable, and portable. It is particularly well suited for
chemistry, where a variety of molecules and reactions is infinite.

The expected long-term impact of this project is a change in the way scientific
and engineering computing software is developed and defined. It promises novel
software technology, which simultaneously achieves development efficiency, high
product quality, and increased ability to optimize the code and enhance the
methodological capabilities, by having no fixed source code. This project also
offers unique, interdisciplinary education for chemistry graduate students,
which places exceptionally large focus on computing, the field that has been a
driving force of the 21st century economy.

This is an award within the solicitation of Software Infrastructure for
Sustained Innovation. The award is co-funded by the Office of
Cyberinfrastructure, the Division of Chemistry and the Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities.
