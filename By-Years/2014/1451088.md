Advanced manufacturing, is a group of manufacturing activities that use advanced
technologies, cutting-edge materials, automation, and computation to manufacture
new products and to improve manufacturing methods of existing products. Advanced
manufacturing provides a capability to produce customized and complex products,
while reducing both production time and cost. To ensure the quality and
reliability of products, most advanced manufacturing systems are equipped with
hundreds of sensors that are used to collect quality-related data such as the
part dimensions, strength, etc. This results in a tremendous amount of data
(namely, Big Data) that provide unique opportunities for improving advanced
manufacturing systems. This EArly-Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award
supports fundamental research that enhances existing knowledge for the
development of new analytical methods for Big Data that help improve the quality
of manufactured products. The results of this research will have a significant
impact on a variety of high profile application domains including automotive,
aerospace, defense, biomedical, and medical by, preventing catastrophic
failures, reducing scrap and rework costs, and improving product quality, all of
which increase customer satisfaction and aid in economic growth.

The use of statistical methods for improving manufacturing processes has been
extensively studied and various techniques have been developed in this area.
However, most existing methods fail to effectively analyze the big manufacturing
process data due to their complex structure, high-volume, and high sampling
rates. To address these issues, this research will propose and validate a new
framework that enables modeling and analysis of Big Data in real-time by
exploiting and integrating statistical learning, optimization, advanced
computing, and manufacturing principles. The research team will develop a set of
nonparametric methods for real-time sensing and measurement of Big Data,
effective data compression, and process monitoring, change detection, and
diagnosis.
