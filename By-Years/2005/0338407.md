0338407&lt;br/&gt;Carman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the past 10 years a significant
amount of research has been dedicated to a promising new 'active' material
called Ferromagnetic Shape Memory Alloys (FSMA's) that generates very large
strain under the influence of an applied magnetic field. The strain is probated
through a mechanism of twin boundary motion as opposed to domain growth as seen
in traditional magnetostrictive materials such as Terfenol-D. Strain levels
comparable to commercially available Shape Memory Alloys (SMA's) such as NiTi
have been observed. However, FSMA materials hold greater promise as actuators
since their magnetically induced strain allows for higher operating frequencies
than the slow actuation (10 Hz) of traditional SMA's. Research will focus on
applications of FSMA material towards transduction needs such as high power
sonar, noise reduction, and anti-vibration mounts and structures. In addition
Professor Greg Carman will visit with East Asian researchers to generate
collaborative efforts between the United States and East Asia.&lt;br/&gt;
