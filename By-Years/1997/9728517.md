9728517 GIORDANO Injury to a nerve in the adult mammalian central nervous system
results in a permanent loss of function. In contrast, the axons of the optic
nerve in zebrafish and other cold-blooded vertebrates display a remarkable
capacity for functional regeneration. These differences in regenerative capacity
are due, in part, to differences in the environment encountered by regenerating
axons. Astrocytes, a type of glia cell, make up a large part of this non-
neuronal environment and can influence axonal growth in the embryonic and the
injured adult CNS. Axonal regeneration in fish may be a consequence of the
unique morphological and physiological properties of astrocytes, which may be
linked to the expression of specific cytoskeletal proteins,the intermediate
filaments (IFP). This study will employ molecular and biochemical methods to
examine the expression of IFPs in order to characterize the astrocyte cell types
in the zebrafish optic nerve. The long term objective of the project is to
determine the mechanisms by which non-neuronal cells of the zebrafish visual
system support neuronal growth both during development and following injury.
