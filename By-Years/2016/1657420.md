The objective of this research is to significantly broaden the algorithms and
theory for nonconvex low-rank estimation. Low-rank estimation problems are
ubiquitous in science and engineering. Recently developed nonconvex methods
promise great computational gains on large-scale datasets, but the algorithmic
and theoretical foundation has not yet reached the same level of maturity as
their convex counterpart. This research attacks this deficit in two research
thrusts: pushing the limits of nonconvex methods for greater flexibility through
a unified theoretical framework, and developing new algorithms robust to data
corruption. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve greater flexibility and generality
for the nonconvex approach, the investigator develops a new unifying paradigm
that explains when and why nonconvex methods succeed. This is accomplished by a
novel reinterpretation of various nonconvex methods through a two-step
procedure. This flexible framework unifies several existing algorithms including
gradient descent and alternating minimization, and opens the door for designing
new algorithms. Theoretically this unified view allows for a decoupling of the
statistical and optimization analysis. The investigator will explore the
consequences of this approach by (a) providing a simpler and modular analysis of
the convergence and statistical properties of existing algorithms, (b) studying
the global behaviors of nonconvex methods and the role of initialization, and
(c) designing new algorithms that are more efficient and general. The second
thrust of this project studies the robustness of nonconvex methods. To protect
against arbitrary corruption in data, the investigator designs new robust
nonconvex formulations by viewing corruption as a superimposed structure and
leveraging sparsity in the optimization objectives. This result will be further
expanded through the use of nonsmooth nonconvex formulations and a complete
rethinking of existing analytic techniques.
