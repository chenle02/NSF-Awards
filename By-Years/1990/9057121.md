Plasma wave and particle interactions are fundamental to the study of plasmas
and plasma turbulence. The self- consistent action of chaotic particles on mean-
field plasma waves and on plasma wave-wave interactions will be explored.
Laboratory experiments will be devised using laser diagnosis of plasma ion wave-
particle and wave-wave interactions to study this problem. The experiments
require the development of more sophisticated laser diagnostics to probe these
interactions. An important goal of the research will be to search for a simple
means of approaching these complex phenomena. The ultimate goal is to provide
experimental tests which will guide and compliment theoretical studies of the
role of chaos in plasma wave-wave and wave-particle interactions.
