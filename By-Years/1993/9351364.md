Parallel and distributed computing is a promising technology that affects the
evolution of computer science and influences most aspects of modern life.
Laboratories which train students in this emerging technology are essential. The
proposed laboratory facility will enable us to provide our students with
experiences in shared memory, distributed memory, and network parallelism,
implement our curricular development plan, and work closely with other educators
in this rapidly changing field.
