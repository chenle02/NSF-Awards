The Louisville Science Center (LSC) proposes to develop "The World Around Us
(WAU)," an 8,000 sq ft exhibition, plus programs and materials designed to
increase environmental awareness of citizens, inspiring greater understanding
and respect for earth's natural resources.

INTELLECTUAL MERIT Exhibition components are CenterStage; AtmoSphere: Air that
Surrounds Us; TerraSphere: Environments that Support Us; and AquaSphere: Water
that Sustains Us. The exhibition integrates hands-on activities and media-based
visitor experiences with approximately 1,000 specimens from the LSC collections.
The project takes an interdisciplinary thematic approach founded in educational
goals and STEM content that is closely linked to national science standards.

BROADER IMPACT Target audiences are children in grades 3-8, parents, caregivers
and teachers. LSC expects to reach some five million visitors over ten years
after opening the exhibition. The project focuses on reaching rural and
underserved audiences in Kentucky and Indiana. Its impact will be extended
through strong ties to the schools and with ancillary materials. The distance
learning capability of the Collections Discovery Gallery will extend the reach
of the exhibition beyond the museum walls. In addition, the application of PDAs
and handheld GIS technology will add to experience of the field in these areas.
Dissemination of "green" fabrication techniques will help other science centers
follow similar approaches.
