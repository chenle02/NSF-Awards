This project concerns the transport of scalars, vectors, and waves in developed
turbulence. The first part of the project deals with the statistical modeling of
turbulent velocity and methods of analyzing the statistics of scalar (for
example, temperature) fluctuations. A characteristic feature of turbulent
velocity is the presence of a wide range of scales. This induces a similarly
wide range of scales in fluctuations of temperature and hence in the local
fluctuations of, for example, the refractive index. The study of the refractive
index in the turbulent air is an important challenging problem for mathematical
analysis as well as technological applications. The second part of the project
addresses the statistical properties of wave motion in atmospheric turbulence.
In particular, the project focuses on several regimes where simplified
description of waves can be derived, some of which are known to be widely
applicable. They include the parabolic approximation, the white-noise
approximation, and the radiative transfer limit. The goal is to formulate a
mathematical framework to study the various approximations in a rigorous and
unified way. The details of the solutions in the various approximations will be
investigated, providing guides for the design of communications and imaging
systems.

Understanding of scalar and wave transport through atmospheric turbulence is
essential for many important applications, including heat and contaminant
transport, laser and wireless communications, remote sensing, and imaging. In
the case of sound or optical wave propagation in the atmosphere, for instance,
the wave speed undergoes random fluctuations determined by small-scale
temperature and humidity fluctuations. This project develops a unified
mathematical framework to address problems of scalar transport and wave
propagation through turbulent media. The results of the research will contribute
to the improvement of optical communications and imaging technologies.
