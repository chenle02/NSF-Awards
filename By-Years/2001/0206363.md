A grant has been awarded to Dr. Michael Whiting and Mr. Matthew Terry
at&lt;br/&gt;Brigham Young University to study the relationships among a group
of insects known as Polyneoptera. This large group includes many commonly known
insects with substantial economic impact such as termites, preying mantises,
cockroaches, stick insects, grasshoppers, stoneflies and earwigs; and lesser
known orders including webspinners, rock crawlers and angel insects. Most of
these insects have representatives from every region of the earth and exemplars
representing the diversity of each group will be examined. This study will
concentrate on generating DNA sequence data from multiple genes for each group
using state of the art methods such as polymerase chain reactions (PCR) and
automated sequencing, but will also incorporate data based on a morphological
analysis of each group.&lt;br/&gt; This work will provide a context for the
evaluation of a wide range of biological, behavioral and developmental data,
both within and between the groups mentioned above. One example of this is the
development of sub-social and social behavior in cockroaches and termites; two
groups that preliminary analyses indicate to be closely related to one another.
The study will also provide a foundation for future researchers to address a
host of questions that deal both directly and indirectly with this fascinating
group of insects.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
