This award will provide funds for a Research Experiences for Undergraduate Site
in the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Kansas. Projects in
biochemistry and cell biology will be directed by full-time faculty members,
actively engaged in research and experienced in undergraduate education. Ten
students will participate in research that focuses on the molecular and cellular
processes of intracellular movement, metabolism, neurotransmission, cell
differentiation, vertebrate development, intracellular information transfer,
genetic controls, and cancer control. In the laboratory students will gain
experience in cell and tissue culture, disc and slab gel electrophoresis,
various types of chromatography, preparative centrifugation, UV-visible
spectrophotometry, recombinant DNA technology, electron microscopy, and protein
purification. Through seminars they will become acquainted with broad areas of
biological research. The participants will be active members of a research team
and increasingly independent researchers. Participants will be selected by a
committee made up of the Project Director and two biological science faculty
members of the University. Selection will be based upon the students' academic
records in the natural sciences and upon their aptitude and interest in
research. Participants will be assigned advisers according to their interests
and in consultation with the faculty members involved.
