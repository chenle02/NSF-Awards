9353876 Watson Texas A&amp;M University seeks to initiate a three-week summer,
residential, Young Scholars program with follow-up activities during the
academic year for 32 female and minority students entering grades 8 and 9. The
students will engage in classroom discussions, group activities, research
projects, and field trips in environmental science and engineering. The program
is designed to involve the students in a range of participatory activities that
will communicate the excitement of engineering inquiry, research and problem
solving and enhance their interest in considering engineering as a career
option.
