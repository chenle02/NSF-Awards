9301690 Kumara This research project is concerned with the design, development
and implementation of formal automata theory based architecture for the modeling
and control of Flexible Manufacturing Systems(FMS). The major challenge of
implementing FMS at the factory level is to realize automated control. An
appropriate FMS model is required for the purpose of control software design and
implementation. In this research, the EMMN (Extended Moore Machine Networking)
model based on automata theory for FMS control systems will be investigated.
This will give rigorous theoretical foundations for modeling FMS. The basic
concept behind the EMMN model is to facilitate distributed control approach by
representing a system as a collection of interconnected abstract machines. A
control hierarchy will be established based on abstractions of control
activities. By using object oriented methodology, the EMMN model of a FMS
control system will be implemented into object based software modules, based on
which an integrated environment for system specification, verification and on
line control will be realized. The applicability and validity of this
methodology will be demonstrated via the simulation of an experimental FMS
control system. In addition the scalability and liveness properties will be
investigated with respect to a real life FMS. The model, which will be
implemented via Object Oriented scheme in a multitasking environment, will be
evaluated for portability by considering adaptation on a laboratory based and a
real life FMS.
