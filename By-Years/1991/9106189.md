This project is a cooperative effort between University of New Mexico (Dr. T.T.
Ng) and Rennselaer Polytechnic Institute (Dr. Dobry) in which the objective is
to use two- and three- dimensional random arrays of elastic rough quart
ellipsoids for computer simulations of uniform sands. Good quantitative
predictions for a wide range of strains, drained and undrained loading, and
static as well as cyclic loading can be studied from these arrays.
Micromechanical statistics of phenomena occurring at the particle/contact level
will be obtained from the numerical simulations. Monotonic and cyclic laboratory
axial/torsional tests on hollow cylindrical specimens of spherical and elongated
glass beads as well as on sand will be done to verify numerical simulations.
