This starter grant award to Columbia University supports the research of
Professor James L. Leighton. The research targets the development of a new class
of chiral Lewis acid catalysts for the addition of a wide range of nucleophiles
to any aldehyde. Hetero-bimetallic chiral Lewis acids are designed and
synthesized that simultaneously employ two binding elements, a simultaneous
sigma and pi binding, to control the addition of nucleophiles to aldehydes.
Following synthesis of the catalysts, their complexation reactions are studied
in detail and the complexes fully characterized spectroscopically. The catalytic
properties are optimized by examination of various bimetal combinations. The
research impacts the field of asymmetric catalysis in a practical way, in that
new catalysts are made available for the asymmetric synthesis of small organic
molecules. In addition, the studies address fundamental mechanistic questions
about the nature of pi-bound aldehyde-metal complexes.
