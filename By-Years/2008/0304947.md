0123029&lt;br/&gt;Harrison&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports travel of
eleven US participants, including junior researchers, to a transatlantic
workshop, "Electronic Networks and Democratic Life." The organizers are Teresa
Harrison of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Nicholas Jankowski of the
University of Nijmegen, The Netherlands. The objective of the workshop is to
articulate major research questions that will establish research priorities,
generate collaborative projects, and lay the basis for comparative studies.
Specifically, the workshop will address relationships between system
characteristics and user behaviors, uses of new technologies for political and
government action, and the nature and consequences of online civic discourse.
The goal of the workshop is the development of an international research
community participating in collaborative research projects on e-networks and
democratic life.&lt;br/&gt;
