9408882 Lairson Magnetic multilayers will be studied as a new class of media
materials for perpendicular magnetic recording, particularly with regard to
their applicability to hard disk storage. Fundamental structural and magnetic
properties shall be related to micromagnetic and recording properties in layered
materials, and crystallographically textured films will be prepared on industry-
standard substrates which can be tested for recording properties. Well-
understood materials, such as epitaxial films and films deposited on textured
seed layers, shall also be prepared using industry-accepted fabrication
techniques such as magnetron sputtering. Work will focus on achieving a
comprehensive understanding of the fundamental properties of the films and the
relationship of these properties to magnetic data storage in multilayers. New
knowledge resulting from this work will be the understanding of magnetic
recording issues in the multigigabit per square inch recording regime and the
role micromagnetic properties of multilayers play in issues such as overwrite,
signal-to-noise, and data stability. It is anticipated that this knowledge will
have a significant positive impact on the ultimate applicability of multilayers
to hard disk data storage. ***
