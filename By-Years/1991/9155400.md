SPICA II is a continuation of Project SPICA (Support Program for Instructional
Competency in Astronomy), a program that promotes the use of hands-on, activity-
based science learning at all grade levels. The program, which is designed to
increase the amount and quality of physical science being taught, relies on the
attractiveness of astronomy to provide the vehicle for achieving its goals. Each
summer for three years thirty different teachers will participate in three week
institutes where they will become familiar with and use hands-on educational
materials and learn related teaching methods. These teachers then become SPICA
'agents', delivering workshops which emphasize hands-on activities to other
teachers in their home regions, districts, and states. Some of the teachers
teach at the college-level and will develop and deliver in-service courses
through university continuing education programs. In addition, a teacher's
handbook of activities will be produced and made commercially available. Funds
from sales of the handbook will be used to help finance the ongoing SPICA
network.
