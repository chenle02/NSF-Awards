The IGERT resource center will provide a web-based infrastructure that will
enable projects to share and learn from each other's experience and resources.
It will build the capacity of the IGERT program by facilitating a learning
organization where lessons learned, curricular enhancements, and emerging
research are archived and made available to newly funded projects. The resource
center will also enrich the ability of projects to collaborate by providing a
suite of interactive online tools and online events. The resource center will
further IGERT's goal of expanding and diversifying the STEM talent pool by
enhancing individual project's recruitment and dissemination efforts. Further,
the resource center will provide trainees with an expanded collegial network to
other faculty, mentors, affiliated IGERT partner institutions and current and
alumni IGERT trainees. Finally it will provide a centralized, searchable,
content rich, online resource for IGERT industry partners, stakeholders, policy
makers and the public at large to learn from innovative graduate education
programs that bridge disciplinary and institutional boundaries.
