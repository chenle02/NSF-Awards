The objective of the research is the development of new methods for jointly
analyzing cryoelectron microscopy (EM) and solution x-ray scattering data in
order to determine the 3D structure of spherical viruses. Research in this area
is timely because improved microscopes and cryo EM techniques are increasing the
flow of images while synchrotrons and associated low-angle scattering beam lines
allow the measurement of qualitatively superior solution x-ray scattering data.
The joint use of both types of data is a natural approach because of
compensating strengths and weaknesses. For instance, cryo EM images depend on
unknown orientation parameters while solution x-ray scattering data does not.
There are two major themes that extend through the work: a new model for the
scattering density of the particle and a unified way of combining the model with
all of the experimental data in order to reconstruct the particle. The purpose
of the model is to precisely and concisely describe the particle. In particular,
the proposed model enforces the finite real-space extent of the particle, allows
more than one type of symmetry to exist with an individual particle, has few
parameters, and is mathematically simple in both real and reciprocal space.
