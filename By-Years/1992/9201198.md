This award is made by the Office of Special Projects in the Chemistry Division
under the Materials Synthesis and Processing Initiative. Structurally
homogeneous poly(3-alkylthiophenes) and poly(3-alkylpyrroles) will be prepared
using principles of self-assembly through inter- and intramolecular hydrogen
bonding. Structural homogeneity will limit defects in the polymers and enhance
electrical conductivity. Oligomers will also be made in order to provide
information about the effect of molecular structure on electronic and photonic
properties and the likely environments needed for self-assembly in the related
polymers. Molecular mechanics and band structure calculations will be used as a
guide to polymer design. %%% Synthesis of well-defined, homogeneously structured
conducting polymers will provide materials with enhanced optical and electronic
properties as well as provide low-defect materials which would address
fundamental transport mechanisms in conducting polymers.
