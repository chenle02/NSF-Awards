This a Research Initiation Award dealing with the impact of load, exciter, and
transformer models on the simulation of voltage collapse dynamics. This research
is expected to identify and predict conditions under which voltage instabilities
are likely to occur and to develop control actions to rectify unsuitable voltage
profiles.
