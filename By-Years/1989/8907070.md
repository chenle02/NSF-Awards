Field problems pervade a broad spectrum of engineering applications, including
oil exploration; engine, aircraft, ship, and automobile design; thermodynamic,
nuclear, and chemical- processing systems; electromagnetic field applications;
and others. The goal of the Center is to enhance the capability of computational
simulation and solution of geometrically-complex, large-scale physical field
problems for engineering design and applications. Such problems demand at least
a thousandfold increase in computational speed. This magnitude of increase will
require integration of progress in the fields of algorithms, grid generation,
architectures, and graphics. It is this integration that will be the unique
strengths of the Center.
