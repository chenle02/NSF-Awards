This effort supports a workshop that brings together a group of atmospheric
chemistry researchers from universities, government laboratories, and private
research institutes, to promote awareness within the international community of
scientific research to improve the understanding of emissions from open biomass
burning around the world. This activity is part of the Interdisciplinary Biomass
Burning Initiative (IBBI) sponsored by the International Global Atmospheric
Chemistry (IGAC) Project.

The goals of the workshop are to (1) bring awareness to the international
biomass burning community of upcoming US-led field campaigns to study wildfires;
(2) Identify ways in which the international community can apply the methods and
results from US wildfire studies to other regions; (3) Identify existing
observational databases on wildfires that can be analyzed as part of a larger
synthesis effort; and (4) Determine ways in which the US led field campaigns can
contribute to improvements in the models and observations of fire behavior and
the links between wildfires, air quality, and climate change. The workshop will
also provide an opportunity for young scientists to meet, network, and exchange
ideas with leaders in the field of atmospheric sciences.
