- 9603570 Stamps This award provides partial support for ten young United States
scientists to attend the 25th International Ethological Conference (IEC) to held
in Vienna, Austria from August 20-27, 1997. The IEC attracts scientists from
over 40 nations, and it is the only international gathering that brings together
scientists interested in all aspects of animal behavior. In addition, since its
inception nearly 50 years ago, the IEC has fostered links between animal
behavior and related disciplines. Indeed, a major theme of the Vienna conference
is identifying and forging connections between traditional fields in animal
behavior (e.g. sensory mechanisms, behavioral ecology, development), and related
fields, including neurobiology, endocrinology, conservation and evolutionary
biology. Over the years, previous NSF travel awards to the IEC have gone to 111
young investigators, many of whom have subsequently become leaders in the field.
The IEC is enriched by the participation of outstanding young investigators at
the outset of their careers, while colleagues and potential collaborators from
around the.world.
