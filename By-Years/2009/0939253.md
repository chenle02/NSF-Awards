This proposal requests funding to support an exploratory workshop On Integrating
Digital Library Content with Computational Tools and Services to bring together
a cross-disciplinary group of researchers and stakeholders to examine the
promise of combining cutting-edge high performance computing analytic tools and
services with digital library content. It will bring together a cross-
disciplinary group from several distinct communities including o content
scholars who wish to more fully exploit the content of digital libraries and
similar repositories of digital materials o content providers who wish to
provide extended mechanisms for users in order to manipulate and analyze digital
materials o software developers and administrators o researchers engaged in new
tool development The workshop has been accepted as an official full-day workshop
of the 2009 ACM/IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL 2009)
