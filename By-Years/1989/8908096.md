The analytical potential of mass spectrometry for analysis of proteins,
peptides and glycoproteins will be extended by development of improved
electrospray ionization sources. The ion focusing methods, crucial for high
sensitivity in the electrospray ionization atmospheric pressure source, will be
refined and the critical operating parameters studied. Fundamental aspects of
electrospray ionization of various biomolecules will be investigated with
emphasis on the multiple charging proteins, peptides and glycoproteins.
Recognizing the important practical effect of extending the molecular weight
range accessible by quadrupole mass spectrometry, the multiple charging
phenomena will be investigated to gain an understanding of its nature, and
ultimately, to control and optimize the charge distribution. Fundamental aspects
of collisionally induced dissociation of the uniquely fragile multiply charged
ions produced in electrospray ionization will be explored for tandem MS/MS
experiments, particularly for application to high sensitivity primary sequence
determination of peptides. Methods for "nano-scale" sample handling, isolation,
enzymatic digestion, injection and analysis will be evaluated for a variety of
reference proteins, peptides and glycoproteins and in applied studies.
