Many behaviors are the output of a complicated web of interactions in the brain.
Some of these behaviors, such as mate choice, have important consequences, yet
our understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying this critical behavior is
remarkably minimal. This project will use molecular techniques to explore the
neural control of mate preference behavior by examining where in the brain
specific genes associated with preference behavior are expressed, and whether
behavior can be manipulated by manipulating gene expression. The research tests
specific hypotheses drawn from recent work by the PI that identified candidate
genes for female preference behavior in a classic mate choice system (the
swordtail fish). Using pharmacological, molecular and neurobiological
techniques, the investigator will test whether these genes (i) are directly
involved in mediating preference response, (ii) are expressed in a neural
pathway distinct from other social neural behavior networks, and (iii) account
for inter-individual and inter-specific variation in female preference behavior.
The expected outcome of this research will include the first functional test of
candidate gene influence on preference behavior, elucidation of the neural
circuitry governing preference behavior, and the first mechanistic comparison of
choice versus coercion mating systems. The results of this research will shed
light on the dynamic control of social interactions with the opposite sex by the
vertebrate brain. Such research is a fundamental first step in understanding the
influence of genes on human behavior, and will likely be a catalyst for further
studies in human. The project also represents a major advancement in the field
of animal behavior and sexual selection. The research is at the forefront of
sexual selection studies by identifying potential molecular and neural targets
for sexual selection. The project will also provide broad educational impacts
through the integration of results into an undergraduate course in Animal
Behavior.
