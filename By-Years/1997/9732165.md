9731265 Smith Anchorage Museum of History and Art will used this planning award
to develop the script, identify artifacts, and do other preliminary planning
activities for and exhibit "Lifting the Fog: Exploration of the North Pacific,
1728 - 1867." The exhibit will be a 5000 to 6000 sq. ft. presentation that will
give visitors insights into the scientific discoveries made in the North Pacific
during the Russian era of dominance of this area. These Russian lead voyages,
which included individuals from a number of European countries, made major
findings in biology, hydrography, marine science and technology, geography and
cartography, and ethnography. With this planning grant, they will bring together
a group of museum professionals representing a diversity of approaches including
hands-on science museums, scientists, and historian of science, formal
educators, native Alaskans, and an evaluator to refine the plans. Project staff
will draft the concept design, draft the label text, develop the specifications
for the exhibit design, and develop the catalogue, among other activities. At
the end of the twelve month planing period they will have refined their exhibit
theme, developed their floor plan and concept design, developed plans for the
interactive and hands-on activities, developed the interpretative labels and
laid plans for the complementary activities including the catalogue, a
curriculum plan, and other adjunct activities such as workshops demonstrating
how scientific investigation was carried out in the 19th century.
