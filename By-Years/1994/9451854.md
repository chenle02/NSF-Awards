The focus of this project is to improve the methods of digital data acquisition
and presentation capabilities available to the students involved in
undergraduate programs. At least one faculty member has current experience with
each of the instruments being used and the project integrates interdisciplinary
approaches to undergraduate archaeological education. Also, techniques being
utilized are at the cutting edge of archaeological research. Data acquisition
instruments are linked together so that data and results can be transmitted and
displayed over systems networks. Students completing their undergraduate
programs and using modern technology are competent professional archaeologists
when they graduate, and are prepared to attend graduate school or to work as
contract archaeologists.
