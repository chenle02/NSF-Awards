This project is attempting to speed up computer arithemtic by several orders of
magnitude using a combination of algorithmic, circuit, and packaging techniques.
CAD tools to automate the application of these techniques are also being
developed under the project. Specific research problems include the development
of a package capable of passing large numbers of signals with 100 picosecond
rise times, and the integration of wave pipelined data paths into an overall
system.
