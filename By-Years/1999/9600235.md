9600235 Ehrlich This proposal is a request for funds for a conference on
"Calcium and Cell Function", to be held this summer. It will focus on the
biochemistry, molecular biology, structure/function, and physiology of calcium
as a molecule that affects all primary biological cellular activities. This
meeting will bring together a diverse group of scientists working an all phases
of calcium and its role in cell function. This is a long standing conference
focusing entirely on calcium and covers the sprectrum of calcium research. The
format and location of the meeting encourage discussion and interaction among
the participants and the meeting will serve as a stimulus to future research.
