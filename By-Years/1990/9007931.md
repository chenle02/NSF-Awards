This award provides funds for the purchase of a computer to be use in the
analysis of data generated by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometry in
the study of the structure of proteins in solution. Determination of the three
dimensional structure of biopolymers such as proteins and nucleic acids, and its
relationship to the biological function of the polymers, is a central problem in
modern biology. Many investigators now see the use of NMR as a highly promising
approach to studies of the native structure of a variety of biomolecules.
However, further refinement of experimental techniques and the analytical tools
needed for interpretation of the spectroscopic data is central to progress in
the application of this powerful approach. Crucial to this has been the
development of advanced, high frequency NMR spectrometers and the availability
of powerful, relatively inexpensive computers able to handle the extensive and
complex calculations that are needed for the interpretation task.
