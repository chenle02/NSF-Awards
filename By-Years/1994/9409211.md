9409211 Molian This is an Engineering Research Deployment Teaching Initiation
award. Under this award, course materials will be developed to introduce the
laser processing of materials into mechanical engineering undergraduate and
graduate courses through laboratory and recitation. This will include the
teaching of recent research results, the preparation of laboratory exercises,
providing hands- on training in carrying out experiments, and videotaping the
research. This project should prepare undergraduate and graduate students for
the scientific and technical environment of the future by incorporating the
recent innovations of laser processing technology.
