The project deals with program synthesis, the derivation of a program to meet a
given specification. While the specification describes the conditions the
desired program is to satisfy, the program itself describes a detailed method
for meeting those conditions. The benefit of this research is to make the
programming process easier and less subject to error. The method is based on a
deductive approach, in which the problem of deriving a program is regarded as
one of proving a mathematical theorem. The theorem expresses the existence of an
object meeting the specified conditions. The proof is restricted to be
sufficiently constructive to indicate a method for finding the desired output.
That method becomes the basis for a program, which is extracted from the proof.
The emphasis of the work has been on automating as much as possible of the
program derivation process. In particular, theorem-proving methods particularly
well-suited to the program synthesis application have been developed. An
experimental interactive program-derivation system is being implemented. Current
research topics included developing a more automatic theorem prover, modifying
already constructed programs, and controlling the efficiency of derived
programs.
