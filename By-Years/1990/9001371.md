This project describes a basic research program focused on the design and
analysis of robust and H- infinity optimal feedback systems. This research
program has four major components: multivariable robust stability and
stabilization problems, H-infinity optimal control of finite and infinite-
dimensional systems, analysis and design of nonlinear time- varying controllers
for robust control of linear time- invariant systems, controller design for
multiple performance functionals. To account for possible uncertainties in
system models, both parametric and unstructured uncertainty in plant models will
be considered. Optimal design in the H-infinity norm is considered to provide
robustness against uncertainty in the spectra of the exogenous signals or
unstructured dynamic modeling uncertainty. It is also a key step in design for
robust performance in the presence of unstructured uncertainty. The emphasis is
on the development of computationally efficient algorithms for controller
design. For this purpose, all high-level algorithms will be developed in terms
state-space realizations, real or complex matrix algebraic equations, etc. It is
expected that most of the algorithms will be implementable on a variety of
computers ranging from engineering workstations to mainframe computers.
