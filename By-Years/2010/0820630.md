The study of the role of science and technology in the conquest of the Russian
Arctic under Soviet power has great significance for historians of science and
technology, environmental historians, scientists, social scientists and policy
makers. It is timely given the ongoing third International Polar Year and
President Vladimir Putin's recent claims to the North Pole and a large part of
the Arctic Ocean. It will shed light on questions of empire and science, center-
periphery relations, and the tension between universal science and local
knowledge. Specifically, it will contribute significantly to understanding how
politics, economics and ideology shaped Soviet science and technology. The
following questions will be addressed in this project: To what extent did the
Communist officials and scientists share goals and understandings of what
science was and how best to support it? How did Marxism, science and technology
combine to create the urban, industrial effort to transform the far north? What
were Soviet conceptions of nature, the north, and indigenous peoples? How do
modern science and technology serve empire building? These questions are all
facets to the following unifying question: How did Soviet military, economic and
political desiderata shape arctic science and technology? The project will
result in several publications of great interest not only to historians but to
policy makers. Several of the publications will deal with "Continuity and
Change: Russian Science and Politics in the Arctic in the Twenty-first Century."
Archival materials, interviews, and various publications will be consulted in
analysis of the founding of the research and development apparatus in the north,
the construction of cities and industries connected with them, and the
establishment of such fields of science as hydrology and hydrography,
meteorology, forestry, and metallurgy.
