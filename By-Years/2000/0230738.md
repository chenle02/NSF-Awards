Despite extensive research in techniques, protocols and technology, progress in
providing usable and widely deployed teleconferencing applications has been
limited. Commercial products are limited to small groups, or to unidirectional,
non-interactive, streaming. Research oriented systems, such as the Access Grid,
support larger groups and more flexible communication patterns, but have very
limited support for high quality video formats and are fragile due to their
reliance on old technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The resulting system will
greatly exceed current implementations in terms of quality, robustness and
consistent operation; yet it can be developed primarily as an exercise in
systems integration. It will facilitate wide area collaborative research and
information sharing, improve reliability and performance of networked
conferencing, and forma solid basic for the future development of more advanced
systems and technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will build a video
teleconferencing tool to enable large-scale, flexible and ad-hoc collaboration.
This tool will be structured to act as a building block for the development of
future applications. It will be built on previous work with high quality video
and robust networked audio, and integrate the results of research into
teleconferencing systems architecture with modern, high resolution, video
capture and display devices.
