Interest in the solid state sciences has undergone explosive growth in recent
years due to the broadly based recognition of the technological importance and
scientific challenges involved in the discovery and study of new materials, and
due to the influx of scientists from other disciplines into various areas of
materials research and development. The 2001 Electron Distribution &amp;
Chemical Bonding Gordon Research Conference will explore the nature of chemical
bonding as the glue that holds atoms together and also gives materials most of
their properties. The goal of the conference is to facilitate international
collaborations and information exchange across a broad spectrum of researchers
with interests in solid state science and materials research and development.
The NSF funds will be used to support the attendance of graduate students,
postdoctoral scholars, and junior faculty. &lt;br/&gt;%%% &lt;br/&gt;The
materials research and development community continues to have direct impact on
technological advances of high significance to society by designing,
synthesizing and characterizing new materials such as magnetic, electronic, and
biomolecular materials. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
