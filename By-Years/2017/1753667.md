This project will address a compelling need for training of professionals in
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in communication with
general audiences. It is aligned with the NSF Agency Priority Goal to improve
STEM graduate student preparedness for the workforce. Four regionally based
five-day workshops (GradSciComm Institutes) will be held over two years. The
institutes are intended to challenge STEM graduate students and their faculty
mentors to communicate clearly and effectively with constituencies outside of
academe. The first institute will be held at University of North Carolina at
Charlotte and the other three will be awarded on a competitive basis to other
institutions throughout the U.S. Each regional Institute will be a starting
point for more permanent and expansive STEM communication with the public.

During each week-long Institute, STEM doctoral students and their faculty
mentors will participate in a series of interactive plenaries and small group
breakout sessions. Each session will build on evidence-based techniques for
improving oral communication and presentation skills. Participants will gain
improved skills for (1) engaging diverse audiences, (2) identifying and applying
traits of successful presenters, (3) using stories and analogies to explain
research outcomes and illustrate unfamiliar concepts, (4) organizing
presentations around core messages and big ideas, and (5) designing impactful
visuals and graphics. Presentations will be organized around core research
messages. Post-institute activities will include instructional webinars led by
communications experts and a virtual three-minute thesis competition judged by
middle school students. Each regional Institute will provide the basis for
ongoing training beyond the two-year funding of the grant.
