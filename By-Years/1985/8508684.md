This research involves a theoretical and experimental study of the problem of
allocating certain applications to a distributed system environment in order to
exploit application and system parallelism for maximum computational speed up to
the application. The applications considered are related to real-time
applications (flight simulator) and the solution of partial differential
equations. The distributed system architectures considered can be classified
according to their interconnecting network as: multiprocessor systems with
shared bus configurations; Processing Element to Processing Element
configurations; and Processing Element to Memory configurations. The proposed
solution approach to the optimal allocation problem involves the modeling of the
application and the distributed system, and the mapping between the application
and the system. The objective of this investigation is the development of a
design tool that may be used to predict the performance of
application/distributed system pairs.
