This proposal will investigate the role of solar wind (magnetosheath) plasma
under low-beta and sub-nominal solar wind Alfvén Mach number (&lt;3) conditions.
The magnetosphere under these conditions is frequently called an Alfvén Wing
magnetosphere. The research will use the Coupled Magnetosphere-Ionosphere-
Thermosphere (CMIT) model which includes the Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry (LFM) MHD model
coupled with the Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation
Model (TIE_GCM) along with solar wind (OMNI), magnetosheath (Cluster and
Geotail) and ionospheric (AMPERE and SuperDARN) data to investigate the effects
of solar wind pressure, ionospheric conductivity and dipolar tilt on the
transport of open magnetic flux and field aligned current generation in the
polar cap. By examining the data and carrying out simulations for this newly
discovered state of the magnetosphere they will determine how the configuration
and dynamics of the lobes are controlled by Mach number and plasma beta, how the
beta and Mach number control field aligned currents and flow and how important
the dipole tilt is for the polar cap configuration and dynamics. &lt;br/&gt;This
proposal will support a young scientist. It has relevance to space weather.
