Biologists have long argued that individuals avoid extreme inbreeding in order
to reduce the probability of producing genetically inferior offspring through
inbreeding depression. Support for this argument is scarce, since only for
humans and certain plants is there unequivocal evidence from the same species
for both the avoidance of extreme inbreeding and inbreeding depression. Black-
tailed prairie dogs living under natural conditions in South Dakota avoid
extreme inbreeding by four different mechanisms, but preliminary evidence from
19 inbred litters indicates that there is no inbreeding depression. Research to
further investigate the apparent lack of inbreeding depression among wild
prairie dogs is proposed. Infanticide as well as communal nursing has been
observed nearly simultaneously in this species. Similar communal nursing has
been observed in only a handful of mammalian species, and never before in a
rodent living under natural conditions. Research to further investigate the
shift from attempted infanticide to communal nursing in prairie dogs is
proposed.
