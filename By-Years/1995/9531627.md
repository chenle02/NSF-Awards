9531627 Kalka This REU site award provides support for eight undergraduate
researchers in mathematics. The site focuses on providing a research experience
for upper level undergraduates in geometry and topology within a seminar
setting. Research projects in the areas of scalar curvature, Reidemeister
torsion in geometric topology, harmonic forms, and complex dynamics are being
offered within the context of an overall seminar program involving the students
in basic study of geometry and topology. The program will run for eight weeks.
