This award will permit the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to manage
activities of its Numerical Data Advisory Board (NDAB), a standing board of the
National Research Council, for the 12-month period from July 1, 1988 through
June 30, 1989. NDAB's activities focus on numerical data for the scientific and
technical disciplines (physics, chemistry, and engineering), for space- and
time-dependent disciplines (the geosciences and biosciences), and for
interdisciplinary and sociotechnical fields (resources, energy, and
environment). NDAB provides the United States' formal mechanism to interact with
CODATA (the Committee on Data for Science and Technology), which is a part of
ICSU (the International Council of Scientific Unions). Through the NAS, the
National Science Foundation supports U.S. membership and participation in both
CODATA and ICSU. In consideration of the merit of NDAB as a way of improving the
quality, reliability, accessiblity, dissemination, informed use, and management
of scientific data to meet the present and future needs of the scientific and
technological community, and of the highly satisfactory management of U.S.
participation in CODATA and in ICSU overall through the NAS, the program manager
recommends an award.
