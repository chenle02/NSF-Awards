This project investigates web querying techniques for accessing web information
resources. The term information resource refers to large web-accessible
resources such as the ACM Digital Library. We propose a semantics-based way of
accessing a web information resource: extract metadata about topics and
relationships from the web resource, extend the metadata with "importance
scores", and query it from a database. The query language is extended with
constructs (a) to propagate importance scores to the query output to rank query
output, and (b) to define "stopping conditions" to reduce query evaluation
times. For some query requests, the metadata in the database may not be
sufficient to answer queries. Our research direction is to locate more
informative query answers by mixing database querying with "focused crawling" in
the web information resource, at the algebraic operator level of SQL queries.
These queries allow time constraints, and relax the closed world assumption,
making it necessary to redefine the notion of well-defined queries. Data
extraction techniques will be employed to extract metadata. Variations of our
basic approach that do not require direct database query engine changes will be
evaluated. Standalone web applications will be developed, and made available.
