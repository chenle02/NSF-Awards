9500279 Lomatch The objectives of this grant are to study conventional and novel
superconducting digital flux quantum devices employing the relatively young
technology of multilayer Josephson junctions with n superconductor-insulator
(SI) layers. The work involves the extensive numerical modeling of multilayer
junction and device behavior. This program will draw from the results of
previous computational and experimental studies, which took place during the
period covered by an NSF Research Planning Grant. A primary focus of the
proposed research will be the numerical simulation of flux quantum circuitry in
which multilayer junctions both serve as nonlinear kinetic inductors (passive
devices) to increase circuit integration density, and as single trilayer
junction replacements (active devices) to allow for new logic/voltage
thresholds, novel device designs, device fault tolerance, and resistance to
thermal noise. The goal will be to optimize circuit designs to maximize
parameter variation tolerances, and to include realistic considerations such as
crosstalk and parasitic capacitance's and inductances so that one may produce
lithographic masks suitable for the fabrication of test prototypes. Conventional
digital devices, such as select logic and memory circuitry, will be considered
for optimum geometry and performance. the unique operational features offered by
flux quantum circuitry due to the natural integration of local memory and
processing are further exploited by multilayer junction technology, so several
novel devices will be analyzed, particularly in the area of neural-based
computing and semiconductor interfacing. If superconducting digital circuitry is
to achieve the integration density that its low power dissipation allows, and if
it is to compete with room temperature semiconducting digital circuitry in more
than a few small niche applications, then work such as the proposed here must be
pursued. ***
