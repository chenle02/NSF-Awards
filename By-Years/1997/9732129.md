The project is for a one year study to explore the physics of topographically-
induced turbulence impinging on a free-surface, and to explore the feasibility
of surface detection of bottom topography in a variety of circumstances. The PI
will perform a Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) with a free-surface for flows in
four scenarios: 1) a single polynomial hill, 2) two-dimensional sinusoidal
topography, 3) three-dimensional sinusoidal topography, and 4) a channel and
shoal configuration. The numerical output will be analyzed to investigate
patterns of stress and advection on the surface which may be used to identify
underlying topography.
