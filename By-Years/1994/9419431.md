The focus of this research is to elaborate the mechanism and utility of the Gif
system for the specific functionalization of saturated hydrocarbons. The nature
of intermediates and the possible role of radicals in the reaction mechanism
will be probed using chemical and spectroscopic methods. With this award, the
Synthetic Organic program is supporting the research of Dr. Derek H. R. Barton
of the Department of Chemistry at Texas A &amp; M university. Professor Barton
will focus his work on the selective functionalization of saturated hydrocarbons
using an iron based catalyst known as the Gif system. The methodology has
potential for a large number of industrial applications.
