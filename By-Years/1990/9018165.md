One goal of research in aeronomy is to be able to determine the properties of
various regions of the upper atmosphere from ground-based measurements of
airglow emission lines. The principal investigators involved in this work have
made significant progress towards this goal through their past work in
determining thermospheric composition, temperature, and incident EUV flux from
ground-based measurements of twilight airglow lines; however much remains to be
done to solve the complex theoretical modelling and data acquisition problems
involved. The proposed work is a carefully planned continuation of research
aimed at advancing towards the goal. Development of models relating to
attainable ground based airglow measurements will continue, with corroborative
support from satellite measurements. The models developed will be upgraded and
made user friendly for use by the CEDAR spectroscopy community. The models will
further be modified and improved to incorporate incoherent radar or ionosonde
measurements, and to extend their range to a global scope. ***
