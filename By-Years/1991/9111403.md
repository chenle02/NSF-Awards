The purpose of this proposal is to establish a framework needed to model
Holocene archaeological sites in Arctic Alaska in relation to global and
regional climate patterns. Subfossil wood from archaeological sites, living
trees and driftwood collected in the Kobuk River area in northwestern will be
used to extend tree-ring data back to 1000-2000 BP. This dendrochronological
data can be used to reconstruct past climate patterns and date archaeological
sites. The results of this project will significantly expand the understanding
of the chronology of cultural development and human adaptation in the western
Arctic, and contribute to an understanding of global climate change.
