An experimental investigation of the quantum dynamical processes for two-state
atoms strongly coupled to an optical cavity is to be undertaken. The objectives
of the research are to explore the spectroscopy of the atom-cavity system as a
reflection of underlying quantum structure, to record the photon statistics as a
probe of quantum state reduction and quantum coherence for an open quantum
system, to observe the response of the atom-cavity system when driven by
squeezed light to study fundamental modifications of radiative processes for
coupling to phase-sensitive reservoirs, to make measurements of quantum
switching and of new quantum phase transitions for an understanding of global
quantum coherence in a dissipative setting, and to generate squeezed light by
the normal modes of the coupled atom-cavity system for the resolution of
previous discrepancies and for spectroscopic applications.
