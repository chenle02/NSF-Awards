National Science Foundation&lt;br/&gt;CAREER: Understanding Cellular and
Molecular Mechanics with Nano-/Micro-technology&lt;br/&gt;Philip
LeDuc&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The traditional
boundaries between engineering and the life sciences are rapidly disintegrating
as interdisciplinary research teams develop new engineering tools for further
exploring fundamental questions in medicine and biology. This fusion promises to
uncover complex cell interactions by linking molecular function to cellular
behavior in the area of mechanics. Recent advances in nanotechnology are
enabling experiments on individual cells and molecules to test the hypothesis
that intracellular structural deformation in mammalian cells is locally
controlled by mechanical perturbations through the response of sub-cellular
domains. The broader impact of these studies is hoped to benefit society through
ultimately leading to the development of treatments for pathological conditions
in which cellular mechanics and structure are believed to play an important
role: heart disease, osteoporosis, and cancer. The technical merit of this
proposal will focus on determining the link between molecular interactions and
cell structure by identifying unique structural function and behavior.
