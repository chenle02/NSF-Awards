This project, in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, will explore the
thermodynamics of Lewis acid-base interactions of polyfunctional hosts with
monofunctional guests. Interactions of both acidic and basic hosts will be
examined. Solvent effects on reactions involving neutral reactants will be
explored using a linear free energy relationship model developed by the
principal investigators. The enthalpies and entropies determined for these
systems will be compared with those of reactions of similar monofunctional
hosts. Techniques to be utilized in these investigations are calorimetry and
multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. %%% The Lewis acid-base model, in which an
electron pair donor reacts with an electron pair acceptor, is one of the most
useful in accounting for the regiochemistry of a wide variety of chemical
reactions. Thermochemical data, such as that to be obtained in this work, have
great predictive value for the behavior of related acids and bases.
