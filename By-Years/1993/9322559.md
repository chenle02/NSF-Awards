9322559 Meyer Johns Hopkins University An international collaboration between
Dr. Gerald J. Meyer, Johns Hopkins University and Dr. Carlo A. Bignozzi,
University of Ferrara, Italy, to develop new techniques for light-to-electricity
conversion is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic
Chemistry Program and the Division of International Programs. Nanostructured
photoanodes using sol-gel processing and novel charge mediating coordination
complexes will be prepared. The resulting cells will be characterized and their
operating mechanism will be determined. The limiting steps and undesirable
reactions which occur in these systems will be evaluated and utilized to
optimize their long term performance. The attachment of transition metal
complexes, which will transfer charge when exposed to light, to high surface
area oxide electrodes offers an opportunity to improve the efficiency of
photoelectric cells. In this project new methods for preparing the requisite
metal-oxides and new types of metal compounds for light induced charge transfer
will be developed at Johns Hopkins and Ferrara Universities, respectively. The
two will be combined into new photoelectric devices whose properties will be
evaluated and optimized at Johns Hopkins.
