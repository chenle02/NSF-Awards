A new application for object recognition, indexing image sets in digital
libraries, demands recognition strategies that are (1) effective in cluttered
scenes and (2) effective for objects recognised at a class level - for example,
people or animals. These needs can be met by recognition algorithms that
interpret the world in terms of stylised properties in shape, shading, texture
and colour, which are caled 'primitives.' In this approach, objects are
represented by a collection of spatial relationships between primitives. The
primitives themselves are used as a source of grouping constraints. Recognition
proceeds by grouping together features or regions that could represent a
primitive, and then assembling groups of primitives that could have come from an
object. There is no explicit 3D reasoning, but the grouping processes may
contain a great deal of implicit 3D reasoning. This approach to shape and to
recognition unites themes studied in active research programs in computer
vision, both in the United States and in the European Community. A joint
workshop, involving both US and E.C. participants (for whom E.C. funding will be
available), will explore representations that use grouping and symmetry as a
recognition strategy. Topics will include: shading primitives, image shape
constraints that result from volumetric primitives, building grouping-based
representations and overall strategies for object recognition. The workshop will
be held in Erice, Sicily, in early 1998. The proceedings will be published as a
volume in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.
