The proposal is to help defray the expenses of participants in the Summer
Symposium in Real Analysis XXXII that will take place June 10-14, 2008, Chicago
State University, IL. This conference has occurred annually since 1978, twice in
1982, and is considered to be the premier conference of its type by members of
the real analysis community. Support will be provided to participants who do not
currently hold NSF awards, with possible exceptions allowed for plenary
speakers. Much of the funding will be directed to graduate students, postdocs,
and junior faculty, but some senior faculty may be funded as well.
