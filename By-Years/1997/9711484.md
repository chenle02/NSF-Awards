9711484 Foley The PI's will develop new methods and models to evaluate the
potential for vegetation feedbacks on the climate system. In particular, they
plan to couple IBIS, and integrated dynamical biosphere model, to the NCAR
Climate system Model (CSM). Using the dynamically coupled CSM/IBIS climate-
vegetation model, they will then explore vegetation feedback mechanisms and
their potential role in future climate scenarios. The development and evaluation
of these new coupled models will provide a more holistic frame work for
preforming integrated analyses of global environmental change. Most importantly
this work will help elucidate the potential role of vegetation feedbacks on the
climate system, and the impact of transient climate change on the terrestrial
biosphere. Attempts at an integrated assessment of global change must consider
the possibility of substantial biospheric feedbacks on the climate system. This
research is funded under the NSF methods and Models for Integrated Assessment
initiatives.
