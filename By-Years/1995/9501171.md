9501171 Candela Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and other techniques will be
used to study the propagation of diffusing and dispersing particle and waves in
three types of system. The first consists of spin-polarized quantum fluids in
random porous media. For example, pure 3He liquid and 3He-4He mixtures in the
pores of bead packs and silica aerogel will be polarized by an 8 - 10 T magnetic
files and cooled below 10 mK to study the mixture phase diagram, quantum
localization effect, and interference and localization of spin waves. The second
system is fluids in porous media at room temperature. Pulsed-field-gradient NMR
will be used to study the geometric structure of the pore space, and to study
trace dispersion in an applied flow over a wide range of Peclet numbers.
Finally, nonlinear waves will be studied both in polarized quantum fluids and in
a room-temperature water-wave experiment to test the applicability of the
inverse spectral transform to physical systems. %%% The objective of this
project is to better understand the propagation of particles and waves in
complex physical systems that have a random structure. Nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) will be used to study the motions of molecules in fluids filling
the pores of materials like fine powders, silica gels, and natural rock. The
studies will take place both at very low temperature, where quantum effects will
dominate, and at room temperature, where classical behavior is found. The low
temperature studies will test theories relevant to the propagation of electrons
in metals and semiconductors. The room temperature work will develop new methods
for studying the structure of porous materials, and will test theories
concerning the dispersion of tracers by fluid flow. Nonlinear waves will also be
studied in a sub-project geared toward engaging undergraduate students in resear
