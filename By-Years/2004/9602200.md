Since the mid-1980s, industrial R&D has been going through major changes,
including a decline in industrial R&D expenditures and restructuring of
centralized corporate R&D laboratories. With these changes have come changes in
the models used to describe and explain the relationship between corporate goals
and industrial science. Formerly, corporate R&D managers and analysts viewed
economic gains as a by-product of research, under an autonomous model.
Currently, a new linkage model of corporate R&D, which directly links research
to the needs of business divisions of the company, is being put into practice.
These developments bring new relevance to the following two questions: How does
restructuring in corporate R&D affect scientists? How are scientists
accommodating changes brought by restructuring? This project proposes to study
both questions by conducting interviews with approximately 96 subjects: 80
scientists and 16 managers working in 8 corporate R&D labs that have recently
experienced restructuring. The focus in the investigation would be three aspects
of the impact of restructuring on scientists: research conditions, research
types, and research environments. This research has theoretical and practical
relevance. It will show the strengths and limitations of the existing literature
on industrial research scientists by presenting scientists' understanding of
their careers and the ways in which they are affected by structural and
organizational changes. It will identify key features of the new research
culture and values evolving in corporate R&D to which scientists have to adjust.
By considering these factors in relationship to the autonomous and linkage
models, a new partnership model may be proposed that can address concerns and
issues overlooked by both the other models.
