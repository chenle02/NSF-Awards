This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
Informatics for fiscal year 2002. The fellowship supports research and training
at the postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
these fellowships will play important roles in training the future workforce.

The title of the research and training plan is "Investigation of factors
influencing large-scale ecological and evolutionary patterns among Caribbean
Anolis lizards." The research investigates macroecological patterns of body
size, abundance, and character displacement in Caribbean Anolis lizards from a
phylogenetic perspective. It integrates phylogenetic information on
approximately 140 species, morphological data from specimens in museum
collections from nearly 7,000 study sites, and landscape data from Geographic
Information Systems (GIS) to examine factors influencing the diversification of
these lizards.
