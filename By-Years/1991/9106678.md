This award will support the research of Professor William H. Press, one
postdoctoral fellow, and partial support for a graduate student, in the areas of
cosmology, theoretical astrophysics, and computational theoretical physics, at
Harvard University. Continuing investigations by this group include: three-
dimensional computer simulations of fundamental fields that have been proposed
as causing observed large scale structure; the theoretical development of future
experimental and observational tests that might find, or rule out, additional
scalar fields in gravity; the question of whether there are "natural" initial
conditions for cosmological perturbations; some aspects of signal processing,
e.g., for gravitational wave and dark matter experiments; computational
algorithm development; and some other related problems.
