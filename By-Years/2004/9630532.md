9630532 Kana The process of denitrification (Biological conversion of nitrate to
nitrogen gas) is a major mechanism for removing dissolved nitrate from water.
Nitrate contamination of surface and ground waters is a growing problem
worldwide. This project uses a new technique of high precision gas analysis to
study denitrification in riverine and estuarine sediments. Advantages of the new
method, developed by the principal investigators, include accurate and
unambiguous measurement of the end product of denitrification and rapid and
inexpensive analysis of samples. The research ill evaluate the effects of
environmental factors including temperature, nutrient concentrations, and
sediment structure on the denitrification process. This project will work
towards a better understanding of the relative importance of denitrification as
a removal mechanism for nitrogen nutrient loading in rivers and estuaries. This
proposal was submitted to the Environmental Geochemistry and Biogeochemistry
solicitation NSF 96-2. The project described is being jointly supported by the
Divisions of Earth Sciences, Environmental Biology, and International Programs.
