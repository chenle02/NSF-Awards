A number of theoretical problems involving the control of coherent matter
sources in a QED cavity are proposed. Non-linear mixing of optical and matter
waves will be used to study processes having strong analogies to those in laser
fields. The PI has tailored many of these problems to the needs and training of
physics students at his RUI institution.
