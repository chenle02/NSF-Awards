The California State Board of Education in collaboration with The California
State University is attempting to bring about large-scale changes in grades 7-12
science education in the state by implementing the NSTA Scope, Sequence, and
Coordination model. Under a grant from the U.S. Department of Education, 100
middle and secondary schools in California have already received planning grants
to begin this project to replace the traditional "layer cake" approach to the
teaching of biology, chemistry, and physics with a "spaced" approach which
spreads the teaching of the sciences over six years and which moves the emphasis
on teaching from the concrete to the abstract over this period of time. Cost
sharing of $276,619 is 14% of the NSF contribution to this project.
