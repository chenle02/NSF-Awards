1126793&lt;br/&gt;Choutapalli&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed state of-the-art
stereoscopic PIV equipment will serve as an essential research tool and improved
measurement capability because it: a) permits detailed study of the three
dimensional velocity field for a variety of jet flow conditions; b) provides
more accurate turbulence flow field data as compared to 2D PIV measurements; c)
facilitates higher spatial and temporal resolution of the flow field; d) can
integrate readily into the existing laboratory infrastructure and hence provide
valuable information that can facilitate application-oriented development of
flow control technologies; e) facilitates the acquisition of experimental data
needed to elucidate fundamental physics and facilitates the development of an
experimental database for computations; and f) serves as a shared resource for
departments within the university as well as other universities, research
organizations, and industry. The acquisition of the stereoscopic PIV system will
therefore yield rich fundamental flow physics knowledge leading to
transformative research and hence transformative technologies in the field of
flow control.
