The proposed research covers a broad spectrum of problems and ideas reaching
from abstract harmonic analysis on symmetric spaces, geometry, and infinite
dimensional analogues, to classical questions in abelian harmonic analysis. The
basic subject of the proposed research is harmonic analysis on symmetric spaces
G/H which connects analysis, group theory (symmetry) and geometry. The project
includes holomorphic extension of H-spherical distributions, applications of
intertwining operators and evaluations of their spectrum, analysis on infinite
dimensional spaces, representation theory and G-invariant Banach spaces of
functions. The physical parts include reflection positivity and transfer
operators. This work combines methods and ideas from several areas of
mathematics: complex analysis, group actions on complex manifolds, classical
harmonic analysis, applied mathematics, and quantum &#64257;eld theory.

Harmonic analysis and representation theory are two central subjects of
mathematics and play an important role in pure and applied mathematics as well
as theoretical physics. Well known examples of applications are tomography and
signal analysis, but the proposed research deals with more abstract and
fundamental questions. The proposal is related to several parts of mathematics,
both pure and applied, and includes several connections to physics, in
particular quantum field theory in form of reflection positivity, and applied
sciences. The research involves wide spectrum of collaboration including
graduate students and a network of other researchers in the USA, Mexico, and
Europe.
