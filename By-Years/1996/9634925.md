9634925 Fridley Wood structures are subject to sustained dead and live loads,
and the creep response of the wood under sustained loads tends to increase
deflections over time. The transverse deflections in wood beam-columns will
likewise increase under sustained load due to creep, thus increasing secondary
moments. Creep has long been acknowledged as a factor which must be considered
in the design of wood structures; however, the effect of creep on the combined
load behavior of wood members has not been studied adequately nor has the effect
been included in design equations. The objectives of this research, are to (1)
experimentally evaluate and model the effect of creep on the combined load
behavior of structural wood members, (2) evaluate the subsequent effect on
member reliability, and (3) propose factors for use in design equations to
account for such behavior. ***
