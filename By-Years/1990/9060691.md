Laser technicians are currently trained by about 25 programs situated in
Community Colleges across the United States. The students are goal-oriented and
practical with a modest background in mathematics and science. Curricula usually
consist of a nearly equal mix of laboratory experiments and class room lectures.
In general, Laser Electro Optical Technology (LEOT) students seem to be similar
to the students who take algebra-based physics at college. Beginning Physics
students have and finds that they confuse important concepts such as position
and velocity or velocity and acceleration. Additional work shows that there is
also confusion regarding optical systems. The concepts taught in the LEOT
programs are similar to, but more complex than, those covered in a algebra-based
physics course. They are further obscured by the difficulty the students have
with the mathematical computations. No work has been conducted to identify
conceptual difficulties in the LEOT area nor to devise practical approaches to
overcoming them. It is quite evident that they must exist and that they limit
the student's understanding of the material just as they do in the physics
curriculum. Oregon Laser consultants proposes to study ways in which computer
based ray trace program and spread sheets can be incorporated into the current
LEOT curricula to model the concepts that cause these difficulties.
