This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
Informatics for FY2001. The fellowship supports research and training at the
postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "From genome to
gene expression: Mapping and understanding genetic networks in Dictyostelium
development." Upon starvation, Dictyostelium amoeba communicate, sort, and
adhere to each other to form ``tissues''. This transformation, resulting in a
resistant spore, utilizes all the mechanisms crucial for normal development of
multicellular organisms. Promoters, repressors, and the architecture of genetic
networks involved in development in Dictyostelium are being explored using both
genomic and gene expression data and mathematical modeling.
