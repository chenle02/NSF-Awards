The College of Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences at Oregon State University
proposes to continue its program of mentoring and research participation for
Native American undergraduate students. The objective of this program is to
increase the number of American Indian and Native Alaskan undergraduates who
complete degrees in science, continue their studies in graduate school, and
enter the scientific work force. This program has been successful in seeing
twenty five students through their baccalaureate degrees. Funds are requested to
support twenty students each year during the course of the award period.
