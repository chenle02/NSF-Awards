This project matches the "at risk" population of Head Start and its staff with
the expertise of the Hands On Science Outreach (HOSO) program in producing
playful units of lesson guides, manipulative kits and teacher training. Working
with mathematics consultants, three units (fall, winter and spring) have been
designated around NUMERATION, CHANCE AND GEOMETRY. The activities in the program
will be multi-cultural, multi-sensory and will focus around toys and games which
the children will be able to take home and own. They will take into
consideration the development of both large and small motor skills. There will
be clear indications for interdisciplinary classroom use. Parent information
will be available in English, Spanish, and Vietnamese, with a visual videotape
component and meetings planned into the project. These should help apply home
continuity for the relevancy of mathematics concepts to everyday activities. The
MATHSTART units will be piloted, evaluated and refined in five demographically
different Head Start programs in Maryland. After refinement, further
dissemination will occur through both the Head Start and HOSO networks.
