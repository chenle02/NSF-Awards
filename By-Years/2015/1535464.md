The PI studies the geometric Langlands program and its applications to
arithmetic geometry. The PI will investigate the geometry and the cohomology of
the special fibers of Shimura varieties by applying method coming from geometric
representation theory, and investigate the possible relations between the
characters appearing in the cohomology and the hypothetical 'character sheaves'
for p-adic groups. The PI will also explore the possible relation between
geometric Langlands program in positive characteristic and the mod p Langlands
program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Langlands Program is among the most important
mathematical frameworks of our time. It is an attempt to unify many different
areas of mathematics, such as representation theory and number theory. The
traditional arithmetic Langlands program, which is directly related to numbers,
has developed more than fifty years and the early development has found
significant applications in solving classical diophantine equations (e.g.
Fermat's last theorem). The geometric Langlands program, which is a relatively
new, is under rapid development, thanks to powerful tools from algebraic
geometry. The two parts of the Langlands program share a lot of similarities and
techniques, while there seems no direct connection between them before. The PI
will try to make some direct connections between them and try to apply some
geometric methods to study some more arithmetic problems.
