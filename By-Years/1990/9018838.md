This research involves a collaborative effort of four universities to use the
PASSCAL portable broad-band seismometer array facility for a comprehensive
imaging study of the lateral transitions in mantle structure beneath the Rocky
Mountain Front. The Front Range of the Colorado Rockies marks the eastern
boundary of heavily tectonized western North America and the western
physiographic boundary of the stable continental interior. Earlier studies show
that there is a major lateral transition in seismic velocities across the Front
Range transition, but its details are poorly understood. Understanding this
transition will provide constraints on models of western U.S. dynamics and
evolutionary models of the North American craton.
