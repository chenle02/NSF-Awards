This project is significantly enhancing available software infrastructure, the
graphical models toolkit (GMTK), for graphical-model based time series modeling.
While GMTK is currently widely used for speech recognition, the extensions being
performed, however, are optimized not just for speech recognition but for all
time-series applications. New infrastructure is also being developed that
significantly enhances GMTK?s abilities, speed, documentation, source code
availability, and pedagogical structure. This work will give to both the student
and the researcher an enormous number of dynamic graphical model facilities.
With its new features, GMTK will be able to perform computationally difficult
time-series processing on extremely large and diverse data sets.
