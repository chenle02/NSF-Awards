The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to develop a new technique to unfold
wrongly folded proteins and to refold them to their native and active
conformations. The technique involves the formation of clathrate hydrates in
protein-containing solutions with low concentrations of denaturants. Hydrate
formation in such solutions opens up the possibility of an in-situ control of
denaturant concentration by converting part of the aqueous phase to a solid
crystalline form. The desired objective is to unfold proteins by forming
hydrates and thus increasing denaturant levels, and subsequently refold these
proteins correctly by dissociating hydrates and thus reducing denaturant levels.
This research is exploratory in its nature, and is based on a well-known
technology directed towards a completely new application.
