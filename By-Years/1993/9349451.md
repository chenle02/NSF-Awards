continues to investigate the determinants and consequences of soil organic
matter (SOM) in the humid tropics. Main activities consist of 1) determining the
relative effects of soil texture and clay mineralogy on total SOM content, 2)
estimating the size of different SOM functional pools, 3) relating their N and P
supplying capacity to texture and mineralogy, 4) determing the relative
importance of physical protection, chemical recalcitrance and nutrient
availability on the SOM pools, and 5) quantifying the effects of different land
use practices on SOM pools. The CENTURY model will be modified for use in
tropical conditions. The results will provide a deeper understanding of organic
matter dynamics in soils with variable charge which will serve as a base for
improved agricultural sustainability in the humid tropics and more realistic
estimates of CO 2 emissions to the atmosphere upon deforestation. ***
