ABSTRACT This proposal is to fund innovative exploratory research on the
general link between heat transfer, dynamic characteristics, and failure modes
of mechanical components. The work is related to frictional heating in sliding
solid surfaces with deforming contacts. A thermohydrodynamic analysis will be
carried out to establish the relevant heat transfer mechanisms. The effects of
separation of the friction material will be determined. The proposed work could
lead to enhanced understanding of the fundamental issues relevant to problems
that occur at the interface of heat transfer and tribology.
