The principal investigator will support graduate students working on problems
in the theory of random walk and in asymptotic likelihood theory. One problem
will be to find a relationship between the size of the largest step of a random
walk and the recurrence of the random walk. Another will be to try to extend the
asymptotic likelihood theory of Hoffman- Jorgensen to nonparametric and
semiparametric problems. This award provides support for graduate students. The
award will help develop the infrastructure of basic mathematical research in the
area of statistics and probability.
