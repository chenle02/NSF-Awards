9626880 Smirnov This project deals with harmonic analysis on symmetric spaces
and Radon transforms. In particular, the investigator plans to study those
symplectic structures appearing as Radon transforms on the space of hyperplanes.
Geometric probability theory and Crofton's integral formula are also to be
considered as they relate to Radon transforms. The idea behind Radon transforms
is to reconstruct a geometric object - e.g., a convex body in space - from its
sectional data or slices. This field has received a great deal of attention
recently due to its applications in computerized tomography and medical scanning
devices.
