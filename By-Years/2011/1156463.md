This project provides student travel support for the IEEE International
Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP)held in Vancouver, Canada on Oct 17-19,
2011. The project allows a selected set of US students interested in network
protocols to travel to this conference and benefit from the talks and other
events. ICNP is a premier conference in this area and exposure to students of
cutting edge research is essential.
