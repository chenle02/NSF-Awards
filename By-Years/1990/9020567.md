Anthropologists have long been interested by the history of human populations.
South Pacific populations have been a problem area in terms of developing a
consensus about the migrations of people into the area - the timing of
migrations, the relationships between populations, the rates of evolutionary
change and the like. With the advent of recombinant DNA technology, there are
potentials for new approaches to these long-standing problems. Stoneking
proposes to isolate various components of the DNA from several hundred humans
representing four broad areas - New Guinea, Australia, Indonesia and Samoa. Data
on DNA sequences and hybridization with oligonucleotide probes will allow the
comparisons of these groups at the genetic level. With the use of statistical
and computer techniques, it will be possible to clarify the relationships
between the groups and thus help to resolve the peopling of the South Pacific.
Both mitochondrial (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA will be analyzed. A particularly
interesting aspect will be Stoneking's analysis of variable sequences on the Y
chromosome. Mitochondrial DNA is inherited through the maternal line while Y
chromosomes are passed through the paternal line. As much debate exists
regarding interpretations of mtDNA evolution, this data will allow especially
interesting investigations.
