Observations indicate that 80% of the matter in the Universe is not made of
normal atoms, but must be otherwise undetected elementary "dark matter"
particles that don't emit or absorb light. Remarkably, particle physics theories
proposed for other reasons predict the existence of weakly interacting massive
particles (WIMPs) with just the right properties to be this dark matter. If
WIMPs are the dark matter, they may be detectable when they scatter in Earth-
based detectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide funding for this
Syracuse group to collaborate on the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (now
SuperCDMS) that has a track record as one of the world's most sensitive. The PI
will lead his group to achieve better rejection of surface interactions and
identify neutrons that multiply scatter within a detector, aided by detailed
simulations of the detector response. The group will help develop and construct
a detector to veto events caused by neutrons and measure the expected neutron
background in SuperCDMS. The group will take part in SuperCDMS detector testing,
including making key contributions to a unique deep facility, demonstrating the
rejection capabilities of new detectors and providing critical feedback for
detector fabrication and development. The long-term activities include
additional cryogenic detector research, focusing on technologies that allow
easier manufacturing and the possibility of a single cost-effective experiment
to detect both dark matter and neutrinoless double-beta
decay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Technological development of
phonon-mediated detectors has widespread applications in astronomy and physics.
The project will help train undergraduates, graduates, and postdocs in a
multidisciplinary field using techniques at the leading edge of measurement
technologies with applications in areas of societal interest.
