This research will study electrodynamics near surfaces with the goal of further
fundamental understanding and contact with experiments. The primary effort will
be on the linear response of surfaces to an applied field by making use of the
d- parameter formalism. A wider range of frequencies will be studied, and
various paths away from jellium models will be developed so that effects of
discrete atomic structure can be incorporated into the model. The resulting
theory will be applied to systems ranging from simple metals to multiple quantum
wells. A parallel effort will be made to transfer the model developed to
nonlinear response properties such as second harmonic generation at surfaces of
cubic materials.
