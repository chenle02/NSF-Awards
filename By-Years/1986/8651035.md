Bucknell University will significantly improve the Computer Science Department's
ability to provide an environment for student and faculty/student projects by
purchasing a micro-computer based system running UNIX. The system consists of a
Sun Microsystems 3/160S server and three Sun 3/50M workstations, together with a
large disk and other peripherals. This equipment will be used in a project
involving students and faculty to develop a Virtual Machine Operating
Environment (VMOE). The VMOE will be used in core courses as the basis for
examples, by students in project-based elective courses and for independent
student projects where the interactions of hardware and system software is the
crucial issue. The system will be transportable to other institutions wishing to
take advantage of the instructional benefits of the VMOE.
