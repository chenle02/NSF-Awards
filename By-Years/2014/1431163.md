As digital evidence becomes increasingly important in criminal and civil
litigation, and as concerns about personal privacy and the sharing of digital
information by both public and private sector entities increase, a clear need is
emerging to create a code of professional ethics that would govern the
activities of digital forensics practitioners. To this end, the PI will organize
a conference that will provide an opportunity for attendees to familiarize
themselves with ethical issues relating to the practice of digital forensics and
to begin the process of developing an overarching, consensus-based, code of
professional ethics for digital forensics practitioners similar to what the
legal, research and medical organizations have created. Subjects to be addressed
include Digital Forensic Investigations, Social and Behavioral Sciences,
Jurisprudence, and Education and Awareness. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to
resulting in a plan for designing, implementing, and enforcing a code of ethics,
the proceedings of the conference would be published and thus made available to
scholars and practitioners in the field, while media coverage of the event will
provide information to informed citizens concerned about ethical issues in
digital forensics and its practice.
