The teleprogramming system, developed under the current grant from the NSF,
provides the capability of performing manipulative tasks in remote, time-
delayed, environments, such as undersea and in space. The teleprogramming system
provides for a symbolic communications link between a virtual reality master
station and a remote slave robot. This effort continues the research on
teleprogramming, to complete the system by including: automatic synthetic
fixturing; model acquisition; providing for the use of fasteners and tools;
reactive slave motions and task input. This research is being conducted in
conjunction with the Laboratoire d'Automatique et d'Analyse des Systemes of the
Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique of France; in France the
concentration is on higher-level task input to the system. We will also work
with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and with IFREMER to prepare for a
sea test of the system.//
