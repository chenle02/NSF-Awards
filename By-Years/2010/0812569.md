Theoretical psychology has not, until recently, been in position to have much to
say about how humans learn in dynamic, multidegree-of-freedom manual control
domains. While applied concerns have led to successful training programs for
manual control tasks (e.g., most people learn to steer automobiles in reasonable
time), we currently lack the ability to predict how well people will do in these
domains or how rapidly they will learn. This limits our ability to train people
in these domains, where we presently rely on expensive one-on-one tutoring or
similar intensive methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project studies human
performance and acquisition of sensorimotor tasks in real and virtual
environments. Human motion data and performance of various skills by high
performers and low performers, who exhibit linear performance gains, will be
analyzed and compared to data for subjects who rapidly acquire skill and exhibit
nonlinear performance gains. This data will inform the development of more
accurate models of sensorimotor skill acquisition that can be expressed in
ACT-R, and doing this should lead to improved understanding of training methods
in human motor learning domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
