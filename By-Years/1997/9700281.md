The main focus of this project is to provide an updated, revised and expanded
Penn World Table (PWT) data set of economic aggregates that is consistent across
time and space for over 150 countries for the whole post World War II period,
known as Penn World Table. This continuing effort is built upon the framework of
the detailed benchmark purchasing power parity studies organized on a regional
basis through the United Nations. To prepare this large Table , it is necessary
to combine the regional benchmarks for the latest benchmark year, 1993, into a
world comparison for the 100 odd countries that are expected to participate. The
results of previous world comparisons will then be integrated with the 1993
benchmark to provide the base for estimating values for non-benchmark countries,
and the base for moving estimates of all countries backward and forward in time.
This project also includes the addition of some variables in PWT proper, as well
as the inclusion of subsidiary price and expenditure from the benchmark
comparisons that researchers will be more readily accessible by. Software will
be provided with the benchmark data that will help researchers make comparisons
between any pair of benchmark countries that may be of interest. It is also
planned to develop a spatial measure of consumption and add it to the PWT data
set. This spatial consumption measure will also be designed on an experimental
basis to provide interarea comparisons within a few large and geographically
diverse countries. The wide use of these data,, the extensive country
participation in the benchmark studies, and the continued focus on international
income comparisons in conferences and journals demonstrate the importance of the
PWT to the research community.
