Proposal: ESI IMD-97-30206 Submitting Institution: Swarthmore College Principal
Investigator: Weimar Proposal Title: Pages of Math abstract: This project
develops an on-line learning guide covering mathematics taught in grades K-12
(except Calculus) as reflected in the evolving standards promoted by the NCTM
and others. This curriculum resource grows out of and extends projects of the
Math Forum such as Ask Dr. Math in which users interact with mathematicians and
these interactions are achieved as a resource for others to use. The project
exploits features on the WWW that enable independent exploration for remedial
and advanced work, takes advantage of opportunities for non-linear learning,
provides access to multiple approaches for problem solving, and involves users
in the continuing development process. In this proof-of-concept phase, the PI
will develop and test the hypertext environment by providing different voices
that can be accessed and used to present several key perspectives that maintain
their integrity but enable the user to pursue an investigation matching his or
her needs and interests. Cost sharing is 6%.
