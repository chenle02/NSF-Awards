The principal investigator will continue her studies of hydrodynamic and
hydromagnetic waves of the type that occur in the earth's core. In particular,
she will use eigenfunction analysis of the partial differential equations that
describe oscillations in stratified, rotating, electrically conducting fluids
and Hamiltonian techniques to study the stability of three-dimensional
magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium states. The behavior of fluids inside of the
earth is a very complicated problem whose solution involves the combined efforts
of experimentalists and theoreticians. Essentially both groups study simplified
models that regard the earth as a rotating ball of stratified, electrically
conducting fluid inside of a magnetic field. The principal investigator is a
theoretician who will investigate among other topics whether certain equilibrium
states are stable to outside perturbations. Her work has relevance in geophysics
and in the study of earthquakes.
