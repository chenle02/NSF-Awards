This project develop a new course, Problem Solving for Computer Science. This
course is not a computer literacy course and is not an introductory programming
course. It addresses problem solving skills, knowledge of computer organization.
and computer usage skills required for the study of computer science. The intent
of this course is to increase the retention of students who might otherwise be
excluded from pursuing the study of computer science. The success of this
approach could have a wide impact on undergraduate computer science education.
With the development of an appropriate textbook and other course materials, this
approach could be implemented in virtually any college or university computer
science program as it requires no modification to established courses in
computer science. The accompanying discrete mathematics course is already a
standard requirement of computer science programs. The project seeks to:1.
identify students who are likely to be unsuccessful in introductory computer
science, 2. design a course which addresses the skills these students lack, 3.
implement this new course, and4. evaluate the value of this course in increasing
the success rate of students who take it.
