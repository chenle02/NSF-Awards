This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation on the R/V
Point Sur, a 135? general purpose Regional research vessel. The vessel is
operated by Moss Landing Marine Labs as part of the University-National
Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. The request includes
three items listed by priority:

1) SBE Compact Carousel w/5 liter Niskin bottles and 9plus CTD 2) C-Star
Transmissometer 3) Ultrasonic Anemometers

Broader Impacts: The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use
instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab
access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost
of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.
