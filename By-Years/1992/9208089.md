This award provides funds to support the participation of research scientists
and graduate students in a workshop on numerical long-range (10-30 days) weather
prediction. The workshop represents a follow-on to a very successful one which
was held three years ago. The workshop participants will examine ongoing issues
of model behavior and systematic errors, the scale and frequency of
interactions, the importance of boundary conditions. They will also consider
recent results on the structure and dynamics of long-lived weather phenomena and
associated wether regime transitions. The organizers hope to identify the most
pressing of the outstanding problem areas in long-range weather forecasting.
This award is jointly supported by NOAA and NSF.
