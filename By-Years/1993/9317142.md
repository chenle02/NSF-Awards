9317142 Gans Since the advent of plate tectonics, earth scientists have
increasingly emphasized the importance of the lateral growth of continental
crust by the processes of terrane accretion and magmatic arc development. The
Cordilleran orogen of North America is one of the prime examples of such crustal
growth, and the Alaskan portion of this belt is considered to have been
constructed almost entirely by the process of terrane accretion. This study will
undertake an ambitious geological and geophysical transect across the
northernmost portion of the Cordilleran orogen in the Bering-Chukchi region of
the Arctic, between mainland Alaska and Russia. The main goals of the research
are to provide us with greater insight into the details of the creation,
evolution and modification of the crust beneath Cordilleran-style oroginic
belts, to give us a better understanding of the coupling between tectonic and
petrologic processes at deep and shallow crustal levels, and to help us
determine the general links between processes at the scale of the crust and
those at the plate tectonic scale. The project is a collaborative effort by
researchers at Stanford (Miller and Klemperer), Rice (Wright), UC Santa Barbara
(Gans), and Western Washington (Engebretson). The project also involves
scientists from the USGS Branches of Pacific Marine Geology (Scholl, Childs), of
Alaskan Geology (Grantz, Moore), and of Seismology (Brocher), and three well-
known Russian scientists from Khabarovsk (B. Natal'in), Yakutsk (L. Parfenov)
and Magadan (M. Gelman). ***
