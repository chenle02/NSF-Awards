Susquehanna University requested ;matching funds to acquire a Hewlett Packard
Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectral detector (GC/MS) with an accompanying computer-
based data station. The Chemistry Department introduces its students to "hands
on" use of modern instruments throughout their four year program. Mass
spectrometry is the only form of spectroscopy that is taught in depth at
Susquehanna for which there is no "hands on" experience in the laboratory. The
Chemistry Department used this instrument to introduce the principles and
techniques of mass spectrometry and capillary column gas chromatography into the
laboratory curriculum at a number of levels. Starting in the freshman year, the
chemistry and biochemistry majors in doing specials projects outside of the
classroom and lab, used the instrument to analyze for triazines in ground and
surface waters in the surrounding agriculture community. the GC/MS was used in
five courses as well as in the senior research program and the triazine study.
The students acquired much broader knowledge of the use of computer based
instrumentation especially in the area of mass spectrometry and entered industry
and graduate school better prepared to use modern computer controlled
instruments.
