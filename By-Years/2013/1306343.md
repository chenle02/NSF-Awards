A novel class of ultra-precise atomic clocks based on highly-charged ions will
be developed. Such clocks hold an intriguing promise of extending the frontiers
of precision measurements. Atomic clocks have both practical (navigation,
geodesy, and network synchronization) and fundamental applications.
Additionally, advanced tools of computational atomic physics will be used to
establish powerful constraints on postulated, but so-far undiscovered exotic
interactions related to dark matter and dark forces. Such constraints are unique
and at the same time complementary to those derived from particle colliders,
such as LHC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be carried out in Nevada,
one of the EPSCoR (Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research)
states, underrepresented in the scientific enterprize. This fulfills one of the
strategic goals of the NSF to 'broaden participation and enhance diversity in
NSF programs'; research and education of a graduate student partially supported
with the goal of 'advancing discovery and understanding while promoting
teaching, training, and learning'. The findings will be disseminated through
publications in scientific journals, conference presentations, and the Internet.
