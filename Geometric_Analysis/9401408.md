9401408 Kuperberg(K) The research involves the study of topological dynamics on
3-maifolds. The PI has already made a remarkable contribution to the subject by
solving a problem concerned with the existence of trajectories on 3 dimensional
manifolds. The current scope of research entails applying the techniques to
higher dimensions and to other cases as described in the project description.
Results in this direction would have very significant consequences to dynamical
systems, differential topology and mathematical physics. ***
