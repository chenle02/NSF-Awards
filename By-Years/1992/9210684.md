The focus of this project is the development of a mathematical model for cell
adhesion. This project will extend present models by incorporating the transient
processes that occur during cell adhesion into the model. The investigator will
obtain analytical and numerical solutions for a variety of cell adhesion
problems including spontaneous growth of adhesion area, forcible separation of
adherent cells, and adhesion and separation under the condition of flow. The
researcher also will conduct a systematic parametric analysis on model variables
and validate the model by comparison of the results of experimental outcomes.
This project is important since the results should help in designing and
improving adhesion-dependent biomedical and bioprocessing devices. The
mathematical structure that will be used, the moving boundary problem, is needed
to understand other processes, such as deposition, melting, solidification, and
cell motility, and therefore this research should advance the methodology needed
to study a broad range of engineering problems.
