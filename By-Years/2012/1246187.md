Research Computing has been a leader in deploying data movement services to
research groups at the University of Colorado Boulder such as Globus Online on a
separate network, the RC-DMZ, which is dedicated to high-performance
applications and research data transfers. This project implements significant
improvements to the RC-DMZ in order to increase the manageability, reliability
and bandwidth. This has become necessary driven by the large amount of research
in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) that is highly data
intensive, with observational and simulation data collections in the tens or
hundreds of terabytes (TB), and soon growing to petabytes (PB). The recent
"Campus Bridging" task force report also demonstrates the need for continued
investment in campus networking capabilities. The upgrades to the RC-DMZ
include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Physical separation between commodity and
research traffic through two new border routers&lt;br/&gt;* Improved network
design by adding redundancy and bandwidth improvement to 20 Gigabit&lt;br/&gt;*
Active, integrated performance measurements&lt;br/&gt;* Security and traffic
monitoring&lt;br/&gt;* Experimental software defined / OpenFlow
Networking&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Improving the existing RC-DMZ is a collaboration
between Research Computing (RC), the departments of Computer Science (CS),
Physics, Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology (MCDB), the National Snow
and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), and the Office of Information Technology (OIT) in
consultation with other departments and institutes. The network improvements
enable better data sharing, and improved access to local, regional and national
computational and data resources for all of CU Boulder's researchers.
