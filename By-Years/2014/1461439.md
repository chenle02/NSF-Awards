A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the
science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and
research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the
Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these
institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging,
rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that
may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational
appreciation for science and mathematics education. This project aligns directly
with that goal, and moreover will enhance the Nation?s knowledge of the impact
of providing relevant STEM instruction on recruiting and retaining
underrepresented individuals into STEM studies, and preparing the next
generation of STEM professionals. For those students entering the workforce
directly from the college, it is important that they have a well-defined skill
set in mathematics, science, and technology for entry into the STEM workforce.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;University of Hawaii-West Oahu will develop math and
science courses sufficient to offer middle and secondary math and science
education concentration and a BS in applied math, and develop a peer-tutoring
program. The curriculum improvements will be developed with attention to
inquiry- and place-based instruction, local tradition and culture, and
indigenous knowledge.
