Environmental monitoring has traditionally been limited by sensors that are very
constrained in their information-gathering capacities and that acquire data only
at a relatively small number of distinct, widely-separated locations. This
severly limits the ability to characterize an environment, to then model it, and
to subsequently provide accurate information for policy decisions relating to
its management. The Networked Infomechanical Systems (NIMS) program introduces a
revolutionary new class of mobile distributed sensors that are networked both
physically by infrastructure and electronically to enable monitoring and
interaction with the full three-dimensional environments in which biological and
other systems exist. NIMS sensors measure changes in the environment,
autonomously move to locations of particular interest, collaborate to exploit
diverse sensing modalities (imagery, acoustic, chemical and meteorological,
etc.) in the detection and characterization of events, and learn from the
collective experience of the network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With members from the
University of California, Los Angeles, Merced, and Riverside, and the University
of Southern California, the NIMS team brings information technology experts in
computer science, information theory, robotics, signal processing, and networked
embedded computing together with biologists and public health specialists. The
initial demonstration applications of NIMS will focus on 1) monitoring of global
change indicators in a mountain riparian stream canyon and 2) detection of
biological pathogens in coastal waters and urban rivers. However, the techniques
being developed apply across an extremely wide range of environments and
applications and have the potental to broadly impact science, policy, and
national security. The NIMS program also enables an engaging, explorative Grade
6-8 science instruction program with both hands-on science and remote network
access to NIMS.&lt;br/&gt;
