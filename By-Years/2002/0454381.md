Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Program: NSF 04-588 CISE Computing Research
Infrastructure&lt;br/&gt;Title: CRI: DEter Cyber Community of Researchers

&lt;br/&gt;This project will expand the DEter testbed to enable improving its
usefulness for science research, conducting larger experiments, and expanding
the research and education community that can access it. DEter is a shared
laboratory for researchers from academia, government and industry to experiment
with cyber security technologies under realistic conditions. The testbed
provides tools and resources that enable repeatable experiments and comparisons
of approaches. DEter has strong security, contained experiments and usage
policies for its use in research on computer network attack and defense
mechanisms. Broader impacts of the project include improvements in cybersecurity
for computing and critical infrastructure. Educational impacts will also follow
from the use of DEter in hands-on projects at colleges and
universities.&lt;br/&gt;
