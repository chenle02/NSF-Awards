This EAGER award will develop and demonstrate new simulation optimization
algorithms that integrate methods of analysis, experimental design, and modeling
to exploit the many unique characteristics of simulated systems. Current
simulation experiments are almost indistinguishable from conventional real-
system experiments. They take little or no advantage of the fact that in a
computer experiment everything is controllable. Unlike conventional "blackbox"
experimental designs, where different scenarios are applied to distinct
experimental units, simulations can simultaneously run many scenarios on the
same processor. The basic concept is to have competing simulated systems "race"
rather than the current approach of running them sequentially (usually each on a
single processor). The foundation for this research is that simulation codes are
"clear boxes", at least to their creators. One not only can look inside this
box, they can reach inside and change it while the simulation experiments are
running.

Simulations impact almost all aspects of modern society to help optimize system
designs and policies. Problems that warrant simulation projects are typically
high-impact and pressing. Preliminary (ad-hoc) integrated simulation
experiment/models prior to this research include one involving emergency
inventories of biopharmaceuticals to make their supply chains more robust to
sudden disruptions (like earthquakes). This indicates that integrated simulation
model/experiments can be considerably more efficient than conventional
experimental designs run on simulations. This allows exploring many more
options, ultimately leading to more informed decision making.
