This pilot project will develop and test one interactive multimedia courseware
module on social, ethical, and professional issues that arise from computing
technology, and develop detailed plans for two other modules. The first module
will highlight the history of computer ethics, consider how the meaning of the
term has changed over the last two decades and compare this field with other
branches of applied ethics, explore important concepts such as privacy and
responsibility, and include scenarios that add interest and reality to the
concepts. The two planned stacks will focus on issues of professional
responsibility, and issues of access and equity for persons with disabilities.
Multimedia "HyperCard stacks" combine video clips, sound bites, graphics and
text. The first stack will be tested by classroom teachers and by students in
interactive independent study. It will be disseminated at cost to universities
and scholars that request it; and demonstrations will be presented at national
conferences and workshops. The stack will serve as a prototype for high quality,
cost effective, state-of-the-art curriculum materials on computing and human
values.
