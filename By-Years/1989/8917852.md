The Marquette University College of Engineering will establish a broad-based
educational opportunity program to attract undergraduate minority students to
engineering, to retain them in engineering programs through degree completion,
and to prepare them for research careers. The Research Careers for Minority
Scholars program will rely on the College's strong academic programs in
Biomedical, Civil, Mechanical, Industrial, Electrical and Computer Engineering;
its quality faculty; its state-of-the-art facilities; its partnership with
industry; and its tradition in successfully training minority students. The
College will select 16 outstanding minority scholars over the four-year grant
period to participate in a program that combines academic-year course work,
research project work, and 10-week summer enrichment programs. The enrichment
activities are designed to establish a successful transition for freshmen
students, to promote a long-term interest in engineering, and to immerse
students in engineering research. As its key components, the program provides
financial assistance; nurtures academic success and personal growth through
mentorship, role model, and advising programs; offers unique opportunities for
developing independent research skills through project work in academic and
industrial settings; fosters a personal identification with the engineering
profession; and offers the encouragement, preparation, and assistance necessary
to enter programs of graduate study.
