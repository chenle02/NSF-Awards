9629268 Wallace Stream Ecosystem Response to Decoupling Terrestrial-Aquatic
Linkages This project involves wood removal and continued leaf exclusion from a
headwater stream. During the last 3 years, leaf exclusion from a 180 meter reach
of stream has resulted in decreased animal production, shifts to alternative
foods, increased relative importance of algae, increased export of small organic
and inorganic particles, less within stream dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
generation, and longer nutrient uptake lengths compared to a stream with normal
inputs of leaves. Some results were unexpected, such as greater microbial
activity on inorganic substrates and wood and no decrease in either organic
matter quality or nutrient export. Microbial biofilms, growing on the surfaces
of wood and inorganic substrates, and increased algal growth are now important
nutrient sinks in the leaf exclusion stream. Wood remains a conspicuous and
prevalent form of terrestrially derived organic matter. This project will
continue leaf exclusion and remove small (year 1) and large wood (year 3) to
reduce: a) metabolically active microbial biofilms on wood, b) physical
stability of the stream, c) particle and nutrient retention, and d) a large but
refractory (wood) terrestrial input. The two stage manipulation allows the
investigators to distinguish the food resource role and structural role of wood
in streams. This long-term, ecosystem-level manipulation on this detritus-based
food web will improve general understanding of the role of important terrestrial
linkages to the structure and function of stream ecosystems.
