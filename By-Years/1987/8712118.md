The chemistry of aromatic compounds represents one of the oldest areas of
organic chemistry. Dr. Hart's recent work has revealed a new facet of this
field, the ability to design aromatic compounds that will form solid state
complexes with special classes of compounds. This project is in the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program. Two separate research areas will be
investigated. Each is a continuation and extension of research currently
supported by NSF CHE-8319578. The first area involves new synthetic uses of
diarynes or their equivalents. A new, efficient method for constructing linear
acenes (compounds with an odd or even number of linearly fused six-membered
rings) and their oxygenated analogs will be developed. The method relies on
cycloadditions to novel reactive intermediates, bis-isobenzofurans or their
equivalents. Trapping of the intermediates, which represent new 14pi or 18pi
electron aromatic systems, will be attempted. Diaryne equivalents will also be
used to construct novel iptycenes, a class of compounds with rigid, three-
dimensional carbon frameworks containing hydrophobic intramolecular cavities
capable of binding small molecules. The second area involves new host designs
for crystalline molecular complexes. Based on a design that features a fairly
long, rigid molecular axis with rigid spacer groups at each end,
N,N'-ditritylurea (DTU) was developed as an exceptionally effective host. X-ray
structures of many DTU and DTU-related complexes will be determined, to define
the geometric requirements of such hosts. Emphasis will be placed on developing
chiral hosts, and on the separation of various structural and stereoisomers.
