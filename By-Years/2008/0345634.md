The University of Memphis is hosting a workshop with two major objectives
related to the EarthScope initiative. The primary objective of the workshop is
to develop testable scientific hypotheses to advance our understanding of
lithospheric composition and properties, and the evolution of the North American
continent, far from current plate boundaries. In addition to defining
hypotheses, the workshop will discuss designing experiments to efficiently test
as many hypotheses as possible, focusing on use of USArray. The second objective
is to formulate plans for using EarthScope facilities as a framework to advance
hazard assessment experiments. In addition to providing needed products for the
National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program and other geologic hazards
efforts, this objective recognizes and seeks to exploit significant
opportunities for outreach and logistical support for the deployment of
USArray's transportable array. The workshop is collaborative and coordinated
with the US Geological Survey and the Mid-America Earthquake Center. The
workshop also seeks to identify sources of existing geological and geophysical
data and to outline a strategy for incorporating them into a synoptic database
needed for planning EarthScope deployments and complementing EarthScope data
products. The workshop deliberations are to be made widely available in a
variety of formats. The workshop provides an unusual opportunity for the lay
public and for educators to observe the creative process of scientific inquiry.
Those scientists who cannot attend the workshop will be able to read brief
summaries of the proceedings in articles in widely read professional news
publications (e.g., EOS, Geotimes). These brief articles will serve to advertise
a web-site containing more full recounting of the workshop. The target date for
the workshop itself is 25-27 August 2004. For more information contact Paul
