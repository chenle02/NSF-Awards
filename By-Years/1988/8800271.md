Growing evidence indicates that spatial abilities are directly correlated to
the foraging ecology of a species. There is also evidence that foraging
behaviors which require precise spatial memory, such as food-storing, are
correlated with changes in the relative volume of brain structures. The foraging
behavior, spatial abilities and brain anatomy of three sympatric heteromyid
rodents will be compared. The foraging ranges of these species (Dipodomys
merriami, Perognathus formosus and Chaetodipus fallax) and their patterns of
cache distribution are to be determined over two field seasons in a California
field site. Their ability to complete a series of mazes and to relocate their
food caches using spatial memory will be measured in the laboratory. Finally,
the relative hippocampal volume of each species will be calculated from thin
brain sections. Thus, this study will address the question of spatial ability at
three levels: the underlying basis in morphology, the organization of spatial
ability for different tasks such as finding food and retrieving caches and,
finally, the implication of such differences for the structure of desert
heteromyid communities. The institutional site for this postdoctoral fellowship
project is the University of Pittsburgh.
