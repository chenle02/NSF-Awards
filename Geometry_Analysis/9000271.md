This project is concerned with problems in algebraic K- theory and geometric
analysis. The principal investigator will study the G-theory of group rings of
finite groups. He will study a conjecture of Hambleton, Taylor and Williams for
which he has already established several special cases. He will also work on
determining to what extent the geometry of a Riemannian manifold is determined
by the spectrum of the Laplace operator. This research is concerned with
algebraic K-theory. In a broad sense algebraic K-theory concerns the evolution
of concepts from linear algebra such as basis and vector space. This work has
implications for algebraic geometry and geometric analysis, and promises to make
interesting connections between a number of different areas of mathematics.
