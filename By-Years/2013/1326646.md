This award funds a series of workshops that are designed to mentor young
economists. The overall goal is to broaden participation in economics research
by giving junior scholars from under-represented groups feedback on their
research in progress and help in developing career plans. The DITE (Diversity
for Tenure in Economics) program matches junior scholars with senior faculty
with extensive experience in research. The junior scholars meet with their
mentors each summer to discuss work in progress and receive feedback on their
professional development to date and plans for the coming year. The mentors and
mentees also meet at other scientific conferences during the academic year for
additional discussions about research progress and research plans.
