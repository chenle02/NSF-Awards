The research objective of this award is to use biomedical engineering tools to
assess the properties and responses of biological cells to mechanical forces. In
particular, the characterization of cells that are cultured in suspension,
without a specific attachment surface, will be performed to assess how cells
self-regulate under these conditions. Studies conducted under this award involve
refining techniques for culturing and applying mechanical stimuli to cell
aggregates that are maintained in suspension. Both material properties (e.g.,
how solid-like or fluid-like the cells are; how stiff the cells are) and
molecular responses (e.g., changes in active responses by the cell) will be
examined. Such characteristics will be compared and contrasted to the behavior
of the cells when plated on more conventional substrates to determine the
differences in these two types of culture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful,
these studies will contribute to the knowledge of how cells sense and respond to
physical forces, and additionally provide insight into how normally adherent
cells behave when they are not influenced by a substrate or scaffold. These
results may additionally be useful in engineering tissue constructs with
different properties compared to those constructed using specially-designed
surfaces. The educational plan focuses on multiple paths, including encouraging
undergraduates to become more involved in research projects, as well as public
school outreach, where K-12 students will be introduced to scientific research
and equipment and encouraged to performed exploratory experiments. Both
outreaches will be guided by the topic of the research area of this award. These
initiatives will help foster the understanding of and hopefully, the
appreciation for, contemporary biomedical engineering topics and methods
