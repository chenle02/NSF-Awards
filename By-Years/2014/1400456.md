NSF Postdoctoral Fellowships in Biology combine research and training components
to prepare young scientists for careers in biology and provide them an
opportunity to establish international collaborations and take advantage of
research facilities and opportunities abroad. Forging strong international
collaborations is mutually beneficial to the U.S. and the foreign hosts. This
fellowship to Kevin Kohl supports a research and training plan to investigate
maternal transmission of gut microbes in live-bearing and egg-laying lizards.
The host institution for this fellowship is Universidad Nacional de San Luis in
Argentina, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Enrique Caviedes-Vidal.

Microbes inhabiting the gut play an extremely large role in the ecology and
evolution of animals. It is possible that gut microbes are acquired by newborns
or are maternally transmitted. Most of the evidence for maternal transmission is
from studies in mammals. This research centers on animals who reproduce by eggs
and how gut microbes are acquired by hatchlings. Lizards of the family
Liolaemidae have been selected for study because it contains over 150 species
that exhibit variation in their birth strategies, some are egg laying while
others are live-bearing. The chosen experimental system is ideal for comparing
transmission routes of gut microbes between live-bearing and egg-laying lizards
and the functions of the microbial communities using metagenomics and whole-
animal performance assays. Overall, it is predicted that live birth allows for
greater microbial transmission between mothers and offspring, yielding greater
microbial performance.

Training goals include acquiring expertise in metagenomic sequencing as a tool
for the understanding the functions of whole microbial communities. Educational
activites and public outreach include mentoring undergraduates and maintaining a
video blog to provide updates on research progress and disseminate research
results. The fellowship affords an opportunity to establish an international
collaboration with scientists in Argentia and is funded with the Office of
Integrative and International Activities.
