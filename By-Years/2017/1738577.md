Building on the previous NSF community of practitioners CSMER project, the
College of Education and the Department of Computer Science at the University of
Puerto Rico at Rio Piedras proposes a project to establish the building blocks
of a strong and well-integrated Research-Practitioner Partnership (RPP) that
will foster the integration of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) into the
public schools of Puerto Rico. Specifically, the project will build an RPP to
foster the integration of the Exploring Computer Science (ECS) curriculum in
Spanish in the public school system of Puerto Rico (PR), study a rapid-response
support system for a cultural-linguistic equivalence of ECS curriculum in
Spanish, and pilot the implementation of ECS curricula in at least two high
schools in PR with a high population of Hispanic, female, and economically
disadvantaged students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project--called ECS4PR--will
use a Design Based Implementation Research (DBIR) approach to build on the ECS
professional development model and create a scalable, cultural-linguistic
equivalent implementation of ECS curriculum in Spanish. It will co-design a
strong and well integrated RPP that promotes systemic educational change in
Puerto Rico. Once established, that RPP will construct a curricular adaptation
model of cultural-linguistic equivalence that can guide a scalable
implementation of ECS for a predominantly Hispanic population, and serve as an
example for other cultures and languages underrepresented in the field of
computer science.
