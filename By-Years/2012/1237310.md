The symposium covers all areas of bioinformatics research, ranging from
comparative genomics and population genetics to structure prediction and
protein-protein interaction networks. Accepted extended abstracts will be
published as a volume in the Springer Verlag's Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics
series, while short abstracts will be published online and on CD-ROM. In
addition to contributed abstracts, the technical program will include tutorials,
panel discussions, and poster sessions, and will feature invited keynote talks
by distinguished researchers in the field. Full versions of selected abstracts
presented at the symposium will be invited to peer-reviewed special issues of
IEEE/ ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics and BMC
Bioinformatics. The symposium provides ample opportunities for interaction
between researchers with complementary expertise thus fostering new
collaborations.
