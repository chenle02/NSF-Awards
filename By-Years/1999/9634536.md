9634536 Hennage The "Nonlinear Guided Wave Phenomena" meeting will take place in
Cambridge, England, August 30 - September 1, 1996. This is a Topical Meeting in
the OSA series which alternates between the UK and the USA, being held every 18
months. The subject matter includes: * Solitons (spatial and temporal) and their
applications to signal processing, communications etc. * Fiber and waveguide
lasers * Applications of second order effects (OPOs, doubler, etc.) in
integrated optics and fiber waveguides * Nonlinear optics in semiconductor
lasers and amplifiers and their applications * Third order effects, cascading,
switching devices etc. * Materials for the above applications Funds from NSF
will be used to partially support costs of travel, accommodations, and
registration fees of young American scientists and graduate students in cases
where their attendance at the meeting would not otherwise be possible. ***
