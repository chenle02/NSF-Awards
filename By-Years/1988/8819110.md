They will perform experiments in three areas of superfluid physics. They will
detect a macroscopic quantum interference effect in (3)Helium using the D.C.
Josephson effect. A second project will involve measurements of the quantum of
circulation in (3)Helium. Finally, they will study the properties of the
superfluid (3)Helium film.
