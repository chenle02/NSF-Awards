9503783 Rubin This grant supports research under the NSF program to promote
Research at Undergraduate Institutions. The Principal Investigator and students
participate in a group continuing an experiment at the Brookhaven National
Laboratory. They are collecting data on rare decays of long- lived neutral K
mesons. The results will provide a test of predictions of the Standard Model of
electroweak interactions. ***
