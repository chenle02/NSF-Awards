9412536 Malin This award, jointly funded by the International and the Chemistry
Divisions of NSF, will support a program of Summer Research Fellowships.
Organized by the American Chemical Society (ACS), the program will be under the
supervision of Dr. John Malin of the ACS and Prof. Ernest Eliel of the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Through these summer fellowships,
Latin American chemistry faculty, at the start of their research careers, will
be invited to spend two months on mutually-designed projects at U.S.
institutions. The program will be coordinated with the chemical societies and
scientific academies of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Mexico, with cost sharing
from the research agencies of these countries. Each of the national chemical
societies will recommend up to four candidates per year; approximately six will
be chosen by an ACS panel, with at least one participant from each country per
year of the program. This support will help to develop and strengthen
cooperative research in the chemical sciences by fostering strong, new, and
early interactions between U.S. and Latin American researchers. ***
