Fluid surfaces that deform are ubiquitous in cell and tissue biology as well as
in modeling of emulsions and foams. Computer modeling plays an increasingly
important role in better understanding of processes involving such surfaces as
well as interfacial phenomena. The present project aims to develop accurate and
reliable numerical methods for the simulation of fluidic deformable surfaces and
their interaction with the bulk. Development of such methods will facilitate
understanding the functionality of lipid bilayers, the actin cortex, epithelial
cell sheets, and the properties of other thin structures exhibiting in-plane
viscosity and lateral mobility. The project provides research training for a
graduate student.

The project will consider models of fluids on surfaces. For these, continuum-
based modeling leads to systems of partial differential equations posed on time-
dependent manifolds. For example, lipid membranes are fluidic thin layers that
can be modeled as two-dimensional viscous surface fluids with bending
elasticity. The project will develop and analyze a geometrically unfitted finite
element method for fluid systems posed on deformable surfaces such as surface
Stokes and surface Navier-Stokes equations, tangential fluid equations coupled
with in-plane elasticity and equations governing out-of-plane (geometrical)
motions, as well as interface-bulk coupled fluid systems. The project focus is
on splitting schemes for the resulting coupled systems. The methods build on
formulation of governing equations in terms of tangential differential calculus
and employ time-independent unfitted background meshes. The approach will allow
for implicitly given complex shapes that may undergo topological transitions.
