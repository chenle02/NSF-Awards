This project aims at developing a theory and methods for correcting errors in
interactive communications. Shannon's influential "A Mathematical Theory of
Communication" established such a theory for one-way communications. Coding
theory has subsequently produced computationally efficient methods for reliable
data transmissions over unreliable channels. While error correcting codes have
transformed communication technologies over the decades, modern communication
settings often go beyond one-way transmissions and instead require many
interleaved rounds of interactive communication. The development of interactive
equivalents of good error correcting codes for such modern systems is a much
harder task, which has attracted attention recently and witnessed encouraging
initial successes. This project will further advance the fundamental questions
underlying possibilities, limitations, and theoretical underpinnings of reliable
interactive communication in the presence of noise, and thus contribute to a
solid mathematical and computational theory of reliable interactive
communication. The project also has a strong educational component which
supports several initiatives to stimulate undergraduates, graduate students, the
scientific community, and the general public through education and
outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project attacks a diverse set of "classical"
questions, such as determining the fundamental communication rate limits for
error correction in interactive communications, and explicit constructions of
tree codes, a powerful but elusive type of online code. The project also
considers the broader context of interactive coding schemes and their wide
ranging applicability in other areas of theoretical computer science, including
cryptography, privacy, and memory efficient error resilient computations.
