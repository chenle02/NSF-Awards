9513819 Fang In eukaryotic organisms, proteins that are destined for secretion
contain an amino-terminal signal peptide, a short sequence of amino acids that
direct co-translational translocation of the nascent protein across the membrane
of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Once this signal sequence completes its task
of leading the nascent protein across the membrane, it is proteolytically
removed by the action of a signal peptidase on the lumenal side of the ER. The
signal peptidase complex is a multi-subunit enzyme complex in the endoplasmic
reticulum. This small one-year award will support initiation of research
activities aimed toward functional characterizations of two newly-identified
genes involved in the activity of the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) signal
peptidase complex (SPC): SPC3, an essential gene which encodes the 25 kD subunit
of yeast SPC; and SPC4, a gene isolated as a high-copy suppressor of a
temperature-sensitive mutant of Sec11, the gene encoding the 18kD subunit. The
studies of SPC3 will include phenotypic analyses of temperature-sensitive
mutants after shift to the non-permissive temperature, and biochemical analyses
of the interactions of the gene product with other proteins using epitope
tagging. The studies of SPC4 will include phenotypic analyses of mutations in
this gene. ***
