This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
"Sixth Cornell Conference on Analysis, Probability, and Mathematical Physics on
Fractals" that will be held June 13-17, 2017, on the campus of Cornell
University. For additional information see the conference website:
http://www.math.cornell.edu/~fractals/ .

This triennial conference series, the first event in which took place in 2002
and of which the 2017 meeting will be the sixth installment, is one of the major
conferences whose focus is on mathematics on fractal sets. Topics to be
discussed range from harmonic analysis to probability, from number theory to
stochastic analysis. The long list of keynote speakers at the 2017 conference
includes the names of most of the world's leading researchers in the field. The
program allows ample opportunity for early-career mathematicians to present
their work.
