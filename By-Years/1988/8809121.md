The long-term goal of this ROW Career Advancement Award is to determine how the
Kinetochore region of a eucaryotic chromosome associates with a spindle fiber to
ensure proper chromosome segregation. Eventually, the investigator will
investigate the role the kinetochore plays in organizing the chromosomes in the
nucleus during interphase. This specific project will make use of both genetic
and biochemical approaches. Antibodies will be prepared and used to determine
the cellular location of proteins for various mutant cells and will facilitate
the isolation of components with which the proteins interact. These powerful
approaches will permit direct investigation of the requirements for kinetochore
assembly and function in yeast. This approach, combined with classical genetic
approaches, make yeast an excellent model eucaryotic system for determining the
molecular mechanisms underlying successful cell division.
