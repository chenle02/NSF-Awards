This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a
compact and autonomous, high precision monitor for the potent greenhouse gases,
methane and nitrous oxide. This proposal is submitted under the Geoscience
Instrumentation subtopic (subtopic E) of the Electronics topic. The target
molecules are currently detected with cw lead salt diode lasers. These lasers
require cryogenic cooling and, due to their lack of long term stability, a
highly trained operator. Quantum cascade (QC) lasers are spectroscopically
stable and can be operated near room temperature when they are pulsed. This
allows the design of compact, rugged, inexpensive and autonomous molecular
monitors. This system is further simplified by detecting both methane and
nitrous with a single QC laser using nearly coincident transitions near 1300 mm
. The Phase I research objectives will be to demonstrate that the required
sensitivity and specificity can be obtained in this spectral region using a
pulsed QC laser and non-cryogenic infrared detectors. The Phase I research will
produce a preliminary design for an instrument to be constructed during Phase
II. The resulting turn-key monitor will address the widespread need to monitor
these important species in a sensitive and cost-effective
manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential commercial applications for this research
include 1) the research market attempting to quantify the worldwide sources and
sinks of greenhouse gases, 2) the market for trading credits for greenhouse gas
emission reductions which requires quantitative documentation of these
reductions, 3) the market for goods and services able to identify and locate
leaks in natural gas distribution systems and 4) various research markets
needing to quantify methane and/or nitrous oxide concentrations or emissions in
both laboratory and field settings.
