This award funds research that will first evaluate the long-term record of a
program designed to promote women's careers in science and then test hypotheses
about the reasons for the long-term results. The Committee on the Status of
Women in the Economics Profession (CSWEP) developed the CeMENT mentoring
workshop in the 1990s to promote women's careers in economic science. CeMENT was
created as a randomized controlled experiment, and evaluation of the first three
cohorts has shown that the mentoring treatment enhanced participants' academic
productivity. It is hypothesized that CeMENT improved outcomes for women because
it: a) expanded professional collaborative networks; b) provided tacit knowledge
that improved productivity; c) created professional support networks; d) some
other mechanism not accounted for here; or e) all of the above. Women continue
to be under-represented in the economics profession. This research will identify
whether the mentoring program continues to have positive effects on the careers
of women economists, and thus inform practices that seek to broaden the
representation of women in the profession. The results will also help us
identify specific mentoring methods that may be useful for other sciences that
face similar issues.

Economists have examined the association between networks and labor market
outcomes, but few studies have identified the causal effects of networks because
they are endogenously determined. The CeMENT program is designed to expand
professional networks for both collaboration and support. It therefore provides
an opportunity to examine the causal effect of an exogenous change in
professional networks on the careers of female economists. The results will
contribute to our knowledge of the impact of professional networks on scientific
careers.
