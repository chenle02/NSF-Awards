Dr. McMillan will continue and expand his program of radial velocity
measurements of solar-type stars to search for gravitational perturbations by
planets. Observations on this program began in 1985, and uniformly calibrated
observations date from late 1986. Continuation of the observational project will
make the data series more sensitive to planetary perturbations. More stars of
near-solar type will be added to the observing list, which will increase the
statistical weight of the survey. Information about the orbits and masses of
planets orbiting stars other than the Sun would broaden our perspective on the
parameters of our own Solar System and thereby help generalize and refine
theories about the formation of stars and planetary systems. Tests have shown
that Dr. McMillan's instrument has the stability and the sensitivity to detect
the reflex acceleration induced by a Jupiter- mass planet on a solar type star,
if the orbit of the planet has a period less than 12 years and has a favorable
inclination to our line of sight. At the current level of accuracy, this is the
longest time base of all radial velocity programs in the United States, and it
provides the most observations of any such radial velocity program in the world.
