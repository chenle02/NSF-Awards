This project concerns the interface between application software and the real-
time data in large-scale arrays of wireless sensors and actuators. The objective
is to develop the theory and algorithms for creating a virtual sensor-actuator
array (VSAA) that will make it possible for application algorithms to avoid
dealing with the continually changing features of physical sensor-actuator
arrays. Using the VSAA, application-specific software can be written as if the
sensing and actuating devices are located as assumed in the application design
model, and that information is received with appropriate time stamps, in
addition to being filtered and integrated in a near optimal manner.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will build on recent research in
intelligent data integration for distributed systems. Raw data &lt;br/&gt;will
be delivered and manipulated as soft decisions in the form of probability
distributions. Information from multiple sources will be integrated using novel
algorithms based on graphical representations of the &lt;br/&gt;information
relationships among the sources, and information-theoretic techniques will be
developed for sharing and moving the computations among the nodes so that
performance does not degrade significantly in the face of intermittent
communication and node failures. The algorithms developed in this project will
be evaluated for intelligent building control applications using in a wireless
sensor-actuator array in the Intelligent Workplace, an existing experimental
facility at Carnegie Mellon University.&lt;br/&gt;
