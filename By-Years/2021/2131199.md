This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2). This project is focused on investigations of the
multiphase dynamics and chemistry of highly oxygenated multifunctional compounds
(HOMs) in the atmosphere and will provide a key missing piece in the current
understanding of the atmospheric lifecycle of HOMs, their identities, abundance,
and reactive chemistry. The results of this research will aid in predictions of
how the reactive chemistry of HOMs modifies the atmospheric composition and will
provide crucial information needed for the accurate simulation of fine particles
and their interactions with clouds in the atmosphere. It will also produce a
dataset useful for understanding the toxicity of HOMs and their impact on human
health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objectives of this project are to: (1)
Characterize the molecular signature and abundance of HOMs in organic aerosols
from both biogenic and anthropogenic sources; (2) Examine how the composition
and distribution of HOMs respond to varying nitrogen oxides (NOx) levels; and
(3) Quantify the lifetimes of HOMs upon gas-particle conversion and elucidate
the aging and removal pathways that HOMs undergo in the particle phase. The
results will be applied to address the following scientific questions: (a) What
are the molecular forms by which HOMs are present in the particle phase and the
linkage with the HOMs identified in the gas phase? (b) How long could HOMs
survive upon gas-particle conversion? (c) What are the aging pathways HOMs
undergo in the particle phase? (d) To what extent does the HOMs aging affect the
yield and makeup of the SOA produced? and (e) How will the particulate HOMs
respond to reducing anthropogenic NOx emissions?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
