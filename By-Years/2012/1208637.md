New rehabilitation therapies for patients with incomplete lower spinal cord
injuries (SCI) will be developed using the Treadport, a robotic treadmill that
provides a realistic walking experience in a safe and flexible virtual
environment. The Treadport overcomes limitations of current rehabilitation
treadmills, which are too dissimilar from everyday walking and therefore limit a
patient's recovery. We will seek to improve a patient's walking speed and
effort, resistance to falling by strengthening and training a patient to
unexpected perturbations, and arm swing coordination which is critical for
normal walking. The intellectual merit is the body-weight assisted robotic
treadmill training, and arm swing assistance using a light-weight exoskeleton.
The robotic treadmill will provide monitored assistance and virtual reality
training scenarios not currently possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
impact is the development of new technology and scientific understanding that
will improve the lives of SCI patients so that they have the most mobility
possible given their injuries. The proposed research combines the disciplines of
robotics, biomechanics, and physical therapy, and requires interdisciplinary
training. The socially positive nature of this project is expected to be
especially attractive to underrepresented populations in engineering and
computer science, particularly women and people with
disabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal addresses the co-worker theme
of the National Robotics Initiative, particularly rehabilitation, orthotics and
prosthetics.
