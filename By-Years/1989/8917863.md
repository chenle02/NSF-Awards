Ribosomal RNA is one of the most informative, useful and highly studied
molecules in biology. Biologists utilize it in three main ways: (1) as a tool
for establishing the systematics of microorganisms (and for refining and
extending the systematics of higher organisms); (2) as a phylogenetic
characterization of natural populations and as an adjunct to diagnosis of
bacterial infections; (3) as a powerful approach to studying the evolutionary
process; and (4) in its own right, as the function-defining component(s) in the
translation apparatus. As the body of available ribosomal RNA data grows,
scientists will increasingly require automated tools to help them store, manage,
and analyze these data. This project is aimed at meeting those needs through the
development of an integrated rRNA data management and analysis facility.
Specifically, the project will entail (a) developing of a new generation of
software for entering, manipulating, and maintaining ribosomal RNA sequences and
related data, (b) maintaining an up-to-date collection of ribosomal RNA data in
an aligned format, (c) using these data for continued analysis of evolutionary
relationships, (d) integrating ribosomal sequence data with other information
concerning the ribosome, and (e) distributing these data and programs to the
research community. In addition to meeting the needs of researchers interested
in ribosomal RNA data, this project will serve as a prototype for future systems
that will need to be developed to manage the large collections of sequence data
that will result from the many genome research projects currently underway.
