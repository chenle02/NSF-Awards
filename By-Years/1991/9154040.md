The Mathematical Association of America seeks funding for a one year project
which is aimed at investigating the state of teacher preparation with regard to
minority populations. The project has three major facets: i. A study which will
be conducted with data collected throughout the nation to inform the mathematics
community about minorities going into the teaching of mathematics at the
secondary level. ii. A working conference which will bring a small group of
experts together to address different components of the problems and to present
papers which feature model programs for minority preservice education. Papers
will be revised after the conference, and submitted to MAA committees and to
members of a select panel. iii. This Blue Ribbon panel of distinguished
educators and leaders in various related areas will hold a conference, together
with all other project participants, and will react to the papers and the
results of the study. The end-product of the MAA effort will be a document which
includes the study and the papers produced by the project participants. The
document will be disseminated to the MAA membership. MAA cost sharing of
approximately 3% of the requested amount is shown by their reduction of the
indirect cost rate from 34% to 30%. The funds awarded to this project is the
revised amount, $91,362.
