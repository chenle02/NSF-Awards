The objective of this research is to study the feasibility of using neural
networks as the basis for intelligent and robust control of flexible structures.
Currently, implementation of modern control systems is based on sequential
processing of state equations as opposed to the massively parallel processing
architecture (neural network) of the human brain. As systems become more
complex, the ability to control them by traditional sequential control methods
becomes limited. Parallel processing architecture is inherent in the recently
developed technology of neural networks. It offers the potential for addressing
the limitations associated with traditional sequential control methods. There
are three potentially powerful characteristics associated with neural networks.
They are: (1) the ability to learn and make decisions based on an optimization
criteria; (2) the ability to perform a recognition task under uncertain
conditions and with incomplete information: and (3) a high processing speed.
This project will study whether these characteristics can be utilized in solving
a flexible structure control problem. The three phases of the research include
development of a neural space representation for complex systems, formulation of
the control system structure in terms of the neural network structure, and
implementation of the results on the control of a flexible beam.
