Under the auspices of the UC Urban Community-School Collaborative, the Summer
Session Office of the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC), in
collaboration with the Monterey Peninsula Unified School District (MPUSD), is
developing a comprehensive Marine Science/Mathematics Institute for African
American students entering or currently in the 9th Grade. A Participants will be
selected from Seaside and Monterey High Schools. The 5-week residential summer
program will be held on the campus of the University of California Santa Cruz,
Santa CA. The inquiry based core curriculum of math and science will incorporate
four main themes: Scale and Structure, Energy, Stability and Change and Systems
and Interactions. Discussions will focus on the natural history, biology,
ecology and geology of the Monterey Bay National Marine. The pedagogical
emphasis will be on cooperative learning while "doing science." Close,
Meaningful interactions with university faculty and students during laboratory
and field experiences will be integral components of the summer and academic
year programs. The summer curriculum will be augmented by courses in library
research techniques, work processing and spread sheet operations and On-line
information retrieval systems. The innovative Residential Program will include
field trips and workshops on academic/career development, conflict mediation,
developing interpersonal skills, time management and study skills. The year-
round follow up program will include mentorship/tutorial programs, internships
and parental information, education and support services. The active
participation of high school teachers from both schools during both the summer
and academic year programs, will provide a vital link to the students year round
and facilitate monitoring of the participants' academic progress. ***
