This project examines the social impacts of rapid social change on the
expectations and aspirations of rural youth in Alaska. Surveys will be
administered to high school students in two regions: the Northwest Arctic
Borough, site of the Red Dog Zink Mine, and the Bristol Bay Area, where there
has been little or no oil or mining development. The object is to compare the
responses of students in terms of educational, occupational, and residential
aspirations and expectations, as well as attitudes toward family, community and
the environment. The project will address the limitations of previous social-
impact research, collect data directly from high school students, and provide
cross-national and cross-cultural comparisons using data from Scotland and
Newfoundland.
