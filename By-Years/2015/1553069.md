By using the electric power sector as an example of a critical infrastructure,
this career project will examine the influence of computer and network security
expertise on critical infrastructure organizations, the ways cybersecurity is
becoming a new field of expertise and the role of global enactments of
cybersecurity on reshaping conceptions of international security. This project
will integrate research and teaching in order to identify options for
policymakers, professional organizations and researchers to help engage
cybersecurity research in professional organizations and analyses of
organizational exercises. This project will inform practitioners, organizations,
and policymakers about best practices for reducing risks to critical
infrastructure. It will provide information to government and city planning for
developing responses to global cybersecurity threats. It will also develop
interdisciplinary tools for teaching cybersecurity to the next generation of
information security experts, control engineers, and public
administrators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will examines enactments of
cybersecurity expertise at three distinctive organizational scales: the micro -
scale of small groups and individuals; the meso - scale of institutions such as
corporations and standards - setting groups; and the macro - scale of political
economy and international organization. This multi-scalar analysis will explore
technical and cultural approaches to risk to show how distinctive cultures of
expertise negotiate risk are a multi - dimensional phenomenon; will identify the
distinctive practices of information and physical infrastructures and will
address how cyberpower will impact within international relations. The project
will develop best practices for critical infrastructure organizations to
integrate computer and network security expertise into overall risk management
strategies, drawing on participant-observation and semi-structured interviews
with practitioners in the field.
