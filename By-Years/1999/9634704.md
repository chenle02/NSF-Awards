9634704 Schmidt This award provides funding for a planning project to assess the
potential of grammar-based design approaches in the development of designer
assistance tools. The project tasks are divided into categories of development
and feedback. The development tasks consist of extending work already completed
on a graph-grammar design algorithm for the generation of simple rolling carts
from small-scale mechanical mechanism components. Devices designed by this
grammar can be built, tested and evaluated. The grammar will be augmented to
include additional geometric reasoning and extended to a second mechanical
design problem. The feedback tasks outlined in this project are established to
gain insight from academic and industrial sources on the potential of and
requirements for a generative designer assistance tool. Feedback from academic
researchers in mechanical design will be gathered from conference presentation
of results of using the grammar-based approach to design. Feedback is also
needed from future users of designer assistance tools to produce a vision of how
generative designer tools can be tailored to meet their needs. Individual
meetings to discuss this issue will be conducted with selected area
manufacturers who maintain positions in their markets as product innovators.
This award will enable researchers to focus future research efforts in
development of grammar-based algorithms for mechanical design in ways that will
provide solutions to problems of real interest to working design engineers.
Devices designed by the graph-grammar algorithm of this project are functioning
scale-models of real-world mechanical devices. Therefore, the successful use of
the algorithm to generate physically-realized devices lends credibility to the
idea of using a grammar to design real-world products. The algorithm refined
during this project will then serve as a learning tool and model for the
creation of larger, grammar-based systems for product development.
