0107120 Goldfinger 0107093 Nelson Great earthquakes represent large releases of
energy and the ability to predict them is of obvious importance. A number of
models of earthquake temporal and spatial characteristics have been developed,
but have not been adequately tested and validated, mostly because the historical
record is very short in comparison to the typical time between earthquakes. This
project will attempt to provide a record of large earthquakes along the Cascadia
margin that spans at least 10,000 years by use of turbidites as proxies for
large earthquakes. The results will be invaluable in testing earthquake
recurrence models.
