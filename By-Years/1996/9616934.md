From the late 1930s to the mid 1960s Logical Empiricism dominated how North
American scientists and intellectuals understood scientific reasoning. At its
core, Logical Empiricism opposed metaphysical philosophies, favoring in their
place reasoning grounded in analytic truths (that is, statements that are true
or false because of the meaning and arrangement of their terms, not because of
the state of the natural world to which they refer). From this analytic
foundation arose a unity of sciences, united by common fundamental principles.
This conference will examine the historical, philosophic, social and political
factors that gave rise to Logical Empiricism in North America. It will develop a
deeper understanding of how the ideas and people associated with those ideas
came to North America and became established. The conference will take place at
Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, in May 1998, and an edited volume
of conference papers will be published.
