This research is on algorithms for synthesis and layout of VLSI designs.
Algorithms for complex, large industrial type design problems are being
developed. Topics include: (1) high level synthesis with testability as a
goodness measure, (2) timing driven placement for FPGAs, (3) channel and
switchbox routing in which cross talk considered, and (4) application of
optimization techniques to enhancing the effectiveness of the fabrication
process. Approaches include: assessing the effects of register allocation and
binding on testability; use of neighborhood graphs to guide iterative design;
and integer programming to solve routing problems. Software incorporating the
algorithms as design tools is also being developed.
