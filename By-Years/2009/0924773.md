This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award funds research to conduct
laboratory experiments that will compare the outcomes of different auction
mechansims. One of the most fruitful areas of theoretical auction research has
been the comparison of static auction mechanisms with dynamic auction mechansims
and the development of new dynamic auction desgins for auctioning multiple
items. This project provides new empirical evidence comparing the performance of
static and dynamic auctions when bidders are financially constrained. This
evidence is particularly noteworthy because it sheds new light on how auctions
for multiple items with common values perform in
practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the experiments compare sealed bid
and dynamic auction formats in common value environments where bidders have
liquidity needs (in reverse auctions) or budget constraints (in standard
auctions). Recent research in economic theory predicts that the dynamic auctions
result in both higher auction efficiency and higher auction revenue. The
experiments test this prediction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Auctions of this type
have been suggested as a method for solving several resource allocation
problems. For example, auctions might be used to sell troubled financial assets.
Auctions have also been suggested as a way to sell emission allowances, which
may be one policy method used to limit greenhouse gas
production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
