9725379 Sammis This research is an extension of work that investigated
precursory seismicity along the San Andreas Fault and found that all events
since 1906 with magnitude greater than 6.5 were preceded by a power-law increase
in seismic energy release. The work aims to address the question of whether the
crust is in a continuous state of self-organized criticality or whether large
earthquakes produce local excursions away from criticality. If the latter holds
true, earthquake forecasting may be possible since the subsequent approach back
toward criticality is expected to have deterministic, observable characteristics
such as the increase in precursory seismicity. This work will extend the
precursory seismicity study to the worldwide catalogs, studying as many large
events in both shear zones and subduction zones as the data allows. This
research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
