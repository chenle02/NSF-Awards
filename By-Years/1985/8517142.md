The Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) will administer a
workshop on cross disciplinary research in multiphase flow on June 2-4, 1986, in
Leesburg, Virginia. The workshop will present recent advances, formulate
important problems, and stimulate research in multiphase flow. Participants in
the workshop will be primarily applied and computational mathematicians and
chemical engineers of academe, government, and industry who are interested in
and are working on various problems of multiphase flow. Topics being considered
include: granular flow modeling and applications, bulk properties of bubbly
liquids, rheological properties of fluid-particle systems, suspensions,
colloidal systems, phase separation, and other instabilities, many body problems
in hydrodynamics, the use of vortex methods in multiphase flow, mathematical
problems in the rheology of complex fluids, diffusion limited aggregation, and
modeling of blood flow and clotting.
