This project is establishing a Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) in an
undergraduate Modern Physics Laboratory. It is enabling undergraduates, for the
first time, to actually see atomic surfaces and "see atoms". The aim is to
actively expose advanced physics majors to contemporary, state- of-the-art
surface physics. The mechanical part of the microscope is being built in the
departmental machine shop, using a proven design, and interfaced to a PC
computer. The design of this STM permits its use by senior undergraduate
students and yet allows modifications and improvements by such students. The
students are able to use the latest methods of preparing scanning tips and study
naturally clean, quality surfaces of carbon, gold, TaS2 and TaSe2. These
surfaces show both atomic and electronic structure without the difficulties of
high vacuum techniques. The students are exposed to modern methods of image
processing using a high speed, high video resolution, personal computer as a
necessary part of the STM. This Nobel prize winning method of probing the atomic
structure of surfaces permits physics students to do what has not been possible
before; to actually "see" an atom.NSF grant funds are being matched with funds
from non-federal sources.
