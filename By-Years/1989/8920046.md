The objective of this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project in
solid state physics between Metka Luzar of the Jozef Stefan Institute and
Alexander Pines of the University of California at Berkeley is to study
molecular ordering, dynamics, and structure of liquid crystals and crystalline
solids using zero field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The proposed
experiments will further basic understanding of the fundamental properties of
liquid crystals, which are important in the development of optical devices. Dr.
Pines has developed new NMR techniques related to liquid crystal research and
Dr. Luzar is expert in ferroelectric liquid crystal materials. This project was
approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on Cooperation in Science and
Technology and is supported through a joint fund consisting of matching
contributions from the U.S. and Yugoslav governments. The U.S. contribution is
provided annually by the Department of State. No NSF funds are involved. The
award, except for funds for U.S. scientist travel, is made to the Yugoslav
institution.
