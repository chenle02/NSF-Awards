Work on this project focuses on two areas related to the study of solutions of
elliptic partial differential equations. These are the analysis of the
biharmonic and polyharmonic equations on non-smooth domains and boundary value
problems for second order elliptic divergence form operators with non-smooth
coefficients. In past work it was discovered that the range of solvability of
higher order elliptic operators on non-smooth domains depended on the dimension
of the underlying domain. There remains a gap in the range in which the solution
will have a finite norm (above the quadratic). If the domain has dimension four
or greater then solutions exist with unbounded p-norms for some value of p
greater than two. But the first value of p is not known, nor is it known whether
this gap reduces to zero as the dimension increases. Work will be done in an
effort to obtain sharp estimates on this range. There is a close connection
between the study of differential operators on non-smooth domains and those with
non-smooth coefficients. Research will concentrate on establishing
representations of solutions through integrals of boundary values. This is a
particularly delicate matter. In the case of smooth coefficient operators, the
integrals are Lebesgue integrals (the harmonic measure is absolutely continuous
with respect to surface measure). This is not necessarily the case in general.
Work will be done in establishing criteria which will still guarantee the
integral representation through approximation procedures. Once these are
established, one can then begin to study the behavior of solutions as the
variable is made to approach the domain boundary.
