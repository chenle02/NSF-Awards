For a normal, local domain R, the principal investigator will study conditions
under which modules over the completion descend to modules over the ring R. This
will involve an examination of the descent properties of special morphisms. In
addition, the principal investigator will construct low dimensional non-Cohen
Macaulay factorization domains in characteristic zero. This project is in the
general area of commutative algebra. The problems to be examined come out of
questions inalgebraic geometry.
