The goals of this research are two-fold: to develop and analyze efficient
parallel iterative solvers with effective preconditioners that arise in solid-
liquid computational simulations; and to parallelize a solid-liquid
computational simulation for the NSF Grand Challenge Particle Simulation
Project. In this particle simulation, the motion of solid particles in flowing
fluid is carried out using an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian finite element
method with a moving particle-fitted unstructured grid. This formulation results
in a nonlinear system of equations that is solved at each time step with a
modified-Newton method. Using the modified-Newton method gives rise to
nonsymmetric linear systems that are solved with a preconditioned GMRES
iterative method. The first focus of this research is to efficiently solve these
nonsymmetric linear systems by developing robust and effective parallel
preconditioners for iterative solving. Moreover, a library of parallel numerical
algorithms will be developed to solve nonlinear algebraic systems using variants
of Newton's method and to solve sparse nonsymmetric linear systems using
preconditioned iterative methods. The library will be portable across a range of
parallel machines and will be placed on the public domain. The parallelization
will be carried out using the general methodology and optimization techniques
developed in Oplus (Oxford Parallel Library for Unstructured Solvers).
