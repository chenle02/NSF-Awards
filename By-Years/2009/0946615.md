0946615&lt;br/&gt;Minko&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is a
support for the Symposium of the American Chemical Society Division of Polymeric
Materials:Science and Engineering titled ?Hybrid Smart Micro- and Nanoparticles?
which will be held in the frames of 238th ACS National Meeting in Washington DC,
August 16-20, 2009. The planned symposium overviews the very recent developments
in science and engineering of responsive nanoparticles and colloidal systems
with special emphasis on new biomimetic systems and applications for
biosensors.&lt;br/&gt;Responsive polymer materials can adapt to surrounding
environments, regulate transport of ions and molecules, change wettability and
adhesion of different species upon external stimuli, or convert chemical and
biochemical signals into optical, electrical, thermal, and mechanical signals
and vice versa. These materials have played an increasingly important role in a
diverse range of applications, such as drug delivery, diagnostic, tissue
engineering, and ?smart? optical systems, as well as biosensors, microelectro-
mechanical systems (MEMS), coatings, and textiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
present symposium will help to integrate various aspects of the responsive
colloidal systems? study in the event open for a wide community of engineers,
materials scientists and students and involve the brightest undergraduate and
graduate students in modern areas of biosensors, colloidal and material science,
and biotechnology.
