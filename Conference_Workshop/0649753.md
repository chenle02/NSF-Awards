This award provides an NSF support for the Workshops on Quantitative Proteomics
conducted by Middle Tennessee State University. Mathematics and computational
science have become crucial technologies for the study of complex models of
biological processes. The workshop will concentrate on the current research
advances of proteomic data processing using mathematical tools and statistical
techniques. The main themes that guide the topics of the workshops include (1)
mathematical framework for modeling and representing proteomic mass spectrometry
data, (2) data mining tools for feature extraction and biomarker discovery, (3)
algorithms designing and software development for proteomic data processing and
statistical analysis, and (4) proteomic data based survival models and survival
analysis.

The workshop provides top scholars of applied mathematicians/statisticians and
medical scientists in proteomics an opportunity to present their research
results as well as collaborate on new research. One of the main goals of the
workshop is to create a special opportunity for graduate students, post-doctoral
fellows, and other young researchers, particularly those from the
underrepresented groups, to meet the leading experts in this interdisciplinary
field, as well as to learn from them and their own peers about current
developments, future trends, mathematical analysis in general, and the
computational and statistical aspects of medical data analysis in particular,
can be applied to solve problems in the medical sciences. This workshop will
play a crucial role in creating a significant impact of the new developing Ph.D.
programs in the interdisciplinary sciences at Middle Tennessee State University.
The experience is expected to prepare graduates for interdisciplinary science
research training and influence them to continue their careers in this
direction. Other than the interdisciplinary nature of this project, the workshop
will also benefit both graduate and undergraduate students, and postdoctoral
associates in the study of mathematics, biochemistry, bioinformatics,
biostatistics, as well as computer science and biology.
