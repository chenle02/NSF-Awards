The analysis of extreme hydrologic events generally requires considerable
amounts of streamflow data. This is seldom the case and records are limited on
non-existent. This work will further the understandings of the mechanisms
controlling basin dynamics by substituting, in a Bayesian sense, physical
understanding for data. Basin scale geomorphological unit hydrographs will be
used together with physical characteristics and representation of hillslope run-
off, e.g., geometry, topography, climate, etc. The objectives are to develop a
unified and consistent theory of run-off production in a basin for dry and wet
periods and to formulate a self-consistent hydro-geomorphologic model for
catchment behavior.
