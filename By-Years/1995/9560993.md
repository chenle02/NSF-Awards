This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop and
evaluate independent strategies for extending operating lifetimes of SQUlDs
fabricated from YBa2Cu307-( step-edge junctions. Two strategies will be
evaluated in Phase 1. The first strategy is to find a coating that is suitable
for protecting Josephson junctions and is compatible with `flip chip`
technology. The second approach is to fabricate step-edge junctions from the
corrosion resistant phase of Yl-xCaxBa2-yLayCu3O7-( and Gdl-xCaxBa2LayCu3O7-(
compounds. Corrosion is particularly problematic during the fabrication and
operation of step-edge Josephson junctions and the strategies developed in this
work will be applicable to a large range of devices fabricated from cuprate
superconductors. One of the most serious problems that has limited the
commercialization of YBa2Cu307-( devices are their lack of environmental
stability. The cuprate superconductor YBa2Cu307-( tends to degrade rapidly when
exposed to the ambient atmosphere through corrosion reactions caused by H20 and
CO2. These corrosion problems severely limit the lifetimes of electronic devices
fabricated from YBa2Cu307-(. The current generation of cuprate based devices are
very susceptible to corrosion and have a very limited lifetime. The proposed
research is intended to lead to new technologies for the fabrication of robust
superconducting electronics. These devices may find application in a number of
diverse areas such as MRI, NMR, magnetic sensing, and low noise electronics.
