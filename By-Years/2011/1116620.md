The primary goal of this project is improve the stability of software systems.
Many modern programming languages use static type checking to eliminate errors
from programs. However, the type systems that underlie these checkers are
conservative and reject several classes of useful, correct programs. In
particular, the techniques of generic programming, which optimize data
structures, generalize interfaces and eliminate boilerplate in program
development, are difficult to type check. Although dependent type systems
provide flexibility in type checking, particularly with respect to generic
programming, they have not yet been integrated into realistic programming
languages.

The proposed work of this project will augment a mature, general purpose,
statically-typed programming language with support for dependently-typed
programming. Specifically, the project will extend the source and intermediate
languages of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC). Although generic programming is
the key application area, the Haskell extensions proposed here will enhance the
capabilities of dependently-typed programming in Haskell in many domains. This
project is in collaboration with the designers and implementers of the GHC
compiler at Microsoft Research, Cambridge. The team includes world leaders in
the areas of dependent type systems, generic programming, language design and
implementation. As GHC is an open-source project, the extensions to Haskell will
be freely distributed. Furthermore, the project will have educational benefits
through the funding of doctoral students and the integration of its results into
advanced graduate and undergraduate courses.
