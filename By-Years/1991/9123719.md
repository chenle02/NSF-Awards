A full understanding of the crisis in science teaching in the elementary and
secondary schools of the United States requires a look at the historical
background against which teaching of science in this country has developed. How
were things done before? Why were the choices for presentation made? What were
the goals of science teaching when it was first introduced? How has the
situation changed? Professor Kohlstedt's project constitutes the first
comprehensive analysis of the Nature Study program of teaching science in
schools to consider its scientific outlook, its concern for social and
environmental issues, the extraordinary diversity of its activities by region
and the ways in which gender issues influenced the program and affected its
stability. "Nature Study" was an international movement that came from Europe to
the United States in the 1890's. It developed as a method to introduce children
to the natural world in a systematic way. Professor Kohlstedt is examining the
period from 1890 to 1930 when the Nature Study movement moved beyond the school
system to extracurricular and public institutions. She is probing the
deceptively simple clarity of Nature Study's basic proposition--learning from
natural objects- -that was elaborated in textbooks and lesson plans variously
directed at rural and urban children in both private and public schools. She is
reassessing the outlook and activities of those administrators and teachers who
established Nature Study as a curriculum and publicized it through lectures and
publications. Based on the records of normal schools, university archives,
school system records, and the papers of individual teachers and students as
well as the numerous published books and articles on Nature Study, this research
will document its philosophy, content, pedagogy, scientific outlook, and public
connections. This study promises to be a most important contribution to our
understanding of the processes of science teaching in the US.
