Understanding plant metabolism at the molecular level in response to pathogens
or hostile growth conditions is crucial for the bioengineering of crop plants
with the growing challenges imposed by globalization and climate change. The new
biotechnological tools to be developed in this project will allow plant
biologists to visualize cellular level metabolic changes in both temporal and
spatial dimensions. This project is focused on developing tools to understand
dynamic plant metabolism at single-cell resolution; however, the potential
impact extends beyond plant biology across many scientific disciplines,
including microbial biotechnology, precision medicine, and environmental
applications. In addition to training graduate and undergraduate students in
this interdisciplinary field between biological and physical sciences, a middle
or high school teacher will be recruited to this project each year through the
Research Experiences for Teachers program at Iowa State University. Teachers
will work on an environment-related duckweed project, which they can continue
after going back to the classroom and develop their own
projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technology which will be developed is mass
spectrometry imaging (MSI) of in vivo isotope labeling, referred to as MSIi. In
vivo isotope labeling can trace metabolic activities and provide temporal
information of metabolic changes. Isotope labeled metabolite distributions can
then be visualized by MSI directly on tissues at cellular resolution. Hydroponic
cultures will be optimized for in vivo isotope labeling of three model plants,
duckweed, Arabidopsis, and maize. MSI data of plant tissues labeled with 2H,
15N, or 13C will be used to identify unknown metabolites directly on tissues and
visualize metabolite flux in selected biological systems. To expedite the data
analysis in an automatic and robust fashion, software tools will be developed by
adding multiple functionalities to the existing open-source software, MSiReader,
such as correcting isotope measurement errors, generating isotopologue images
and abundances, visualizing labeling efficiency, and enabling untargeted
labeling search. Once successful, the new technology can be expanded to many new
directions, including fluxomics at single-cell resolution, high-precision
metabolic bioengineering, and cell- or tissue-specific dynamic stress
responses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
