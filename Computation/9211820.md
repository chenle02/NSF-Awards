The planned effort is a continuation of the work under NSF Grant DMS 8810150
entitled "Topics in Spectral Methods". The principal investigators will continue
the theoretical and computational investigation related to spectral and ENO
(essentially non-oscillatory) methods for discontinuous problems. The research
and educational activities involved in computational fluid dynamics have wide
applicability to scientific and engineering problems.
