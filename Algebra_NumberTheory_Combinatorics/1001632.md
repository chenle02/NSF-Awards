This proposal addresses series of interrelated problems on quantum groups,
Poisson Lie groups, Poisson homogeneous spaces, and their relations to
combinatorics. These include: determining the spectra of quantized universal
enveloping algebras of nilpotent algebras of De Concini-Kac-Procesi and Lusztig
and the Berenstein-Zwicknagl (flat) braided symmetric algebras, carring out the
orbit method for quantized algebras of functions, classifying automorphism
groups of quantum nilpotent algebras, investigating quantized algebras of
functions related to the Belavin-Drinfeld classification and the corresponding
varieties of Lagrangian subalgebras, proving completeness of Kogan-Zelevinsky
integrable systems, investigating cluster algebras on flag varieties and double
flag varieties and their interaction with total positivity on these objects.

The theory of Lie and algebraic groups is a major branch of mathematics, used
to study in a unified way symmetries of physical theories, and geometric and
algebraic objects. In recent years noncommutative versions of these techniques
started playing an increasingly prominent role. Hopf algebras appeared in
numerous studies in mathematical physics, algebra, combinatorics, noncommutative
geometry, and topology.
