This dissertation examines the effects of state controlled communist political
socialization in communist totalitarian regimes. The research will take place in
Romania and involves a triangulated and mixed methods research design consisting
of archival research on the education curriculum, secondary data analysis of
post-1989 surveys and approximately one hundred in-depth interviews with former
high-school students and their teachers, focusing on the 1975-1989 interval. The
interviews will be conducted in Bucharest and Cluj and will focus on the
teaching and learning process as well as other relevant experiences of youth
coming of age under communism. This project's broader impacts lie in its
contribution to social science understanding of everyday life under socialism
and the factors that led to its downfall. The research also seeks to address
contemporary debates on the effectiveness of political socialization through
research on a communist and totalitarian context, providing a necessary
background and useful lessons for contemporary teaching of democratic civic
education.
