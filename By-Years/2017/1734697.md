The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project reaches many
different silos, including disaster relief, logistics, and personal protective
equipment, through innovations in custom manufacturing and rapid prototyping.
This I-Corps project is exploring the commercialization feasibility for a method
to protect any amorphous shape with a rigid, adaptable fit system. There are
many application areas where a method to form a rigid support system would be
useful and transformative. For example, this method requires minimal, non-
professional training and no water or external additives to catalyze the cure
from liquid to solid. If results of this study suggest that this technology has
merit as a medical device, it could transform the way patients are treated for
broken bones, how victims are cared for in disaster relief areas, and how
medical treatment is administered in the third world. Additionally, the current
standard for protecting fragile objects during shipping is with polymer-
reinforced paper, plastic peanuts, or sheets of air-puffed plastic. Objects of
unidentifiable shapes could be more efficiently packed with this adaptable-fit
technology.

This I-Corps project proposes to conduct commercialization feasibility research
on a method for protecting any amorphous shape with a rigid, adaptable fit
system. The proposed technology utilizes research in manufacturing techniques to
develop a novel method for custom forming a rigid support structure around an
amorphous shape. The method consists of a network of tubing that contains one or
more liquids, such that an external stimulus may trigger the transformation of
one or more of these liquids into solid form. The tubes connect in a lattice
structure that allows them to expand and contract in order to fit to an
amorphous shape. Exploring this new method of forming a rigid structure can
advance the fields of custom manufacturing and rapid prototyping. The technology
allows for rapid creation of a custom-fit part in the field, without any
external tools.
