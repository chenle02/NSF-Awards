S. S. Antman will treat a variety of dynamical and steady-state nonlinear
problems for rods, shells, and three-dimensional solid bodies. The bodies are
composed of nonlinearly elastic, viscoelastic, plastic, viscoplastic, or
magnetoelastic materials. In each case, properly invariant, geometrically exact
theories encompassing general nonlinear constititutive equations are to be used.
The goals of these studies are to discover new nonlinear effects, determine
thresholds in constititutive equations separating qualitatively different
responses, determine general classes of constitutive equations that are both
physically and mathematically natural, examine important kinds of instabilities,
contribute to the theory of shocks and dissipative mechanisms in solids, and
develop new methods of nonlinear analysis and of effective computationfor
problems of solid mechanics.

The award will support mathematical research on the mechanics of solids, such as
metals, plastics, etc. Qualitative phenomena such as the buckling of columns and
shells, the propagation of waves in rods, and the formation of shocks that could
lead to fracture will be studied for wide classes of mathematical models. This
work is interdisciplinary, combining modern techniques from engineering
mechanics, physics, and mathematics. One important feature of the modern
mathematical techniques employed, which is not widely known outside of
mathematical circles, is that the analytical methods used can handle whole
classes of physical problems for different kinds of materials in different kinds
of shapes subject subject to different kinds of loadings, all at the same time.
In this sense, the approach is the antithesis of computational methods, which
can handle only one specific problem at a time. Part of the outcome of this work
will be the development of effective numerical methods for this rich class of
problems, and some of the results will be illustrated numerically.
