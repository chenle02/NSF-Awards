This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
Program. This study will examine the pathways to promotion within a single,
large multi-level firm with data from job histories of employees hired between
1975 and 1985. It seeks to answer the question of why individuals who begin with
what look like the same career chances often end up in different positions. This
question is both of practical significance and is rooted in the theoretical
literature on organizations. Analysis of career data will test statistical
models of multiple career trajectories as these apply within firms. %%% This
research contributes to sociological understanding of career mobility and the
barriers to equality of advancement that may develop within firms. In addition
to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award will
materially assist a highly promising student in completing research for the
Ph.D. dissertation. Thus it contributes to the future scientific manpower of the
nation and the thorough training of the next generation of social scientists.
