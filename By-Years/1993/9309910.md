Galatsanos The research is exploring a novel, multi-channel approach to the
image restoration problem that utilizes a wavelet-based subband decomposition.
Such a decomposition facilitates the incorporation of localized space-variant
statistics and prior knowledge into the restoration process as well as adaptive
noise suppression at various resolution levels. Furthermore, it can be
implemented in a practical and computationally efficient manner. In order to
fully exploit the potential advantages of this approach, three classes of multi-
channel restoration algorithms are being considered: 1. stochastic restoration
algorithms where the multi-channel statistics of the wavelet-based subbands are
used to model the space-varying nature of the original image; 2. deterministic
algorithms where multi-channel regularization operators and parameters are used;
and 3. hierarchical image restoration where the image is progressively restored
starting from its coarse features and continuing to the finer ones.
