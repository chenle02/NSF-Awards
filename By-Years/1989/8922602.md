The Geological Society of America is an important source of funding for
graduate student research in the earth sciences. Since the Society's research
grants program began in 1933, awards have been made to 4,336 geoscientists in
the total amount of $4,796,544. In 1989, the research grants budget was
$180,600, comprising 210 awards averaging $860 per recipient. This year's budget
allowed funding of only 43% of the requests, and at less than 80% of the
awardees' proposed expenditures. In order to bring the supply of funds more into
balance with demand, GSA is proposing to enter into a three-year, cooperative
financing program with the National Science Foundation, commencing in April
1991. Under this proposal GSA (together with its Foundation) and NSF would fund
two-thirds and one-third respectively of a $300,000 annual student research
grants budget. GSA will administer the program, as it has for the past 56 years.
An NSF conferee has met with the Research Grants Committee during its
deliberations each year, and such representation is proposed to continue during
the term of this program.
