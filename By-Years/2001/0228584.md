Recent computational studies have suggested that E. coli metabolic and
regulatory networks are small-world, which are often characterized by the
presence of highly connected "hub" nodes that connect highly intra-connected
sub-networks and, therefore, play an important role in shaping overall network
behavior. This project describes a combined experimental and computational
approach to discover genes whose over-expression has the strongest affect on
cell behavior and to determine if these genes display biological network
connectivity values that are characteristic of "small-world" network
architectures. It is proposed to apply and further develop a new and innovative
post-genomics methodology, parallel gene-trait mapping that enables new
experiment-based investigations of the structure of E. coli biological networks
at the whole-genome level. In parallel, it is proposed to perform computational
studies that will create and parse E. coli regulatory and metabolic network-
graphs to determine individual gene connectivity values. A primary outcome of
this work will be the training of several young scientists and students at the
interface of the biological and computational sciences. A second outcome will be
the further development and application of a novel post-genomics methodology
that can be used in a variety of contexts.
