The assembly of proteins and nucleic acids into viruses involves numerous
molecular interactions. Often assembly is dependent on scaffolding proteins.
Analogous to scaffoldings used in building construction, these proteins assist
assembly, but are not found in the final product. The broad objective of this
research is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of scaffolding-mediated viral
morphogenesis, using the Microviridae, a family of small single-stranded DNA
viruses. The functions of scaffolding protein domains are elucidated with
chimeric proteins, constructed between related viruses, or proteins containing a
deletion of a specific domain. These altered proteins only perform a subset of
the natural functions, thus arresting virion morphogenesis at distinct stages.
By analyzing the deleterious effects of these altered proteins and how viruses
can mutate to overcome these effects (second-site genetic analyses), a more
detailed picture of viral morphogenesis emerges. In addition to scaffolding
proteins, protein interactions with single-stranded Microviridae DNA genomes
appear to affect the last stage of assembly. A combination of genetic and
structural approaches (X-ray crystallography) will be used to further elucidate
this relatively new phenomenon. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The
project includes the scientific education of graduate and undergraduate students
in the Principal Investigator's laboratory. In addition, viral and host cell
strains generated as part of the research are used in a large undergraduate
Microbiology course, taught by the Principal Investigator, to illustrate the
concepts of both classical and molecular genetics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
