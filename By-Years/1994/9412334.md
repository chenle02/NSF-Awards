This work, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, is focused
on the development of Fourier transform - ion cyclotron resonance mass
spectrometry for the structural characterization of peptides in the 1,000 to
10,000 Dalton molecular weight range. Laser desorption of neutral species,
followed by chemical ionization, is used to generate the ions, which are then
analyzed using tandem mass spectrometry. Techniques that involve refocusing the
ions in the center of the ion cyclotron cell will be developed to improve
sensitivity, and different chemical ionization reagents, including metal ions,
will be explored to provide maximum information about the peptide sequence.
Professor Amster and his graduate students at the University of Georgia will
investigate improved methods for the characterization of peptides using mass
spectrometry. Reactions between laser desorption molecules and gas-phase ionic
reagents will be studied. Advances in this area have important implications for
biotechnology, including the characterization of new peptide drugs.
