This award is made under the high performance connections portion of NCRI's
"Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64. It provides partial
support for two years to upgrade an existing OC-3c network to OC-12c and extend
the network to other Georgia research institutions. The existing network
connects the Georgia Center for Advanced Telecommunications Technology (GCATT)
with other parts of the Georgia Tech campus. The other Georgia higher education
institutions involved are Georgia State University, Clark-Atlanta University,
and Emory University's Crawford Long Hospital. The upgraded network also will
link to Peachnet, the University System of Georgia's internet. Advanced
applications are concentrated in three strategic areas: environmental
technologies, advanced telecommunications, and biotechnology, including human
genetics.
