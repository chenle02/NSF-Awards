The scientific component of this CAREER project focuses on single-molecule
explorations of RNA and ribonucleoproteins (RNP) enzymes. The work involves the
study of the folding/assembly dynamics of RNA and RNP enzymes at the single-
molecule level using fluorescence spectroscopy and will explore the correlation
between the structural dynamics and function. Specifically, the work will entail
1) a study of the structural dynamics of small RNA enzymes including the hairpin
ribozyme to reveal general principles of RNA structural formation and strong
correlations between structural dynamics and catalytic activity; 2)
characterization of the folding dynamics and energy landscape of a large multi-
domain RNA, the group I intron BI5, to explore the capabilities and limitations
of RNA as functional enzymes; 3) elucidation of the structural dynamics of an
RNP enzyme, BI5/CBP2, to reveal the effect of proteins on the structural
dynamics and functional capabilities of RNA; and, finally, 4) as a long-term
goal that will be initiated in this program, exploration of the assembly
dynamics of complex RNP particles such as the signal recognition
particle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project provides undergraduate, graduate, and
postgraduate students a solid and advanced education in the interdisciplinary
area between physics, chemistry and biology. The methodologies developed and
knowledge derived from the work are being incorporated into a new
interdisciplinary course that the PI is developing, Molecular Biophysics and
Biophysical Chemistry. The course material will be organized into a textbook,
which is greatly needed in this new and growing scientific
area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by the Physics
Division in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and by the
Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological
Sciences. &lt;br/&gt;
