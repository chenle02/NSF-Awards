9552863 Carl This Local Systemic Change project will enhance all elementary
teachers in 60 out of the 130 elementary schools in Clark County (CCSD). It is a
five year project that will begin with 10 schools, then bring in 20 more and
finally 30 more to reach a total of 2,040 teachers. The effort will be centered
around 6 Teachers on Special Assignment (TOSA's), 50 teacher leaders and 20
administrators. Each teacher will be engaged in over 100 hours of professional
development over three years. Approximately 40 hours will be based in classroom
settings. TOSA's will support teachers to implement newly adopted science and
math modules. Each TOSA will spend full days in assigned schools but much of
their leadership work will take place after school, on Saturdays and during the
summer. Professional development activities will target three levels of
teachers. 1. Emerging-introductory institutes for those new to hands on learning
to acquaint them with newly adopted resources. 2. Developing continuing workshop
and classroom support for teachers as they focus on effective use of adopted
exemplary materials. 3. Extending sessions for personal growth and reflection
and for leaders of the reform. The school district is committed to establishing
five materials resource centers which will supply and distribute materials to
all schools. The mathematics and science expertise is provided by a cadre of
external consultants who will deliver the workshops to the teachers. The request
is for $6,000,000 with cost share amounting to $8,108,950.
