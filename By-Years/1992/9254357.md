The proposed project in scientific visualization will enhance undergraduate
courses in science, mathematics, and engineering. It will also improve the
education of undergraduates who plan to pursue a career in teaching science and
mathematics at the pre-college and college level. Students will learn about
using visualization as a tool for discovery and understanding complex phenomena.
In addition, they will also learn about state-of- the-art visualization
techniques that allow scientists and engineers to examine huge amounts of data
with higher efficiency and greater comprehension. Finally, students will be
provided with hands-on experience of software packages that are widely used in
the field. the project injects a component into our curriculum that heretofore
has not been widely applied.
