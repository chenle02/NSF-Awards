ABSTRACT

The Berkeley Statistics Department will operate a vertically integrated research
and education program involving undergraduate majors, graduate students,
postdoctoral fellows, and faculty.

The goal of the program is to produce statistically trained professionals who
will contribute to our society in the commercial, governmental, and academic
sectors. The program contains several integrated components. Innovations at the
undergraduate level include curriculum reform, research seminars, and research
experiences for undergraduates. The graduate student component includes
education, mentored teaching experiences, research, and broadening components
aimed at training graduate students to interact in interdisciplinary
environments. The postdoctoral component includes mentored research and teaching
experiences. Recruitment of traditionally under-represented groups into these
programs will be strengthened by the resources of the Berkeley Edge, a campus
NSF-Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate, the goal of which is
to triple minority Ph.D. production in the sciences, mathematics, and
engineering.
