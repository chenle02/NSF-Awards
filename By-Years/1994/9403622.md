In this project the PIs will extend their geochemical modeling work through
analysis of a large suite of basalts from Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans.
They argue that the existing data are few and often not useful for answering
many important questions that have been raised: for example, can it be possible
to map domains in the upper mantle for their trace element ratio
characteristics? It is not even clear as to how much of the differences seen in
the existing data are due to interlaboratory differences. The PIs argue that
incompatible trace elements and isotopic ratios are most helpful in comparing
different oceanic basalts. They are developing ICP-MS techniques to analyze the
basalts from the oceans and ophiolites for strongly incompatible trace elements.
Their objective is to develop models for source mantle heterogeneities, thermal
structure and convection in the upper oceanic mantle.
