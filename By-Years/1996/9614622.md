9614622 Voight The Merapi volcano in Indonesia is currently undergoing an active
phase that is characterized by growth of a lava dome. Previously, this stage of
lava dome growth has been followed by a phase of instability and collapse that
resulted in the generation of hazardous pyroclastic flows as exemplified in the
recent (1994) lethal dome collapse. The primary aim of this study is to shed
light on the processes of dome growth and instability, fragmentation and
pyroclastic flow transportation and deposition using the current cycle of
activity at Merapi as a natural laboratory. The research proposed will comprise
the key US component to the cooperative international research program developed
during the Merapi Decade Volcano International Workshop, held in Yogyakarta last
October. The work plan involves looking at deformation of the lava dome and
effusion rates with a network of geodetic survey stations and telemetered
tiltmeters; positioning rain gauges that will test the impact of storm
precipitation events on pyroclastic flow occurrences; and conducting
stratigraphic and textural studies of the 1994 deposits to provide constraints
on the interior of the previous dome.
