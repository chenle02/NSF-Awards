This Research award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
program supports work by Professor Raymond Schaak at the Pennsylvania State
University to apply concepts from molecular chemistry to the synthesis of
complex one-dimensional inorganic nanostructures. By developing a library of
chemical reactions that transform one type of metal nanostructure into a more
complex one, it will be possible to apply a total synthesis approach to the
formation of inorganic nanowires using the concepts of orthogonal reactivity,
protection/deprotection, and site-specific modification. This research will
generate fundamental new knowledge about inorganic reactions that occur on
nanoscale solids and will lay the groundwork for the synthesis of complex
nanowires with target features that include composition gradients, homogeneous
dopants, core-shell structures, and highly-crystalline regions within complex
nanowire systems. The chemistry is being designed to be simple and
straightforward, making it broadly applicable to a diverse group of scientists
and engineers for widespread utilization. Undergraduate researchers will play a
prominent and active role in the development of these chemical reactions. The
chemistry and target systems will serve as a springboard for open-forum
discussions about scientific ethics that will include undergraduate students,
graduate students, postdocs, and faculty. In the future, these results will help
researchers design next-generation nanomaterials for advancing applications as
diverse as nano/microelectronics, thermoelectric refrigeration, superconducting
interconnects, catalysis, and mechanical actuation.
