This collaborative award is made under the Materials Chemistry and Chemical
Processing Initiative and is supported by the Divisions of Chemistry and
Materials Research. The theme of the research is the synthesis, characterization
and catalytic evaluation of supported alloy thin films prepared from main group-
transition metal cluster precursors. Specifically, iron boride clusters will be
prepared, characterized and decomposed on a variety of supports. The supported
alloys will be characterized and evaluated for catalytic oxidation of methane to
formaldehyde. Solid catalysts known to be effective for the partial oxidation of
methane will be promoted with iron boride films and evaluated. Once the role of
the boride films is understood, the preparation will be modified to optimize the
catalyst activity and selectivity to formaldehyde. %%% Correlation of precursor
structure, thin film properties and catalytic activity will impact both basic
science and applied catalysis.
