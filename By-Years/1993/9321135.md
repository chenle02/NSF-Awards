9321135 Andrews This award is for support for a study to continue development of
a chronology, reconstruct paleoenvironments, and understand the processes
associated with major ice sheet instability (Heinrich events) of the eastern
sector of the Laurentide Ice Sheet over the last glacial cycle. During the
continental glaciation of North America, Hudson Strait drained a quarter to a
third of the Laurentide Ice Sheet and was the major conduit for the transport of
water, sediment, and icebergs from the ice sheet into the North Atlantic. The
fluxes of these materials into the Labrador Sea and North Atlantic would have
had a dramatic effect on the global climate system. A number of cores have been
identified for study that will provide high-resolution records of ice sheet
(Heinrich) events on centuries to decadal time scales. ***
