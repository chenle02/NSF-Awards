Description: This proposal requests funds for the partial support of a
conference on agricultural management in salt-affected areas to be held in
October 1990 in Agadir, Morocco. The conference has as its major objective the
transfer of information and knowledge on ecophysiological problems relating to
saline soils. The PI, Dr. D.W. Rains, is one of the leading active researchers
in the field. The conference is organized in cooperation with the Institute
Agronomique et Veterinaire Hassan II, a staff member of which, Dr. R. Choukr-
Allah, will serve as local organizer. Both the Minister of Agriculture and the
Minister of Interior have been invited to address the conference. Scope: The
five-day conference will include invited participants from 24 different
countries. Lectures and poster sessions will address the following topics:
mechanisms of salt tolerance, genetic aspects of salt tolerance, crop management
under saline conditions, halophyte utilization in agriculture, and soil and
water management aspects of irrigation with highly saline water. NSF support
will help allow seven experts from the U.S. participate in the conference. As
the conference is research oriented and focused on developing country problems,
this proposal fulfils objectives of the Science in Developing Countries Program.
