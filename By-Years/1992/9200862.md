A research program to investigate the dynamics of hole and electron trapping and
detrapping in oxide defects/traps at room temperature and below will be
conducted. Trapping behavior will be studied over a range of electric fields and
incident light intensities, and the research will attempt to detemine whether
charge free regions in gate insulators are defect free or represent coalesced
tunneling regions at oxide thicknesses <6 nm. The study will also address the
distribution and density of defects/traps in insulators which have also been
exposed to ionizing radiation levels that might be encountered during device
processing. The research is intended to resolve several outstanding
uncertainties in this field, and to provide insight into the physical meaning of
neutral defects with cross sections much smaller than an atomic dimension. %%%
This research addresses basic processes in electronic materials, and is expected
to result in a better understanding of these processes, and an improved ability
to fabricate semiconductor devices and integrated circuits with higher
performance and greater reliability.
