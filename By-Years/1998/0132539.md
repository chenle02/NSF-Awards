The objective of this work is to understand and develop the reaction chemistry
of stereogenic organocopper reagents. The scope of reactivity of these "chiral
carbanions" will be explored; specifically a variety of alpha alkoxyalkyl
cuprates and alpha amino alkyl cuprates will be prepared and the
stereoselectivity of their vinylation, acylation, conjugate addition, and
substitution reactions will be investigated. Asymmetric deprotonation and
transmetallation will be used as routes to prepare these reagents and for any
substrate where these routes might fail then stereogenic cuprates will be
prepared by dynamic thermodynamic resolution. Efforts to determine the
structures of the organocopper reagents and kinetics of reactions that provide
the highest enantio- and diastereoselectivites will be undertaken.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
the research of Dr. R. Karl Dieter of the Department of Chemistry at Clemson
University. Dr. Dieter will explore the reaction chemistry of stereochemically
enriched organocopper reagents. The ability to form carbon-carbon bonds in
molecules which are chiral (have two nonsuperimposable mirror images) and make
only one of the two possible forms (a single enantiomer) is one of the most
important problems facing the pharmaceutical industry today. When developed, Dr.
Dieter's work could be applied to the synthesis of nitrogen and oxygen
containing heterocycles with activities as antibacterial agents, CNS agents, and
antiretroviral compounds. Students trained during the course of this work will
gain skills needed by the pharmaceutical industry which now produces a number of
single enantiomer compounds.
