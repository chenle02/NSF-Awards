Release of fine sediment from small reservoirs along mountain channel creates
hazards for aquatic biota, and adversely impacts recreational channel use. One
means of minimizing the sedimentation hazards associated with these releases
would be to specify the discharge regime necessary to flush fine sediments form
channel reaches of critical aquatic habit. This research project will use a
representative case of recent reservoir sediment release to address the basic
objectives of : (1) evaluating the ability of for existing hydraulic models to
simulate sedimentation patterns along the type of mountain channels affected by
reservoir sediment releases; and (2) developing a conceptual model of reservoir-
release sedimentation patterns along mountain channels as a function of channel
geometry, discharge, sediment volume, and grain-size distribution. Data on
channel response to reservoir-sediment release come form the North Fork Poudre
River, Colorado, which had a sediment release in September 1996. Monitoring
along the North Fork Poudre River since October 1996 has created a database of
changes in velocity distribution, bedload and suspended load transport, and
channel geometry as a function of discharge. The research seeks to integrate
existing knowledge so as to most effectively apply that knowledge toward
mitigating a widespread problem. It will provide resource managers with the
information necessary to choose the most appropriate model for a given
situation, as well as providing modelers with specific data on the strengths and
weaknesses of existing models when applied to sedimentation along mountain
channels. It is likely the model study will yield some basic insights into the
importance if increased boundary roughness and secondary flow.
