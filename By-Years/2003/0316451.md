Behavioral and neuroendocrine variation in mammalian mating systems

Jerry O. Wolff and Steven M. Phelps

SUMMARY This research will examine individual and geographic variation in the
expression of receptors for the hormone vasopressin, which affects monogamous
mating in male prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster). Vasopressin receptors
affect affiliative and paternal behavior in males; this dual role may allow
females to choose good fathers as mates. Preliminary evidence suggests that
monogamous traits such as affiliation and paternal care are more common in a
population of voles from Illinois and less common in voles from Tennessee. A
series of field and laboratory experiments will be conducted on voles from these
two locations to determine how vasopressin receptors affect individual
differences in male fidelity, affiliation and paternal care. Experiments will
also determine if females can assess differences in male affiliative behavior
and select mates based on paternal characteristics. In addition to examining
individual mate preferences, field experiments will be conducted to determine if
this trait ultimately affects juvenile survival and population growth rates.
This will be the first study to combine data at the level of gene expression,
individual behaviors, mating system, field demography and population variation.
