This project will deliver in-service training to 75 elementary school teachers
each year for a period of two years. Participants will be drawn from several
School Districts in New York City. The aim of the program is to improve physical
science literacy and to provide techniques and strategies for the inclusion of
current hands-on materials into classrooms. Two workshops will be conducted.
Comfortable Physics Workshop I will introduce and explain those topics necessary
to make elementary teachers comfortable with physics. Comfortable Physics
Workshop II will bridge the gap between the physical concepts and the laboratory
apparatus of Workshop I and the elementary school classroom. Workshop
participants will meet for three hours each week for 15 weeks during the school
year--more often during the summer months. In addition to lecture, lecture
demonstrations, and hands-on laboratory work in both workshops, a project will
be required of each participants.
