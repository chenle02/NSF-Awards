This program is a continuation of the pioneering work of the group headed by
Dr. B.F. Burke, concentrating on the study of gravitational lenses. Extension of
their large survey to the Southern hemisphere is under way, and the discovery of
more of these interesting objects is anticipated. Once identified, these systems
will be utilized to obtain an independent evaluation of the Hubble constant,
using the gravitational time delay effect. Those of the newly discovered
Einstein ring type will also allow definitive determinations of galactic masses.
In addition, the group will use the survey material to search for high-redshift
radio galaxies and quasars, and to study their radio properties.
