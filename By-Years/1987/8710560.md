This effort provides new approaches to optical computation. This is based upon
the direction in which an electric field points in a thin film material. If this
involves a periodically layered material structure such as that consisting of
alternating Gallium arsenide and Gallium arsenide with aluminum added, then this
so-called polarization switching can be enhanced (ie done in a smaller amount of
material). It is this aspect which is new. With the field direction pointing in
a specified direction, say across the film, a one is represented; parallel to
the film, a zero. Thus binary states can be fit into such a polarization
switching mechanism. This is interesting since this naturally leads to binary
logic implementation. The effort in this proposal is thus directed towards
optical signal processing using new data processing devices fabricated in
semiconductor materials.
