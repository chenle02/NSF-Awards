The University of Delaware requests planning grant funds to develop a Science
and Technology Research Center proposal for a South Pole Astrophysics Research
Center to serve as the focus for scientific, technical, and logistical aspects
of astrophysical research in the Antarctic. The goal of the Center is to advance
understanding of the universe through the promotion and realization of
experiments at the cutting edge of knowledge. The Center's activities will
include assisting scientists in determining feasibility of their research and in
conducting it, facilitating collaborations among scientists, providing training,
facilitating international collaboration, providing technical support for onsite
research, and providing a framework for planning and program support activities.
The planning grant funds will support a workshop that will identify significant
astrophysical problems for which observations at the South Pole are critical as
well as additional workshops wherein the center proposal will be developed. The
goal of the proposed center is to make a significant contribution in
astrophysics research. The South Pole is a unique site, and the difficulty of
conducting research there demands planning, coordination, and logistical
support. The Center can provide this as well as play a major role in setting the
agenda for future scientific research.
