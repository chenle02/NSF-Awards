RD Instruments will undertake an SBIR Phase II proposal to continue development
and commercialization of a phased array acoustic Doppler current profiler
(PAADCP). This company has pioneered the use of acoustic Doppler techniques for
a variety of ocean science and applied oceanographic applications. The project
will reduce the size and weight of presently available instruments and make them
more versatile by developing a single phased array to replace the four
independent piston transducers that are now required. A 38 kHz phased array
transducer will have a significantly smaller diameter and be lighter in weight
than the four 75 kHz transducers now used. A fifth beam can also be formed to
add a new capability of measuring vertical velocities as well as lateral
velocities. Its smaller flat shape will make it easier to mount in ships and
elsewhere. Additionally, it is anticipated that it will have nearly double the
profiling range of present instruments. To achieve the objectives, several tasks
will be undertaken. These will include a design trade-off study to validate
theoretical models developed during Phase I concerning the ceramic geometries of
the transducer and their resulting beam patterns. Broadband technology options
will be examined for implementation. The 38.5 kHz ceramic transducers will be
designed and packaged along with the electronics and data management system.
Signal processing algorithms will be developed. There will also be an extensive
testing program in laboratory tanks and at sea in collaboration with academic
ocean scientists. If successful, this new PAADCP could be the next generation
acoustic profiling system and will have broad applications on U.S. and foreign
research vessels and in offshore commercial applications as well.
