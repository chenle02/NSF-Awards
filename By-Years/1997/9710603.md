A data bank of human genetic polymorphisms, mostly protein and blood groups
polymorphisms, including HLA, was generated by the PI and colleagues as part of
the analyses required in the production of the volume, History and Geography of
Human Genes. This database contains allele frequencies obtained from the
available literature on human genetic polymorphisms. The current project aims to
make these data available to research workers on the internet via the World-Wide
Web, together with the set of methods of historical and geographic analysis
already available or currently being developed in the PIs laboratory. This is
especially worthwhile and timely because the Web makes it easier for researchers
to employ existing, sophisticated programs for data retrieval and analysis
without porting them to their own computers. The data to be made available on
the Web will be stored and managed by an object-oriented database system based
on a prototype already in place. This system accepts arbitrary queries and
delivers the results over the Web. The available classical polymorphism data are
identified by geographic and linguistic relationships, and all data will
eventually be accompanied by geographical and linguistic information in order to
facilitate further study the roles of culture and language in the distribution
of contemporary genetic variation. Additionally, the Web accessible database
ultimately will be augmented with new data on classical marker frequencies, new
data on DNA polymorphisms, and unpublished analytical methods being developed in
the PIs laboratory. Updating and maintenance of the database and Web-site will
be ongoing.
