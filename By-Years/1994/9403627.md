9403627 Schwartz The focus of this research is the development of soluble,
"early" transition metal complex reagents and surface-bound organometallic
reagents. In the former area, low-valent titanium and zirconium salen
derivatives will be prepared that will employ helical chirality to guide organic
transformations. In the latter area, oxide surface-bound organometallics will be
used to catalyze the partial oxidation of alkenes. With this reneawl award, the
Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Jeffrey Schwartz of
the Department of Chemistry at Princeton University. Professor Schwartz will
focus his work on understanding reactivity of transition metal complexes so that
new reagents can be rationally developed for use in organic synthesis.
