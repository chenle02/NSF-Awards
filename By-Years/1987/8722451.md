Twenty-five years ago macroeconomics seemed poised for a substantial advance in
quantitative precision and usefulness. The statistical tools of simultaneous
equations modeling had reached maturity and appeared ready to allow application
of then accepted Keynesian theory with steadily increasing scale and precision.
But these expectations of dramatic progress proved overoptimistic. Keynesian
theory no longer represents a consensus; the elegant tools of simultaneous
equations theory are less used than a few years ago. Progress in quantitative
macroeconomic research is currently due to the research of several different
groups with disparate aims and methods. These include work by commercial
forecasting organizations on sustained, practically useful, large-scale contact
with data; rational expectations models that provide realistically complex
interpretative explanations of how observed patterns in the data could arise
from individual and institutional behavior; and methods of probability modeling
that provide an increasingly accurate picture of the uncertainty associated with
model forecasts and policy projections. Communication among these groups is
limited, and progress is slow for all of them because of the shrinkage in recent
years of funding for sustained, scientifically oriented research in quantitative
macroeconomics. This grant supports the creation of the Institute for Empirical
Macroeconomics. The purpose of the Institute would be to encourage research in
empirical macroeconomics and related fields that is large scale, sustained over
time, and reproducible, with quantitative measures of uncertainty attached to
the results. A renewed effort can be expected to make progress, given recent
developments in macroeconomics and in computational capacity. The institute can
play a unique and potentially important role in drawing together the different
strands of empirical macroeconomic research and pushing out more rapidly the
frontiers of computational research in macroeconomics.
