Walter Bowyer and his undergraduate students at Hobart and William Smith
Colleges will investigate the mechanism of Grignard reagent formation with the
support of this forty-two month continuing grant from the Analytical and Surface
Chemistry Program. The surface of the reacting magnesium metal will be
characterized using photomicrography, scanning electrochemical microscopy, and
kinetic studies. The goal of this research is to develop a fundamental, detailed
understanding of the surface processes involved when alkyl halides react with
metallic magnesium to form synthetically important Grignard reagents. Grignard
reagents are among the most commonly utilized organic reagents, however, the
factors controlling the production of these species are not well understood. In
this research project, designed for undergraduate participation, Professor
Bowyer and his students will characterize the mechanism of reagent formation
occuring at the surface of magnesium metal. The results from these studies will
permit much better control of the synthesis of these extraordinarily useful
reagents that are employed broadly in commercial processes.
