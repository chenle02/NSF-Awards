This award will provide 52% of the funds required to acquire and install a gas
source isotope ratio mass spectrometer in the Department of Earth and
Environmental Sciences at Lehigh University. Lehigh University is committed to
providing the remaining funds needed. The mass spectrometer system is necessary
to carry out the PI's research program supported in part by the National Science
Foundation. The main thrust of this research is a study of the processes of
crustal mass and energy transfer using field observations integrated with
analytical data on the distribution of the stable isotopes of carbon, oxygen,
hydrogen, sulfur and nitrogen. Emphasis will be placed on the distribution of
nitrogen in metamorphic rocks of the Earth's crust, an area of research
pioneered by the Principal Investigator. The stable isotope analytical
capabilities of the new instrument will also be used in biochemical and
environmental studies programs at Lehigh.
