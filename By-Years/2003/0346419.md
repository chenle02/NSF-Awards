Professor Robert Weis of the University of Massachusetts is utilizing bacterial
signaling proteins responsible for chemotaxis in Escherichia coli in a new
design for sensors. The idea is to make a self-contained combined receptor-
enzyme amplifier that can specifically bind small molecules of choice, and by
regulating the activity of an associated enzyme, amplify a signal to indicate
the presence of the molecule. Another desirable aspect in the design of these
so-called "chemical detection modules" is their ability to self-assemble, for
use in large arrays. The goal of this project is to engineer the E. coli oxygen
taxis receptor. The work is to 1. alter the binding specificity of the receptor
using site-directed mutagenesis and 2. self-assemble by engineering a protein
attachment that acts as a template for the self-assembly. Two graduate students
will be involved in this work on biologically-inspired sensing.
