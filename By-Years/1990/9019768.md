Progress in the field of knowledge-based programming has been held up because of
the tremendous investment needed to build an experimental testbed. The objective
of this project is to provide an open research system to other investigators by
preparing the Kestrel Interactive Development System (KIDS) for distribution to
educational and research institutions and to provide ongoing maintenance and
support to off- site users. KIDS is a knowledge-based system that supports the
development of correct and efficient programs from formal specifications. KIDS'
features include formal specifications, highly automated support for
correctness-preserving program transformations, ease of use through a point-and-
click-style graphic interface, and representations for a wide varity of
programming knowledge. The system has components for performing algorithm
design, deductive inference, program simplificaiton, partial evaluation, finite
differencing optimizations, data type refinement and other development
operations. Generally KIDS can be viewed as a system for performing semantics-
preserving transformations on complex linguistically- expressed objects.
