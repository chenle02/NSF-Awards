This proposal requests 5 years of support for the SWAB program. The SWAB program
has been successful for over 35 years in keeping tritium (3H) and radiocarbon
(14C) contamination on ships, associated vans and laboratories to a minimum. The
University of Miami proposes to continue testing platforms of the Academic
Research Fleet (ARF), particularly those involved in measuring natural
abundances of 14C and 3H as part of global ocean programs such as CLIVAR and
GEOTRACES, GOSHIPS etc. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The
principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two (NSF 19-602),
providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its
shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research
projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research
program of NSF).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
