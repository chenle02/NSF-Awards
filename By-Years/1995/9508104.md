9508104 Spear This study involves a systematic analysis of nucleation and growth
processes of metamorphic porphyroblasts in regionally metamorphosed rocks with a
wide variety of P-T histories. The primary goal is to examine the processes of
garnet nucleation, growth and breakdown with increasing metamorphic grade from
the first occurrence of garnet within the garnet zone to the occurrence of
coexisting garnet and staurolite within the lower staurolite zone. Research will
focus on a suite of samples collected from western New Hampshire, eastern
Vermont, and the Taconic Mountains near the NY- MA-CT tri-state area. For each
sample, data on the 3-dimensional spatial distribution, size distribution and
compositional zoning will be determined for every garnet within the chosen
volume of rock. The proposed study will be among the first systematic studies to
test the idea that garnet nucleation and growth processes may vary with
metamorphic grade and P-T history.
