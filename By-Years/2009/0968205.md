This project continues the development and application of quantum mechanical
methods to obtain wavefunctions and properties of the most complicated atoms and
ions (transition metals,lanthanides and actinides). These species, which
constitute over half the periodic table, are technologically important in
catalysis, advanced lighting sources, atomic clocks, nuclear waste, semi-
conductor defects, rare-earth magnets, high temperature superconductors, plasma
fusion devices, laser sources, MRI contrast agents, anti-hydrogen formation,
etc.

Many of the techniques and details can be directly applied in molecular and
condensed matter calculations for localized properties. Personnel get trained in
developing computer codes, in analysis skills, and critical thinking, and
generally go into private sector software jobs. There is a good "push-pull"
relationship between the PI and experimenters in universities and national labs
which has benefitted both parties. At times the PI has acted as a provider of
last resort for properties of the most complicated atoms.
