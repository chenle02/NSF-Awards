Tarduno 9418061 The PI will sample several pelagic cores from the equatorial
Pacific to quantify magnetic reduction in pelagic sediments and its relationship
to paleointensity and directional recording. To accomlish this he will collect a
host of rock magnetic (hysteresis measurements, IRM, ARM, K, low temperature
treatments) and paleomagnetic data (demagnetized remanence) and combine these
with information from magnetic separates (XRD, SEM, TEM) and geochemical
analyses (Fe, Mn, S). ****
