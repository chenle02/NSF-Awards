This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative science research
project between Professor George Thomas, Division of Cell Biology and
Biophysics, University of Missouri, and Professor Issei Harada, Pharmaceutical
Institute, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan. This project will attempt to
determine vibrational models for a variety of DNA oligomers for assessing
putative structural markers. Professor Harada will perform the UV resonance
Raman measurements and normal coordinate analyses, while Professor Thomas will
acquire the Raman and infrared data. The objective of the research is to
determine the nature of DNA normal modes of vibration that generate
conformation-sensitive Raman and infrared bands ("conformation markers"). The
bands are important for diagnosing nucleic acid secondary structure in
biological assemblies. They will be rigorously assigned using a combination of
experimental and theoretical methods. The experimental data will be used to
design a force field that accurately reproduces the observed frequencies,
permitting the character of each normal mode to be ascertained (U.S. and Japan).
This approach, which represents the combined application of normal mode analysis
and isotope substitution, should elucidate the vibrational character of DNA
conformation markers and provide for the first time a rigorous and quantitative
basis for empirical DNA spectra-structure correlations.
