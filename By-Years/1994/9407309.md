9407309 Schmidt Arizona State Univ. This theoretical study of Monte Carlo
methods and applications is supported by the NSF Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program. Both variational and Greens Function Monte Carlo theory is
applied to the calculation of molecular electronic structure and to the study of
structure and dynamics of floppy van der Waals clusters. New methodological
developments in Monte Carlo theory include: study of explicitly-correlated
variational functions for electron correlation effects, use of Greengard's fast
multipole method for numerical evaluation of electrostatic potentials,
pseudopotentials for inner core electrons, modified fixed node methods, and the
combination of Monte Carlo and density functional methods. Both ground and
excited states are treated. In particular, the theory is applied to the
calculation of spectral shifts for a diatomic or small aromatic molecule in a
rare gas cluster. Monte Carlo methods constitute a class of numerical methods
for the approximate solution of differential equations using the concept of
random walks through the many-dimensional physical space. In this project, Monte
Carlo methods are applied to the Schroedinger equation of electrons in atoms and
molecules to study electronic spectra and molecular structure. These
mathematical methods are also applied to the Schroedinger equation for the large
amplitude motions of atoms in loosely bonded molecular clusters.
