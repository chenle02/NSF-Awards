This project establishes an interactive microcomputer laboratory classroom in
psycology. It impacts all majors in psychology exposing students to the use of
the microcomputer as an integral part of the research enterprise in psychlogy.
Student experiences include the use of microcomputers for programming of
experimental contingencies, stimulus presentation, data collection and
statistical analysis with human and animal subjects.For those phenomena which
cannot ber directly studied, simulation programs are used. Twelve microcomputers
and ancillary equipment serve a variety of courses and over 100 students per
year. The laboratory is available for advanced student research projects as
well. The provision of software for sharing information and documents should
impress students with the many effective alternatives for developing research
ideas, exchanging experimental data and communicating the results of their
research investigations. This new facility represents a critcal and significant
new direction in the psychology program. The award will be matched by an equal
sum from the grantee. *** //
