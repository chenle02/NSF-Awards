Steven D. Schwartz of the Department of Physiology and Biophysics of the Albert
Einstein College of Medicine in New York is funded by the Physical Chemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division to study quantum operator approaches to
condensed phase and multidimensional reaction dynamics. In this proposal the
evolution operator approach to multidimensional quantum dynamics developed by
the PI will be used to discuss the kinetics of chemical reactions in condensed
media. The technique will be improved and further developed, in particular to
deal properly with nonlinear effects. These results will be used to study proton
tunneling in benzoic acid and proton transfer in enzymes. This research will
develop a first principles theory for chemical kinetics in condensed phase. The
range of application of such work is all of chemistry and biology, within the
limits that the complexity of a first principles approach.
