The University of Utah, in conjunction with the University of Texas at Austin,
the University of Illinois at Chicago, and the University of Washington, will
conduct a Regional Geometry Institute aimed at integrating research and
educational activities in the area of geometry. The participants in the
Institute will include research faculty in mathematics; mathematics educators;
faculty from undergraduate institutions; graduate, undergraduate and high school
students; and high school teachers. They will participate in month-long summer
workshops and in academic year activities at three sites. The guiding philosophy
of the Institute is that research and education in mathematics can and should be
working partners, and that researchers and educators can benefit from one
another. During the first year the research focus will be the geometry and
topology of manifolds and quantum field theory. During the second year the focus
will be on nonlinear partial differential equations in differential geometry.
The educational component will focus on various means of introducing modern
concepts in geometry into the undergraduate and precollege classroom.
