Appalachian State University will purchase a high-vacuum pumping station, an
RF/DC sputtering system, and an electron beam evaporation and etching system.
This equipment will be used to improve instruction in upper-division physics
laboratory courses. Experiments in vacuum technology and thin film properties
will be introduced, and microstructures fabricated with the equipment will be
used in new experiments in opto-electronics. Advanced undergraduate students
also will use the equipment for individual projects. Appalachian State
University will match the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
