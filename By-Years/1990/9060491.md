The objective of this project is to determine the feasibility of producing a
high-performance, ultrafiltration system for removing dissolved organic
materials from water. Specific objectives of the initial phase of this research
include the characterization of surfactant micelles for solubilization of the
pollutants, evaluation of membrane performance and process optimization to
determine the technical feasibility of the process concept. This project
proposes to investigate an innovative concept for removing contaminants from
water by a filtration process through a membrane. This is a Phase I award made
in accord with Program Solicitation NSF 90-31, Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR). The project addresses a significant problem in dealing with
treatment of industrial wastewaters that contain petroleum hydrocarbons and
heavy metals and may prove useful for reducing the environmental impact of those
discharges on surface and groundwater.
