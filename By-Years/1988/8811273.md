Contemporary high-frequency electromagnetic engineering problems can involve
full-vector wave interactions with complex, electrically-large, three-
dimensional structures. Numerical simulation of Maxwell's equations for such
structures is of great importance since the classical analytical tools for
electrodynamics cannot deal with vector near fields that may be almost
arbitrarily complex. Two of the primary contemporary thrusts in numerically
modeling such problems are: (1) the frequency-domain integro-differential
equation approach with solution via the method of moments (MON); and (2) the
time-domain partial differential equation approach with solution via the finite-
difference time-domain (FD-TD) method. This research project will develop
Connection Machine (CM) software for the latest versions of MOM and FD-TD,
construct benchmarks relative to Cray-based versions, and develop scaling rules
for CM processing of ultra-large near-field data bases. This project will also
extend a new spatial decomposition (SD) technique to the latest combined-field
surface integral equation versions of MOM. SD is very promising for reducing the
dimensionality and ill-conditioning of large MOM problems, and may permit
existing computers to process very large EM models.
