This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will help launch the
development of a Metainformation Engine. Every application could be supplemented
by a rich set of links; most items on display screens should have multiple links
tailored to current task and preferences. The Metainformation Engine will
automatically generate links within the majority of computer applications,
generate metadata about the application elements and the relationships
underlying each link (which users can examine for better understanding), and
provide several hypermedia-style services such as annotation. Instead of keyword
search or lexical analysis on the display text, the Metainformation Engine
generates links on application elements based on application structure and
context. These links lead to related elements in the same application or in
related applications or databases. Integration requires few or no modifications
to existing applications. This product will be valuable to enterprises as they
attempt to collect and integrate new and legacy information meaningfully across
corporations and the entire supply chain.
