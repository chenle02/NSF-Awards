Post-mating selection has recently become recognized as a potentially powerful
and general evolutionary force. The overall goal of the research is to
understand the role of post-mating selection, which occurs when gametes from
multiple males co-occur within the female reproductive tract, in the evolution
of the striking diversity of male reproductive traits observed in the Animal
Kingdom. The results will represent one of the first tests of the importance of
this selection for morphological evolution, and should help define a novel route
for trait diversification among species. Using Drosophila bipectinata (Diptera:
Drosophilidae) as a model, the proposed research tests the fundamental
hypothesis of the existence of a genetic correlation between a male-specific
trait and fertilization efficiency. A second major goal is to uncover the
physiological and genetic mechanisms, and their environmental sensitivity, that
contribute to the maintenance of the remarkable evolutionarily potential of such
secondary traits in animals.

The research will contribute to the resolution of long-standing problems in
evolutionary biology: it will advance our understanding of the full scope of
selection in evolution, and of the mechanisms contributing to the formation of
reproductive barriers between populations and ultimately of new species. The
results should inform applied disciplines such as agriculture where an
understanding of how new species arise often can help predict and control the
emergence of pest organisms. Because the research will examine the effects of
ecologically relevant levels of environmental (thermal) stress on fitness
functions, the results should also help predict the consequences of climate
change. The effort will promote teaching, learning and training by involving
undergraduate and graduate students, and a postdoctoral researcher, in the
research and educational activities. There will be a substantive outreach effort
in collaboration with the Cincinnati Nature Center where the PI will train and
teach volunteer educators and the general public.
