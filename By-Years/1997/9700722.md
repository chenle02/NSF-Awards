In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Lisy will study microscopic ionic solutions using both
experimental and simulation methods. The binding between cations and host
molecules in the presence of hydrogen-bonding solvents such as water and
methanol will be investigated using infrared spectroscopy of mass-selected ion
clusters. Aromatic hydrocarbons and crown ethers will serve as models for
peptide aromatic side-chains and ionophores, respectively. Molecular dynamics
simulations will be compared with experimental observations and will be helpful
in interpreting the observations. The results of these investigations will help
the understanding of ion-molecule interactions in solvated media. These studies
will bridge the gap between gas-phase mass spectrometric measurements and
solution-based studies. Interactions between neutral molecules and electrically
charged atoms or molecules, called ions, are of fundamental importance to a
number of areas, including chemical processes in liquid or solid solutions, and
ultimately in biological systems. Similarly, examining gas phase ion-molecule
processes is important for understanding chemical reactions in the upper
atmosphere
