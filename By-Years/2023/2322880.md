This project will support the efforts of a team of undergraduate students from
various STEM disciplines at the University of Virginia. The team will develop a
low cost, non-invasive, effective topical treatment for Staphylococcus-based
cellulitis for the International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM)
competition in synthetic biology. The development and production of this device
will provide undergraduate students with hands-on training in a variety of
scientific areas, including synthetic biology, molecular biology and
computational modeling. The project supports the bioeconomy by introducing
students to and creating an opportunity for student-driven entrepreneurship
within the field of synthetic biology. In addition, student participants acquire
a global perspective on innovation, strategic road mapping, and professional
community, while recognizing structural barriers to fair resource sharing and
access to new technologies. Broadening participation in STEM research is an
important goal of this project.

This project supports the interdisciplinary research training of a diverse team
of undergraduate students at the University of Virginia. The team will develop
skin-penetrating anti-microbial peptides that are specific for Staphylococcus
and that have the potential to be produced at scale. The project will be
developed for the International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM)
competition in synthetic biology. The participants will receive training in a
variety of STEM disciplines, acquire a global perspective on innovation and
strategic road mapping, and have many opportunities to network with leaders in
STEM fields such as synthetic biology, molecular biology and computational
modeling.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
