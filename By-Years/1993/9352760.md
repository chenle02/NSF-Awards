9352760 Nations Digital imaging techniques are used to enhance students'
experiences in both physics and astronomy. Non-science majors (including many
education majors) in a year-long elementary astronomy sequence are using CCD
cameras in observing and laboratory exercises. This a dds a much more
quantitative component to the observation-oriented but largely descriptive
astronomy laboratory course. Science majors in their first (and often only)
physics course, both in the algebra and the calculus-based sequences, can get
laboratory experience with CCDs and digital image processing. This is a
technology they are quite likely to encounter in their future careers. Physics
majors in upper-division courses in optics, experimental physics, and a
required, research-oriented independent study courses will use the equipment as
well. Research opportunities in both astronomy and physics increase dramatically
in both spectroscopy and imaging applications. Laboratories which incorporate
the CCDs are more streamlined, quantitative, and clear than previously. The
systems are easily transported between physics laboratories, which are offered
during the day, and astronomy laboratories, which are at night. ***
