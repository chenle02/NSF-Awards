Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of this project is to
improve the quality of the software design and development education for
undergraduate students in Syracuse University, with contributions to the
understanding of the educational process that will have similar benefits to
other educational institutions in the country. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is
accomplished by adapting and integrating the results of the NSF Educational
Innovations project at the University of Alabama on integrating component-based
software development into the computing curriculum (NSF CDA-9712929).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major adaptation efforts focuses on introducing
component-based software development into the courses on software engineering,
rather than requiring separate courses. &lt;br/&gt;
