This proposal requests funds to bring to Mexico six faculty from universities
and scientific institutions in the United States to participate in a 3-day short
course on the biological basis of behavior. 140 graduate students and advanced
undergraduates from Mexico and other Latin American countries will be exposed to
diverse fields of research with an emphasis on interdisciplinary and integrative
approaches to the study of animal behavior. Faculty will give students workshops
that reveal the processes of conceiving, designing, and executing research
projects in their respective fields. The course will include classes, hands-on
workshops, symposia, round-tables, and student poster presentations evaluated by
the participating faculty. The format of the course and inclusion of faculty
from U.S. institutions is intended to promote more frequent and intense
scientific and educational collaboration between Mexican and US researchers and
students in the broad field of animal behavior and to provide Latin American
students with intensive exposure to theoretical and practical aspects of major
fields of behavioral research. Latin American students participating in the
course will have the opportunity to meet and interact with potential future
mentors in the U.S.
