This research treats spectral theory of Schrodinger operators and elliptic
boundary value problems with indefinite weight functions. Such eigenvalue
problems occur naturally in the study of nonlinear partial differential
equations and are of broad interest in mathematical physics and applied
mathematics. In physics and engineering they arise, for instance, in transport
theory, lasers, crystal coloration, hydrodynamics, and reaction-diffusion.
Professor Lapidus will conduct research on semilinear elliptic equations and the
related topic of eigenvalue problems with indefinite weight. The elliptic
problems are set on bounded domains with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary
conditions. He will also consider Schrodinger operators on unbounded domains
with discrete spectrum. He will investigate both eigenvalues and eigenfunctions,
with special emphasis on extensions of classical asymptotic formulas and
remainder estimates, distribution of eigenvalues, inverse problems, and decay
and oscillation of the eigenfunctions.
