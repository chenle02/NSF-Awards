Dr. Ulibarri will use the support provided from the Minority Research Initiation
Planning Grant to obtain necessary pilot data to prepare a competitive research
proposal. The aim of her research is to understand how gonadal hormones
influence the development of a group of sexually dimorphic motoneurons in the
spinal cord. These motoneurons provide an excellent model for examining the
cellular mechanisms of action of gonadal hormones. Dr. Ulibarri will use state-
of-the-art anatomical techniques to initially define the neurogenesis of
motoneurons in males and females. These data are important to formulate
hypotheses concerning migration and differentiation of these developing neurons.
She will then determine how gonadal steroids affect the development of these
motoneurons. This research should ultimately lead to new insights about how
hormones regulate the production, migration and/or survival of neurons within
this sexually dimorphic system and advance our understanding of the cellular
events underlying the plasticity of the nervous system.
