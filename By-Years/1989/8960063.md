A research program is proposed to develop a new and innovative type of borehole
logging tool for measuring the bulk density of geological formations. This tool
uses a linear induction accelerator (LIA) to generate an intense x- ray beam
which is scattered from the formation. Detectors placed near the accelerator
sense the scattered photons thereby providing a direct measure of density. LIA-
base systems offer substantial advantages over other density logging tools.
Because its intensity is >50X more than that for radioactive tools, the LIA
facilitates higher sensitivity and/or logging speed while offering greater
safety during handling and transport. Also, it will be more rugged, capable of
higher operating temperatures (>175oC), and >3X less expensive than other x-ray-
type logging tool with the following parameters: (1) electron energy >1MeV; (2)
beam current > 50 uA; (3) diameter < 10 cm and (4) cost < $50,000. We propose to
perform three tasks: (1) develop a LIA system design including the accelerator,
its power system and an x-ray converter; (2) perform experiments to evaluate and
select key LIA components and (3) develop a onceptual design for the x-ray
detector system. Success in Phase I will provide a firm foundation for
development of a laboratory prototype logging tool in Phase II.
