This Career Proposal describes a research plan to exploit the holographic
principle as a potential guide towards a unified theory of quantum mechanics,
gravity and matter. The holographic principle relies on the covariant entropy
bound that posits that the area of any spatial surface exceeds the entropy of
matter in adjacent regions. Uncovering the origin of this bound will lead to a
better understanding of quantum gravity. The PI will investigate the connection
between this bound and the stability of matter as well as the uncertainty
principle. The PI also plans to address the apparent tension between string
theory and cosmology and use holography to better understand quantum aspects of
cosmological models. In a broader context the PI intends to give lectures to
High School students at the Berkeley science museum as well as design courses
that integrate cosmology and particle physics that will be web accessible.
