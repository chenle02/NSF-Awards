State U.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: What Does it Take to Succeed in Information
Technology? A Multi-Level Analysis of Stakeholders' Perceptions of Critical
Attributes and the Effects of Stereotype Fit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Washington
State University has been awarded an ITWF grant to examine beliefs about the
attributes of successful IT professional, applying social psychological research
on gender stereotypes and cognitive processes in performance evaluation to the
case of IT professionals. The study will examine associated effects on employee
satisfaction, commitment, and performance. Key research questions include: What
are the desired characteristics of IT workers that are necessary to be
successful in IT occupations? Do the desired characteristics fit men more so
than women? How do evaluation and reward systems impact the retention of workers
in the IT workforce? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
