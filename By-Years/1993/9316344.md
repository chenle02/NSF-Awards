9316344 McCaffrey This research is to study the 100 by 30 km Toba depression,
within the Sumatra volcanic arc. The Toba depression is the world's largest
Quaternary resurgent caldera. It formed 74,000 years ago during a massive
eruption that dispersed over 2800 cubic kilometers of ash over an area of at
least 4 million square km. Toba's magma system is presumably in a period of
repose between major eruptive events. This study combines seismic and petrologic
investigations with the goals of understanding the origin and evolution of the
Toba magma system, the distribution of melt within it, and its relation to deep
(subducted slab) and shallow (crustal) structures. Magma distribution and its
relation to slab and surface faults will be assessed by tomographic and tectonic
analyses of seismological data from shallow earthquakes near Toba, from
intermediate-depth earthquakes in a possible tear in the subducted slab beneath
Toba, and from teleseisms, all recorded on a 48-station seismograph array. This
combined petrologic and geophysical approach will provide valuable constraints
on the evolution and volcanic/seismic activity of large-volume, silicic magma
reservoirs, and of other convergent-margin magma systems. This research is a
component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. *** ??
