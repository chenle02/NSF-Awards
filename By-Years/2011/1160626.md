The project aims at understanding different aspects of the geometry of algebraic
varieties and their moduli. There are two main topics: (1) Effective and ample
cones of moduli spaces of stable curves. This sequence of projects is focused on
the Grothendieck-Knudsen moduli space of stable rational curves. The goal is to
investigate the Mori Dream Space structure of the moduli space; in particular,
give modular interpretations for its birational contractions and give a
presentation for its total coordinate ring. A new point of view is the
interpretation of the moduli space as a Brill-Noether locus of a reducible curve
associated to new combinatorial structures called hypertrees. (2) A study of
higher Fano varieties using minimal dominating families of rational curves. The
main focus is on the classification of 2-Fano varieties and generalizations of
Tsen's theorem.

The broader context of the project is the area of algebraic geometry, one of the
oldest and currently one of the most active branches of mathematics, with
widespread applications throughout mathematics and reaching into physics and
engineering. Algebraic geometry is the study of algebraic varieties, which are
geometric objects defined by the zeros of systems of polynomial equations. The
variation of algebraic varieties is captured by the so-called moduli spaces,
which are themselves varieties with a very rich structure. The project aims at
revealing the intriguing structure of various moduli spaces of curves (which are
fundamental in many areas of mathematics and in theoretical physics). The
project impacts arithmetic and computational algebraic geometry, areas which
have increasing applications in coding theory, robotics, computer vision,
phylogenetics, statistics, etc.
