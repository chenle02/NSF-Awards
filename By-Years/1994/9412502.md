9412502 Georgiou This project is on research to develop new strategies for the
production of catalytic antibodies. The strategies are based on the expression
of a vast number of different antibodies on the E. coli cell surface followed by
screening procedures for selecting the desired molecules from the population.
The selection process will make use of the possible binding between the
fluorescently labeled conjugate of the transition state analog and the antibody
on the cell surface. Cells bound to the transition state analog can then be
selected by fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS). In a parallel study, this
research will attempt to demonstrate the isolation of catalytic antibodies
directly based on the rate of product formation rather than binding to
transition state analogs. Catalytic antibodies have a high degree of selectivity
and activity, but are currently prohibitively expensive for commercial purposes
because of the high cost of isolation and production. Part of this project is on
new approaches to lower this cost. ***
