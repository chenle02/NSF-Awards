9316504 Baumgartner The project involves a three-year integrated field,
geochemical and modelling study to illuminate the crystallization history of
siliceous marbles in the Ubehebe Peak (Death Valley, California) contact
aureole. Detailed outcrop and aureole scale maps of mineral occurrence (isograd
maps), abundance and textures will be made for the siliceous dolomite mineral
assemblages. This data set will be complemented with stable isotope and trace
element geochemistry of carbonate and silicate minerals within the siliceous
dolomite units. Initial interpretations will employ simple one-dimensional
models to identify promising outcrops for further study. A 2-D finite element
model will be developed which will account for variable-density fluid flow,
conductive and advective heat transfer, stable isotope exchange, and simple
mineral reactions in the siliceous dolomite system. Results of the study will
ultimately lead to qualitative understanding of the evolution of the
hydrothermal system associated with the cooling of the intrusion.
