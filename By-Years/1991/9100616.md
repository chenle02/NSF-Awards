This award funds a continuation of fundamental research on the properties of
very distant radio galaxies by one of the world leaders in this field.
Investigations of these objects will attempt to locate objects still in the
accumulation phase which will later form the early galaxies. The relation
between the optical and radio emission of early active galaxies will be studied
to help explore the origin of the light, emitted in the ultraviolet, which we
see red-shifted into the visible portion of the spectrum.
