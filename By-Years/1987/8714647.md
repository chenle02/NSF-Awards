This research, in chemical kinetics, is supported as part of the Physical
Chemistry Experimental Program. It is important for the understanding of the
basic processes that take place in simple gas phase chemical reactions. A unique
very low pressure reactor has been implemented to study the chemical kinetics,
including elementary processes rate constants, of reactions involving hydrogen
atom addition to allylic species. These reactions will be used to generate
radicals such as the ethyl, isopropyl, tertiary butyl, HO2, RO2, phenyl, etc.
Disproportionation of these species and their reactions with halogen and
hydrogen atoms will be studied. Outputs of this research will be elementary
chemical kinetic data and enthalpies of formation of these radicals as well as
basic information on chemical bonding and reactivity.
