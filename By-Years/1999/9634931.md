Chun DMI-9634931 Droplet deposition is fundamental to droplet-based
manufacturing (DBM) processes. The challenge of this technique has been the
simultaneous control of both geometry and microstructure during the direct
manufacturing of a part drom the molten state. This research project will
develop a high-precision and uniform-droplet deposition system to investigate
deposition phenomena, including microscale process monitoring of the droplet
thermal state and impact dynamics, microstructure evolution and modeling, and
evaluation of spray deposits. This is a collaborative research project between
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Northeastern University. The
research project has a balance between theory and experiment, and will provide
valuable findings for the rapid prototyping industry.
