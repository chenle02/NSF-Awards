This study will assess N-fixation in rhizosheath forming and non-rhizosheath
forming plants. For the first time. The quantity of nitrogen (N) rhizosheath
forming plants obtain from either atmospheric or soil sources will be quantified
15N isotope dilution methods. The function of rhizosheath roots in hydraulic
lift will also be measured. Rhizosheath soil may act as sinks for deep soil
moisture supplies (hydraulic lift) or rhizosheath roots may act as barriers to
moisture loss, which can have a direct effect on microbial activity within
rhizosheaths and can significantly alter N-fixation. Research will determine
whether hydraulic lift of moisture reserves from deep roots to rhizosheath soil
occurs and whether hydraulic lift stimulates microbial numbers and N- fixation
in rhizosheaths.
