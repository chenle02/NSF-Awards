Abstract

This project examines the effect of long work hours (?overwork?) on gender
inequality in the U.S. labor market. Overwork is increasingly common as an
established norm in the workplace, especially in high-skilled jobs. Those who
work long hours are perceived to be more committed to their jobs and rewarded by
higher income and more frequent promotions, while those who work fewer hours are
penalized for being less committed to their jobs. This project seeks to identify
whether this overwork phenomenon systematically disadvantages women, who are
less likely to work longer hours because of the normative expectation that they
will have more caregiving responsibilities than men. To this end, this research
will use longitudinal data drawn from the Survey of Income and Program
Participation (SIPP) and a cross sectional dataset drawn from the Current
Population Survey (CPS). The project will employ quantitative methods to conduct
three empirical analyses that assess whether spousal overwork affects men and
women?s employment differently; whether overwork affects women?s occupational
mobility; and whether overwork exacerbates the gender gap in earnings. This
study will help us to understand whether gender inequality in various arenas
perpetuates through the interaction between the gendered workplace and deeply
engrained gendered norms in the family. This will shed light on sources of
occupational sex segregation. By examining the gendered consequences of the
overwork phenomenon, this study will contribute to identifying whether
discriminatory factors are hidden in the overwork culture, an issue that
connects to women?s status in the labor market.
