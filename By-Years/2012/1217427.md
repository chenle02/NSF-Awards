The Chicago School of Professional Psychology will build upon its existing
offerings to develop and deliver a specialized focus in Academic Leadership,
designed to address the compelling need for women faculty in the STEM
disciplines at HBCUs to acquire leadership skills. The program will serve three
cohorts of 15 participants each, each of whom will receive a Graduate
Certificate in Academic Leadership.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impact&lt;br/&gt;With the focus of this project on women STEM faculty in
Historically African-American Colleges and Universities, this project will
contribute significantly to increasing gender diversity in the leadership ranks
at these institutions. By supporting women of color in STEM fields in realizing
their leadership potential, this program will help ensure that students and
faculty in these disciplines will benefit from the skills, wisdom, breadth of
experience and unique perspectives that such women will provide. The model
designed for the TCSPP Academic Leadership Graduate Certificate Program has
promise for broad dissemination across its eastcoast, midwest, and westcoast
campuses and their wide professional networks.
