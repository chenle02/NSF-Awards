The economic dependence of married women on their husbands is an important yet
hidden dimension of inequality in contemporary society. This dependence persists
even among employed wives, who typically earn less than their husbands. This
project will provide a new framework within which to view contemporary American
marriage by constructing and validating measures for three distinct dimensions
of wives' material dependence: the level of actual economic dependence, the
level of economic independence possible if homemaker wives were employed full-
time, and the degree to which wives are dependent upon their husbands for social
prestige. The theoretical importance of these concepts will be examined by
testing the explanatory power of models derived from sex-role socialization
theory (the internalization of attitudes and aspirations as a result of early
childhood upbringing) and a structural gender stratification theory (the
concrete context of work and family which either pushes women out of the labor
force or pulls them into it as lifetime workers) for predicting the level of
individual women's dependence. Using data from the Career Development Study from
the state of Washington and from the cross- sectional, national probability
sample of the National Survey of Families and Households, these measures of
material dependence will be used to predict indicators of gender equity within
marriage. This project will fill a major gap in the sociological study of
marriage and the family, contributing to our understanding of their nature and
functioning and yielding knowledge about the consequences of economic dependence
on the division of household labor as well as on wife abuse.
