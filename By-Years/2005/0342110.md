Abstract: DMS-0342110&lt;br/&gt;PI: John Erik Fornaess, U
Michigan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract; There is a three month program (Nov 24th
2003-Feb 20th, 2004) at Institut Henri Poincare in Paris on: Complex Analysis
and Applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main themes are:&lt;br/&gt; 1. Radon
transform and applications (inverse problems)&lt;br/&gt; 2. d-bar equation and
Complex Geometry&lt;br/&gt; 3. Several complex variables
dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The program will include, courses, series of
lectures on recent progress, and three one week workshop, one for each theme. It
is an opportunity to introduce young researchers to the most striking
development in Several Complex Variables. There will be an emphasis on interplay
between the various techniques and on applications (short courses on
applications of complex analysis to economy and tomography).&lt;br/&gt;
