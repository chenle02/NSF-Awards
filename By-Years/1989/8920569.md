This research will study the effects of household environment and parental care
on child health and stress. The research will take place in the West Indies,
where the anthropologist researcher and his students will conduct ethnographic,
survey, and laboratory fieldwork. The project will try to measure child stress
by hormonal assays, and other factors by quantitative observation techniques as
well as standard ethnographic methods. This research is important because it
will provide a test of a methodology for measuring stress that could be useful
in comparative research. The information to be gained about the causes of child
stress, including survey information, medical histories, in depth interviews and
psychological tests have the potential to help explain stress in other
situations of interest to society.
