A VLSI laboratory and design courses are being developed for the electrical and
computer engineering curriculum. These courses provide students with experience
in the development of VLSI-chip products. In this setting, students form teams
and undertake the whole design process: logic design, gate-level, layout-level,
simulation/verification, test generation, and testing of the returned prototype
chips. The proposed courses emphasize the importance of quality in the IC
products, particularly testing. Students adopt the concept of concurrent
engineering early in their studies of the design and testing techniques, and
problems that arise in the manufacturing and mass production of the ICs are
considered and solved. Design- for-test techniques are studied and their actual
implementation, which makes the IC-chip products easy to test, are carried out
by the design teams.The items requested comprise a benchtop ASIC tester and
logic verification and test generation CAD software, which are essential for the
implementation of Design-for-Test laboratory courses.
