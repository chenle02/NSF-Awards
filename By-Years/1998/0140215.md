In this project funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Bowers will conduct research on the ion mobilities of
molecules, clusters, metal ions, peptides, oligonucleotides, and other
biomolecules. Specifically, work will be done on the energetics and mechanism of
solvation of salt crystals, as well as on the conformations of
polypeptides/proteins and DNA/RNA oligonucleotides. The energetics associated
with their folding, hydration and interaction with metal ions will be
investigated. These systems will be studied in the gas phase in order to avoid
complications due to a solvent effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
attacks fundamental problems on the mobilities of ions and biomolecules in the
gas phase. The results of these studies will be correlated with theoretical
modeling. Graduate and undergraduate students as well as postdoctoral research
associates will participate in this research. They will receive training in one
of the forefront areas of contemporary physical chemistry and be thus prepared
for advanced studies, or employment in industry, academia, or government
laboratories.&lt;br/&gt;
