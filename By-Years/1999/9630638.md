The project will investigate the housing and economic development policy choices
made by city public policy makers in the United States. The goal of this
research is to explain the variation in housing policies among American cities.
The project will (1) determine the effect of inter-city competition on the
initiation and support for affordable housing policy and programs, (2) identify
political factors influence housing policy decisions, and (3) evaluate the
tradeoff between affordable housing and economic development. A stratified
sample of cities with populations of 25,000 or more will be the focus of a mail
survey of principal policy makers including the city mayor. Four cities will be
chosen as case studies based on the quantitative analyses of the survey
responses. The results of this study will provide a baseline for a longitudinal
analysis of city housing policy in 2005. This project falls under the domain of
the Human Capital Initiative.
