9521058 Overpeck This project will examine annually-stratified sediments from
the Cariaco Basin off Venezuela to determine variability in upwelling and
strength of the trade winds during the period of rapid glacial advance and
retreat known as the Younger Dryas interval (8-12.6 Ka). The results will
contribute to understanding how tropical climate varies on short time scales,
and the relation of such changes to variable solar radiation. ***
