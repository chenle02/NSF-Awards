Cryptographic protocols are a fundamental tool to secure distributed computer
applications, but also notoriously hard to design and analyze. With modern
computer applications becoming increasingly complex, interconnected, distributed
and interactive, there is a pressing need to improve the researchers' ability to
design and analyze protocols that go well beyond the traditional problem of
secure message transmission. This research investigates frameworks to improve
the way cryptographic protocols are designed and analyzed, by investigating new
mathematical models of computation specifically targeted to security analysis.
These methods will allow security analysis of more complex applications, and
also to improve public confidence in the analysis itself.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores computation models where time is
only treated implicitly, through logical dependencies. Avoiding the explicit
modeling of time greatly simplifies the analysis of cryptographic protocols,
still capturing timing constraints that are relevant to security properties.
Different communication and security models are considered, and compared to each
other via reductions, with respect to security guarantees, their ability to
capture realistic attacks, and expressiveness in describing protocols of
cryptographic interest. Models are evaluated by exemplifying their use in the
analysis of a set of representative case studies, including Oblivious Transfer
protocols, and protocols for secure multiparty computation. These tools and
techniques will help developers to more easily reason about the security of a
wider range of applications, and lead to more secure and trustworthy software.
