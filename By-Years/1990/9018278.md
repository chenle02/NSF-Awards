This award provides 50% funding for the development of a logging tool for
temperature versus depth measurements in deep and hot drillholes. The logging
tool will be developed by the PI in the Department of Geological Sciences at
Southern Methodist University. SMU is committed to providing the rest of the
funding required for this project. Use of present equipment to measure heat flow
through the Earth's crust is severely limited in depth and temperature, mainly
because of the use of electric cabling to transmit back to the surface.
Consequently, few research quality temperature logging tools can be used at more
than 450K and 3 kilometers. This project will adapt downhole computer and
cryogenic technology to develop a temperature logging tool that is more accurate
than existing ones and capable of operating up to 650K and 5 kilometers. Such
measurements are needed to interpret the heat flow from the interior and its
role in the Earth's thermal budget.
