9411164 Russell This award provides funds to permit Dr. Glen A. Russell,
Department of Chemistry, Iowa State University, to pursue with Dr. Woonphil
Baik, Department of Chemistry, Myong Ji University, Korea, for 30 months, a
program of cooperative research on free radical reactions of nitro compounds.
This research will involve (1) exploring the reason(s) underlying the lack of
reactivity between allylic nitronate anions and 2-halo-2-nitro-propanes when
photostimulated and (2) extensions of the basic SRN1 mechanisms to new types of
free radical chain processes involving electron transfer reactions of aliphatic
nitro compounds. The possibility of achieving cyclization reactions of hindered
phenoxide radicals with a tethered nitronate anion also will be investigated.
The proposed research will attempt to extend general understanding of the
mechanism of certain free radical chain substitution reactions with appropriate
anions (nucleophiles). The collaborators are highly respected researchers in the
field of the proposal. This project is relevant to the objectives of the
U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks to increase the level of
cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the
exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through
collaboration on problems of mutual benefit. Korean participation in the project
is supported by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF). ***
