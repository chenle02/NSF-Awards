9626698 Freed This grant supports the global analysis and differential geometry
group at the University of Texas at Austin. The proposed research concentrates
on the analytic and algebraic aspects of mathematical physics. Research topics
to be pursued include: Chern-Simons theory and the structure of topological
quantum field theory; infinite dimensional integrable systems and nonlinear
Schrodinger equations; symbolic dynamics and branched manifolds; geometrical
structures in nonrelativisitic quantum mechanics. The project also includes
educational activities involving undergraduate students and high school
students. Quantum field theory is an active area within theoretical and
mathematical physics: ultimately, the researchers in this field hope to come up
with a rigorous and unifying framework explaining various basic forces of
nature. Integrable systems constitute an important subarea within the theory of
dynamical systems - a dynamical system is given by a system of ordinary
differential equations; in such a system the rate at which the system evolves
over time is independent of time. Dynamical systems are used to model various
natural phenomena such as population growth and weather systems.
