This award provides funding to the University of Missouri at Rolla for an REU
Site in micro mechatronic systems under the direction Dr. Vittal S. Rao. The
project will involve 12 undergraduate students, who will be placed in teams of 2
to work together with a faculty advisor and a graduate students on a research
project covering topics that include mechatronics, microelectronics and smart
structures. The 8 week research program will consist of research projects, guest
lectures, industrial field trips, and hands-on laboratory experience. At the end
of the summer program each student will prepare a written final report and an
oral presentation on the research project undertaken.
