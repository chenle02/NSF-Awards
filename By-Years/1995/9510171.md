CTS-9510171 Donald Kirwan University of Virginia ABSTRACT The aim of the
proposed research is to achieve a fundamental understanding of rapid
precipitation of pharmaceutical compounds and proteins. Potential applications
are in the production of pure, very fine crystalline pharmaceutical products and
the recovery of biologically active proteins. The research will focus on
measurements of nucleation and crystal growth kinetics, as well as impurity
rejection characteristics under high supersaturation conditions. The influence
of micromixing on such processes will be investigated along with an evaluation
of protein stability during rapid precipitation. The results are expected to
have an impact on the development of efficient separation techniques for the
pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.
