940142 Dunkl This award supports mathematical research on problems arising in
the theory of special functions emphasizing underlying group structures and
extensions to several variables. The analysis involves the study of root systems
using a technique a parametrized algebra of differential-difference operators
associated to finite reflection groups. There is an intertwining operator which
relates these algebras for different parameter values. An important part of the
project will consist of finding integral formulas for this operator for Weyl
groups by means of techniques based on the associated compact Lie groups.
Progress in this topic would lead to more detailed information, such as
asymptotics, about the Bessel functions of Coxeter groups and certain
generalizations of the Fourier transform. Work will also continue on singular
polynomials of Coxeter groups, at topic which connects representation theory,
monodromy of differential equations with rational singularities on the
reflecting hyperplanes of the groups, Hecke algebras and the intertwining
operator. Approximation theory and special functions has fruitful connections
with many branches of applied mathematics such as differential equations,
operator theory, numerical integration, continued fractions and control theory
to name a few. These subjects have close connections with special functions and
related symmetry groups which provide a natural synergism between the
theoretical and applied aspects of this research. ***
