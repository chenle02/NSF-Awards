Research and experience support the assertion that having a more diverse and
inclusive team of individuals improves outcomes in research and training. By
broadening participation for underrepresented groups, we open doors to new ideas
and new breakthroughs. This symposium and related workshop for students in the
biology of fishes, amphibians, and reptiles, will showcase data- and experience-
driven presentations by speakers who will not only discuss the merits of
diversity, equity, and inclusion in science, but will provide training on how to
implement workable strategies for these initiatives. A strong mentoring program
will actively bring and support undergraduate students into the field, which
will have long-term benefits for the scientific community at
large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This symposium and workshop, to be held in
conjunction with the annual Joint Meeting of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists
(JMIH) in July 2021, will promote a more inclusive environment for
underrepresented groups in the fields of herpetology and ichthyology. Increasing
participation in these fields will have dramatic effects across biology. The
goal is to increase diversity and equity through three activities: 1) increase
the dialog among professional societies regarding the importance of diversity,
equity, and inclusion in science; 2) provide support for undergraduate and
graduate students, especially those from URGs, through a network of mentors; and
3) provide an interactive workshop that will enable participants to recognize
the role of social identity in the scientific enterprise equip them to better
serve mentees from diverse backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
