This grant funded by the Organic Dynamics Program in Chemistry provides support
for the research of Prof. Gary Schuster at the University of Illinois. The
general theme of Schuster's research is the creation, detection and reaction
behaviour of high energy-content reactant intermediates. These intermediates
will be generated photochemically and examined by analysis of their chemical and
spectroscopic properties. In particular, one group of experiments will attempt
to generate, detect and characterize a set of novel boron-containing
heterocycles, hypovalent compounds of boron and boranyl radicals. These largely
unexplored substances are expected to have unusual properties of potential
practical and theoretical importance. Other experiments will explore the
properties of electronically excited complexes of dienes and dieneophiles. These
species appear to undergo reactions that yield products not easily obtained by
conventional routes. As time and resources allow, the properties of ylide ions
will also be examined. These high-energy-content reactants are formed by
oxidation of ylides: their properties have never been examined experimentally.
