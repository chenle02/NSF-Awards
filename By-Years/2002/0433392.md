The local infrasound environment in Alaska is rich in both natural and human-
generated sources. Identifying the source and localizing it is a challenge with
many different applications. The Infrasound group at UAF has operated arrays in
Alaska and Antarctica for several years. The primary arrays are comprised of
eight microphones arranged to obtain wide-band operation with no spatial
aliasing over the frequency band of interest. These arrays are operated and
maintained by the UAF group as part of the International Monitoring System (IMS)
of the United Nations Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Office (CTBTO). A
second array of four microphones is operated by the UAF group as a research
array. The group has used this array to test methods of wind-noise reduction,
microphone performance and array performance under varying array geometries. As
part of the process of identifying infrasound signal sources a prototype locator
algorithm was developed that allows estimation of the range to the signal source
for locations of the signals source of up to 10 to 15 times the array diameter.
The locator algorithm has been used extensively in cases where signal-to-noise
levels are high and it appears to be robust. Investigators will continue to
study the method and investigate its behavior under a range of signal-to-noise
conditions, as well as develop an estimator of the variance in the estimates of
range and azimuth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The description and classification of
signal sources will improve the ability to discriminate against known natural
and man-made sources in signal detection operations. The development of an
algorithm to estimate source range to accompany the traditional azimuth
estimates will also benefit the general area of source localization using
acoustic methods. This algorithm should be transferable to any detection program
using arrays of sensors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
