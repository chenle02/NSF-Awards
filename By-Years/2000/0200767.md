0200767&lt;br/&gt;Leonard, Godoy, McDade&lt;br/&gt; This pilot research by three
anthropologists will study subjective and objective quality-of-life in an
indigenous population of lowland Bolivia (the Tsimane') undergoing rapid
lifestyle change. The researchers will develop and field-test new measures of
quality-of-life in order to ultimately test hypotheses about the effects of
economic development. They intend to collect primary information from a sample
of people; to collect repeated observations from the same people and communities
to control for fixed attributes; and to evaluate a broad range of explanatory
variables relating to economic success, nutritional status, and stress.
&lt;br/&gt;This research will be significant in its theoretical advance in
estimating how inequalities affect quality of life. It will advance the
methodology of eliciting information from people about their subjective state of
happiness, and in its broader aspects, will contribute to a more informed
discussion and a new way of thinking about he degree to which economic
development, integration to a market economy, trade opening or globalization
hurts or helps traditional people. &lt;br/&gt;
