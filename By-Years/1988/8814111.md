Large numbers of maps are accessioned regularly by map libraries, where they
are a major source of information for geographers and other scholars. The
process of cataloging those maps is time-consuming, expensive, and prone to
error, however, because many catalogers have little substantive knowledge about
the information contained on the maps. The complexity of information presented
on many maps likely will prevent the complete "automation" of the map cataloging
process, but partial assistance is possible through development of semi-
automatic systems that can be use to rapidly classify much of the information on
maps. This doctoral dissertation research project will conduct a more
comprehensive inventory of the criteria currently used to catalog maps. These
criteria then will be used to define a set of decision rules and develop a
computer-based program to assist nonexperts in classifying maps, and that
program will be tested in an experimental framework to determine if it is faster
and more effective than current methods. The first part of this project will
increase general theoretical understandings about how map information is used to
catalog maps, while the second and third offer prospects for development of a
minor "expert system" that can economically assist in the cataloging process.
This project should help determine the degree to which certain steps in the map
cataloging process can be efficiently handled by nonexperts, thereby freeing
persons more knowledgeable in the content of the maps for more sophisticated
analyses.
