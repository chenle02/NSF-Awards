9614065 Scholz This grant provides $130,000 as partial support of the costs of
upgrading Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory's rock mechanics laboratory and
partial salary support for a laboratory technician. Specifically, these funds
will be used to purchase equipment necessary to upgrade their current triaxial
press for high temperature duty, including a new gas medium servo controlled
confining pressure system and construction of a fluid separator system so that
hot fluids are kept independently contained from cold fluids and at constant
temperature. This system will be used for short term studies (4 days) of rock
deformation under hydrothermal conditions. For longer term (several month)
deformation experiments, five inexpensive triaxial presses systems will be built
that are relatively insensitive to power outages and will be used for studies of
chemical/mechanical induced pressure solution. This equipment will allow the PI
to continue cutting edge research on the impact of solution transport
deformation on fault zone rheology and to document the effects of diagenetic
precipitation and dissolution in the presence of reactive fluids under
deviatoric stress on permeability in sedimentary and fractured igneous and
metamorphic rocks. ***
