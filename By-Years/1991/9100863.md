This award provides funds to The College of Sciences at San Diego University to
direct a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site for Summer/Academic Years
1991-92, 1992-93, and 1993-94. The program will provide undergraduate students
with research experience in the laboratories of a strong group of molecular
biologists who are faculty members of the Departments of Biology and Chemistry.
Both plant and animal science areas are represented among the research interests
of nineteen participating faculty members. Eight students will participate for
two months in the summer and 30 weeks in the following academic year. Students
will be selected from biology and chemistry majors at eight local community
colleges as well as undergraduate colleges and universities in San Diego County,
including San Diego State University. Additionally, students will be recruited
from Imperial Valley Community College and San Diego State University's Imperial
Valley Campus (SDSU IVC). The program design will permit students who commute
from the Imperial Valley to participate in all components of the program during
summer and on Tuesdays and Thursdays of the academic year through transportation
by van to the main campus of the University. Imperial Valley institutions and
three of the eight San Diego County community colleges have diverse ethnic
student populations, especially black and Hispanic. Consequently, the
institutions selected for participation will assure access of under-represented
minority students to the program. Students will participate in laboratory
activities for 40 hours per week in the summer and for 10 hours per week in the
academic year. Both summer and academic year programs will include weekly
(summer) or bi-weekly (academic year) enrichment colloquia which will introduce
students to such topics as ethics in research, academic advising, and career
planning. Student-suggested science topics to improve understanding will be
presented by appropriate faculty members, and the students themselves will
report on their research activities to the group several times during the year.
The primary objective of this project is the encouragement and preparation of
students to enter advanced, especially Ph.D., degree programs in the sciences.
The components of the project should make these highly competitive for openings
in a variety of advanced degree programs.
