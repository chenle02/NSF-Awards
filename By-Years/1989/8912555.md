Horizontal gradients of atmospheric pressure are the fundamental cause of
almost all motions in the atmosphere. Very precise measurements of small
pressure differences over distances of tens of kilometers are important for
understanding of forcing functions responsible for extreme weather events. In
general, present day operational instrumentation are not capable of measuring
pressure gradients with sufficient accuracy for some research purposes. In
previous research, the Principal Investigators demonstrated that high resolution
airborne radar altimeters coupled with highly accurate navigational positioning,
allow extremely accurate calculations of pressure gradient forces. These
measurements are considered important to attack some classes of meteorological
problems over the next decade. The Principal Investigators will continue to
develop their measurement technique using data collected from their earlier
experiment. The technique will then be applied to discern important physical
processes associated with upper tropospheric jets, which have been shown to be
associated with severe weather.//
