Isotope ratios in nature can change during equilibrium or kinetic processes
because different isotopes of the same element have slightly different physical
and chemical properties. Isotope fractionation during diffusion is a fundamental
process with multiple applications, including development of methods for
separation of isotopes, correction for isotope ratios in isotope age
determination, examination of atomic scale processes of diffusion, and inference
of history and rate of rock formation. This project will investigate isotope
fractionation during multicomponent diffusion in molten basalts with natural
isotope compositions. Specifically, diffusive isotope fractionation of three
major elements in rocks, K, Ti, and Mg, will be evaluated. The project will
provide a research opportunity for a graduate student. New methodologies and
analytical protocols will be developed that will be useful to many other
researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Isotope ratios of K, Ti ad Mg in existing
well-characterized experimental charges will be measured by pushing the limits
of current SIMS instruments to resolve the isotope ratio variation in the
quenched glass. The isotope data to be acquired will ultimately enable
researchers to understand diffusion mechanisms at the fundamental molecular and
ionic level. The project will also advance the SIMS technique for isotope ratio
measurements and will have applications to isotope fractionation during natural
processes of magma mixing as well as mineral dissolution and growth. This work
will contribute to the fundamental understanding of diffusion and isotope
fractionation in mafic silicate melts. In addition, the results can be applied
to understand magma mixing and mineral growth, and to infer cooling time scales
of rocks. Graduate students will be trained and will attend scientific
meetings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
