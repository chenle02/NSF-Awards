The study of hydrodynamics (HD) is critical in several areas of astrophysics.
One of those areas concerns certain brief phases of stellar evolution, lasting
minutes or even seconds, in which very rapid structural changes can occur in the
star, critically affecting their evolution. The most common of these events in
the sudden core-collapse of a massive star, leading to the explosion of a
"supernova" (SN). It has long been known that the remnant "shell" from supernova
explosions aggregates into filamentary and "elephant trunk" structures that
indicate HD instabilities as the SN blast wave expands into interstellar space.
The most recent observations of the supernova "SN1987a" in the Large Magellanic
Cloud show "finger" shaped structures rich in the element nickel that developed
weeks or even days after the explosion. The Principal Investigator (PI) plans to
use a new HD numerical calculation procedure, the Piecewise Parabolic Method
(PPM) to perform numerical simulations of the detonation and explosion of Type
II supernovae such as SN1987a. The new technique is generally far more efficient
than old ones and will permit calculations to be done in two and even three
dimensions, thereby permitting an understanding of the development of small
structures in these remnants. Moreover, with a Co-Investigator and student, the
PI will utilize a new theory of convection that is essential to understand the
observed swirling of gas "blobs". Many of the heavy elements on the Earth are
synthesized during the critical moments following this explosion. It now seems
that heavy elements such as nickel are synthesized unevenly in the small
"finger" structures. This project should provide some understanding of how and
why this uneven formation of heavy elements occurs. The techniques and computer
programs developed for this study are expected to find future application in
several other astrophysical contexts, such as Type I supernovae (accreted matter
on a hot white dwarf from a double star companion), pulsation in large amplitude
variable stars, and convection in stable stars such as the Sun.
