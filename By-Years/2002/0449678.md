CAREER: THE FORMATION EPOCH OF MASSIVE
GALAXIES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AST 0449678 Pieter
van Dokkum&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Pieter van Dokkum, at Yale University, will
undertake a program to provide information on the number of massive galaxies in
the early universe, with an ultimate goal of constraining theories for galaxy
formation. He will determine the number density, clustering properties, and
physical properties of a population of high redshift galaxies with colors that
are similar to nearby ones, suggesting a possible evolutionary connection. With
this work, Dr. van Dokkum will investigate whether massive galaxies were
assembled when the universe was ~2 billion years old, or if they consisted
instead of small substructures, as predicted by many
theories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along with involving undergraduate, graduate and
postdoctoral personnel in the research, the CAREER related educational plan will
build upon the science education and public outreach (EPO) program of the Yale
Peabody Museum for Natural History. Dr. van Dokkum will add astronomy EPO
programming, and build bilingual relations with the Hispanic and Latino
communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
