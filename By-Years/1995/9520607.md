9520607 Rowe This research involves determination of the evolutionary
relationships among fossil marine reptiles. Morphological, morphometric and
biogeographical evidence will be evaluated. The proposed research will yield
significant new phylogenetic information regarding the interrelationships of
members of this reptilian family. In addition the study will provide an
evaluation of different methods for recovery of the best estimate of amniote
phylogeny. A final consideration will be the power of a phylogemy to predict
morphological changes.
