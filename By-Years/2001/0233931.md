Support is provided for the continued operation of a worldwide network of sites
to view the full solar disk at high-resolution in the H-alpha hydrogen resonance
line. Nominally, each of the 5 stations obtains an H-alpha image every minute
with 1 arcsecond pixel resolution. These unique observations are rapidly
communicated to the solar-terrestrial community, and provide critical contextual
background for the interpretation of satellite data as well as material for
student education and research activities. In-house scientific investigations to
be pursued include, (1) the study of lateral filament oscillations, (2) the
association of filament eruptions with coronal mass ejections, (3) magnetic
field characterization through combined analysis of H-alpha, Global Oscillations
Network Group (GONG), and Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) data, and (4) micro-
flare studies through co-ordinated use of Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic
Imager (RHESSI) X-ray observations and H-alpha network data.
