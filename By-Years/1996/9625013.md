Efficient storage organization and access is of central importance to the advent
of large scale multimedia systems. Multimedia applications, ranging from video-
on-demand (VOD) to medical tele-presense or large scale scientific computations,
involve storage and retrieval of large volumes of information subject to a
spectrum of real-time constraints. Current storage systems are inadequate to
address the needs of multimedia systems. Indeed, various recent experiments in
delivering VOD to populations of several thousand customers have established
storage access as a key barrier to success. There is thus a growing need for a
new generation of high-performance storage technologies that can efficiently
support large scale multimedia systems. The main goal of the proposed research
is to develop novel architectures and resource management algorithms for
multimedia storage systems that will result in orders of magnitude performance
improvements. The main thesis pursued here is that a storage system can exploit
intrinsic, non-random, access characteristics of multimedia applications to
accomplish dramatic performance improvements. This research effort will have
several important contributions to the study of multimedia systems in general
and to their storage technologies in particular. It will seek to characterize
storage access patterns of the broad spectrum of multimedia applications and
study techniques to take advantage of these characteristics in improving storage
and access efficiency. The proposed study will consider the entire storage
hierarchy, study the entire pool of resources and how these resources interact,
as well as devise methods for incorporating application and workload constraints
and characteristics into resource management techniques. Such media-aware,
workload-aware, and application-aware storage organization and access mechanisms
can significantly improve performance of a storage server. ***
