9318942 Kay Forbears of New World Monkeys reached South America some time in
the early Cenozoic, but because of an inadequate fossil record there are only
indirect lines of evidence about when or from where - direct from Africa remains
a distinct possibility. The first record of them in South America occurs at
Salla, Bolivia, and dates to about 25 million years ago. The goal of this
collaborative field project is to collect and date accurately more material of
the earliest South American primates at Salla and possibly elsewhere in Bolivia
and to explore Argentina strata of similar age, and earlier, where it is very
likely ancestral forms should be found. This project will shed much needed light
on the origins of these primates who evolved in parallel with our own ancestors
in Africa. ***
