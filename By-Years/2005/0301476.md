Plesser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;String theory is one of the most challenging and
interesting fields in&lt;br/&gt;both mathematics and physics. Widely considered
the most promising&lt;br/&gt;approach to formulating a complete unified model of
physics at the&lt;br/&gt;most fundamental level, it has also spawned many ideas
in pure&lt;br/&gt;mathematics. The original idea of string theory was that all
fundamental &lt;br/&gt;constituents of the universe were open or closed loops of
string. It &lt;br/&gt;has become increasingly clear that this formulation of the
theory is &lt;br/&gt;incomplete in essential ways. One of the missing pieces is
the phenomenon &lt;br/&gt;known as "D-branes", which naively appear to be
geometric objects of various&lt;br/&gt;dimensions: points, strings, membranes,
and so on, which coexist with the &lt;br/&gt;fundamental strings of the
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A satisfactory mathematical framework for studying
these D-branes, and an &lt;br/&gt;understanding of their physical nature, are
lacking. In this project,&lt;br/&gt;mathematical techniques from algebra and
geometry will be used to uncover&lt;br/&gt;the concepts required for a precise
definition of these D-branes. The&lt;br/&gt;researchers will develop new
mathematical tools, as needed, as well as&lt;br/&gt;apply existing mathematical
tools to attack this problem. The physical &lt;br/&gt;nature of D-branes in non-
trivial backgrounds will also be investigated &lt;br/&gt;in detail, using
methods from quantum field theory and insights from &lt;br/&gt;supergravity. The
insights gained from the study of D-branes will be &lt;br/&gt;applied back to
the physics of gauge theory and string theory, as well.&lt;br/&gt;
