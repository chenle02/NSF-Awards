This collaborative research investigates various problems associated with
parametric empirical Bayes point and interval estimation and measure of
uncertainty of a parametric empirical Bayes small-area estimator when the data
are obtained from a complex survey. In addition, the investigators will conduct
three real world applications of parametric empirical Bayes analysis: (1)
Estimation of U.S. Census undercount; (2) Estimation of the median income of
four-person families for fifty U.S. States and the District of Columbia; and (3)
Estimation of the unemployment rates for fifty U.S. states and the District of
Columbia. There is a growing demand by many U.S. and overseas federal agencies
to produce reliable small area statistics for various subgroups of a population.
Usual design-based survey estimators are not suitable for this purpose since a
typical sample survey being designed for a large population contains very little
information regarding the sub-populations or small areas of interest. The
problem is generally referred to as a small-area (domain) estimation problem in
the sample survey literature. Development of reliable small-area statistics and
suitable measures of uncertainty using information from complex surveys is
extremely important. This research will advance small-area estimation methods.
