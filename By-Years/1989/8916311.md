This research will determine how desaturation of membrane lipid fatty acids is
regulated. Because it has not been possible to characterize most of the
membrane-bound enzymes which catalyze fatty acid desaturation by conventional
methods, the small family of genes encoding the desaturases will be cloned. The
cloned genes and antibodies against the products of these genes will then be
used to measure the amount of desaturase gene products and to examine the effect
on membrane lipid composition of quantitative variation in the amount of
desaturase in transgenic plants. The proposed approach will exploit a unique
collection of mutants of Arabidopsis with alterations in fatty acid desaturation
to facilitate the isolation and characterization of the family of desaturase
genes. Fatty acid unsaturation is a determinant of the quality and economic
value of the product from oilseed species. Because of the importance of
nutritional fatty acids from plants in human health it would be advantageous to
be able to control the degree of unsaturation of the lipids in the harvested
tissue of crop species so that they can be tailored to meet our nutritional
needs. This could be extremely cost effective. Many conceivable mechanisms of
understanding of how the desaturases act, how they are regulated, and having the
relevant genes in hand. Inasmuch as the same enzymes appear to regulate both
membrane and storage lipid composition, the goals of this proposal represent
tangible steps in this direction.
