This project will investigate the reliability and validity of forensic decision
making in the context of the technique of fired cartridge case comparison. It
does so by examining whether inconclusive forensic decisions result from truly
ambiguous physical evidence or from non-evidentiary factors. The project
additionally will study whether pattern evidence produced by two different
sources is sufficiently distinct to be consistently detected by forensic
examiners.

The project will employ an experimental approach to test the validity of
forensic analyses of fired cartridge cases. Through interrater reliability, the
research will assess the tendency for multiple forensic examiners to reach
similar conclusions when evaluating the same evidence. The project also will
ascertain whether the toolmarks left on fired cartridge cases by two discrete
weapons are sufficiently distinct to be detected by different examiners. These
comparisons will enable the project to test the validity of pattern matching
forensic techniques that necessarily rely on subjective human judgments. As this
research addresses issues relevant to a multitude of forensic techniques, it
will significantly advance knowledge about the probative value of decision
making throughout the forensic sciences.
