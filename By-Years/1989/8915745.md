Theoretically based engineering correlations are developed for prediction of
structure, scaling properties, and growth velocities far from equilibrium in
electrochemical deposition. Structures and structural transitions are correlated
with control parameters and are recorded with high-resolution photomacroscopy.
The principles governing destabilization of an initially smooth growth front and
its dynamic restabilization into a structured aggregate are formulated by
analysis of the diffusion and electric fields with consideration of
concentration, kinetic overpotential, and double-layer charging. Schlieren
photography is used to image the diffusion field around growing aggregates. The
role of the surface overpotential is probed using AC impedance measurements. The
theory developed in this project and the control strategies derivative from it
will have broad applicability whenever electrically induced aggregation is
either necessary or detrimental. Test metals for the experimental verification
are selected to be technologically relevant, so that the results should be
immediately applicable in battery and microelectronic circuit production.
