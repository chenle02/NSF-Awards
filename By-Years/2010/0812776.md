Geometry and topology, always central areas or research in mathematics, have
experienced tremendous developments in recent years. In particular, the fields
of geometric analysis, low-dimensional topology, gauge theory, symplectic and
contact geometry, Gromov-Witten theory and Teichmuller theory have all
flourished. Another important theme in recent years has been the interaction
between geometry/topology and physics. The next Great Lakes Geometry Conference
will bring experts to the University of Michigan to exchange ideas on important
recent developments in these areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Great Lakes
Geometry Conference is a well-established international conference series. The
aim of this conference is to bring together distinguished speakers in a variety
of areas in geometry, topology and mathematical physics which will benefit
students and early career mathematicians at the University of Michigan and other
Midwestern institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
