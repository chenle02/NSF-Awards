The microscale physical topography, or microtexture, of biomaterial surfaces
bears strongly on endothelial and soft tissue cell adhesion and growth on these
surfaces. Ion beam surface texturing technology offers precise control of the
size, shape, and density of micrometer scale texture features. A two stage
project is suggested to investigate ion beam textured organic surfaces as
substrates for epithelial cell growth. The first stage will investigate the role
of surface texture in promoting growth of epithelial cells in culture, and
establish a surface morphology which optimizes the rate at which epithelial
cells plate out of solution onto this substrate. This technique may provide
superior culture vessels for epithelial cells which are difficult to culture.
The second stage will investigate the use of artificial texture on biomaterials
to create an improved skin system for catastrophic burn victims.
