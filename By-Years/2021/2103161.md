The 2021 EDGE (Enhancing Diversity in Graduate Education) Summer Symposium is a
three-day event that addresses mathematical research and professional
development. The Symposium uses a vertical mentorship model to fill in a variety
of gaps (academic and non-academic) that are not guaranteed to be filled by
other means. The community built during EDGE programs is the primary mechanism
that increases retention, access to professional opportunities, and likelihood
that our participants don’t just succeed, they thrive and are propelled into
careers in the mathematical sciences that influence the whole
community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The EDGE Summer Symposium combines research
talks, panel discussions, and formal and informal networking events. The EDGE
Symposium will bring together (virtually and in-person) 75 mathematicians,
primarily an intersection of women and graduate students, and will be hosted by
the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. Participants of the Summer Symposium
discuss cutting-edge research, motivating further discoveries and empowering
less senior participants to strive for similar work. These more junior
participants also receive indispensable career advice, while more established
mathematicians hone their mentoring skills, strengthen their own support
network, and deepen their commitment to influencing the next generation of
mathematicians. In increasing the number of women who succeed in graduate school
and beyond, the Summer Symposium increases the visibility of a diverse
collective of mathematicians, inspiring younger mathematicians to persevere and
become leaders in the mathematical sciences. Further information about the EDGE
