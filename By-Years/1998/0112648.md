I propose to initiate a lending program to share science resources and equipment
with pre-service and in-service teachers and schools in the Monterey Bay region.
K-12 teachers have a great need for access to scientific equipment and for
support in using scientific equipment in their teaching. The University of
California Santa Cruz (UCSC) is well positioned to increase the access of
regional schools to its own scientific equipment through its outreach wing, the
Educational Partnership Center (EPC), and its Division of Natural Sciences. My
Post-doctoral Fellowship in Science, Math, Engineering, and Technology Education
(PFSMETE) involved the acquisition of a basic set of scientific equipment useful
for various kinds of environmental monitoring by K-12 students. The lending
program I propose would use this existing equipment to provide follow-up support
for teachers with whom I worked on environmental monitoring projects during my
post-doctoral fellowship. It would also serve as a seed project for a larger
university-based equipment-sharing programs.
