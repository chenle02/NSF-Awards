The release of calcium inside cells is critically important for such functions
as muscle contraction (including heartbeat) and egg (oocyte) maturation. Calcium
release signals are initiated by local events inside cells known as "sparks" or
"puffs" and these lead to the release of calcium throughout the cell. This
project will test whether the mechanisms that control calcium sparks and puffs
are involved respectively in the physiological process of cell-wide calcium
release in oocytes and the cell-wide release of calcium in heart cells which, if
not tightly controlled, can lead to problems with uncoordinated contractions of
heart muscle (irregular heart beat.) Undergraduate students from the City
University of New York will be engaged with this research project, learning
concepts of both cell biology and the mathematical modeling of biological
processes. The studies carried out by undergraduates will be included in a
"Teaching Resource" publication that will make widely available teaching
materials to which undergraduates have made major contributions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hypothesis to be tested is that mechanisms of puff
termination will encourage physiological, cell-wide Ca2+ release in oocytes
whereas spark termination mechanisms will suppress pathological cell-wide Ca2+
release in cardiac myocytes. In this project, simulations will be carried out to
evaluate how the mechanisms of activation and termination of sparks and puffs
influence event variability within release sites and between sites. The
relationships between Ca2+ sparks, Ca2+ puffs, and the transition from local
events to cell-wide Ca2+ waves will also be simulated, and modeling predictions
will be tested experimentally (using Xenopus oocytes and rat cardiac myocytes)
by measuring variability in Ca2+ sparks,variability in Ca2+ puffs, and how this
influences the spark/puff to Ca2+ wave transition.
