9602209 Austin This study examines informal strategies of maintaining social
order in ethnically complex (Muslim-Christian) Philippine municipalities in the
province of Lanao del Norte on the southern island of Mindanao Although
international attention has focused on the unstable nature of Muslin-Christian
regions around the world, few researchers have addressed the distinct
peacekeeping networks which appear to have at least relative success even in
ethnically diverse Philippine communities. The P.I. will analyze the variety of
Muslim-Christian disputes and grievances in the region and will clarify the
varied peace-making styles which have emerged at the neighborhood and village
levels Particular focus will be given to the manner in which citizen volunteers
have mobilized in an effort to maintain peace and order even in the comparative
absence of official police and government social control agencies. Special
attention will be paid to the role played by the intermediary (bilingual fixer)
who is traditionally sought out to intervene between rival Muslim--Christian
groups. Data for the project will come from in-depth interviews with community
leaders (priests, Islamic dates, village captains, police and court officials
and educators, among others. Analyzing the non-violent, peacemaking mechanisms
appearing in the Muslim--Christian communities and the social context in which
they succeed or fail will provide valuable information to researchers and policy
makers in other world areas experiencing political-religious discord. %%%%
