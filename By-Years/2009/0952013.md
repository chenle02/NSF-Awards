The Science Teacher and Researcher (STAR) program addresses the science and
mathematics teacher recruitment and retention crisis by creating a prestigious
dual "teacher-researcher" career path in an innovative partnership between
universities, K-12 districts, federal research agencies, and industry. STAR
leverages existing federal research and development assets to help prepare a new
generation of science and math teachers equipped with the skills to inspire more
of our nation's students to choose STEM (science, technology, engineering and
mathematics) career paths. The STAR program has three main goals for addressing
the crisis in science and mathematics teaching: 1) enhanced recruitment of high
quality teachers, 2) improved teacher education and professional development,
and 3) improved teacher retention rates. Founded and implemented in 2007 at Cal
Poly, San Luis Obispo on behalf of the California State University (CSU) system,
STAR provides cutting edge research experiences and career development for
teachers during the early critical years. The key experience of the STAR program
is a paid summer research internship in a national laboratory or at a NASA
research center. The internship includes weekly education seminars and workshops
conducted by master teachers, science education faculty, and education staff at
the research facility. By anchoring preservice teachers in a community of
scientific practice, they better understand what it means to be a researcher as
well as a teacher of science or mathematics. This pilot expansion of the STAR
program, based on the success of the program in California, is funding 45 Noyce
Scholars to become STAR Fellows with 20 in California and 25 in new pilot STAR
university-laboratory partnerships in up to five other states. It is increasing
the pool of STAR Fellows who are Noyce Scholars and allowing evaluation of the
impact of the STAR program as a value-added component of Noyce programs across
the country and contributing to the research literature on the impact of
providing research experiences for preservice teachers.
