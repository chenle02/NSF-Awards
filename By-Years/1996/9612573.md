This project will determine quantitative properties and causes of high-latitude
F-region and topside ionospheric zone upflows. The PI will systematically
examine the effects of at le4ast three candidate magnetospheric 'drivers' for
such upflows: (1) effects of soft electron precipitation; (2) downward
magnetospheric heat fluxes; and (3) convection-driven frictional ion heating.
His methods used will be: (1) ionospheric fluid studies, (2) analysis of 200-800
km profiles of ionospheric plasma density, temperature and field aligned flow
velocity measurements, and (3) analysis of DE-2 measurements of ionospheric and
magnetospheric particles and fields. Preliminary investigations the PI has
performed have produced two model-data comparison papers, which indicate in
quantitative detail the importance of the soft electron precipitation effects as
well as the magnetospheric electron heat fluxes. In addition, ion upfluxes
significantly correlate with electron and temperatures, and ion field-aligned
velocities have a direct relationship with the computed ambipolar electric
field. Finally, substantial upflows occur only for soft electron precipitation
average energies less than 100 eV. Further studies will be of widespread
interest to CEDAR and the general ionospheric community.
