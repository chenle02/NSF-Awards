McBryan 9406582 The goal of the proposal research is to develop effective
parallel sparse linear systems solvers for solving the algebraic equations
arising in the finite element discretization of elliptic coupled systems of
partial differential equations. These solvers will be based on domain and
subspace decomposition methods for use in the solution of linear coupled
multicomponent problems, such as the fluid-structure interaction problems. The
emphasis will be scalable, transportable algorithms.
