DNA nucleotide sequences have emerged as the most convincing source of
information concerning evolutionary relationships among species, genera, and
higher level taxonomic groups. Dr. Morris Goodman has been a leader in this
field of molecular evolution, and he proposes continued analysis of gene
sequences among primates and other mammalian groups. This research will help to
clarify relationships within the primates, and between primates and their
closest non-primate relatives. Dr. Goodman will also investigate the possible
correlation between the rate at which a lineage evolves, the mutation rate in
that lineage, and the life span of organisms in that lineage. The proposed
research will attract broad attention from vertebrate zoologists,
anthropologists, and molecular geneticists. A more robust genealogy of mammals
will encourage a wide range of research projects in ecology, behavior, and
biogeography, to name a few relevant fields.
