9318849 Jackson Despite extensive study, the properties of molecular gas in the
nuclei of external galaxies are poorly understood. Previously the molecular ISM
in galaxies has been studied with CO emission, which provides the distribution
and mass of molecular gas. Unfortunately, CO does not directly probe the dense
molecular gas. Dense gas is particularly important because it actively forms
stars and also traces the circumnuclear environment. The Principal Investigator
will develop a new set of tools by observing molecules such as HCN, which
require high densities for excitation. The technology is now in place to map
these species in nearby galaxies at 50 pc resolution. By observing several lines
he will map in detail the density, temperature, composition, and motion of the
dense molecular gas in galactic nuclei. He will perform HCN surveys of a number
of galaxies in order to characterize their dense gas properties.
