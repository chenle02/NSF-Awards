Abstract

The aim of this project is to construct orbits of Hamiltonian systems by
variational methods. The focus is on questions related to Arnold diffusion. For
small perturbations of strictly convex integrable systems in 2 or 3 degrees of
freedom, Mather has recently succeeded in proving a strong form of Arnold
diffusion. For perturbations in a cusp residual set, there are orbits whose
action varies in a fairly arbitrary prescribed way. A major goal of this project
will be to generalize these results to small perturbations of strictly convex
systems in >3 degrees of freedom.

This project deals with fundamental mathematical questions that arise in various
physical application, e.g. the containment of a plasma in a tokomak (for the
production of energy through nuclear fusion) and the question of the stability
of orbits in planetary systems. In each case, it has to do with whether certain
orbits of dynamical systems wander. In the case of the tokomak, the mathematical
questions is related to the physical question of whether the hydrogen atoms in
the plasma collide with the walls of the container; in the case of the solar
system it is related to the question of whether the planets remain orbiting the
sun for all time, or whether the mutual gravitational attraction of the planets
could cause one of the planets to wander away from the sun over a very long
period of time. It needs to be pointed out, however, that this project deals
with a fundamental mathematical problem that originated in the study of physical
problems of this sort; it does not address these problems directly.
