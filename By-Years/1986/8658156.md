Dr. Aziz has been selected as a Presidential Young Investigator. He is active
in fundamental research on kinetics of phase transformations and non-equilibrium
materials, including metastable materials. In the research program for NSF he
will pursue studies of crystal growth using short pulse lasers to achieve rapid
melting and solidification. He will examine defect formation, microstructure,
and segregation in crystals grown by this technique and relate the results to
theories of rapid crystal growth. Dr. Aziz had three years research experience
at Oak Ridge prior to joining Harvard University. He is off to an excellent
start in his career with several publications in the areas of solidification,
pulsed laser melting, pressure effects on crystal growth and icosahedral phase
formation. The facilities at Harvard University are excellent for performing the
proposed program. Funding of a five-year continuing grant is strongly
recommended.
