This project is concerned with a number of interrelated questions about the
cohomology and modular representations of semisimple algebraic groups, along
with their Lie algebras and related finite subgroups of Lie type. Special
attention will be given to the cohomology of line bundles on flag varieties,
where there are many open questions about module structure and vanishing
behavior. For the finite groups, the research will center on injective modules
and on the decomposition behavior mod p of ordinary representations. A group is
an algebraic structure with a multiplication defined on it. These structures
occur commonly in many areas of mathematics, as well as, chemistry, physics and
computer science. Finite groups may be viewed as algebraic sets of
transformations of vector spaces and through these representations, it is
possible to determine their properties and structure.
