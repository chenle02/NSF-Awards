The overall goal of this project is to continue making systematic hydrologic and
meteorological measurements responsive to science community needs on the Kuparuk
River on the North Slope of Alaska, an representative extensively studied
watershed. The project will produce timely high quality, long-term data to
improve understanding of hydrological processes, to detect and quantify climate
induced change, to enable the development of new models of hydrologically
related processes in time and space and to verify remote sensing techniques.
