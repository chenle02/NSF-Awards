The investigator and his colleagues study the computer generation of higher
dimensional curves that interpolate a given sequence of points and are free from
unnecessary oscillations. From the sequence, simple geometric constraints are
found on all interpolating curves that minimize oscillations subject to the
general interpolation constraints and the associated theory allows for the
removal of redundant constraints. Computer algorithms incorporating the
geometric constraints are used to find entire families of piecewise rational
curves from which particular curves are selected subject to additional
application specific constraints. The study is motivated by applications that
involve the design of paths along which objects are to move, such as robotics
and animation. In these applications it is desirable to create motions that are
smooth and free from unnecessary oscillations. This is important, for example,
to reduce the energy used in controlling robots or to create accurate animations
of images from measurements such as those taken to produce medical imaging data.
For such applications, minimizing the number of unnecessary oscillations is
accomplished by imposing the appropriate mathematical properties on a higher
dimensional curve that governs the changes in certain important variables that
dictate the motion. Algorithms for the automatic computer generation of these
oscillation free higher dimensional curves can be used as a basis for many
different applications.
