The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research Phase I project is opening a new, low-temperature range of Diesel
emission control currently unavailable, while providing further flexibility in
Diesel vehicle performance significant for commercial vehicles particularly
those in stop-and-go operations (city-type duty cycles). Its environmental and
societal impacts consist of markedly-reduced Diesel emissions and greenhouse
gases, emission control system downsizing and cost savings, reduced warranty
costs to Diesel vehicle manufacturers and reduced Diesel fuel use. Impacts
further include reduced emission of respiratory irritants from and increased
fuel economy in Diesel vehicles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical objectives
in this Phase I research project are proof of concept, computer simulation of
the underlying complex thermo-chemistry mechanisms and prototyping. The
innovation potentially resolves a major obstacle in reducing oxides of nitrogen
in very low temperature Diesel exhaust, where traditionally injection of Diesel
Exhaust Fluid (DEF; urea water solution) has not been feasible due to risks of
urea crystallization; crystallization itself has been a major warranty challenge
in the Diesel vehicle industry particularly in heavy vehicles such as trucks and
buses operating in city-mode driving conditions. It is anticipated that the
proposed novel mixer will minimize urea crystallization risks, accelerate rates
of thermolysis and hydrolysis reactions in the Diesel exhaust and enable the
Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) catalyst reducing nitrogen oxides (NOx) at
temperatures well below the current limit of 200 Â°C. By removing these barriers,
the technology developed in this project will enable low temperature reduction
of Diesel exhaust NOx, known to both harm human health and increase greenhouse
gases. The proposed innovation will likely also provide economic value
consisting of vehicle component cost savings, major warranty cost reduction and
reduced fuel consumption.
