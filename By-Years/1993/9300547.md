This REU site project will support six undergraduate students engaged in
faculty directed research at Texas Christian University. The activity will run
for an eight-week period. Students will focus their studies on research problems
in computational group theory and graph theory, centering on the study of groups
arising from sliding block puzzles. The research will require some knowledge of
computers and of the abstract algebra software GAP, which the students will
acquire during the project in a self-contained orientation. Students will be
expected to produce papers detailed the results of their work. They will be
encouraged to give presentations at mathematics meeting during the academic
year; in addition, papers of exceptional merit will be prepared for publication
in appropriate journals.
