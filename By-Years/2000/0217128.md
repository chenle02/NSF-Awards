0217128&lt;br/&gt;Chamberlain&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant is for a technical
support person for the stable isotope geochemistry laboratory in the Department
of Geological and Environmental Sciences at Stanford University. The grant
covers the costs of salary for two years. The stable isotope laboratory has
Finnigan-MAT Delta plus XR and 252 mass spectrometers, and both are configured
for continuous flow measurements and have on-line combustion devices for C, H,
and N isotope analyses of organic matter and minerals. The Finnigan-MAT 252 also
has UV and IR lasers and associated extraction lines for the analysis of O
isotopes in silicate and oxide minerals. The technical support person will be
responsible for: 1) assisting in construction of laser lines; 2) routine support
and maintenance of the mass spectrometers; 3) training of students, postdoctoral
fellows and faculty in the use of this laboratory; and 4) analysis of samples.
