This proposal will perform the exploratory work needed to develop millisecond
imaging technologies as a viable tool for ultra-high contrast astronomy. The
direct application of this work is to the development and utilization of the
next generation of extremely large telescopes, currently under construction,
that will be involved in direct imaging and characterization of extra-solar
planets. The discovery, classification, and characterization of extra-solar
planets has stirred the imagination of lay people and professional astronomers
alike. The discovery and characterization of an earth like planet, with
atmospheric chemical signatures of life processes, would have a profound impact
on humanity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adaptive Optics (AO) systems have made
significant improvements in both the imaging spatial resolution and contrast
available to ground-based telescopes. Although an AO system attempts to fully
correct for atmospheric-induced wavefront distortions, a real-world AO system
does an imperfect job, resulting in the "AO residual", a set of speckles in the
image plane that appear and disappear at millisecond time-scales. It has been
shown that these speckles are a major limitation to high-contrast imaging, such
as that involved in directly imaging exoplanets. In the proposed formulation,
the science camera operates synchronously with the wavefront sensor (WFS), so
that the science camera records a speckle pattern that corresponds to the
wavefront measured by the WFS. The resulting millisecond exposures provide an
information-rich dataset containing a random AO residual, measured by the WFS,
that effectively interrogates the optical system and provides new information
about the "non-common path aberrations", which, when corrected, can
significantly improve ultra-high contract astronomical imaging.
