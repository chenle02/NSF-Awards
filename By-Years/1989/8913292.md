Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is a technique that uses
absorption of infrared energy to probe molecular structure. When used in
conjunction with a modern computer, FTIR studies on large numbers of samples can
be conveniently carried out and the resulting data readily analyzed. The use of
FTIR spectroscopy is essential to chemists who are carrying out research in many
important frontier areas. The Department of Chemistry at Louisiana State
University, Baton Rouge, will use this award from the Chemical Instrumentation
Program to help acquire an FTIR spectrometer and data station. The areas of
chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition include the
following: 1) Applications of solid-state deuterium NMR spectroscopy 2) Metal
complexes for multielectron redox reactions 3) FTIR studies of metallocene
complexes 4) Kinetic studies of gas phase models for tobacco smoke 5) Catalytic
studies on bimetallic systems.
