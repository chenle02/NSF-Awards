This project will investigate methods of controlling defect densities,
specifically those of stacking faults and their associated defects, during the
synthesis of YBCO thin films. TEM and x-ray diffraction will be used to
characterize the microstructures. Thin film will be deposited using off-axis
magnetron sputter deposition. Multilayering will be some of the techniques used
to control the densities of nonstoichiometric stacking faults. Microstrutures
will be correlated with variations in transport properties. %%%% This project
aims to correlate the critical currents with defect densities of the YBCO thin
films. Correlations between the microstructures with variations in the transport
properties will provide better understanding about questions concerning vortex
dynamics and vortex lattice melting. Improvements in the performance of these
films can be expected with this kind of understanding.
