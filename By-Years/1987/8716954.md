This is a study of the organic compounds that are transported atmospherically
from the continents into the Pacific Ocean. The points of inquiry are the
sources of these organics, the mechanisms by which these organics are removed
from the atmosphere, and their contribution to the organics deposited in the
deep-sea sediments. New samples from north of Hawaii will be processed. Then
data from the entire western Pacific will be analyzed. This effort will
terminate the SEAREX project.
