The Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program supports Prof. Kermit Murray of
Louisiana State University for research targeting enhanced understanding and
extended application of laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. Specific
aims are to i) probe particle generation during infrared (IR) laser desorption,
ii) develop IR laser desorption electrospray ionization, iii) apply IR laser
desorption electrospray ionization to chemical imaging, and iv) adapt cyber-
enabled mass spectrometry to enhance research collaborations.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educational aims focus on undergraduate, graduate, and
postdoctoral training with an emphasis on continuing and expanding diversity in
the LSU Chemistry Department. In addition, a cyber-enabled regional mass
spectrometry resource is being adapted to facilitate interstate research
collaboration.
