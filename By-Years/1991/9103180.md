Aggregation procedures are of critical importance to a large number of the
sciences, including engineering, computer science, decision science, statistics,
economics and other social sciences. The purpose of this research is to develop
a mathematical, information theory foundation for several central classes of
aggregation processes. The idea in the development of this foundation is that
the theory may be able to characterize the kinds of faults and paradoxes, as
well as the kinds of desired traits that can occur. It is expected that the
theory will be able to determine the best choice of procedures subject to
specified sets of criteria. This theory will be applied to several specific
classes of procedures coming from diverse disciplines. Thus, it is expected that
several new kinds of results will emerge for computer science and engineering,
decision and choice theory, economics, statistics, ect.
