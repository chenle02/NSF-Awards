A Theoretical and Computational Basis for Micro-continuum Field
Theories:&lt;br/&gt;From Atomic Model to Continuum
Theory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;James D. Lee&lt;br/&gt;Department of Mechanical and
Aerospace Engineering&lt;br/&gt;The George Washington
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of
this proposed research is to enhance the scientific understanding of and to
establish a profound theoretical foundation for mechanics of materials with
micro-structure and micromotion. It includes: (1) the construction of a unified
theory for micro-continuum based on statistical mechanics, molecular dynamics,
nonlocal theory, polar theory and thermodynamics. It will be capable of
explaining and predicting a large class of microscopic phenomena in which the
ratios of the external to internal characteristic length and time approach
unity; (2) the development of a computational basis, including finite element
method and molecular dynamics method, for the above-mentioned theory; (3) the
applications of the theory through the computer simulations to the fields where
the effect of length scale is predominant to the material response.
