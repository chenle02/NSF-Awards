Professor Michael C. Leopold of the University of Richmond is supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to conduct
research leading to the development of chemically modified gold nanoparticles
assembled onto conducting surfaces, known as monolayer-protected clusters
(MPCs), and to use this platform as a functional electrode component for protein
monolayer electrochemistry to probe the electron transfer properties of
immobilized redox proteins, while preserving their biological function.
Experiments will be conducted to study the role of the core size and
functionality of the MPCs, and the dependence of electron transfer rates on
distance through the MPCs. Understanding of the interactions and charge transfer
properties of proteins with these substrates will lead to a better realization
of the potential of MPCs in many applications in bioanalytical chemistry leading
to the development of miniaturized biosensors. This research will involve
undergraduate students in an undergraduate institution in modern research
methods and train them in state-of-the-art instrumentation.
