This award provides one-half the funding necessary to acquire an electron
microprobe that will be installed in the Department of Geology and Geophysics at
Yale University. Yale University is committed to providing the remaining funds
needed for the acquisition. The new electron microprobe system will replace a
21-year old instrument that is now obsolete. The new probe will satisfy the
analytical needs of a number of researchers at Yale. Expanding research programs
in the Department of Geology and Geophysics that require the microanalytical
capabilities of the electron probe include projects in igneous, metamorphic, and
sedimentary petrology, geochemistry, mineralogy, structural geology, economic
geology and archeometallurgy. Research programs in the departments of chemical
Engineering and Mechanical Engineering at Yale are also expected to make use of
quantitative microprobe analysis.
