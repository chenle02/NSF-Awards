This project studies the statistics of estimated rotations with especial
concentration on problems which arise in the reconstructions of tectonic plates.
We propose to adapt our previous work on M-estimators for spherical regressions
to the types of data which arise in such reconstructions. We also propose to
develop methodology for a statistical test of the fixed hot spot hypothesis. One
component of this problem will be to develop methodology for use with contoured
data. We propose to continue our work on splining together fitted rotations and
developing a confidence band for the fitted path. Finally, we propose to
continue our work on Behrens Fisher type problems which arise when data of
different types are used to calculate a reconstruction. This project is to study
the statistical properties of estimated rotations. Such problems arise in the
statistical estimation of the motion of rigid bodies on the sphere and in
Euclidean space or in the statistical estimation of an unknown coordinate
system. Of these potential applications, the most scientifically compelling
application of this line of research is the statistical determination of the
errors in tectonic plate reconstructions. The proposal will concentrate on
studying the types of problems which arise in the tectonic context.
