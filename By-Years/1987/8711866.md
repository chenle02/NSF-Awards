This proposal will pursue phase equilibria for the second and third row
transition elements. Phase diagram analysis will be performed on tantalum binary
and ternary alloys. Descriptions of the phases will be developed consistent with
theoretical results of heats of formation of compound and solution phases.
Isothermal sections will be computed for eight tantalum-base ternary alloy
systems in order to compare experimental and predicted phase equilibria over a
wide range of temperature and composition.
