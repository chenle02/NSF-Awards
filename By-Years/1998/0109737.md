This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project seeks to modify insect
viruses for the purpose of generating a new class of species-specific insect
biocontrol agents. The approach will combine the emerging technique of RNA
inhibition (RNAi) with existing baculovirus technology to generate recombinant
insect viruses capable of targeting individual or closely related insect pests
with great specificity . Standard molecular biology techniques will be used to
engineer baculoviruses containing a portion of an essential host insect gene
inserted between convergent promoters, which when activated by host
transcription factors, will synthesize both the sense and antisense RNA strands
of the inserted gene. This double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecule specifically
inhibits the expression of the corresponding gene in the host insect, thereby
killing the animal. Standard bioassays will be performed in which the
recombinant baculovirus will be delivered to host insects by feeding or
injection, and the LD50 of this virus will be compared to that for an unmodified
baculovirus and for a recombinant baculovirus expressing an insect neural toxin.

The commercial application of this project will be in the market for insect
biocontrol agents. The recombinant insect viruses have the potential to serve as
highly selective and environment- friendly insect biocontrol agents that kill
pest insects faster than unmodified viruses and with greater specificity than
viruses expressing insecticidal toxins that also affect beneficial insects.
