Professor Carl Carlson is a major contributor to problems of interest to low-
energy particle physics and nuclear physics, particularly regarding work on
gluonic hadrons. He proposes to continue his work on perturbative QCD as well as
to develop a dedicated computer for performing lattice gauge calculations. He
also plans to calculate the low-energy nucleon-nucleon interaction from a quark
cluster model. In recent years nuclear physicists have become interested in
problems in the low-energy region of particle physics. This move has increased
the interactions between particle and nuclear physicists concerning problems of
common interest. Professor Carlson has played an important role in the
development of physics in this interface regime. He proposes to do research
regarding the role that the quark degrees of freedom play in determining the
nucleon-nucleon interaction and the properties of atomic nuclei. He also
proposes to build a computer at the College of William and Mary especially for
performing calculations related to these problems. This important research
should help to advance this forefront area of physics.
