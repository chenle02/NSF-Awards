This project supported by the Inorganic Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry Program will support the continuation of studies of transition metal,
homogeneous catalysis by Professor A. Sen of the Pennsylvania State University.
Professor Sen will perform in-depth investigations of two new catalytic systems
that offer promise for selective, metal catalyzed, oxidative functionalization
of organic molecules. The first of these systems is the platinum(II) mediated
hydroxylation of remote C-H bonds in certain functionalized organic compounds.
The second is the rhodium catalyzed hydroxylation and hydroxycarbonylation of
C-H and C-C bonds of alkanes, including methane and ethane, using molecular
oxygen as the oxidant. The catalyst precursors contain no oxidizable ligands so
that there is the possibility that catalyst degradation will not occur. To be
addressed in both cases are the structure and reactivity of the organometallic
intermediates, the nature of the C-H (C-C) activation step, and the mechanistic
origins of the observed selectivities. This research is concerned with the
development of homogeneous catalysts based upon transition metals that may allow
for the selective functionalization of saturated hydrocarbons. Homogeneously
catalyzed reactions typically offer much greater selectivity than heterogeneous
reactions, when they can be used. However, only the latter types of catalysts
are used industrially to promote reactions of saturated hydrocarbons because
known homogeneous catalysts normally are not sufficiently reactive, if they even
react. The initial discoveries upon which this research is based suggest that
homogeneous catalysts may ultimately be used for the selective functionalization
of such molecules. If the catalytic activities are great enough, there is a high
probability that commercially viable processes will result.
