The proposed research employs a unique configuration of fiber-protected carbon
nanotube as a building block to construct carbon nanotube based nano-injector
and nanopore devices for biomedical applications. Advanced semiconductor
processing tools such as focused ion beams instrument will be used to fabricate
these nano-devices. The development of focused ion beam technique to fabricate
nano-device that can be applied to fields of biology and medicine is the main
goal of this proposed research. When coupled with atomic force microscope, the
proposed nano-injector will have the ability to deliver minute but precise
amount of bio-molecules to a specific location inside a living cell with
nanometer spatial resolution. There are several major advantages to use carbon
nanotube as a nano-injector to deliver biomedical materials into a cell: (a) the
aspect ratio of carbon nanotube makes it an ideal candidate for injector
application, (b) the large Young's modulus of carbon nanotube makes it very
strong to withstand bending force, (c) the ideal size of carbon nanotube, so it
will not damage the cell wall during injection. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed nanopore devices could be used to count or sort nanometer size
particles or bio-molecules such as nuclear acids or small proteins. A test of
principle experiment is proposed to deliver plasmid transcription units into
intracellular compartments of a living cell. This research effort will have
broad impacts on cell biology and biomedical research. The proposed carbon
nanotube-based nano-devices such as nano-injectors or nanopore devices could
open up new filed in cell biology. The proposed research on using focused ion
beams technique to fabricate new nano-devices will also contribute to the
development of new fabrication methodology using focused ion beam technique.
This research project will also seek to develop close ties with several local
high schools and community colleges and help to train community college and high
school students.
