The archaeological record pertaining to various regional Mississippian culture
sequences (A.D. 900-1540) is a laboratory for developing and testing models of
change and stability in chiefdom-level societies. Recently, the major thrust of
Mississippian research has been to understand the culture as an adaptive system
and account for the dramatic organizational changes evident over several hundred
years. In order to do this more effectly, tighter chronologies are needed. This
project has two specific objectives: to develop a theoretical model to explain
site variability in Kent phase, Mississippian culture sites in the southeastern
United States; and to develop and calibrate a regional ceramic chronology which
will permit more sophisticated measuring of population trends and settlement
pattern changes during the Mississippian period. The student will excavate two
stratified middens, Clay Hill and the Kent Site, in eastern Arkansas.
Determining the development of late Mississippian society is an important
question in archaeology, one addressed most effectively at a regional level.
