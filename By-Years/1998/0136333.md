ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0136333&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adsorption and
solution complexation exert important controls on the fluxes and distributions
of trace metals in the oceans. However, to understand metal ion adsorptive
behavior requires that the solution chemistry be well characterized. Considering
that yttrium and the rare earth elements (YREEs) have solution chemistries that
are known and are influenced by the same processes that influence other metals
in seawater makes them ideally suited to studies of metal ion adsorptive
behavior. For this reason, two PIs from the University of South Florida propose
to carry out a series of laboratory experiments to determine the adsorption
characteristics of YREEs as a function of particle type and solution chemistry.
For particle type, the PIs plan to utilize -MnO2, a-FeOOH, a-Al2O3, amorphous
SiO2, calcite, aragonite, Ulva lactuca (living/non-living algae) and natural
suspended matter collected in the Gulf of Mexico. The study will use both
synthetic solutions and natural seawater. Results from this research will
provide an improved understanding of processes that exert dominant control on
the distribution of reactive metals in
seawater.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
