This research, part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, is designed
to study the structure and energy levels of reaction intermediates formed during
ion molecule reactions. The intermediates formed will be mass selected, using
mass spectrometric techniques, and then trapped in a rare gas matrix for
spectroscopic investigation. These studies will yield the structures and
vibrational energy levels of the species studied. The expertise developed in
this research will enable mass spectroscopists to determine the structures,
vibrational energy levels and potential energy surfaces of ionic reaction
intermediates in addition to their mass. The reaction intermediates to be
studied include ionic metal carbonyls and ionic metal amines.
