9711165 Monismith This project is for a laboratory study of wave breaking and
the turbulence it induces. A full-field velocity measuring technique (Digital
Particle Tracking Velocimetry) will be used to obtain two-dimensional velocity
fields, from which vorticity, turbulent statistics and dissipation can be
calculated as functions of time. The study will improve our understanding of the
dominant mixing process in the upper ocean, and the data could also be used to
include breaking in Large Eddy Simulations of the upper ocean.
