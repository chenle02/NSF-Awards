This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will determine
the feasibility of using monolayers of bacteria to form hexagonal arrays of
small holes in metal coated semiconductors. Such micron-sized patterned
materials form tuned photonic bandgap structures with narrow band emission.
These narrow infrared line sources allow detection of liquid or vapor chemical
species through changes in absorption. Very high- resolution, high-cost
lithography was required to fabricate proof of principal devices. The proposed
research would significantly lower production costs by as much as a factor of
ten. Phase I research would demonstrate: (1) growth of uniform sized bacteria,
(2) uniform dispersal on a substrate in a hexagonal array, (3) use of inherent
electrostatic repulsion to maintain uniform separation, and (4) transfer of this
pattern to a treated substrate. Varying growth time and size of bacteria alters
emission wavelength and chemical selectivity of the sensor.

Existing infrared vapor sensors, that are more reliable than electrochemical
sensors, are used for high end applications that can afford an instrument
costing hundreds of dollars. The proposed materials development would reduce
costs to below $10 per sensor, $50 per complete instrument, allowing IR chemical
sensing applications to reach mass markets for automobiles or homes.
