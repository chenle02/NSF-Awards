9310686 DYMOND A variety of inorganic and organic chemical substances generated
in upper ocean may be considered indicators of the biological and environmental
conditions existing at the time of their formation. In this study, the principal
investigators will analyze a suite of organic and inorganic bioindicator
substances accumulating in sediment traps deployed during the Arabian Sea
Process Study. By analyzing trap material in time series and comparing it to the
chemical composition of seafloor sediments, the investigators expect to identify
reliable biomarkers generated during monsoon- associated primary production
events that (1) reflect water column primary productivity and processes
affecting primary production and (2) persist in seafloor sediments as potential
palenvironmental indicators.
