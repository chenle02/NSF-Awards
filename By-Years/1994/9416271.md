9416271 Gatz This project is being funded as part of the National Earthquake
Hazards Reduction Program's investigation into the causes and effects of the
January 17, 1994 earthquake. Data will be derived from telephone interviews with
500 individuals who are members of families participating in an ongoing
longitudinal study of intergenerational family relations and mental health. The
focus of the interviews will be experiences during and after the earthquake,
including family involvement in preparedness efforts and the psychological
impact of the earthquake. Analyses will address: the extent to which preparation
is diffused through family networks, and what family-level mechanisms encourage
or impede preparation; the effects of family ties in moderating the impact of
the recent earthquake, and conversely, the effects of the earthquake on family
ties; and age difference in vulnerability. ***
