ABSTRACT

DEB-0209329

Dr. Robert W. Thacker of the University of Alabama at Birmingham has been
awarded a grant to investigate evolutionary relationships between marine sponges
in the family Dysideidae and the microbial symbionts [cyanobacteria ("blue-green
algae")] and other bacteria] that live inside these sponges. Many species in the
Family Dysideidae produce chemical compounds with anti-viral and anti-cancer
properties. Although the porous bodies of these marine sponges can host diverse
microbial communities, the role of microbial symbionts in the production of
pharmaceutically active compounds remains unclear. A preliminary study by Dr.
Thacker suggests that as sponges have evolved and split into distinct species,
their microbial communities have evolved in tandem and are specific to each
species of sponge. This study will examine several species of Dysidea and
related genera from the Western Pacific, Caribbean, and Mediterranean regions.
Sponge DNA sequences and microbial DNA sequences will be compared to test the
hypothesis that sponges and their symbionts share parallel evolutionary
histories. This study will also investigate the placement of the Family
Dysideidae into either Order Dendroceratida or Order Dictyoceratida by comparing
DNA sequences among members of the Dysideidae and selected sponges from the two
orders. In addition, this study will test whether the production of
pharmaceutically active compounds is associated with the presence or absence of
specific symbionts. This research project will provide a rare, direct comparison
of the evolutionary histories of sponges and their symbionts, with an immediate
impact on the fields of sponge taxonomy, drug discovery, and host-symbiont
coevolution. The project will also provide a greater understanding of the
evolutionary histories of sponges and their symbionts, which will accelerate and
enrich the search for new anti-viral and anti-cancer drugs. Increased knowledge
of these host-microbe interactions will directly impact our understanding of all
types of animal-microbe interactions, including those involving humans.
