This project extends the lemma generation heuristics and failure analysis of
induction schemes in an induction and rewrite-rule based theorem prover called
Rewrite Rule Laboratory (RRL). Finding an appropriate induction scheme and
speculation of intermediate lemmas are critical steps in mechanization of proofs
by induction. For theorem provers to be effective for applications, it is
essential that a theorem prover be able to automatically perform inference steps
considered routine in the application domain. This can be achieved, to a
considerable extent, with the help of decision procedure for data structures
used to model the application domain. Further, these decision procedures should
be tightly integrated with other inference steps and heuristics including
simplification (rewriting), generation of induction schemes and their analysis
vis a vis likelihood of success, lemma speculation, and appropriate
instantiations of definitions and lemmas needed in proof attempts. Motivated by
the application of hardware verification, this project seeks to design and
implement decision procedures for data structures including bits, bit vectors,
numbers, lists and sequences, and arrays, and integrate them in the induction
based prover RRL.
