Measurements of the intrinsic anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background
radiation on scales of 7 minutes and 24 minutes of arc will be made using the
Owens Valley Radio Observatory 40 meter and 5.5 meter telescopes at a frequency
of 20 and 32 GHZ. A sensitivity level of Trms/T = 5x10-6 will be achieved on the
40 meter telescope and 2.5x10-6 on the 5.5 meter telescope. At this level
existing theoretical predictions based on detailed calculations are within
reach. In addition to these observations of the intrinsic anisotropy,
observations will be made of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect caused by the
interaction of the cosmic microwave background radiation with the hot gas in
galaxies.
