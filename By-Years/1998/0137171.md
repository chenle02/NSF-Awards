&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0137171&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In
this project, researchers at the Texas A &amp; M University will perform
analysis, quality control, and adjustment of the transmissometer data from the
Hawaii Oceanographic Time-Series (HOT) and from the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series
(BATS) data sets collected during the last decade. These data were collected at
fixed locations in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and provide important data on
seasonal and interannual variations, covering all seasons at both sites. The
unprocessed or pre-processed data reside in the appropriate laboratories, but
several different characteristic errors are in the data, making them unreliable
for modeling and analysis in their present condition. The researchers will
analyze the data, control their quality and make necessary adjustments. The
adjusted data will be used for assessment of the regional and seasonal Beam
Attenuation - Particulate Organic Carbon relationships. After checking and
adjustment, the data will be posted on HOT, BATS and TAMU web-servers. The data
will be analyzed for seasonal and interannual variability and will be made
available to the scientific community for the purpose of modeling ocean carbon
cycles or evaluating the output from existing models. &lt;br/&gt;
