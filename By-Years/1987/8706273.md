Polyhydroxybuytyrate (PHB) can be produced by many bacteria by fermentation and
can be easily obtained in quantity. It would be an excellent thermoplastic; it
lacks toxicity and is biodegradable. However it is too crystalline and brittle
which has hindered its commercial potential. It is, however, possible that these
PHB biosynthetic enzymes could be used to make alternate polyester materials
with improved properties. Thus it is planned to dissect the important and
fundamental mechanism of how this class of biological molecules are assembled.
It will be necessary to clone (or move) the three genes in the biosynthetic
pathway. The genes will be sequenced, appropriate vectors will be constructed
and the resulting three enzymes, thiolase, acetoacetyl CoA reductase and PHB
synthase, will be purified to homogeniety. The regulation of the three genes
will be studied and each purified enzyme characterized structurally and
functionally. The ultimate objective is to shed light on the unexplored
mechanisms of biological polyester formation of PHB analogues. This is an ideal
team to conduct this investigation. Dr. Masamune, a physical organic chemist,
Dr. Walsh, a skilled bioorganic chemist, and Dr. Sinsky an applied
microbiologist. Support is recommended with a high priority.
