This award provides funds to determine the feasibility of constructing an
electro-optical microscope that has the capability of yielding high quality,
quantitative images of three-dimensional semitransparent objects without the
need of physically slicing the specimen prior to imaging. The microscope
generates a reconstruction of the three-dimensional complex index of refraction
of an object by digitally processing multiple Gabor holograms of the structure
using the filtered back-propagation algorithm of diffraction tomography. The
Phase I program has as its principal goal the determination of the practicality
of the underlying microscopic principle in relation to the sensitivity of the
reconstruction procedure to noise and other error sources and the determination
of the imaging performance of such a microscope under less than ideal operating
conditions. A prototype breadboard design of the system will be completed during
the Phase I program.
