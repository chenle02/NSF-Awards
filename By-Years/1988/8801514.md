This research has as its basic theme the development of likelihood and
likelihood-based methods for statistical models in which conventional likelihood
methods are poorly understood or are known to fail. The topics fall into several
main categories. These are semiparametric density estimation, mixture estimation
and testing, composite likelhood, nuisance parameters, and algorithms. This
reseach in the general area of statistics. It aims to extend the scope of
scientific problems that can rigorously analyzed.
