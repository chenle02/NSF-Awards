This proposal describes the design and implementation of VLSI vision systems for
real-time dynamic tasks. The two part career plan develops smart application
specific and general purpose visual computational sensors which may be used with
other intelligent systems to realize solutions to various robot vision and image
processing problems. The three part research tasks are: (1) the development and
implementation of compact VLSI algorithms for image acquisition, edge detection
and motion detection; (2) applications of these algorithms to specific problems
such as image velocitometry, target tracking and rudimentary line-following
auto- navigation and (3) development of a general purpose VLSI computational
sensor which performs image acquisition, edge detection and 2D optical flow
measurement in a single compact system. The goals of the educational component
of this proposal include inclusion of VHDL tools into introductory undergraduate
digital design courses, and the development of VLSI courses in imaging
technology and mixed digital/analog signal processing with fabrication and
testing requirements.
