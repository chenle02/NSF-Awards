Hypervisors are the building blocks of cloud computing. They host the
virtualized operating systems and applications which provide highly-scalable,
pervasive services on a continuous basis. These thin-layer, bare-metal operating
systems create a prime target for attack. A compromised hypervisor grants access
to hosted virtual machines and data stores. Its computing resources can be used
for malicious purposes, including mounting additional attacks. To avoid
detection, rooted hypervisors must not only avoid tripping internal alarms, but
also convince external monitors that they are operating normally. To conceal
illicit activities, they may underreport performance metrics. Although rootkits
can hide unauthorized activity by understating system load, they cannot tamper
with external measures of power usage. This research develops a new method for
identifying compromised hypervisors which integrates energy usage statistics.
This method correlates independent measures of server energy usage with
hypervisor reports of system state to create models of power consumption. The
detection process focuses on hypervisors which appear to use more power than
expected, given reported performance metrics. Three out-of-band tests for
detecting compromise are undergoing testing and refinement. The results of this
research will indicate the effectiveness of energy correlation-approaches at
identifying rooted hypervisors. If successful, this project will provide a
platform-neutral method for cloud management monitors to identify compromised
hypervisors. It reduces adoption risks for organizations and individual users of
cloud services. In addition, it will provide opportunities for graduate and
undergraduate students to developed advanced skills in cloud and data center
security.
