The principal investigator will study an important invariant associated to
elliptic operators on manifolds with boundary. His method will involve
calculation of this invariant, the so called eta invariant, of the boundary
value problem. The research involved here involves a wide variety of areas of
mathematics. The primary objects of study are partial differential operators and
manifolds. What is important is the relationship of certain quantities
associated with both the operator and the geometry of the manifold (a manifold
is a higher dimensional analog of a surface). The principal investigator will
concentrate on one such quantity, the eta invariant.
