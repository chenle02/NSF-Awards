This project is to explore a specific aspect of the control of acetylcholine
receptor (AChR) expression by the motor nerve. The AChR, a skeletal muscle
membrane protein, normally resides within the neuromuscular junction, but upon
motor nerve section appears in large numbers in extrajunctional areas. Cessation
of muscle activity following denervation results in the appearance of protein
factors that recognize specific regulatory sequences in receptor subunit genes
and upon binding activate or derepress them. Short control sequences have been
identified in the AChR a- and d- subunit genes; since these elements are
structurally similar, they are likely to be recognized by the same regulatory
protein(s). In this project, radioactively labeled target DNA fragments will be
used as ligands to identify binding proteins, and resin-coupled target DNA will
be employed as an affinity chromatography matrix for the purification of such
proteins. Findings made in the course of this research will aid in understanding
AChR control and may shed light on how electrical activity regulates gene
expression in excitable cells in general.
