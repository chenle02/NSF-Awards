The complex interactions among macromolecular species in living cells provide a
number of opportunities for evolutionary change to take place in each of the
components involved in the interaction. An important feature of such molecular
coevolution is that the interacting components in one evolutionary lineage can
evolve along a pathway which differs from the same components in another
species. This could lead to adaptively significant differences among species in
the functional properties of the particular molecular system. An investigation
of the functional divergence that has arisen among species in the system
responsible for making the 18s and 28s ribosomal RNAs in mammals is proposed. It
has been found that the nuclear transcriptional machinery from one species is
often not capable of interacting with the DNA regulatory sequences involved in
controlling ribosomal RNA gene expression from other species. The rate of
evolutionary change in the transcription factors and the controlling elements of
these genes will be studied. The analysis of this model system may be especially
significant since it involves the analysis of evolutionary changes in elements
affecting the control of gene expression. Such changes have been proposed by
many to be at the basis of the characteristic differences in physiology,
morphology and biochemistry that have accumulated among species during
evolution.
