Exposure to stress leads to activation of multiple systems such as the
sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)
axis, both of which evolved as endogenous mechanisms to promote survival in the
face of diverse threats. However, considerably less attention has been devoted
towards understanding brain mechanisms that promote functional recovery and
adaptation after the threat subsides. As a result, we have argued that exposure
to intense stressors requires a protracted period of recuperation, and that
activation of inflammatory pathways in the brain as a result of stressor
exposure promotes recuperative behavior. The goal of this project, therefore, is
to determine the mechanisms by which stressor exposure leads to activation of
inflammatory pathways in the brain. The researcher specifically hypothesizes
that activation of central noradrenergic nuclei in response to stress are
critical for activating these inflammatory pathways, while the release of
corticosterone, the major effector molecule of the HPA axis in rat, constrains
the development of neuroinflammation. In this regard, the project employs a
systems biology approach that seeks to clarify the functional interplay among
multiple stress responsive systems at the cellular, neurochemical, and
neuroanatomical levels of analysis. The investigator's laboratory is comprised
of trainees at all levels of the scientific hierarchy (undergraduates, graduate
students and post doctoral trainees) and includes strong representation by
underrepresented populations in the sciences (50% female, 33% minorities). The
laboratory environment is state-of-the-art and contains extensive resources
devoted specifically to promote training and networking for careers in science.
The laboratory also has a strong history, and deliberate plans for,
dissemination of findings to the scientific community (both domestic and abroad)
as well as to the lay public.
