It is important to know the mechanisms, performance and limits of sensory
processing by animals to understand the evolutionary mechanisms forming a
communication system. Conversely, knowledge of the evolutionary context is
required to pose insightful questions about sensory systems and brain function.
The mating calls of insects provide an excellent example of how the senders and
responders have to evolve to optimize uses of acoustic features of the signal
from sender to the receiver in complex acoustic environments. This project
exploits the variety in the call frequency (pitch) in acoustic communication in
four closely related species of katydid, in which the carrier frequencies vary
significantly between species, and which occupy habitats with significantly
different acoustic properties. Orientation behavior toward a call is measured
with a powerful tool of a walking compensator, which monitors the turning of a
walking insect to evaluate the role of temporal and spectral sound pattern
recognition cues. Intracellular recording of identified auditory neurons is used
to evaluate neuronal encoding strategies for acoustic signal patterns. Results
will integrate mechanistic and evolutionary aspects of signal processing to
further understand the interdependence of sensory systems and signal
evolution.&lt;br/&gt; Broader impacts of this project also include launching a
young investigator's career, and multidisciplinary graduate and undergraduate
training.&lt;br/&gt;
