This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will explore the
feasibility of using well dispersed nanocrystals with high thermal conductivity
as functional fillers to improve the thermal and mechanical properties of
electronic packaging materials without sacrificing processibility.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The successful development of nanocomposites will ensure
that advanced packaging technology is capable of facing the challenges from the
future generations of chips and circuits. The main competitors for these
nanocomposites will be traditional filler reinforced composites, and carbon
nanotube reinforced composites. The success of this SBIR project will also
advance the state of the art in the synthesis of wide band bap semiconductor
materials. These materials have unique mechanical, optical and electrical
properties, which will be applied in many different areas, such as lithography,
photodetectors, and light emitting diodes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is
