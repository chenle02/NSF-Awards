Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;#1253199&lt;br/&gt;Yuan,
Baohong&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes to conduct microscopic imaging in
centimeter deep tissue. They have recently, for the first time, developed an
ultrasound-switchable fluorescence (USF) technique that is fundamentally
different from current imaging methods. In this project, they will develop a USF
technique for deep tumor (~2-3 cm) microscopic imaging (&lt;100 ìm). The
technique will be evaluated and optimized in tissue phantoms, ex vivo tissue
samples, and live animals. The research will also be locally and globally
integrated with educations of students, high school teachers and the general
public. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This USF technique will have high spatial
resolution (&lt;100 ìm, like high-frequency ultrasound), and relatively large
imaging depth (~2-3 cm like low-frequency ultrasound. The proposed USF imaging
technique can be potentially used to visualize microscopic structural,
functional and molecular information of a small but centimeter deep tumor. It
can greatly benefit many types of cancer imaging, such as breast or prostate
cancer.
