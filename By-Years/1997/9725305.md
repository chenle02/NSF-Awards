9725305 Severinghaus This award supports a project to develop and apply a new
technique for quantifying temperature changes in the past based on the
thermodynamic principle of thermal diffusion, in which gas mixtures in a
temperature gradient become fractionated. Air in polar firn is fractionated by
temperature gradients induced by abrupt climate change, and a record of this air
is preserved in bubbles in the ice. The magnitude of the abrupt temperature
change, the precise relative timing, and an estimate of the absolute temperature
change can be determined. By providing a gas-phase stratigraphic marker of
temperature change, the phasing of methane (with decadal precision) and hence
widespread climate change (relative to local polar temperature changes) can be
determined (across five abrupt warming events during the last glacial period).
