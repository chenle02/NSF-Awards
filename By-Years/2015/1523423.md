This action funds an NSF National Plant Genome Initiative Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Biology for FY 2015. The fellowship supports a research and
training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to
broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan
for this fellowship to Zachary Lemmon is "Exploring the Role of Meristem Size in
the Diversity of Pepper Plant Form". The host institution for the fellowship is
Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Zachary
Lippman.

How the shoot-tip of a plant develops determines plant form in terms of shoot
and flower production and thus crop yield. This research will contribute to
yield increases in various crops by advancing the understanding of shoot-tip
development in bell and other peppers, which are ideal to study because they
show substantial diversity of plant form. Training objectives for the Fellow
include advanced techniques in molecular biology, computational biology, and
development of an independent research program. Broader impacts include training
underrepresented high school and undergraduate students in plant research,
development of an educational program for 7th/8th grade students covering
current issues in plant genetic engineering, and publication of a web portal
exploring natural variation and current crop engineering efforts.

This research project will address fundamental questions about genetic and
molecular mechanisms underlying meristem size and branching diversity in pepper
and develop reverse genetics technology to apply principles of pepper branching
to improve productivity in peppers and related crops. The project will explore
the relationship between meristem size and plant architecture diversity in five
pepper species. Existing diversity for plant architecture in pepper presents an
opportunity to study how differences in meristem size influence shoot and flower
production. The Fellow will use quantitative genetics to define genetic factors
controlling meristem size and branching. Gene expression will also be examined
with in situ hybridization and transcriptome profiling of developing meristems.
Finally, candidate genes identified through quantitative and genomic analyses
will be targeted by genome editing techniques in an effort to modulate and
improve shoot and flower production. Project outcomes and educational resources
will be available at http://lippmannsf.labsites.cshl.edu/outreach/ with large
sequence datasets available from the Sol Genomics Network at
