9632596 DAVIS A major goal of the U.S. GLOBEC Northwest Atlantic Field Studies
Phase 2, Georges Bank Program is to examine the immigration and emigration
(source, retention, and loss) of target species from the Bank. Toward this end,
a field study is proposed in which focused high-resolution sampling will be
conducted with the Video Plankton Recorder (VPR) to quantify average and
episodic transport processes that move the copepods Calanus and Pseudocalanus
across the boundaries of the Bank during the spring development of these
populations. The major circulation processes to be studied include: 1) the
inflow or source of copepods along the northern edge of the bank; 2) the degree
of closure of the gyre and retention of copepods, and 3) the losses of copepods,
due to mean along-shelf flow to the west as well as detrainment of bank copepods
to the south by eddies and warm-core rings. This project will be carried out
collaboratively with the Brink et al. SeaSoar/(VPR) study (9632349). ***
