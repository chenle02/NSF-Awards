One of the most fascinating structures related to reproduction is the copulatory
plug, a solidified mass derived from male seminal fluid that forms in the female
reproductive tract shortly after mating. This structure occurs in most sexually
reproducing animals, including many reptiles, birds, insects, rodents, and
primates, yet its function remains poorly characterized. To address this gap in
knowledge, a mouse model engineered with a defective copy of transglutaminase IV
(Tgm4), a gene necessary for copulatory plug formation will be investigated.
Preliminary data show that males who cannot form a copulatory plug suffer severe
fertility defects; the main goals of this project are to figure out where
reproductive failure occurs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research also has
broader impacts on the surrounding community. Teachers and students from local
inner city (Los Angeles) high schools will be incorporated into our scientific
pursuits. A one week long Workshop on Molecular Evolution, a "hands on science"
experience that guides participants from initial hypothesis, to experimental
design and data collection, analysis and interpretation, and finally to
publication will be a part of this project. In addition to collecting data
necessary for this project, the Workshop will simultaneously demystify the
scientific process and the university environment for high school students and
teachers alike.
