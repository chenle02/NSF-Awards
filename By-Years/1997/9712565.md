9712565 Valavanis The theme and central objective of the Workshop is Autonomous
Underwater Vehicles for Shallow Water and Coastal Environments. Specific
applications will target shallow water environments related to wetlands and
shallow water fisheries monitoring, coastal studies, monitoring of environmental
pollution due to industrial wastes, offshore oilfield platform and pipeline
inspection and maintenance. An oil spill in wetlands is quite different from an
ocean or beach oil spill. The swamps around river banks and bayous are not
easily accessible to any containment and remediation process. Further, the
sinking oil in water, among weeds, and in sediment materials make it more
difficult to detect, identify and confine. In addition to the already mentioned
difficulties, it is not advisable to use humans for such functions due to the
hazardous nature of the tasks. Thus, a relatively inexpensive AUV equipped with
the proper sensors and controls may provide a viable alternative solution to the
problem. The anticipated outcome of the meeting will be: a clear understanding
of the problem area (shallow water environments), derivation of operational and
mission constraints, and requirements and a suggested AUV architecture to build
such a vehicle. Proceedings will be produced and distributed. ***
