In a world that is increasingly quantitative and one in which computers nearly
are ubiquitous, it is important that all students learn how to think logically
and add fundamental computing skills to their problem solving skills. The
expression of this need is underscored by the countless calls for a well-trained
STEM workforce, yet, in reality, the fundamental computational skills needed for
success in the STEM disciplines are not part of the liberal arts curriculum. The
proposed project's significance resides in its leveraging the expertise of
computer science and liberal arts educators to develop curricular
recommendations that infuse computational thinking into the liberal arts
curriculum. This curricular development has the potential to improve the liberal
arts workforce and better prepare these students to navigate and contribute to
society.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The goal of proposed project is to identify
essential computer science skills that will benefit students in the liberal
arts. Relevant literature and current liberal arts curricula and workforce needs
will be assessed in order to identify gaps between curricular content and
workforce needs. Faculty from computer science and liberal arts will participate
in a workshop to discuss the role of computer science skills and principles in
the liberal arts and then write and disseminate an informed white paper that
will be used to guide future liberal arts curricular development.
