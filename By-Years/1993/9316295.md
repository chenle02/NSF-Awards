Jones 9316295 PI will study the pattern of ontogenetic variation responsible for
one of the best-documented and most discussed cases of phyletic size increase in
the fossil record. Ontogenetic age and growth rate changes will be "teased
apart" by integrated sclerochronologic and stable isotopic (carbon and oxygen)
analyses of growth increments in shell cross-sections. ***
