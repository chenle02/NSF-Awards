This is an award to support research on development of a flue gas monitoring
system for determination of the potential air contaminants in emissions of gases
from combustion processes. The system is based on the application of principles
derived from use of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy in monitoring
nitrogen, sulfur and chlorine in an on-line, diagnostic instrument that can be
used for determination of the quality of effluent gas streams. Exhaust gases
from combustion of fossil fuels and from combustion of solid wastes results in
the production of byproduct gases that pollute air into which they are
discharged. Results of this project are expected to determine the feasibility of
producing an instrument that could be used to monitor nitrogen and sulfur oxides
and air toxics such as hydrogen chloride in exhaust gases from combustion
processes. The proposal leading to this award was submitted in response to NSF
92-30, Small Business Innovation Research under Topic No. 25d, Environmental
Systems.
