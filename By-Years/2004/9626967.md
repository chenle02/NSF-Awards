9626967 Weiner This project aims at experimental tests of novel ultrashort pulse
code-division, multiple-access (CDMA) fiber communications systems. These
systems are enabled by a femtosecond optical encoding and decoding technology,
which uses a passive parallel modulation scheme to achieve Terabit/sec effective
serial modulation rates. Multiple users are accommodated in such a system by
assigning different, minimally interfering optical code sequences to different
subscriber pairs. A unique attribute of optical CDMA is the use of optical
processing, which can circumvent electronics bottlenecks and which potentially
can implement directly in the optical domain certain network operations, such as
addressing and security, which traditionally have been performed electronically.
The impact of the CDMA approach is likely to focus on high performance
applications such as supercomputer interconnects, over relatively short
distances. ***
