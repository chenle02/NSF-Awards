This project improves the general physics courses for life science students
with a new sequence of introductory college physics laboratories that unites
intrinsically motivating medical and life science applications with the power of
scientific computing tools. This project addresses the two introductory college
physics courses at the university by (1) intrinsically motivating applications
and (2) using the computer for data acquisition and analyses. Most introductory
college physics students are enrolled in a physics course in order to fulfill
the requirements for careers in the medical and life sciences. Therefore, an
entire group of students shares common interests that are virtually ignored in
the present traditional physics laboratory sequence. This project develops a
complete set of lessons that focuses on fundamental physics concepts, but also
attempts to motivate the study of these concepts based on medical and life
science applications. Computer technology is becoming an important part of every
day life, but no where is this more true than in the field of medical sciences.
Essentially all scientific data are collected using automated data acquisition
systems and analyzed using computers. If students use computing tools for the
study of medical and life science applications of physics concepts, they have a
unique opportunity to develop their awareness of and sophistication with the
appropriate application of scientific computing tools. In addition, students
develop skills at using large electronic databases to find needed information.
