The effects of the nomination campaign on the general election have been a
concern of political scientists for decades. The concern is based on a
nomination campaign which promotes factions with the party's rank and file
membership. Conventional wisdom believes that the current presidential selection
process is divisive and has negative consequences for the party's ability to run
a successful campaign during the general election campaign. However, research on
the divisive nomination and carryover effect hypotheses has yielded mixed
results indicating a need for further research. This doctoral dissertation
research project will examine the divisive nomination and carryover hypotheses
in two distinct, but complementary ways. First, the student will rexamine the
in- group/out-group expectation with an experimental design which simulates the
presidential selection process. The second part of the design involves
examination of National Election Studies data collected during the nomination
and general election stages of a presidential campaign. The survey analysis will
focus on attitude development and behavior by party identifiers toward the party
nominee during the nomination and general election stages of the campaign. This
examination of individual attitudes and behavior will link the two stages of the
process and help in understanding how the entire presidential selection process
influences attitudes and behaviors.
