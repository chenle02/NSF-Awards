This research develops a novel database system architecture that efficiently
supports queries over rich data types like multi-media, time-series, matrices,
and documents. Complex data types are modeled as Enhanced Abstract Data Types
(E-ADTs), which are software modules with a common interface. While the uniform
interface leads to extensibility, it also exposes semantic information that can
be used for query optimization. The E-ADT architecture is demonstrated through
the development of the PREDATOR database system. The project studies
optimizations that are essential to efficiently support each data type, and
extensions of these techniques across multiple data types. While initial results
demonstrate major performance improvements compared to existing database
systems, several issues are being explored further. What should be the contents
of a toolkit for data type development? Can the mechanism for extensible types
be extended to implement a heterogeneous database system? How does one build an
extensible database system in a Web environment? The project is developing
solutions to all these issues and demonstrating them in PREDATOR. The
educational goal of the project is to provide a freely available, full-function,
modern database system for the database community to use for educational and
research purposes. To this end, the code base of PREDATOR is being released, and
the functionality of the system is being augmented with many standard database
features. This project has the potential to change the fundamental architecture
of the next generation of object-relational systems, with applications ranging
from geographic information systems to multimedia databases.
