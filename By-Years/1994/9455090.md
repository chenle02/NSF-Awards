A one week workshop on FT-NMR will be held for undergraduate faculty, who have
had little experience in FT-NMR, from 2 and 4 year institutions in a six state
region: Arkansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska and Iowa. The workshop
will consist of lectures, instrument use, and data analysis and will cover
topics ranging from beginning NMR theory to pulse sequences and 2-D NMR. Hands-
on experience will be gained on a JEOL 270 MHz FT-NMR. A workshop handbook,
containing a large number of spectra, will be prepared for each participant.
Participants will be able to use these spectra at their home institutions. Major
goals of the workshop are to up-date participants on modern NMR techniques and
to encourage use of these techniques in the undergraduate curriculum. Follow-up
activities include a meeting at the Midwest Regional ACS meeting, in November,
1995. Reports prepared by participants about their use of the information gained
from this workshop will be collected, edited, assembled, bound and distributed
to all institutions of higher education in the six state region.
