This award supports the research of Professors Richard Stanley and Gian-Carlo
Rota in Combinatorics and its connections with other areas of mathematics.
Professor Stanley will work on extending his earlier research on polytopes,
Hilbert functions, symmetric functions, the monotone triangle conjecture, and
differential posets. Professor Rota will work on invariant theory, geometric
probability, umbral calculus, and the theory of species. This research falls in
the broad category of Combinatorics, which is one of the most active fields in
today's mathematics. Fundamentally, Combinatorics represents a systematization
of the very first of all mathematical activities, counting. In its modern
development, however, Combinatorics has gone beyond just counting to make use of
a wide variety of advanced mathematical techniques, and although its roots go
back several centuries, the field has had an explosive development in the past
few decades because of its importance in communications and information
technology.
