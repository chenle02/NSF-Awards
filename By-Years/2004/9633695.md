The PIs will install a 24-station magnetometer array at low latitudes across
China to study: (1) magnetic pulsations and their causative substorms, (2)
magnetospheric control of the equatorial electrojet, (3) low latitude magnetic
pulsations, and (4) traveling current vortices at low latitude. Chinese
scientists, collaborating with this project, will operate the array. Since the
instrument has been developed by UCLA and NASA, the NSF funding will cover the
cost of fabrication and analysis in the US. The apparatus will study the region
below L=2, where no large two dimensional array is currently deployed.
