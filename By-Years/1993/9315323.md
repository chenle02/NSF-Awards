9315323 Mourou This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research
in physics between the University of Michigan's Science and Technology Center
for Ultrafast Optical Science directed by Gerard A. Mourou and the Laboratory
for the Application of Intense Lasers, Ecole Polytechnique, led by Denis Pesme.
The award principally supports an exchange of advanced graduate students and
postdoctoral researchers. The objective of their research is to test some of the
fundamental concepts of the so- called wakefield acceleration. Specifically,
they propose to develop laser amplifiers with the aim of producing ultrashort
and high-energy pulses, and to investigate laser-plasma interactions in the
relativistic regime. The U.S. investigators are world leaders in the field of
ultrashort, high-energy pulses. Most techniques developed by this group are used
worldwide. This is complemented by the French group's vast experience in the
general field of laser-plasma interactions; for example, in the ionization of
gas by multiphoton absorption and in laser-plasma interaction at the nanosecond
regime. The project will advance understanding of outstanding problems in
condensed matter physics (e.g., high temperature superconductors) through the
application of new technology in ultrashort optical pulse generation. ***
