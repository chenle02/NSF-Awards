This RUI grant to a Hope College faculty member supports research in the study
of correlated fragments from the decay of the compound nucleus formed in heavy
ion reactions. The measurements help to determine the time and spatial extent of
the decaying nuclear system. Undergraduate students participate in the
construction of apparatus, execution of the experiments at national user
facilities, and analysis of the data.
