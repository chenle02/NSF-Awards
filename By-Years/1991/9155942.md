Six faculty members from several departments are developing a multidisciplinary
two term course sequence titled "Interactive Earth Systems". The two courses at
the introductory level, are intended to help beginning college students
understand that scientific knowledge is applicable to their lives and is
important for contemporary human society. Students are introduced to an
understanding of the evolving earth and its environments via four key concepts,
each introduced by a specific case study: the nature of earth systems and
interactions; cycles and flows in the earth systems; long time- scale changes;
and human interactions and catastrophic events. A special feature of the design
is the use of individual modules of learning, each constructed on a specific
topic. Each module consists of two one-hour lectures each week and two two- hour
sessions in which the students solve specific problems or answer specific
questions in small cooperative groups of 3-4 students. Students taking these
courses are gaining an understanding of the scientific laws governing changes in
the natural world and the human implications of global changes.
