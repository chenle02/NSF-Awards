The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award
is to model the dynamics of design and development processes for large-scale
complex engineered systems to enable improved engineering design. The research
will leverage methods and results from the fields of dynamical systems,
multidisciplinary design, analysis, and optimization (MDAO), and management
science. If successful, the primary innovation will be to relate key design
factors to the dynamical behavior of systems engineering processes. These
factors include: (1) the system requirements; (2) the development funding
profile; (3) the technology development roadmap; (4) the system decomposition
and organization of design teams; (5) the incentive structures for the design
teams; (6) the systems engineering management approach; and (7) the physical
characteristics and performance of the design itself. The research will
investigate approaches to cast the development process as a state space model
dependent on these multidisciplinary factors. The resulting model will be
suitable to quantify characteristics including steady-state response, stability,
and reachability and controllability. The model will be used to study historical
aerospace development projects to calibrate model parameters, validate the
modeling approach, and gain insights into causes for past programmatic cost and
schedule overruns.

If successful, the research will provide an intellectual bridge between the
process-centric methods of industrial dynamics and the product-centric viewpoint
of multidisciplinary design. The work will also provide a foundation for the
study of feedback and optimal control strategies for systems engineering
management. The dynamics model may hold the potential to understand the root
causes of the cost and schedule overruns that frequently occur in the
development of engineered systems such as aircraft and spacecraft. The
educational objective is to encourage students to pursue technical careers by
illustrating the important societal role of engineers through pedagogical case
studies and vignettes based on the historical development projects used in the
research tasks. The results will be broudly disseminated to achieve the greatest
impact.
