Galvestion College will upgrade its freshman/sophomore physics laboratory. The
goal of this project is to provide students with a work station composed of a
microcomputer, universal interface, measurement sensors, printer, and
appropriate computer software. The work station will be used to interface with
current standard physics equipment as well as newly devised apparatus.
Microcomputer instrumentation measuring techniques will provide for rapid and
accurate data collection, enhanced data analysis, and allow for new ways to
perform physics experiments. The microcomputer will relieve students from time-
consuming calculations and graphing so that more indepth experiments can be
performed. Students will use the microcomputer to generate theoretical data and
graphs to compare with the experimental results. This process will provide a
clear display of the physical principles involved and how they are expressed
theoretically. In addition, students exposed to the microcomputer
instrumentation will be better prepared to understand the uses of microcomputers
in advanced courses, research laboratories, and the work place. The College will
match the award with an equal amount.
