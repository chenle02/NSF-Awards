An experimental study will be conducted of the feasibility of performing .;.in
situ>;> laser spectroscopic measurements in a tribological surface force
microscope. This could allow determination of molecular behavior and micro.flows
in molecularly thin films on sliding surfaces and lead to better understanding
of the properties of boundary lubrication films and other thin molecular layers.
Initial experiments are aimed at determining detection limits for a variety of
laser.induced signals originating from the small contact area and under the
physical constraints enforced by the design of the surface force microscope.
Selected long.chain molecular layers, deposited by the Langmuir.Blodgett
technique will be used. The results will be used to design a surface force
microscope with significantly improved capabilities.
