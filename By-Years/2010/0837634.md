Engineering - Engineering Technology (58)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is
developing, evaluating, and disseminating a web-based system called Learning
Environment for Automated System Integration that is helping students and new
engineers learn system integration concepts. The approach includes animations
and tutorials on system integration concepts and procedures; detailed case
studies on the design of automated systems; intelligent problem-solving
environments that will allow students to design and test automated systems; and
an online community where students, engineers, and instructors can exchange
ideas about system integration. These tools serve as a resource both for
undergraduate courses related to engineering design, computer-aided
manufacturing, or industrial automation and for new engineers working in the
system integration industry. The approach complements existing instructional
materials and equipment, provides opportunities to practice system integration
skills outside of scheduled lab times, and serves as a virtual laboratory for
educational institutions with limited equipment resources. The materials are
being used in seven courses at the principal investigator's institution and at
two collaborating minority serving institutions. The evaluation efforts are
using structured interviews, surveys, analyses of user activity web logs and
student products to characterize the usability and instructional effectiveness
of the developed material. The investigators are disseminating their material
and results through website postings that are linked to the NSDL and to other
digital libraries such as NJCATE and NETAEC, through conference presentation,
through journal publications, and through the ATE National Center on
Manufacturing Education. Broader impacts include the dissemination of the
materials and the focus on underrepresented groups.
