*** 9760106 Bates This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
will develop a new binder that will allow powder metal injection molding (MIM)
of reactive metal parts. Parts made of reactive metals such as titanium are
already made extensively using powder metallurgy, but many valuable metals are
so reactive at high temperature that currently available binders will react with
and contaminate the part during MIM processing. The new binder will be explored
for the conditions of its formation as well as for its physical and debinding
characteristics. Binder properties, the binder/powder ratio, the mixing
procedure, the injection molding process, and the debinding process will be
explored experimentally to optimize the process using titanium as the reactive
metal powder. Molding and debinding will be demonstrated and the green strength
of the parts measured. Some sintering will be attempted to show the
effectiveness of the process. Potential commercial applications of reactive
metal injection molding are expected in the powder metallurgy industry, leading
to the availability of more complex reactive metal parts in the many
applications where they have major advantages. ***
