On September 22, 1989, the worst hurricane in over two hundred years hit the
coast of South Carolina and severely damaged or destroyed portions of our marine
laboratory complex. The support provided to this project will assist in
reconstructing and modernizing research facilities to permit on-going research
projects to resume full capacity and to provide an improved research environment
for new research programs requiring newer technologies. Specifically, support
will be provided for two intertwined aspects of the master reconstruction plan:
1) to partially defray the cost of renovating a damaged laboratory building to
make it an experimental seawater laboratory; and 2) to construct a major sector
of new space in a larger laboratory facility designed for analytical,
computational, data management and experimental programs. The University of
South Carolina will provide matching funds and FEMA will assist financially in
construction of the new laboratory. These new facilities will greatly enhance
research opportunities for both visiting scientists and those from USC.
