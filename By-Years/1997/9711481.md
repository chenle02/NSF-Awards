9711481 Allen Research will be conducted under the auspices of the Coastal
Ocean Processes Program (CoOP). A modeling study will be undertaken of the
physical circulation and ecosystem dynamics on the Oregon continental shelf and
slope. The objective of this research project is to understand and be able to
model physical oceanographic circulation processes and accompanying ecosystem
dynamics in the wind-forced continental shelf flow fields off the U.S. northwest
Pacific coast. Objectives include the application of high resolution numerical
circulation and ecosystem models to both process studies and to direct
simulations of continental shelf and slope flow fields for investigation of the
physical and biological mechanisms involved in wind-forced across-shelf
transport processes. It is intended that this study will prepare for future
Coastal Ocean Processes (CoOP) program field experiments with application of a
high-resolution, limited-area, regional shelf circulation and ecosystem model.
That model would be used to help understand the physical and biological
processes in the observed flow fields by providing interpolation or
extrapolation of necessarily incomplete measurements and by enabling directly
relevant process studies.
