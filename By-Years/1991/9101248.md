Shrub invasions into grassland cause long term changes in plant community
structure that are indicative of desertification in the southwestern United
States. Shrub replacement of grassland may also influence the dynamics of
ecosystem nutrient cycling. Both the longevity of desert shrubs and the long
term accumulation of soil nutrients under desert shrubs in "islands of
fertility" may act in tandem as a positive biological feedback for continued
desertification. This study combines state-of-the-art stable isotope techniques
with traditional soil science and plant ecology methods to address the following
questions: 1) Which soil nutrients comprise an island of fertility?; 2) Do
biotically-regulated soil nutrients become more spatially heterogeneous over
time as desertification proceeds?; 3) How does shrub presence or absence affect
rates of island of fertility formation and degradation?; and 4) Does soil
nutrient concentration correlate to the degree of island of fertility
development and has C3 shrubland recently replaced C4 grassland at the Sevilleta
NWR, New Mexico? Answers from this research will provide valuable insight
towards a more complete understanding of the dynamics of desertification in the
southwestern United States.
