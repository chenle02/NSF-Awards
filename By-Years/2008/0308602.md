Wei Kong of Oregon State University is supported by the Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program for research that aims to obtain photophysical and
photochemical information on biologically relevant species including nucleic
acid bases, indole, and their complexes with water molecules. The approach
involves resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) and laser induced
fluorescence (LIF) spectroscopy of supersonically cooled gas phase species, and
polarization spectroscopy of oriented samples embedded in superfluid helium
droplets. Specifically, the PI will investigate (1) the energy disposal in
pyrimidine nucleic acid bases and the effect of solvent on the decay dynamics,
(2) the directions of transition dipoles of all five key nucleic acid bases, and
(3) the nature and origin of the the excited electronic states of indole.
Outcomes are expected to have interdisciplinary impact, encouraging enhanced
understanding of biochemical reactions.

High-resolution spectroscopic studies of biologically relevant species are often
hindered by their broad light absorption spectra, but polarization spectroscopy
as used here can enable electronic transition dipole directions to be determined
effectively. The use of superfluid helium droplets as molecular carriers further
enhances the molecular information that can be acquired. Kong's research on the
origin of the photostability of nucleic acid bases is expected to impact
discussion concerning how water is important to the origin of life. As well, the
measurements of transition dipole directions will improve the predictability of
circular dichroism spectroscopy, improving its capability as a quantitative
measure of biopolymer conformation.
