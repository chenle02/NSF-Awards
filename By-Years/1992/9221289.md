The process by which interstellar gas gathers into stars is a fundamental
problem in astrophysics, with implications for the formation and evolution of
galaxies and the formation of the elements. The structure and evolution of
molecular clouds, the sites of Galactic star formation, will be investigated by
Dr. McKee. Molecular clouds are observed to be highly clumped, and calculations
will determine the nature of the medium between the clumps. The early evolution
of a molecular cloud, in which a largely atomic gas becomes molecular, will be
calculated. The distribution of pressure in gravitationally bound clumps will be
investigated. Calculations will trace the destruction of the clouds by the
massive stars that form within them. Shock waves shape the mass spectrum of
diffuse interstellar clouds, and powerful hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic
computer codes will be used to study the interaction of shocks with clouds.
Shock waves can produce water masers, which are signposts of massive star
formation, and the conditions under which this can occur will be evaluated. Many
of the heavy elements of the interstellar medium, which are produced by stars,
are locked up in tiny dust grains; the sputtering, vaporization, and shattering
of these grains in interstellar shocks will be calculated.
