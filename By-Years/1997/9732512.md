A daily cycle of rhythmic activity is present in most animals and plants. While
some of this timing control is from processes ('biological clocks') within the
organism, there also is a synchronizing of such activity with external stimuli,
such as day length. The matching of the daily cycle with a periodic external
stimulus, such as sunrise, is called 'entrainment.' Sometimes entrainment occurs
to stimuli that are non-photic, as well. This conference will bring together a
group of researchers in this research area to discuss current and sometimes
conflicting evidence for the mechanisms underlying these entrainment effects, at
levels ranging from the molecular to behavioral. Because of the widely
distributed effects of entrainment, this conference is likely to have strong
impact on several areas of neuroscience, including sensory systems,
neuroendocrinology, and behavior, as well as beyond neuroscience to
endocrinology, and animal and plant physiology. The NSF emphasis on funding for
attendance by young investigators and those from underrepresented groups will
also have an impact on their careers.
