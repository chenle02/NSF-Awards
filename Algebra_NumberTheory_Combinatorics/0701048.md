Abstract for the proposal of Calegari DMS-0701048

This project investigates the relationship between Galois representations and
automorphic forms using tools from homology, commutative algebra, and p-adic
analysis. Of particular interest are modular forms that are of cohomological
type but are not associated to Shimura varieties, especially modular forms over
an imaginary quadratic field K. In this case, the associated symmetric space
quotients are hyperbolic manifolds of real dimension 3, and thus, the study of
such forms is not amenable to the usual techniques of algebraic geometry. A
long-term goal of the project is to establish the modularity of elliptic curves
over K, adapting the method of Taylor-Wiles to this setting. Modular forms over
K can be thought of geometrically as cohomology classes of certain local systems
on arithmetic 3-manifolds. From a topological viewpoint, the cohomology of
arithmetic 3-manifolds has been intensely studied in relation to such questions
as Thurston's "Virtual Positive Betti Number Conjecture." However, in number
theory, these cohomology classes have conjectural associations to motives and
Galois representations. The tension between these different perspectives makes
this a fertile area for interdisciplinary research.



Wiles' famous work on Fermat's last theorem established a correspondence between
two classes of disparate objects: elliptic curves, given by polynomial equations
of degree three in two variables, and modular forms.Associated to each elliptic
curve is a modular form, which is like the DNA of the corresponding elliptic
curve: many properties of the elliptic curve can be determined directly from the
modular form. An emerging theme in number theory (and beyond) in the last twenty
years is the Langlands program, a vast generalization of this correspondence. In
the Langlands program, one considers algebraic varieties, which are finite
collections of polynomial equations of arbitrary degree, and automorphic forms,
which, like modular forms in the classical case, play the role of algebraic
variety DNA. For example, given a set of equations, one would like to know if
there exist infinitely many solutions where all the variables are integers.
Conjecturally, one can determine this directly from the corresponding
automorphic form by computing whether a particular integral vanishes. The
Langlands program is still, in many respects, in its infancy --- we neither know
exactly how to relate systems of equations, in general, to automorphic forms,
nor have we "cracked the code" for understanding how to extract useful
information from automorphic forms, or have even determined all the components
from which automorphic forms are built. Nevertheless, this broad area of study
promises to be a guiding problem in number theory for the foreseeable future.
