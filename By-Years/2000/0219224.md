This project addresses technical challenges that face next-generation immersive
visual communication. It proposes to study one particular type of immersive
communication system base on auto-multiscopic (eyewear-free multiview) 3-D
display. Such a system would consist of three closely-spaced digital video
cameras, standard PCs, some compression hard-ware/software, and the said
multiscopic display. This system would allow interaction in 3-D space by
allowing depth perception, and moreover, "look-around", i.e., geometrically
correct viewing from a number of viewpoints. Anticipated applications are 3-D
videoconferencing, remote collaboration, telecommuting, etc.
