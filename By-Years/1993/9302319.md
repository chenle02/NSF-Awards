9302319 Nations This proposal is to support a research project for Native
American students (Hopi and Navajo people) at various career levels in
evaluating the coal resources and determiningg the potential for coalbed methane
gas production from Cretaceous rocks on their reservations. The project would
serve as a vehicle for science education that is relevant to current scientific,
economic, and cultural problems on the Navajo and Hopi reservations. Coupled
with the collaborative educational outreach phase of the program, this research
project should stimulate greater interest in science among Native American
students at all educational levels. Thus the project would direct Native
American students toward careers in the sciences and teaching while answering
cogent scientific and economic questions.
