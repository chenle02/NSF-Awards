A fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence is to achieve intelligent
coordination of a group of decision makers in spite of uncertainty and limited
information. Decision theory offers a normative framework for optimizing
decisions under uncertainty, but due to computational barriers, developing
decision-theoretic reasoning algorithms for multi-agent systems is a serious
challenge. This project will advance foundational contributions to the
understanding of decision-theoretic planning in stochastic multi-agent domains
as well as the development of efficient new algorithms that provide exponential
savings in memory requirements and computation time. Moving beyond toy problems
is a hard computational challenge that has been broadly recognized by the
multiagent systems community. Research under this project will transform the
ability of researcher and practitioners to apply decision-theoretic planing to a
new range of domains.
