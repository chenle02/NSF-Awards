Mayville State University seeks funds to develop a model Mathematics Specialist
Program for grades K-8. A preservice teacher preparation program will be
designed, developed and tested for implementation in North Dakota and Western
Minnesota elementary schools. With adjustments, the preservice program will also
serve inservice teachers who will be prepared as mathematics specialists and
mathematics stewards for their schools. Through a cooperative arrangement with
twelve area school districts and four Native American Reservations, the
university will prepare inservice teachers as mathematics specialists and will
define the role of a mathematics curriculum steward: an individual with a
mathematics concentration, who is a professional advocate and a counselor in
mathematics education, and provides on-site consultant service to improve and
coordinate mathematics instruction throughout their schools. Program evaluation
will be an integral part of the development process and an active dissemination
network will be developed for purposes of educating teachers throughout North
Dakota and the region. The goal of the program is to implement the NCTM
Curriculum and Evaluation Standards in over 1,000 elementary classrooms by 1997.
National experts in mathematics education will assist the proposers in the
development and implementation of the project. The contribution of Mayville
State University accounts for 53% of the NSF budget.
