The special session "Computational Differential and Difference Algebra" will be
part of the conference Applications of Computer Algebra (ACA) 2014 to be held at
Fordham University, July 9-12, 2014. Th subject of differential and difference
algebra concerns the study of differential and difference equations from an
algebraic point of view. These types of equations have many applications to real
life problems, including biology (population dynamics and cellular biology),
chemical reactions, and physics. The aim of the special session is to bring
together researchers who develop theory for these types of equations and those
who develop algorithms for working with them.

The annual ACA conference series started in 1995. The aim of this special
session is to bring together researchers who develop theory and algebraic
algorithms that solve or simplify systems of linear and non-linear differential
and difference equations. This group includes researchers in differential and
difference Galois theories, differential and difference elimination, symbolic
computation in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, and model theory.
This special session will foster the interaction of researchers in differential
and difference algebra with researchers in model theory, algebraic geometry, and
commutative algebra at a new level. The schedule will be designed to make this
interaction particularly convenient and will include time for informal
discussion. Moreover, special attention will be paid to mentoring the
participants in the special session who are young investigators. In addition to
the talks in the conference format, it is planned to have several longer
lectures to foster in-depth discussions. Additional information can be found at
