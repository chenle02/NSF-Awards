0138596&lt;br/&gt;Ambrose&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary study
combines scientific ecological knowledge (SEK) and the traditional ecological
knowledge (TEK) of the Inupiat people regarding Kotzebue Sound, Alaska. The
research will focus on developing an ecological profile of the nearshore
Kotzebue Sound and testing three hypotheses regarding food webs, sewage impacts,
and ecosystem change. Common methods of ethnography will be used to elicit TEK,
and standard oceanographic techniques will be used for the SEK portion of the
study. The project includes outreach to local schools and will bring local
students of all ages into the data collection process.&lt;br/&gt;
