9357415 Sailor This NSF Young Investigator award deals with research and
teaching in areas that include the chemistry of luminescent porous silicon, and
the role of chemical adsorbates and surface chemical reactions. The potential of
these materials for uses such as chemical and bio- sensors, and detector and
display applications will be evaluated. ***
