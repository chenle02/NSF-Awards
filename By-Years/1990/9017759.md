One of the critical regions of the magnetosphere is the magnetotail, which is
thought to be responsible for magnetospheric substorms, which are intervals of
time that are associated with enhanced currents and intensification of the
auroral (i.e. northern lights). This grant concentrates on three problems
concerning the plasma physics of the magnetotail: 1) the origin of mid-frequency
electrostatic plasma waves, 2) collisionless tearing mode reconnection in teh
closed magnetic field-line region of the plasma sheet, and 3) the structure of
collisionless shocks in the distant tail. These problems will be attached using
observations, analytic theory and numerical simulations.
