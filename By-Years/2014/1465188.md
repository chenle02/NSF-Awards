In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis program of the Chemistry
Division, the research groups of Professors John Arnold and Robert Bergman of
University of California, Berkeley are working toward developing new reagents
containing inexpensive and earth-abundant early transition metals that are
capable of cleaving strong bonds. Ideally, this research will lead to
development of catalysts for removal of fluorine and chlorine from
environmentally dangerous halogenated organic wastes, such as CFCs, selective
functionalization of chemical feedstocks to produce high-valued organic
products, and synthesis of new inorganic polymers and materials. The most
immediate broader impacts of the work described in this proposal relate to the
training of skilled synthetic chemists and the fact that a more complete
understanding of fundamental reaction steps that occur at transition metal sites
is important in a wide range of industrially important chemical conversions.

This project focuses on the development of new niobium systems supported by
imido and &#946;-diketiminate and related ligands. This project is split into
two major parts. The first involves reactivity and mechanistic studies of low-
valent niobium systems toward developing reagents for activation and
functionalization of C-F, C-Cl, and C-O bonds. The second involves synthesis of
a series of bis(imido) complexes that are reactive across a niobium-nitrogen
multiple bond, and investigation of their reactivity toward cycloaddition of
unsaturated substrates and 1,2-addition of C-H and E-H (E = H, B, Al, Si, N, P,
O, S) bonds. Target compounds will be characterized using 1D and 2D 1H, 13C, and
other heteronuclear NMR techniques, X-ray crystallography, FT-IR (Fourier
transform infra-red) spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and other characterization
techniques. Additionally, DFT (Density Functional Theory) calculations will be
used to gain electronic structure and mechanistic insights.
