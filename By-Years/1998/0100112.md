This proposal grows from the PI's recent discovery that important elements of
Faraday's 1856 investigation into gold -- a large set of microscope slides and
other laboratory materials -- still exist in a well-preserved state at the Royal
Institution in London. The combination of laboratory materials with the more
traditional written documentation from the scientist's notebooks presents an
important opportunity for cognitive scientists to understand even more
thoroughly the work of Faraday -- and scientific work more
generally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal requests SGER support for travel to
England so that the PI can undertake certain technical work related to the
slides and other laboratory materials before undertaking a more detailed
scholarly examination of the entire set of experiments by Faraday. Primarily,
Tweney seeks assistance to enable him to photographically reproduce and
catalogue the microscope slides. He also wants to examine and study the chemical
materials and processes that Faraday used, some of which survives as well. From
this preliminary work, a more complete exploration of Faraday's gold research
can be undertaken by the P.I. in the United
States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
