This collaborative project between Michael Milgroom, Cornell University, and
Wang Kerong, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China, will compare the
genetic diversity and population structure of the chestnut blight fungus and its
virus-like double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) parasites in China and the US. At least
eight populations in China will be sampled, and using molecular genetic markers
identified in previous studies, fungal isolates from each population will be
analyzed for genetic variability. The extent of population subdivision will be
determined, from which inferences can be made about gene flows among fungus
populations. Fungal isolates from China will be screened for dsRNAs in order to
estimate prevalence in Chinese populations. The chestnut blight fungus was
introduced into the US from China at the turn of the century and devastated the
previously abundant chestnut forests in the eastern US. Studying the fungus
populations at their source in China is an opportunity to understand the basic
factors that affect the population biology of this species in a long-
established, relatively stable population. This study is also expected to be
useful for the development of a biological control program of the fungus.
