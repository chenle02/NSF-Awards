Infrared remote sensing techniques are routinely used as a means of obtaining
data on the concentration and altitude distribution of atmospheric trace
constituents. The PIs propose to conduct a series of balloon flights to obtain
high spectral resolution atmospheric transmission and emission data in various
spectral intervals from 100 cm-1 to 3000 cm-1. The transmission data will be
obtained from the ground through 40 km and from 40 km during solar occultation,
at a resolution of 0.002 cm-1 (unapodized). The emission data will be obtained
over the same altitude range and in a limb viewing mode at a resolution of .04
cm-1. The data will be analyzed to obtain constituent profiles for compounds of
stratospheric interest with higher absolute accuracy than in previous studies.
The concentrations measured in this program will be compared with earlier data
for detection of possible trends. The spectra will also be compared with
calculations using the latest versions of the HITRAN database. These comparisons
are particularly important for improving our ability to accurately calculate the
atmospheric radiative transfer.
