9523434 Marwitz Winter storms are among the most costly and disruptive of
meteorological phenomena. The factors that control the production of such
weather as freezing rain, heavy snowfalls and aircraft icing conditions are
usually a complex interaction of localized precipitation physics and the larger
scale atmospheric dynamics, so called microphysical/dynamical interactions.
Utilizing aircraft and other meteorological data collected during the Winter
Icing and Storms Project (WISP), under a previous award the Principal
Investigator has advanced our understanding of the precipitation formation
processes in winter storms including a new taxonomy for and insights into
aircraft icing conditions. Under this award the Principal Investigator will
continue this research and has three primary objectives: 1. Diagnostic study of
the dynamical/microphysical interactions within a blizzard; 2. Diagnostic
studies of a series of cases of freezing rain; 3. Attempt to explain the
observed relationship between supercooled drizzle drops and vertical wind shear.
Successful completion of this research will advance our fundamental
understanding of the production of wintertime precipitation and potentially lead
to improved forecasts. ***
