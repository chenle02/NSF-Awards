teacher in the first year and 52 in each of the succeeding 3-years. In Phase I,
Leadership Teams (one physics teacher and one Tech pre teacher) and project
staff will develop workshop materials for a 3-wekk workshop, Learning Through
Manufacturing Experiences. This will be done during a five-week program which
includes a 3-week internship with Peavey Electronics Corporation and two week of
materials adaptation and content reinforcement at Mississippi State University.
During the second, third and fourth years of the project two cohorts of 24
physics and tech prep teachers will participate in these workshops designed to
equip them with knowledge and experience of the skills necessary for students to
enter the world of manufacturing and the content knowledge to develop those
skills. Academic year follow-up includes site visits to schools of participants,
Internet communication and one-day workshops in association with professional
teachers' conferences.
