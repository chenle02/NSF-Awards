IIP 0968821&lt;br/&gt;University of
Idaho&lt;br/&gt;Coleman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;University of Idaho (UI) is
planning to join the existing multi-university Industry/University Cooperative
Research Center (I/UCRC) entitled "The Center for Advanced Forestry Systems"
(CAFS) which was established in 2007 with four member institutions: North
Carolina State University (lead university), Oregon State University, Purdue
University and Virginia Tech. Since then other universities have joined this
Center: the University of Maine, the University of Washington, the University of
Georgia and the University of Florida.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary focus of
the proposed research site within CAFS will be to provide additional and
specialized expertise and research platforms in the areas of endophyte selection
and deployment, seed orchard pest protection and geospatial projections. The
proposed activities at UI will augment current CAFS projects, and will more
fully address the needs for scientific and technological advances for enhancing
the competitiveness of the US forestry sector. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The effort
at the University of Idaho has the potential to improve the competitiveness of
the forest products industry by solving key problems using applied research and
enhanced institutional collaboration. The community will benefit from refereed
publications and presentations at scientific meetings focusing on key nationwide
research questions. The proposed work at the University of Idaho will expand
training of graduate students with unique interdisciplinary skill sets. The
proposed site also has a plan to address diversity issues in this field.
