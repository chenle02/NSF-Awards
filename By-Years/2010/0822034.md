The purpose of Project Delta is two-fold. One, the PI proposes to extend an
existing library of seventeen interacting CDROM digital learning environments on
numbers and operations by adding an algebra strand. Two, the PI proposes to
evaluate the impact of the new algebra materials on teacher development. Each of
the digital environments features classroom sessions that allow for exploration
of a mathematics topic, children learning over time, and teachers? instructional
techniques. The project's research effort addresses the following questions:
What is the impact of Project Delta experiences on elementary teachers? content
knowledge, general pedagogy, and pedagogical content knowledge? What is the
impact of Project Delta experiences on elementary teachers? practices, including
the use of their knowledge in planning for and enacting algebra lessons? Three
groups of 60 teachers participate in the study.
