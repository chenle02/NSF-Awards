9707073 Voorhees Interfacial energy is the primary driving force for the
precipitate coarsening processing metal alloys in the absence of elastic
stresses. As a result, the average particle size increases monotonically with
time, and large particles grow at the expense of small particles. In contrast,
in the presence of elastic stress, particles can undergo inverse coarsening
where small particles grow at the expense of large particles, and large-scale
particle migration occurs in the solid. Complete stabilization of the two-phase
mixture with respect to coarsening may be possible. In this research the
coarsening process is examined in elastically stressed solids both
experimentally and theoretically. The experimental effort focuses on two major
unexplored aspects of the coarsening process in elastically-stressed solids: (1)
the kinetics of the coarsening over a wide range of average particle sizes, from
small average particle sizes, where the interfacial energy is the dominant
energy in the system, to large particle sizes, where the elastic stress is the
dominant energy in the system, and (2) the three-dimensional morphology and
spatial arrangement of particles in the l ate stages of coarsening. The
theoretical effort is directed toward predicting the evolution of a
statistically large system of particles where the particle morphologies and
locations evolve in a manner that is consistent with the elastic and diffusion
fields in the system. This effort should allow the determination of
statistically averaged quantities such as the exponents and amplitudes of the
temporal power laws that describe the coarsening kinetics as well as the
development of the microstructure during coarsening. %%% The theory will be used
to predict the coarsening kinetics using parameters that will be measured in the
experiments. The theory will be sufficiently realistic that the predictions can
serve as a guide to the development of coarsening-resistant coherent alloys. *
