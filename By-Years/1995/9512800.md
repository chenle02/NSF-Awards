9512800 Manchester This U.S.-Eastern Europe workshop on paleobotanical topics
will precede the fifth "International Organization of Paleobotany" conference
being held in Santa Barbara, California, during June 30-July 5, 1996. Organized
by Dr. Steven Manchester of the University of Florida, Florida Museum of Natural
History, the workshop will feature definition and development of new joint
research projects between U.S. participants and counterpart Hungarian, Czech and
Polish scientists who are attending the same conference. The topics to be
discussed will feature floristic evolution and biogeographical interchange
through geologic time. The workshop is expected to yield ideas for new
collaborative research that will extend and promote the U.S. research
community's access to unique geologic sites and paleobotanical expertise in
Eastern Europe. Resulting international research proposals will be considered by
the National Science Foundation on a competitive basis. ***
