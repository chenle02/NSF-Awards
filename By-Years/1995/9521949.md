9521949 Tieleman This award is to support the Third International Colloquium on
Bluff Body Aerodynamics and Applications (BBAA III) to be held on July 28 -
August 1st., 1996 at Virginia Tech University. The purpose of the colloquium is
to broaden the interaction of engineers and scientists, researchers and
practitioners in the fundamental aspects of bluff body aerodynamics and related
fields. These exchanges of information and knowledge will strongly benefit the
wind engineering community since the understanding of the behavior of air flows
around structures is fundamental for estimating their response to particular
wind loads and for developing mitigation strategies. ***
