The research seeks to further quantify the input of atmospheric Fe into the
sparsely sampled Southern Ocean (SO), specifically in the vicinity of the West
Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) and adjacent continental shelf waters in the Drake
Passage. This is typically a high nutrient low chlorophyll region where surface
trace metal and primary productivity data are suggestive of Fe limitation. The
WAP is characterized by high productivity in the austral summer, and at this
time may be in the path of northern dust (aeolian Fe) input or subject to melt
influx of elevated Fe accumulated from glacial and present-day sea ice sources.

Primary scientific questions are: (1) to what extent does atmospheric Fe
contribute to nutrient cycles and ecosystem dynamics in the SO? (2) How is
warming climate occurring in the WAP affecting the aerosol composition of the
maritime atmosphere. The primary productivity of the Southern Ocean is key to
understanding oceanic uptake of anthropogenic greenhouse gases such as carbon
dioxide.
