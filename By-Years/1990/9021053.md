The state-of-the-art in the boring bar industry is to use carbide bars to
achieve a high degree of stiffness. But many machining jobs call for a small
diameter hole of great length. Current boring bars are limited by this length-
to-diameter ratio with ratios of 10 to 1 or greater resulting in intolerable
chatter. Attempts have been made by manufacturers to insert passive damping
devices into a cavity near the workpiece of the bar to increase this length-to-
diameter ratio. Although this measure has met with limited success, the
improvement is sufficiently encouraging to try other damping methods. %%% The
purpose of this research project is to investigate the problem of controlling
chatter on a boring bar.
