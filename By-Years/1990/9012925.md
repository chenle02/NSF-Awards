In the early development of the biotechnology industry, new contexts of
biotechnology firms were created, joining the university lab, while at the same
time old contexts of pharmaceutical and chemical firms were largely pushed
aside. Understanding these changes is important to explaining where the industry
may go in the future, as well as in understanding growth of other science-based
industrial developments. Zucker and Brewer propose to study and explain the rate
of founding and the geographic location of new biotechnology firms as a function
of available intellectual capital and the dual membership of founders in firms
and universities, as well as the phenomenon of new biotechnology firms spinoffs
and the extent to which scientific knowledge remains public or becomes
proprietary. They also propose to model the productivity of scientists as a
function of a variety of individual and contextual factors. They will combine a
number of different data bases to obtain information and make use of innovative
modeling techniques that combine partial likelihood and multi-level analytical
methods. To estimate these models, detailed micro-level data must be collected,
as well as data on the organizations and cities and regions within which the
individual-level scientific discovery and application takes place. Implications
of this research include improved understanding of the discovery/application
process, the effects of institutional context on that process, and the changing
character of knowledge flow that follows from commercialization and the increase
in proprietary pressures.
