The PI will measure the thermal dependence of magnetostriction and
magnetocrystalline anistrophy constants above room-temperature in synthetic
single crystals of titanomagnetites. Single crystals will be grown from the melt
by the floating zone technique in an arc image furnace at the crystal growth
facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The single crystal work will
complement work on the thermal dependence of magnetostriction in polycrystalline
Samples. There are no such measurements for the thermal dependence of
magnetocrystalline anisotropy above room- temperature for titanium-rich
titanomagnetites. The thermal dependence of these fundamental constants is
important for theories of thermoremanent magnetization, coercivity, and thermal
dependence of domain states.
