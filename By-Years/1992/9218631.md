Dr Meinke has isolated over 200 embryonic mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana with
a wide range of developmental abnormalities. He has been mapping genes with
essential functions during embryogenesis and an analyzing of T-DNA insertional
mutants produced following seed transformation. The proposed research will
continue a molecular analysis of tagged embryonic mutants and examine several
untagged mutants with particularly unusual phenotypes. The molecular analysis
will focus on four mutants in which flanking sequences have already been
recovered. Detailed analysis will be limited to mutant genes with interesting
patterns of expression, sequence homology to known genes, or transcripts that
can be recovered from existing cDNA libraries. Dr. Meinke has recently
identified a novel homeotic mutant that appears to be defective in a regulatory
gene that functions to activate a wide range of embryo specific pathways. Mutant
embryos are abnormal, occasionally viviparous, and desiccation intolerant, but
can be rescued in culture prior to desiccation. The resulting seedlings have a
phenotype consistent with a model that mutant cotyledons are partially
transformed into leaves, and that this regulatory gene functions to maintain the
distinction between leaves and cotyledons. This mutant is not tagged, but merits
detailed analysis and Dr. Meinke proposes to map the gene in preparation to
further characterization of this interesting mutant.
