As switching time requirements and chip size decrease, submicron geometries will
be an inevitable trend in the integrated circuit industry in the 1990s. In order
to achieve the required small geometries and high yields, stringent demands will
be made on resist technology. Although there are many electron-beam resists
which have submicron resolution, none of them totally meet all performance
requirements. Due to the inherent characteristics of high glass transition
temperature, effective adhesion, thermal stability, and dry etching durability
of aromatic silicon-containing polymer and the high radiation sensitivity of
chloromethyl styrene, copolymers of chloromethyl styrene and several aromatic
silicon-containing monomers will be investigated as high resolution electron-
beam bilayer resists. The resist sensitivity is proportional to the molecular
weight of the copolymer and mutually incompatible with resolution, which is a
function of polydispersity. Improvement of adhesion, thermal stability, and dry
etching durability is often at the expense of sensitivity. Thus, the effects of
the molecular structure and the synthetic parameters on these properties will be
studied. As the lithographic process is vital for developing a new submicron
resist system, the processing parameters will be optimized for the chloromethyl
styrene and aromatic silicon-containing copolymer with optimum molecular design
in order to obtain a thermally stable and dry etching resistant electron-beam
resist with high sensitivity and resolution.
