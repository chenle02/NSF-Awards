The principal investigator will continue his work on the structure of random
walk paths in two and three dimensions. The particular objects of interest are
critical exponents for these walks: the intersection exponent, which measures
the probability that two independent walks intersect; the chemical exponent,
which measures the length of the shortest subpath between two points; the
resistance exponent; the loop-erasing exponent, which measures the length of a
path derived from erasing loop chronologically; and exponents related to the
behavior of a particle diffusing on a random walk path. The investigator will
also study clusters formed from random walk dynamics. The principal investigator
will continue his work on the fractal-like structure of random walk paths in two
and three dimensions. This is an area of probability theory that draws heavily
on heuristic models in physics and chemistry for motivation. Results in this
area will impact both the probability community and the theoretical physics
community. One object of interest is the intersection exponent of a random walk,
which measures the probability that two independent walks intersect.
