EAR-0309794&lt;br/&gt;Sharp&lt;br/&gt;Ocean serpentinites contain a high
concentration of water-soluble chlorides, and should be an important carrier
responsible for removal of Cl from the exosphere as a source for high-salinity
fluids in subduction zones. Four goals are proposed: 1) to better constrain the
Cl content of serpentinites and their abundance by characterizing ODP cores and
obducted equivalents, 2) to characterize the mineralogical siting of Cl - in
serpentine using electron microbeam and TEM techniques, 3) to examine weakly and
more highly-metamorphosed serpentinite bodies and associated wallrocks for
evidence of high salinity fluids and their metamorphic/metasomatic effects and
4) measure chlorine isotope ratios of serpentinite and related lithologies in
order to identify the origin of Cl. This work will include direct measurements
of anion concentrations, salinity determinations of fluid inclusions, H, O and
Cl isotope ratios, and evaluation of metasomatism in veins and shear zones as
indirect evidence for element migration during passage of high-salinity fluids.
&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts - The integrated approach outlined in this proposal
will lead to a better understanding of the importance of high-salinity fluids in
deep subduction-related metamorphism, and the source of such fluids. The work
will be carried out by the three PIs, a Ph.D. student and undergraduate (honor's
thesis) and high school students (NASA SHARP summer internship). The project
will include a large number of students at all levels, including minority high
school students who will benefit from hands-on experience of a real scientific
inquiry. &lt;br/&gt;
