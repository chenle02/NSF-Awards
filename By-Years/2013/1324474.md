Science and technology (S&T) indicators used to measure the overall impact of
international collaboration do not currently provide universities with a
comprehensive, institutional-level assessment of their international research
collaborations. This project will test and refine commonly used S&T indicators
and develop new metrics to evaluate input, output, and the impact of
international research cooperation using a combination of quantitative and
qualitative methodologies. The project will process and analyze data from
various sources including Elsevier?s Scopus and Thomson Reuters? Web of Science
publication databases; grants and patent databases; as well as a mixed-mode
survey administered to faculty researchers at Washington State University (WSU).
Collectively, these tools will first be applied to WSU as a case study and
further assessed with four other U.S. public research institutions.

Broader Impacts: This project will create and assess an institutional-level blue
print that will assist a U.S. university to document the impact and productivity
of its international research collaborations. Practical tools and information
will be generated to capture the formal and informal characteristics of
partnerships; the resulting guidance manual will be of interest to university
policymakers and decision-makers to leverage investments resulting from
strategic international alliances. The impact of this research project will
provide evidence-based approaches to U.S. institutions in implementing
interventions that will enable growth in productive international research
collaborations.
