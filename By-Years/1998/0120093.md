ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information Technology Workforce
(ITWF)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Id: EIA-0120093&lt;br/&gt;PI:
Dorothy T. Bennett and Cornelia Brunner&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Education
Development Center (EDC)&lt;br/&gt;Title: Designing for Diversity: Investigating
Electronic Games as Pathways for Girls into Information Technology
Professions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides support for a 2-year study
to research design criteria of electronic games that affirm and support 8-14
year old girls' positive notions of (Information Technology) IT professions.
While much is known about general characteristics of games that appeal to girls
and boys, there is a little information about the specific game design features,
characteristics and problems that might successfully attract different children
into IT. The study is expected to result in the development of specific design
criteria for game designers and practical guidance for educators interested in
using games to foster children's IT skills and interests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
