The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is to drive safer and more cost-effective
emergency department care pathways by improved risk stratification at patient
presentation (triage) compared to the current standards of care. E-triage
addresses the ED crowding crisis (136 million visits in US annually) that
adversely affects patients' health outcomes and has led to a state of financial
unsustainability in America's safety net. E-triage's approach supports new ED
operational models to separate service streams for acutely ill and non-urgent
patients. New streaming models are needed to mitigate ED crowding by: (1)
conserving scarce ED resources for patients truly in need of emergency care, and
(2) preventing unnecessary waiting and costly resource over-utilization for non-
urgent patients. It does this by using local ED electronic health record (EHR)
data to scientifically risk-stratify patients based on risk of critical events
and severity of illness. E-triage meets a commercial opportunity to mitigate
crowding, enhance ED operational performance, and improve the value of
healthcare delivered to ED patients. The proposed project will transition
E-triage to a scalable and commercially available platform under a business
model that supports growth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will
yield a scaled and commercially available e-triage decision support platform
that is currently being piloted in multiple emergency departments (EDs).
E-triage deploys a novel combination of data-science methods and flexible
information technology architecture that supports usability by diverse ED
customers. The tool relies on advancements in machine learning methods,
mechanisms to harness user feedback, and software technology that is flexible
and interoperable with EHR systems. It must also securely transmit and store
patient data and be computationally efficient to accommodate fast-paced ED
environments. E-triage enables rapid data-driven prognostication of ED patients
at presentation based on risk of critical events and severity of illness using
common locally collected ED data. Compared to US triage practice standards,
which relies heavily on provider subjective judgment, e-triage demonstrates
improved identification of high- and low-risk patients based on evidence from
retrospective and prospective evaluation. E-triage is disruptive in its design
to support new ED operational models that separate service streams for acutely
ill and non-urgent patients toward reducing the burden of ED crowding.
