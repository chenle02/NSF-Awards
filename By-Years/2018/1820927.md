This project will help answer one of the key questions being asked by the
international Arctic climate-science community: What is the role of snow-on-sea-
ice in controlling heat exchanges in the Arctic climate system? This work will
educate young scientists in the combined issues of field measurements, high-
resolution modeling, and representing high-resolution processes in regional and
global models. In addition, it will collect high quality field measurements that
will advance Arctic system science for years to come.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This
research will synthesize three interrelated science contributions: (1)
Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC)
field observations will identify governing physical processes, fluxes, and
linkages within the Arctic climate system. (2) Realistic-resolution (meters-
scale), physically based modeling tools (e.g., MicroMet, SnowModel, EnBal,
SnowPack, SnowTran-3D, SnowDunes, SnowAssim, SeaIce-3D) will quantify the
behavior, interactions, and sensitivities among the Arctic system components.
(3) Field observations and high-resolution modeling will be integrated to define
what is missing or poorly represented in Earth System Models and guide the
parameterization of the associated snow-related processes and fluxes for the
Community Earth System Model (CESM) and the Los Alamos Sea Ice Model
(CICE).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
