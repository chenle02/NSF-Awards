This approximately two-year project targets primarily teachers of elementary
schools in Texas, and would involve teachers of grades 4-6 during the first year
and teachers of grades K-3 during the 2nd year. During each yearly cycle, 24
participants from across the state of Texas will come to Concordia Lutheran
College, Austin, Texas, for a 4-week summer workshop involving classroom,
laboratory, and field experiences. During the following school year, the Project
Director and Senior Associate will conduct four Saturday workshops in each of
four regions of the state to address the expressed needs and concerns of
teachers in that region. They will also visit each participant's school and
assist in the implementation of science concepts and methods learned during the
summer. Teachers who have completed one year in the program will return the for
several days during the following summer workshop to share their experiences
with the new group of teachers, and to design school-specific plans to radically
improve science education in their schools. On one of the workshop days,
principals will join the teachers to collaborate with and support them in
developing the plan for their schools. This project is appropriate for the
Teacher Enhancement Program because it (1) is designed to enhance the science
knowledge and teaching of teachers by utilizing the local environment and
focusing on phenomena appropriate for elementary school science; (2) contains an
amplification plan which will accommodate the limitations and idiosyncracies of
individual schools while enhancing the teaching of science in all of the grades
in each school; and (3) targets an under-represented (rural) group; Non-NSF cost
sharing is approximately 8.5% of the amount requested from NSF.
