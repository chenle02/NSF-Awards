Abstract

Award: DMS-0503864 Principal Investigator: Igor Belegradek

This project is concerned with the topology of curved Riemannian manifolds. One
objective is to study collapsed manifolds, i.e. manifolds that appear lower
dimensional at a certain small but definite scale. Specifically, it is planned
to investigate almost nonnegatively curved manifolds, collapsed manifolds of
bounded nonnegative curvature, and cusp cross-sections of finite volume
nonpositively curved manifolds. In a somewhat different direction it is proposed
to study negatively pinched manifolds, including pinching estimates, rigidity in
case of optimal pinching, finiteness theorems forced by assumptions on pinching,
asymptotic geometry of horospheres, and negatively pinched groups. The project
continues earlier work of Belegradek and collaborators, and especially the
recent results with Kapovitch on diffeomorphism classification of negatively
pinched manifolds with amenable fundamental groups (that settled a problem of
Bowditch), and on optimal pinching estimates for such manifolds (that answered a
question of Gromov).

While the project mostly deals with intrinsic development of global Riemannian
geometry, it is also to some extent motivated by Sciences and Engineering, where
curved spaces are plentiful and occur naturally. The theoretical insights
obtained in the project may be applicable to concrete problems in those fields.
