This CAREER award supports research and curriculum activities for applied
engineering analysis and product development. More specifically, the grant will
enable a design environment which reveals the first-order effects that drive the
design behavior, aiding the engineer to better internalize the causality between
critical design decisions and a product's performance. The critical activity of
the project is the development of analysis and design objects that permit
automatic application of analytical methods, appropriate boundary conditions,
and numerical solution to the features of a designed component. To develop and
demonstrate the methodology, cost and cooling analyses are to be developed and
applied in the design of injection molded parts. The developed methods can later
be extended to mechanical assemblies, different manufacturing processes, and
additional analysis types for integration into engineering education and
practice. The research results will be translated to academic curricula and
industry application through integration with commercial design environments. If
the goals are achieved, engineers would gain the ability to synthesize designs
with real-time feedback regarding the product's purpose and performance. In
academia, students could gain more thoretical understanding, engineering
intuition, and confidence by exploring analysis in the context of design
synthesis. In industry, the integrated environment should aid engineers develop
more robust molded parts with reduced time, effort, and cost.
