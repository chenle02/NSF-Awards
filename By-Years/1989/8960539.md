This research will seek the development of a new class of superconducting
magnetic sensors utilizing high Tc copper oxide based superconductors. These
sensors are expected to offer better performance than nonsuperconducting
instruments, at a much lower cost than that of present low Tc instruments. They
combine a superconducting pickup loop, together with non-superconducting
fluxgate magnetometer. Potential applications are in geomagnetism, instruments,
such as susceptometers, and biomagnetism. This technology can be applied to the
implementation of SQUID based systems, if high Tc SQUID's become practical.
