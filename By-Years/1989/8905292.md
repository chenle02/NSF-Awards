This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research Equipment for the
Mathematical Sciences program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences of the
National Science Foundation. This program supports the purchase of special
purpose computing equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the
mathematical sciences. This equipment is required for several research projects
and would be difficult to justify for one project alone. Support from the
National Science Foundation is coupled with discounts and contributions from
manufacturers and with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting
the proposal. This program is an example of academic, corporate, and government
cooperation in the support of basic research in the mathematical sciences. This
equipment will be used to support four research projects in the Department of
Statistics at the University of Chicago: Statistical Problems in Image
Reconstruction, directed by Wing-Hung Wong; Graphical Models with Genetics
Applications, directed by Augustine Kong; Estimation of Annual Ion Deposition
Under New Emissions Scenarios, directed by Michael Stein; and Inference for
Spatial Processes, directed by Michael Stein.
