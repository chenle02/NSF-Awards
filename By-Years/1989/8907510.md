Dr. Arthur G. Palmer has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Palmer's doctoral degree was from the University of North
Carolina under the supervision of Professor Nancy L. Thompson. Dr. Palmer
intends to continue research at the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation under
the sponsorship of Professor Peter E. Wright. Dr. Palmer's area of postdoctoral
research will be a study of the intramolecular motions of proteins by 13C-NMR.
Specifically the conformational dynamics of the electron-transport protein,
plastocyanin, will be investigated. The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in
Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to
broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D's and attract them into
meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and teaching.
