Through this project, state-of-the-art diode array detector spectrophotometers,
microscope attachments, an ELISA plate reader, cold cabinets, and supporting
equipment is purchased and an HPLC system upgraded to achieve full integration
of collaborative learning activities into selected core and elective courses in
the Biology Department. Incorporation of collaborative approaches to laboratory
work have been highly effective in a trial program in Research and Analysis.
This approach is now enalarged to include additional core courses and elective
courses in biology. The new equipment permits the introduction of modern
cellular-focused activities and projects into a required sophomore-level course,
enabling faculty to introduce students to this important phase of biology early
in their curricula. As a result, a significant increase in hands-on student
involvement is occurring in a number of courses. A corresponding expansion in
the range of undergraduate research projects our students might pursue is
anticipated. The new equipment is greatly enhancing the learning opportunities
available to students.
