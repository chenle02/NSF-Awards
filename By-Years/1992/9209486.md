Robust control has become the central focus of control systems research over the
last 12 years. The objective of this project is to bring together leading
international control researchers to asses the state of knowledge in the rapidly
advancing field of parametric robust control. This workshop will bring together
experts from each of this area. The papers presented at the workshop will be
published in book form. The results of the workshop will have a very significant
international impact on research, education, and engineering applications of
robust control for many years to come. The proposal presented here seeks partial
financial support for the 16 invited participants from the US.
