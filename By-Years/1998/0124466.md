Sufficiently fast fluid flows over erodible beds of sand and gravel entrain
surface particles, which then roll and hop along as bedload. This project aims
to develop quantitative predictive relations between fluid flow and bedload
transport that more precisely incorporate the role of the fluctuating flow
velocities due to turbulence, which always is present. Such relations will apply
to the non-uniform or unsteady flows that are ubiquitous in streams and beneath
waves and will provide new insight into the formation of erosional and
depositional sedimentary features from ripples and dunes to bars and channels to
sorting and grading. The project will investigate (1) turbulence structure and
bedload transport over simple bedforms such as bedload sheets and low dunes, (2)
turbulence structure over abrupt streamwise changes in bed roughness, (3)
turbulence structure and the fluctuating forces on fixed natural bed particles,
(4) turbulence structure and the fluid forces that act on bedload particles
during entrainment, and (5) the modification of fluid velocity and turbulence
structure by moving bedload particles. In addition, the project will further
develop our discrete-particle computational model for sediment transport by (1)
incorporating into it better treatment of the lift forces on bed and bedload
particles and of the reaction forces on the fluid as the particles accelerate
and (2) coupling it with an existing numerical simulation of turbulent flow over
three-dimensional bedforms. The proposed research addresses three intertwined
issues: how the forces exerted on particles on the bed and moving over it are
related to the temporal and spatial distribution of the near-bed fluid
velocities, how the entrainment and motion of those particles are related to the
forces, and how the near-bed fluid velocities are modified by the presence of
the moving bedload.
