Matching markets have an important role in the economy. They determine such
varied outcomes as which student goes to which college, who gets what job, and
who buys what house. Recent work on the theory of matching markets has been
useful to the design of markets as well as for the repair of market failures.
Much of this work, however, has focused on the design and analysis of
centralized matching markets. Many matching markets are not fully centralized;
for example, college admissions decisions in the United States are made by each
individual institution on its own. Furthermore, almost all of the centralized
matching marekts are preceeded by decentralized opportunities for participants
to match. This award funds research on the game theory of these decentralized
markets as well as lab experiments and a field study to identify the crucial
elements that determine decentralized market outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
field study uses the newly developed theory to analyze a unique data set tracing
the way a specific adoption agency matched adopting parents to domestic birth
mothers. The goal is to use these data to better understand the preferences of
adoptive parents and birth mothers towards potential matches.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The theory and experiments will provide
useful tools for improving the design of matching markets. The field study gives
crucial information for child advocates who are seeking to improve state-level
policy towards adoption and foster care.
