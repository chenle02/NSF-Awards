The Oklahoma State University seeks to initiate a 4-week residential Young
Scholars program in Mathematics for 30 students entering grade 12. This project,
called American Indian Summer Program in Mathematics at Oklahoma State
University (MOSU), is a mathematics enrichment experience for American Indian
students. Academic activities include seminars on functions, patterns, and
problem-solving and workshops on the use of graphing calculators, symbolic
manipulation software and electronic mail. In a hands-on cooperative learning
environment, participants will work together to solve mathematics problems,
apply mathematics to real work situations, and learn to use graphing calculators
and computers as aids for doing mathematics. The program will explore ethical
issues related to the integration of traditional American Indian culture with
western science and technology. Technololgy is incorporated through out the
curriculum. Cultural issues and American Indian role models play a critical
role. Academic year follow-up is conducted by electronic mail.
