Classical multivariate analyses are typically designed for fixed dimensional
data, and are often not applicable, even invalid, for high-dimensional data.
Analysis of modern high-dimensional data call for novel multivariate statistical
approaches in the "large-p, small n" paradigm. This proposal consists of three
broad objectives aiming to establish a set of multivariate inferential
procedures that are adaptive to high dimensionality, and can accommodate a wide
range of model and dependence structures. The investigators will develop new
thresholding methods to improve the power performance of the tests for high
dimensional means and covariance when the signals are sparse and faint. They
also propose bandwidth estimators for the state of the art banding and tapering
estimators for covariances, and hence make these two estimation approaches
practical. The project will also develop tests for nonparametric functions of
high-dimensional covariates in partially linear models. The multivariate testing
procedures obtained from the proposed projects will be readily applicable in
selecting gene-sets which are associated with phenotype variations, or
responsive to certain treatments in the forms of having different means or
covariance. The successful application in gene-set analysis will enhance our
understanding of gene regulations at a biological meaningful pathway level. The
research will also improve the applications of multivariate analysis in biology,
marketing research, and financial risk management.
