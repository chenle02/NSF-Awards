This proposed device research incorporates material research and nanofabrication
technology with new system approaches to enhance current fiber optic networking
capabilities. The work is based on research results from a grant made by the
previous NSF CISE EMTNano program that involved silicon phontonics, nano
fabrication and nonlinear optical polymer research. The device research involves
miniaturizing optical components to the nano-scale, thereby extending the t
reach of optics to ever shorter distances. The miniaturization permits
enhancement of bandwidth through the use of on-chip dense wavelength division
multiplexing allowed by silicon photonics components. The miniaturized system
with reduced power consumption permits use of broadband sources instead of a
multitude of stabilized lasers. This new system approach promises not only
breakthroughs in size and cost but an epiphany in the approach to control of
process and thermal variations. The material research involves high temperature
electro-optic chromophores that exhibit high electro-optic coefficients when
guested in polymeric hosts. The nanotechnology includes infiltration and poling
of these novel composite polymers in slotted silicon nano-waveguide structures.

The broader impacts of the proposed research include energy conservation,
education and economic benefits. IT equipment consumes several percent of the
annual national energy consumption of 3.6 PW-h. Efficient computing will
increase IT capacity while lowering energy consumption. This research impacts
education in numerous ways. The program will provide research opportunities for
graduate and undergraduate students. The research results will be published as
well as incorporated into courses in a timely fashion. The PI has a track record
in encouraging participation of minority students and women and will continue to
expand these efforts under this program. The proposal is based on the previous
discoveries in fundamental research efforts and addresses the theme of the NSF
I-Corps Teams, that is, to innovate scientific discoveries into technologies,
products and processes that benefit society. Overall, the proposed work will
broadly impact the society by providing the next-generation computing and
information technology (IT) on which the society increasingly depends.
