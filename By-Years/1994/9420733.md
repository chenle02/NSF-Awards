| b 9420733 PRIVATE Hod. The broad goal of this project is to characterize the
recently identified cAMP regulated RNA binding protein (RBP) that interacts with
PEPCK mRNA (Nachaliel, N., Jain, D., and Hod, Y., 1993, J. Biol. Chem. 268,
24203). Several features of the RBP suggest that it may play an important
physiological role. The activity of the RBP, which is most abundant in the
cytosolic fraction, was found to be significantly reduced in rat hepatoma cells
treated with cAMP, or in livers of starved rats, a physiological state
associated with an increased level of
