This study addresses measurement of local convective surface rainfall and
attendant surface and boundary layer atmospheric variables, on the creation of a
prototype database for fundamental studies on rainfall properties and dynamics,
and on the determination of predictability properties of local surface
convective rainfall. The significance for hydrology is that the study will: (1)
enhance the hydrologic database of rainfall and other storm data with very-fine
resolution data with beneficial consequences for studies on the statistical and
dynamical properties of surface rainfall and its extremes, (2) assess the
fundamental dynamical and microphysical mechanisms at work during the occurrence
of heavy surface rainfall with beneficial consequences for efforts devoted to
dynamical parameterizations, (3) provide predictability measures that would be
very beneficial for hydrologic studies of hazardous flood events. A host of
specially calibrated instruments for surface meteorological measurements,
including very sensitive optical raingauges and a phased array wind profiler
will be used for measurement of convective events in three locations in Iowa
City, Iowa during four spring and summer months of each of the two project
years. The quality-controlled data will be used to create a prototype database
that would be made available (together with documentation) to the scientific
community for fundamental studies. The data will also be used to aid in the
formulation of mathematical models of heavy rainfall that are physics-based and
consistent with the observed temporal features of the process and that could be
used to assess the predictability properties of local surface rainfall.//
