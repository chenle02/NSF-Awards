The proposed research seeks to develop a ship-based weather radar for use in
field studies at sea. This radar will greatly improve our knowledge of oceanic
weather systems, far from the reach of land-based weather radars. The knowledge
gained from this instrument will improve our understanding of how rainfall in
these oceanic weather systems differs from rainfall over land. These
measurements will in turn improve our knowledge of the physics and dynamics of
ocean-based precipitating weather systems. The knowledge gained from these
measurements may improve our methods to calculate rainfall over the vast oceans
of the world in weather models. While not deployed at sea on various field
studies, this radar will serve as a teaching and learning platform for students
and faculty interested in the latest techniques in radar meteorology.

This ship-based C-band, polarimetric Doppler radar will provide an oceanic
capability that currently does not exist in the U.S. Differences in
precipitation processes over land versus sea are well understood but gaps still
exist in our detailed knowledge of these processes. These differences are often
a function of varying aerosol concentrations and differential heating of land
surfaces leading to stronger vertical motions over land versus the sea. This
radar will help fill those gaps through better precipitation estimation and
microphysical parameter characterization using the dual-polarization measurement
capability from the Ship-CPOL radar. These data will also serve as ground truth
for various satellite remote sensing techniques used today to estimate
precipitation over the vast oceans of the world.
