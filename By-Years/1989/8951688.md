This funding allows the Computer Information Systems Department of North Central
Technical College to acquire an IBM AS/400 computer to provide the students
experience with the third generation of the RPG programming language, practice
with associated built-in database management system, familarity with the
computer's operating system and, experience with file and program manipulation
in a system of networked computers. The enhancement to the curriculum provides
student expertise in a modern operating system comparable to that used in the
industrial sector that employs the program graduates. This acquisition is the
final step in the long range plan to provide experience on the full range of
operating systems: MS-DOS, Macintosh, UNIX, and IBM. This award is being matched
by an equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
