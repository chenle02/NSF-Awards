The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) in the state
of North Dakota will enhance the research competitiveness of approximately 20
faculty members working in three established research clusters located at the
two major state universities, North Dakota State University (NDSU) and The
University of North Dakota (UND). The research clusters selected for enhancement
have the potential for national prominence and include: (1) Supramolecular
Protein Complexes: Roles in Metabolic Regulation and Intracellular Structure
(NDSU and UND); (2) Population Change and Genetic Diversity (NDSU and UND) and
(3) Main Group Organometallic Chemistry (NDSU). A fourth emerging research
cluster in the area of intelligent systems will be supported entirely by state
funds. It will provide the state with a means to pursue its economic development
strategy in advanced scientific computing. In addition, outreach programs in
education and human resource development will be conducted that build and
strengthen partnerships between the two universities and the two- and four-year
state colleges, Native American community colleges, the high schools and junior
high schools in the state, and the general public. The state of North Dakota and
institutions will help build and maintain the science and engineering
infrastructure through an outright contribution of $1.333 million per year in
matching funds plus a full contribution of all indirect costs for a total
contribution over three years of over $6.5 million.
