9619527 Barber The author's previous eigenvalue solutions for the problem of
thermoelastic distortions due to frictional contact heating will be extended to
the general case where the perturbations are moving in the direction of sliding.
This is relevant, for example, to the thermoelastic buckling and general
performance of components such as automotive caliper brakes and automatic
transmission clutches. The analytical studies and FEM solutions will be
validated and supplemented with input from industrial collaborators, one an
automotive brake laboratory and the other a manufacturer of automatic
transmissions. The industrial input will be partly in the form of test data and
partly as knowledge transfer obtained by having the two students who do their
theses on the project spend their summers as interns at the respective
industrial sites. ***
