This project focuses on several topics in stochastic analysis and optimization
that include: (i) Adaptive Sequential Detection of a structural change-point
which is not directly observable, in the presence of uncertainty regarding the
characteristics of the new regime; (ii) Stochastic Control with Discretionary
Stopping, as well as Stochastic Games with features of both stopping and
control; (iii) Stochastic Control under Partial Observations, also known as
"adaptive control". Progress in the understanding of optimal stopping has
recently made possible the explicit resolution of a large class of problems. In
this project, it is envisioned that similar advances in significant, and
increasingly realistic, questions of adaptive change-point detection -- when one
has to learn about unobservable parameters and simultaneously, in real time, to
optimize system performance. In addition, plans include work on a 'fusion' of
optimal stopping with stochastic control and filtering theories, and contemplate
the exact resolution of combined problems of stochastic optimization with
discretionary stopping in the presence of partial observations. This effort
will, for the first time, bring the field to the threshold of solving fairly
explicitly several Stochastic Games of combined Control and Stopping, of both
zero- and non-zero-sum type. Optimization problems that involve features of both
stochastic control and optimal stopping arise in the study of target-tracking
models, where one has to stay as close as possible to a certain target by
spending fuel, to declare when one has arrived sufficiently close to the target,
then to decide whether to engage the target or not. Problems of combined optimal
stochastic control/stopping also come up in Mathematical Finance in the context
of computing the upper- and lower-hedging prices of American contingent claims
under portfolio constraints, in portfolio/consumption problems with an embedded
retirement option, in the study of dynamic measures for managing risk, and in
stochastic games of the principal/agent type. The work on adaptive sequential
detection of change-points has clear implications for several fields of
application (signal processing, finance, wireless communication, manufacturing,
image or speech recognition), in contexts where learning about unknown
parameters and dynamic system optimization have to be made simultaneously and in
real time. The resolution of the problems suggested in this project is expected
to advance our understanding of stochastic optimization and expand the frontiers
of its applications. The involvement of graduate students in the research
activities is expected to continue at a strong pace, and to be a major factor in
the advancement of Applied Probability and of the Mathematics of Finance.
