This two-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research aimed
at analysis of high precision variations of the Earth's gravity field obtained
by a global network of superconducting gravimeters. The collaboration involves
the research groups of David Crossley at Saint Louis University and Jacques
Hinderer of the Geophysics Institute in Strasbourg, France. This project is part
of the Global Geodynamics Project (GGP), which is an international six-year
effort to record the Earth's gravity field using superconducting gravimeters.
The investigators will manage the scientific and technical program of the GGP
and cooperate on the analysis of the data and an approach for separating the
actual planetary effects from local station noise. This project will advance
understanding of the dynamics associated with the Earth's interior, especially
the rotations of the liquid outer core and solid inner core. In addition, it
will contribute to knowledge about Earth-atmosphere-ocean interactions.
