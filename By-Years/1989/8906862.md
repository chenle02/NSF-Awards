This award is made in the Organic Dynamics Program in support of the research of
Dr. Steven Kass at the University of Minnesota. The research is concerned with
the gas-phase reactions of organic ion-molecules as studied by the variable
temperature Flowing Afterglow(FA) technique. The principal reactions to be
studied will be unimolecular rearrangements, elimination reactions and the
generation and characterization of novel anions. Substituent effects,
thermodynamic properties, reactivities and carbon-carbon bond cleavages of gas-
phase alkyl anions, generated by acid-base chemistry, will be obtained. A
variety of ring-openings, proton and alkyl shifts and concerted reactions will
be studied. Activation energies will be obtained by measuring rate coefficients
as a function of temperature. Substitution versus elimination in the reaction of
alkyl halides with bases will be explored and the preferred stereochemistry in
1,2- and in 1,4-eliminations will be studied. The objective of these studies is
to provide a greater appreciation for the relationship between structure and
reactivity.
