Bailar, Barbara SBR-9409755 This award provides partial support for the Federal
Statistics Fellowship Program, a program organized by the American Statistical
Association that brings academic researchers into the Bureau of the Census, the
Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the National Center for Education Statistics to
work with statisticians and social scientists for up to one year. The primary
objective of the program is to foster collaborative and interdisciplinary
research efforts that will stimulate the development of methodology and social
science research relevant to issues on which federal statistical agencies
provide information. This program, which began in the late 1970's, has been a
success for both the academic community and the federal agencies. The benefits
to these communities include: (1) research generated by access to data and other
resources that are not available outside the particular government agencies, (2)
improvements in federal statistics, which are used by academic researchers and
others, and (3) the discovery of methodological and other research problems
relevant to public policies.
