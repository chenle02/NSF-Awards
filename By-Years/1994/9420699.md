9420699 Metzger The goal of this project is the synthesis of electron donor-
acceptor molecules that can be used as fast unimolecular rectifiers of
electrical current at the ultimate molecular, or nanometer, limit of electronic
processes. The molecules will be tested as one molecule thick Langmuir-Blodgett
films configured on metal substrates such that the molecular conductivity can be
studied by scanning tunneling microscopy. In addition, photo-excitable molecules
will be synthesized and tested as unimolecular photodiodes, and suitable doping
schemes will be devised to explore the behavior of these devices as molecular
transistors. %%% This interdisciplinary research project will cover aspects of
chemical synthesis, physical characterization, and the design of fast
unimolecular rectifiers, photodiodes, and transistors at the ultimate molecular
or nanometer scale of electronic behavior. This proposed study is crucial to the
development of next generation, molecular based electronic devices particularly
in view of advances in this area in Europe.
