This dissertation project will compare the 20th century migration experiences of
southern whites and African Americans who moved to two midwestern cities,
Cincinnati and Indianapolis. The key goals of the project are to identify and
interpret three migration patterns-migration differentials, step migration and
return migration-while paying special attention to how these patterns varied by
race, urban setting and over time. The project will draw from a broad range of
quantitative and documentary sources, including the Integrated Public Use
Microdata Samples from U.S. censuses of 1910 through 1980. The main sources for
city-level data are samples of county marriage records, which contain
information on race, age, birthplace, occupation and residence for the bride and
groom and their parents. Oral histories, newspapers, and organizational records
will provide supplementary material.
