9406858 ARROYO This three-year plan of postdoctoral study will allow Dr. Arroyo
the opportunity to obtain training in archaeometric research techniques in the
archaeometry laboratory at the Missouri University Research Reactor (MURR). The
techniques learned at MURR will be applied to data that will be recovered on a
regional survey on the Pacific coast of Guatemala. The research will integrate
different lines of technical investigations previously done as well as
information from the field survey and excavations. Research areas will include
the origins of the early formative pottery assemblage, dating of the early
formative assemblage, middle formative occupation, and cultural evolution of the
region. One of the research focusses of archaeometry is the development of
ceramic production and exchange. An important contribution of the field is the
establishment of linkages between the physical properties of objects and human
behavior. Variation in the physical states of artifacts may be evaluated to
understand prehispanic cultural evolution.
