An interactive scientific and educational workshop will be held at Masaya
Volcano (Nicaragua) in February of 2019. The meeting will bring together
graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and early career faculty to gain
hands-on experience with collection, processing, and interpretation of ground-
and satellite-based observations of volcanic processes, and will provide an
immersive networking opportunity for students, early career faculty and
international collaborators. The workshop will entail an initial (pre-workshop)
deployment, ongoing field study during the workshop, lectures and presentations,
and data analysis. A follow-up mini-workshop in the US will allow the workshop
PIs to complete data analysis, integration, and publication. This workshop is
the second in a planned series of innovative workshops involving targeted study
of select open-vent volcanic systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Masaya Volcano is the
ideal locale for this workshop owing to the current presence of a dynamic and
easily accessible lava lake. The volcanic activity is amenable to a range of
geophysical data collection, including seismic, infrasonic, geodetic, optical,
thermal, and ground-based UV and microwave sensing. It also presents an ideal
opportunity the integration of remote sensing observations from satellite
platforms (e.g., geodetic, gas, optical and thermal), with ground-based
observations. The scientific program will focus on data acquisition, processing,
and analysis techniques through hands-on demonstration and focused discussion.
Novel scientific insights are expected from integration of diverse data
sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
