This is new study of the nutrient dynamics of silica in the Sargasso Sea. The
field work will be done at Station S south of Bermuda, a site with good
historical biological oceanographic data as well as ongoing studies. The study
will use a new high sensitivity silica technique and collaborates with a new
proposal by McCarthy and Garside that is centered on the nitrogen dynamics of
the same system. Both uptake and dissolution of silica in surface waters will be
measured, as well as the ambient concentrations and the particulate flux in
sediment traps. Silica dynamics are mainly influenced by diatom growth and
removal processes and this study will be one of the first to focus on the
distribution of diatoms in the Sargasso Sea.
