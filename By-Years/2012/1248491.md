This project supports three years of research team seminars in cultural
anthropology, biological anthropology, and archaeology that will be hosted by
the School for Advanced Research (SAR), an advanced research center for
anthropology and allied disciplines. The program will support at least two
seminars each year for research teams that need focused time together to
discuss, synthesize, and analyze the results of their collaborative research and
to develop plans for successful completion of their projects. Eligible research
teams will be those in which the primary focus is on a question of
anthropological importance, but the teams may be interdisciplinary and
international in scope. Seminars will be selected through biannual competitions
held in March and September. Transportation to and from SAR and all food and
lodging will be provided for the research team to meet in SAR's Seminar House
for no more than four days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project addresses recent
studies on the state of U.S. and international scientific inquiry, which
identify a trend towards increased collaborative, interdisciplinary, and
international research and the increased quality and importance of the products
resulting from this research framework. However, studies on the practice of
collaborative science also demonstrate that, while digital communication is an
important component of team research, face-to-face interaction is also needed to
successfully advance the research, which can be a challenge to achieve when the
investigators are scattered across the U.S. and in other countries. This program
addresses this need and advances collaborative scientific inquiry by providing
the opportunity for at least 6 research teams consisting of approximately 10
participants each to assemble at SAR from 2013-2016.
