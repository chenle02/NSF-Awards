This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) is supported by the Office of
International Science and Engineering in conjunction with the Petrology and
Geochemistry program to provide funds for collecting urgent data on a recent
explosive eruption of Llaima Volcano in Southern Chile. This explosive basaltic
eruption began on 1 Jan 2008 and the field data needs to be collected before the
thin deposits are destroyed in the austral winter. The investigators are early
career researchers from the fields of physical volcanology and geochemistry who
both have experience working in basaltic systems. The project will involve
combining field geology and monitoring data with petrological and geochemical
analysis of the eruptive products to build an understanding of the eruption
system and in particular conduit processes at usually passively degassing
volcanoes. This work forms part of a broader research interest in the dynamics
of basaltic systems and will form the basis of a PhD thesis for an incoming PhD
student. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This eruptive phase of the Llaima volcano began
on 1 Jan 2008, with a spectacular fire fountain display lasting 14 hours and
continued at lower effusion rates through February and March with the effusion
of a lava flow from the summit crater. The intriguing aspect of this eruption is
the style of activity emanating from two lateral, vents, which generated
frequent small explosions, the plumes of which collapsed and formed pyroclastic
flows on numerous occasions. This eruption provides a window of opportunity to
test ongoing work by the investigators on passively degassing basaltic systems,
based on the neighboring Villarrica volcano and Stromboli, in Italy. In
particular, it is planned to investigate the transition of these normally
quiescence systems into eruptive cycles, and furthermore probe the nature of
the, clearly, complex plumbing system. &lt;br/&gt;
