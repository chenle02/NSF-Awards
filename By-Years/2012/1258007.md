This award is for supporting a community workshop on Atmospheric and Space
Science Research in Polar Regions. The overarching theme of the workshop is to
address the status and future prospects of geospace sciences in the Arctic and
Antarctic, using these geographical regions as a platform for specific aeronomy
and space physics research projects. The workshop will bring together a diverse
group of researchers to map out goals for the direction of polar research in the
coming years. While fundamental aspects of Sun-Earth coupling will be one
important topic, the workshop will focus specifically on making real progress in
the field of space weather, as well as to open up discussions related to solar
forcing of climate change. As observing platforms, the value of polar regions
are critical to future progress in these fields. The expanse of the Antarctic
continent, in particular, provides access to geospace regions that cannot be
reached in the northern hemisphere because of the presence of the Arctic Ocean.
In addition, the relative orientation of the magnetic and geographic poles in
the southern hemisphere enable observations within the auroral zone to be
carried out in 24-hour darkness, a capability not at all possible in the
northern hemisphere, yet critical to understanding auroral processes on Earth?s
dayside. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this proposal are in that the meeting
will broaden the perspective of U.S. scientists in the polar observing systems,
promote international collaboration, and provide an opportunity for the next
generation of geospace scientists to interact with leaders in the field. The
workshop will provide a forum to develop a blueprint for a more unified
scientific enterprise for research in space weather, space climate, and upper
atmospheric aeronomy.
