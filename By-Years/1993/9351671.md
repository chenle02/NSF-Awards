9351671 DuBois We are establishing a new course in computational chemistry and
visualization applications and a Computational Chemistry and Visualization
Laboratory. This laboratory facility is enabling us to teach computational
chemistry and visualization applications to students in a laboratory environment
as well as providing lecture demonstration capabilities through our video
classroom facilities. This integrated use of molecular modeling and
visualization tools is being implemented throughout our curriculum (and
especially in the junior and senior years) and is enabling our students to
visualize a number of fundamental molecular properties which are important in
relating microscopic concepts to the macroscopic properties of materials. Recent
advances in computational chemistry programs, 3D visualization software,
workstation power and computer networking have combined to allow this exciting
opportunity to make fundamental pedagogical changes in the undergraduate
curriculum. These changes are enabling students to better understand and
comprehend the critical, basic concepts of molecular bonding, intramolecular and
intermolecular interactions, and molecular interactions with electromagnetic
radiation. Perhaps most importantly, the students are gaining that understanding
much earlier in their chemical education which, in turn, is permitting them to
advance to much higher levels of chemical understanding during their
undergraduate education. ***
