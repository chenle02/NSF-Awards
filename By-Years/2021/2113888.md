This award to SRI International (Dr. Konstantinos Kalogerakis) will support the
quantitative reevaluation of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere chemistry
based upon new laboratory results. Nightglow emission signatures observed from
space and ground-based instruments are commonly used as proxies for atmospheric
composition, especially for the altitude region around 100 km that cannot be
easily studied in situ. Monitoring the intensity and temporal evolution of such
proxies by remote sensing is the method of choice to study many phenomena
occurring in this region of the atmosphere. This award would support the
quantitative reanalysis of the details relevant to the production and loss of
excited atomic and molecular precursors responsible for prominent nightglow
emissions. These results would quantify more precisely the study of atmospheric
composition, radiative and energy balance, wave propagation and dissipation, as
well as transport dynamics. One or two undergraduate students would be engaged
in this work through a site REU grant awarded to SRI
International.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The thrust of this reevaluation to be
supported by this award would be aimed at the investigation of the coupling
between the OH Meinel and the O2 Atmospheric band emissions, which is connected
to the collisions of O atoms with vibrationally excited OH. Part of this study
would utilize observational data sets derived from multiple sounding rocket
experiments that would be combined with modeling methodologies based upon
recently developed efforts based upon new laboratory
findings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
