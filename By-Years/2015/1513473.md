Galaxies are vast collections of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter, and come in
various sizes, shapes, and colors. Understanding how the different types of
galaxies formed is one of the major quests in astrophysics. Today, the biggest
and heaviest galaxies in the local universe are found to be quiescent (i.e., not
forming new stars) and made of very old stars, with typical ages of 12 billion
years. To understand how these nearby galaxies formed, their counterparts in the
distant, young universe need to be studied as well. Dr. Marchesini and his team
will investigate quiescent galaxies over 95% of cosmic history using the highest
quality astronomical observations. The findings will be compared with
theoretical predictions, providing new clues on what switches off star formation
in the early phase of galaxy formation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides training
graduate and undergraduate students, Dr. Marchesini will implement a summer
research program for high-school students, contribute to the professional
development of K-12 science teachers, and deliver public lectures.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project includes construction of multi-wavelength
photometric catalogs of galaxies using data from the Hubble Frontier Fields,
ground-based telescopes (Keck and VLT), and Spitzer-IRAC. The spectral energy
distributions of the detected galaxies will be modeled to derive photometric
redshifts and stellar population properties. The evolution of the stellar mass
function of galaxies since redshift z=7 will be measured, with particular
emphasis on the quiescent galaxy population.
