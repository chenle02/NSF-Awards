This group of investigators from the University of California at Santa Barbara
proposed to purchase an "Iris Crimson Elan" computer for the purpose of DNA and
protein sequence analysis and molecular graphics. The investigators use
recombinant DNA techniques in their research. Nearly 20 individual labs will use
the computer. The labs will be linked by an ethernet system currently being
installed by the institution. Research projects using the system include a wide
range of studies involving both plant and animal cells.
