The goal of this research is to investigate the characteristics of intense
electron beam sources based on laser-generated photoelectrons at the surface of
an organic thin film on a metal substrate. Recent work has demonstrated that
high current densities and large total currents can be generated by laser
illumination of conventional photocathodes in ultrahigh vacuum environments, and
also that organic thin films can serve as excellent photoelectron sources. The
advantages of organic films include greatly reduced vacuum requirements and ease
of fabrication. This project will determine the energies, energy spreads,
angular divergences, and apparent source sizes of photoelectrons from organic-
thin films. The temporal behavior of the emission will be investigated with
various laser wavelengths and pulse lengths. Films containing active molecules
in a host, and more than one type of active molecule, will be evaluated, as well
as coatings of a single material. Substrate effects will also be explored. A
kinetic model of the emission process will be developed to explain the temporal
and spectral characteristics. The proposed research program is an investigation
of new techniques and materials, particularly nonlinear organic thin films,
which can be used to generate electron beams of high current density under
intense illumination by a laser. Electron beams of high brightness can be used
for integrated circuit lithographic exposure, for instruments such as
microprobes and electron microscopes; for point- source X-ray generation, and
for large scale devices such as accelerators and free electron lasers. Laser-
generated results indicate that kiloampere currents can be produced easily.
Synchronized emission from multiple emitters as well as optically controlled
beam shapes are possible with this technique. Because high current densities and
small spot sizes with extremely rapid spot deflection can be achieved, the
interaction of these beams with semiconductors should make possible some very
useful signal processing and switching applications.
