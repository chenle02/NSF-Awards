9512821 Channell This two-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research
in marine geology and geophysics involves J.E.T. Channell at the University of
Florida and Carlo Laj and Catherine Kissel at the Center for Radioactivity,
French National Center for Scientific Research, Gif Sur Yvette, France. The main
objective of their research is to carry out rock magnetic studies of ten Late
Pleistocene piston cores from the Labrador Sea and Northwest Atlantic. These
magnetic studies will advance understanding of marine detrital events associated
with ice sheet variability. The project takes advantage of a unique French
instrument a high resolution pass-through magnetometer and French expertise in
global paleoclimatology.
