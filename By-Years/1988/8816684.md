This award to George Mason University's Department of Geology is made in
response to a proposal submitted to the National Science Foundation's Research
in Undergraduate Institutions Program. The award will provide one-half of the
funds needed to acquire a cathode luminoscope system. The University is
committed to providing the other half required. The equipment will be used to
expand the capabilities of the Geology Department in teaching and research
involving microscope studies of rocks. Cathode luminescence is induced in
certain minerals when they are bombarded by electrons. The exact nature of the
visible radiation induced in a particular mineral depends on details of its
crystalline defects and chemical impurities. Consequently, the study of
catholuminescence is very useful in the study of the provenance, or origin, of
the mineral grains in sedimentary rocks. The system at George Mason University
will be used in studies of the reconstruction of the Appalachian area during the
mountain building episode in the Ordovician time period.
