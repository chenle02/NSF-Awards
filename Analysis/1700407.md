This award provides funding to help defray the travel expenses of participants
in the conference "Ergodic Theory and Operator Algebras" that will be held from
June 5-9, 2017, on the campus of Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas.

This conference will be run as one of the two concentration weeks in the 2017
installment of the Workshop in Analysis and Probability, which takes place each
summer at Texas A&M University. Recent separate developments in both the field
of ergodic theory and operator algebras means that a conference on the
interaction of these subjects is timely. This conference is unique in that it
will focus on the intersection of these areas and aimed at graduate students and
junior researchers. Funds from this award will support the participation in this
conference by U.S. graduate students and junior researchers without other
sources of funding. More details are available at the conference website
http://www.math.tamu.edu/~kerr/etoa2017/.
