9315683 Webster This project will elucidate the behavior of Cl in magmatic
systems. The results will find application in processes involving exsolution of
Cl-bearing fluids/melts, in speciation and transport of Cl-complexed ore metals
in hydrothermal fluids, or in discharge of Cl to the atmosphere from erupting
magma. The research program involves a series of experiments to determine: (1)
the solubility of chloride melts (NaCl-, KCl-, and AlCl3-bearing) in granitic
melts, (2) the distribution of chlorine between granite melt and coexisting
aqueous phases, and (3) the effects of P, T, and melt composition on both of
these objectives. The experiments will be conducted at pressures of 0.001 to 1.5
kbar and temperatures of 700o to 1000o C. Melt compositions will include
peralkaline, subaluminous, and peraluminous haplogranites and Fe-, Ca-, Li-, B-,
F-, and CO2-bearing granites; the experiments will be conducted with a range of
Cl concentrations.
