9507062 Schriber A Particle Accelerator Conference, the latest in a series that
occur biennially, this year combined with the International Conference on High
Energy Accelerators, is supported in part this grant. this provides a forum for
presentation of the newest developments in accelerator technology, and for
exchanges of ideas to stimulate further advances and generate new ideas. The
published proceedings, available in print as well as on CD-ROM, are valuable
references for researchers in acceleration methods and technology. ***
