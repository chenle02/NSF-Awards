This project is part of NSF's "Research in Undergraduate Institutions" funding
opportunity. It supports the research of seven collaborating anthropologists
studying the adjustment and inter ethnic relations of Guatemalan, Haitian, Cuban
and Mexican immigrants to South Florida, and the responses to these ethnic
groups by native African Americans and Hispanics. Using survey and intensive
interviews schedules, the project will focus on political and economic
behaviors, studying how these behaviors are maintained and revised by cultural
factors such as religious practices and family life, as well as social factors
such as network formation, class, and relations with state agencies. This
research is important because the understanding of inter ethnic relations is of
critical importance to modern societies. Such comparative case studies will help
policy makers deal with feelings of unfairness and commitment to social order
among diverse ethnic groups.
