Our legal system often requires decision-making. Judges and legislators must
often resolve, address, or intelligently incorporate into policy, scientific
issues that are themselves hotly debated by knowledgeable scientists. How can we
best adjudicate competing scientific claims consistently with democratic values?
An historian/philosopher of science, Jane Maienschein, a lawyer, Daniel Strouse,
and a biologist, James Collins, have organized this conference in order to
formulate a research agenda on questions of how conflicting scientific claims
are resolved in a constitutional democracy. Traditionally, scholars in science
studies, law, and political philosophy have lacked a common perspective. They
have different conceptions of evidence and different approaches to resolution.
Nonetheless, the issues overlap all these disciplines and the scientific. legal,
and political communities in which such conflict resolution currently proceeds
also overlap. Indeed, legal systems and scientific development seem to be
central to establishing and stabilizing democracies. Consequently, we need an
interdisciplinary study of the adjudication of competing scientific claims in
the context of such democratic systems. This workshop promises to develop a
research agenda for such interdisciplinary study by identifying researchable
questions, promising approaches, and available opportunities. Experts from law,
biology, philosophy, the social and behavioral sciences, and history will gather
to be held in Phoenix Arizona March 24 and 25 to develop this research agenda.
