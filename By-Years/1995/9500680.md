9500680 Bayless This Small Business Innovative Research Phase II project
provides the opportunity to eliminate the radioactive material currently used in
Measurement-While-Drilling (MWD) density logging tools. The existing tools,
which provide critical information for most formation evaluations, pose risks to
the environment and to the personnel that operate and transport them. The
overall objective of the project is to perform the research required to develop
a novel electrical x-ray instrument for the measurement of bulk formation
density and lithology (composition) in MWD applications. The specific technical
objectives of the project are: (1) to modify the Phase I device to
experimentally demonstrate reliable electron beam operation at high energies;
(2) to improve the basic geometry of the x-ray density/lithology logging tool in
order to maximize its performance; (3) to design and construct a high energy
laboratory prototype x-ray logging tool; (4) to measure the performance
characteristics of the laboratory prototype x-ray system; and (5) to
experimentally evaluate the high energy MWD x-ray tool in simulated formations.
Sperry-Sun Drilling Services, a leader in the MWD field and a Phase I
contributor, will participate under Objectives 2, 3 and 5. If successful, this
project will provide a new type of MWD density/lithology logging tool with
performance parameters comparable to, or exceeding, those of radioactive tools.
However, it will eliminate the risks associated with the radioactive material in
existing tools. ***
