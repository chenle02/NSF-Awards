The proposed project seeks financial support to support a workshop to be held
October 17-19, 2018 at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina CA. The Workshop
will bring together the NSF EFRI Two- Dimensional Atomic-Layer Research and
Engineering (2-DARE), as well as New Light, EM (Electronic) and Acoustic Wave
Propagation: Breaking Reciprocity and Time Reversal Symmetry (NewLAW) supported
researchers working on materials and devices in these areas to help promote
future collaborations and address common challenges. This includes faculty,
postdoctoral researcher and graduate students from the institutions supported by
the 2-DARE and NewLAW programs. The Workshop is expected to play a key role in
addressing in detail currently faced bottlenecks in material and device research
and identifying new directions for research. The research discussed at the
Workshop is expected to lead to technological breakthroughs and disruptive
technologies that can have great societal impact in the future in many areas
such as sensing, communications and health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
