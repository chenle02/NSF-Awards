In more technical terms, the main component of research of this award is the
study of critical points of curvature functionals on Riemannian manifolds. An
important problem is to understand compactness of moduli spaces and existence of
critical metrics, such as anti-self-dual and extremal Kaehler metrics. With
certain geometric noncollapsing assumptions, the appropriate moduli spaces can
be compactified by adding metrics with orbifold-like singularities. A long-term
goal is to extend the compactness theorem to include the possibility of
collapsing, and to find other applications to the differential topology of four-
manifolds. In dimension four, critical points of the Weyl energy are known as
Bach-flat metrics, which contains the class of anti-self-dual metrics. Such
metrics have very interesting properties, and can be studied using twistor
theory. In higher dimensions, the PI will investigate quadratic curvature
functionals, and their variational properties, such as stability and rigidity of
critical points. This has applications to volume comparison theorems and gluing
results. The PI is also interested in non-compact examples of critical metrics,
such as asymptotically locally Euclidean critical metrics, and obtaining optimal
decay rates for such spaces. This has applications to the understanding of the
structure of moduli spaces, and to the removal of singularities.

An important motivation for the research of the PI is to understand the
relationship between the geometry and the topology of a space. The latter,
topology, is the study of properties of a space which are invariant under
continuous stretching or bendings of a space, while the former, geometry,
involves understanding distances and is more rigid. For example, the surface of
our planet is a sphere, and one measures distances on it by computing arclengths
of great circles (the Earth is actually an oblate spheroid, but it is very close
to being perfectly spherical). One can imagine deforming the Earth by pushing in
or pulling on small or large regions to warp the geometry. Such a deformation is
less appealing that the familiar round Earth, and there are many ways to make
this notion very precise in terms of minimizing some sort of total energy
measurement. This is directly related to physical principles which say that the
state of a physical system will tend towards a final configuration which
minimizes the total energy. This idea can be generalized to higher-dimensional
objects called manifolds, which are generalized versions of the surface of the
our planet. For example, the space that we live in is three-dimensional, and if
one includes time, we are in a four-dimensional universe. In order to understand
these types of higher-dimensional objects, one attempts to find the best way to
measure distances on them which use the least amount of energy, and maximize the
symmetries of the space. The projects described above are to define appropriate
energies on such spaces, and to seek out the important optimal geometries which
minimize the total energy.
