Furman University has installed a TCP/IP network that links the equipment in
the major academic and administrative buildings on campus. It requests support
from NSF for connection of this campus network to SURAnet. SURAnet is the
midlevel network located in the southeastern United States. It will provide
operations management and information services and it give Furman University a
56 thousand bits per second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45
million bits per second) National Backbone network. The University needs greater
functionality and network speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries,
and make file transfers along with being able to collaborate with peers at other
schools on common projects. Students and faculty research will benefit from the
link. This is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative
educational resources.
