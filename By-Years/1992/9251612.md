This undergraduate plant physiology course now includes a pressure chamber and
osmometer to measure whole leaf water and osmotic potential, a portable
photosynthesis system to measure carbon dioxide uptake, stomatal conductance,
and transpiration, and oxygen electrodes, monitors, and chart recorders to
measure respiration and the light reactions of photosynthesis. Students
investigate such relevant questions as the effects of herbicides and of
increasing carbon dioxide concentrations on plant physiology.
