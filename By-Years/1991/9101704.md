Within the past decade there has been an increasing awareness of the importance
of oceans in the climate and biogeochemical cycles of our world. Biologically,
the primary producers of the oceans play a major role in these effects. The 37th
Brookhaven Symposium on Biology: Primary Productivity and Biogeochemical Cycles
in the Sea, will provide a major synopsis of where we have come in this area of
research in the past decade and will provide a forum for discussions on the
future needs in biological and chemical oceanography.
