9550593 Hrabowski The proposed University of Maryland System (UMS) Alliance for
Minority Participation (AMP) is a comprehensive program that is designed to
extend and increase the impact of current initiatives to increase substantially
the quantity and quality of minority students receiving baccalaureate degrees in
science, engineering, and mathematics (SEM). The following UMS institutions will
participate as full partners in the proposed AMP: 1) the University of Maryland
Baltimore County (UMBC); 2) the University of Maryland College Park (UMCP); and
3) the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES), a historically black
institution. Additional UMS institutions have expressed and interest in
participating in the proposed UMS AMP. Discussions regarding additional UMS
partners for years two through five are underway. Dr. Freeman A. Hrabowski, III,
President of UMBC, has received national recognition for his leadership in
developing innovative programs to expand educational opportunities for minority
SEM students, and he will be the principal investigator for the proposed UMS
AMP. Dr. Hrabowski received the National Science Foundation's 1994 Educator
Award for his outstanding commitment and dedication in the education of
minorities in the fields of science and mathematics. Also participating in the
AMP will be the following community colleges located in close proximity of the
participating UMS institutions and that serve as the primary feeders of minority
SEM transfer students: 1) Anne Arundel Community College; 2) Baltimore City
Community College; 3) Catonsville Community College; 4) Chesapeake Community
College; 5) Howard Community College; 6) Montgomery Community College; 7) Prince
Georges Community College; and 8) Wor Wic Community College. In support of NSF's
goals, the primary goals of the proposed UMS AMP include the following: 1. To
produce approximately 800 minority SEM baccalaureate recipients each year by the
end of the 1999-2000 a cademic year. 2. To enroll at least 300 minority SEM
graduate students per year beginning in the fall of 1997. The secondary goals of
the proposed UMS AMP is to increase the number of minority students entering SEM
careers, especially faculty positions. The proposed AMP's design includes the
following characteristics: Strong commitment by institutional leaders to the
program's success; Removal of financial barriers for minority students; A Summer
Bridge Component; An Academic Year Component; Focus on improving knowledge and
skills; Focus on motivation and support; Focus on monitoring and advising; Focus
on academic and social interaction; Focus on "filter" SEM course curricula
revision; and Involvement of feeder community colleges.
