The goal of this research is the investigation, design and implementation of
high performance VLSI architectures for two dimensional pattern matching and
recognition. Although several hardware algorithms have been proposed in the
literature for the one-dimensional pattern (string) matching problem and its
variations, very little work has been done in the area of hardware algorithms
for matching and recognition of two-dimensional patterns. Most of the research
has been aimed at efficient software algorithms based on different features and
matching strategies. Many pattern matching applications need real-time response,
perform number of repetitive computations on different data sets, make use of
regular and local operations, are modular, and have a fair amount of inherent
parallelism. The design of special purpose hardware for pattern matching could
speed up the task considerably, making it amenable for real-time applications.
Specifically, the main objectives of this research are . Develop new and
efficient hardware algorithms and VLSI chips for a class of pattern matching
problems such as scene matching, approximate string matching, polygon matching
and tree matching. . Design and develop an application specific system
architecture for pattern matching and recognition through integration of the
above mentioned VLSI components at board level.
