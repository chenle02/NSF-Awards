This project will develop a High Resolution Imaging Systems Laboratory which
will provide facilities for undergraduate electrical engineering students to
undertake design projects in sensor array processing, data fusion, machine
vision, radar, video, and related fields.Senior electrical engineering students
will work in teams on year-long design projects, where they will be involved
with all aspects of engineering design, including preparatory theoretical
studies and literature searches; hardware, software, and system design; project
management and scheduling; component selection and ordering; as well as written
and oral presentations and demonstrations, all under the guidance and oversight
of an expert faculty advisor.Each project will involve the design and
implementation of a complete imaging system residing on a personal computer or a
high-powered workstation, or a standalone system that comprises specialized VLSI
processors. The equipment acquired consists of the circuitry, devices, and
computer hardware and software to acquire and process image data. It will permit
the implementation of the various types of imaging systems described above. Both
required and elective theoretical courses will be impacted by the proposed lab,
allowing theory to be focused on the context of the design and application of
real imaging systems.
