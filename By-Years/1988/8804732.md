The polyhedrin gene of Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus is
maximally expressed very late in infection, after the release of extracellular
virus. It is believed that temporal regulation of polyhedrin requires the
sequential expression of an immediate early gene(s) to activate delayed early
gene expression; a delayed early gene(s) to turn on DNA synthesis and large gene
expression; and a late gene(s) to stimulate polyhedrin, a very large gene. I
have devised a complementation assay to map the viral factors which control the
temporal regulation of polyhedrin expression. A plasmid, polcat, was constructed
that contains the bacterial gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) under
the control of the polyhedrin promoter. CAT is expressed upon cotransfection of
permissive insect cells with polcat and viral DNA, but not with viral DNA which
has previously been digested with restriction enzymes. The inability of digested
DNA to support polcat expression is apparently due to inactivation of one or
more essential genes by restriction digest. The location of these genes can be
mapped by complemenation with cloned PstI-restriction fragments. Preliminary
results indicated that twelve of the PstI clones complement different digests of
viral DNA, indicating that at least twelve genes are involved in the temporal
cascade. I intend to map and determine the function of several of these factors
in temporal regulation of polyhedrin expression. The ultimate goal of this
project is to define a limited set of viral genes which permits high level
expression of polyhedrin in insect cells. Although it may not be possible to
identify all of the factors during the grant period, this research should
increase our understanding of the mechanisms of temporal regulation of
baculovirus gene expression.
