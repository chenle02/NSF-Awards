A feasibility study will be undertaken to facilitate the collection of underway
oceanographic and meteorological data from the increased use of Volunteer
Observing Ships (VOS). A major element of a VOS installation is the wiring that
links sensors to data loggers and satellite transmitters. The feasibility of
removing the need for the wiring will be explored by seeking a wireless means of
signal transmission. Three possible solutions will be investigated:(1) a radio
modem, (2) an acoustic modem, and (3) a power line/inductive coupled system.
Different ships may require different approaches or combinations of approaches.
Wireless system benefits include:(1) greatly reduced time to install data
gathering systems on ships,(2) increased flexibility, including the ability to
quickly relocate sensors for better performance, (3) portability, making it
easier to move a meteorological system from ship to ship, and (4) the ability to
obtain real-time data, such as sea-surface temperature, from difficult locations
onboard or inside the ship without the need to run expensive cabling through
bulkheads.
