ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;05 May 2008&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
0820677&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Skidaway&lt;br/&gt;PI: J.
Sanders&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal requested six Shipboard Scientific
Support items for the R/V SAVANNAH; namely an aft conning station enclosure and
relocation of crane controls, gyrosphere replacement and backup satellite
compass, limited GMDSS equipment, fixed fire suppression systems for two
machinery spaces, a new RHIB and outboard, and an oily water separator. Some
were considered important safety items, while others served to enhance
operations and maintenance. Only the aft conning enclosure, gyrosphere and
satellite compass, one fixed fire suppression system, and RHIB were recommended
for funding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The R/V SAVANNAH supports
federally and state funded scientific research on the southern east coast and
routinely exposes graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography.
