In this GOALI program the PI's are pursuing systematic studies of the key
physical processes underlying the efficient hyperpolarization of He-3 and Xe-129
by spin- exchange optical pumping. Measurements focus on the determination of
spin-exchange and spin-relaxation cross sections, optical pumping at high buffer
gas pressures, the role of van der Waals molecules in high-pressure Xe cells,
light transport in optically thick vapors, and relaxation processes which
depolarize the species. This research is conducted by collaborators from the
University of Wisconsin and Magnetic Imaging Technologies Incorporated (MITI), a
newly-established company specializing in the commercialization of hyper-
polarized noble-gas sources for use in medical diagnostics. The experiments are
conducted by students working partly at the university and partly at the company
laboratories. Partial funding is provided by the Office of Multidisciplinary
Activities (OMA).
