Michael Rubinstein of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, is
supported by an award from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program
to develop a theory of the self-healing process for the major class of autonomic
self-healing polymeric material: networks with reversible associations and
dissociations. The self-healing ability of these polymers originates in high
non-equilibrium concentration of dissociated groups created at the fractured
surfaces that decays very slowly during a "waiting" time while two broken parts
of the material are kept separated from each other. One of the objectives of the
project is to determine which molecular parameters, such as degree of
polymerization, number of associating groups per chain, and the strength of
associations maintain the high excess of dissociated groups at the fractured
surfaces for the longest period of waiting time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
research contributes to the development of synthetic self-healing materials
which are expected to have major technological impact by extending the working
life and safety of polymeric components used in a broad range of applications.
Results of this research are incorporated into new problem sets and
supplementary materials for the "Polymer Physics" textbook by M. Rubinstein and
R. H. Colby. Examples of self-healing materials are being used in the design of
the updated "Zoom In" exhibit at the Morehead Planetarium and Science Center as
well as in lectures by the PI to high school students at the "Science Spectrum"
and "Science at the Edge" series at UNC.
