The Environmental Chemical Sciences (ECS) program of the Division of Chemistry
will support the research program of Associate Prof. Anne Johansen of Central
Washington University (CWU). Dr. Johansen and her research group will study the
chemical mechanisms linking physico-chemical properties of collected atmospheric
ultrafine particles (ยกร 100 nm, UFP) to their environmental reactivity and
physiological toxicity. Two main particle characteristics are investigated: (i)
the content of redox-active, or bioavailable iron, and (ii) the degree of
particle surface carbon oxidation. In addition, the presence of potential
electron donors in the surrounding matrix will be evaluated. By using model soot
and real UFPs, mechanisms will be identified and their relative significance
assessed in biologically and environmentally relevant conditions. Research will
be conducted at CWU and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory User Facility
(EMSL) with the aid of custom-made and state-of-the-art instruments. These
analytical capabilities will enable the generation of novel results that are
likely to increase current understanding of the reactivity and transformation of
carbonaceous particles in a variety of settings. An important educational
component of this study is the effective training of undergraduate students from
a primarily undergraduate institution located in a rural setting such as CWU. A
large number of underrepresented minority students will gain experimental,
critical thinking and communication skills through their hands-on work while
collaborating with scientists from the nearby National Laboratory.
