Commercial aquaculture of the hard clam, Mercenaria mercenaria, is practiced
throughout the Atlantic coast of the United States. The development of this
industry is based on hatchery produced seed. Growout success is dependent on the
initial size of the planted seed, predator protection and the timing of that
planting. Seed placed in the field late in the planting season yields variable
success. The reasons for the variable success of these late plantings has not
been investigated, but is believed to be related to the "health" or "condition"
of the seed. A second, but related source of economic loss is the variable
success experienced when small clams are overwintered in onshore nursery
systems. Once seed begin to die, losses can be at a rate of 5% or more per day
compounded. Such losses impose a large economic burden on clam culturists. The
researchers propose developing and testing a method that could be used by
hatcheries or planters to evaluate the general "condition" of seed clams. This
technique, once calibrated, could be used to make economic decisions on
supplemental feeding or other techniques to improve condition of the seed.
