Experience has proven that exploiting robots for manipulation tasks is much more
difficult than engineers had expected and many attempts at automating tasks
requiring robotic manipulation have failed. Our research has led us to believe
that a formal approach to specifying the steps required for manipulation tasks
is essential to developing the required software for a specific task, and in
adaptively controlling and monitoring robotic operations. We have defined 14
primitive operations based on the reduction in the degrees of freedom which
occurs when components are assembled or manipulated, and from our initial
experiments, these primitives appear to elegantly and completely define the fine
manipulation required for simple assembly tasks. Each of the primitives has a
strategy associated with its execution, and a set of recovery algorithms in the
event the operation fails. The work herein proposed will expand and further test
the basic concepts. Manipulation By Constraint can be thought of as an approach
to representing the knowledge required to assemble or manipulate objects.
