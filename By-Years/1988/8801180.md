This is a project for research at the interface of two areas of mathematics,
Banach space theory and probability theory. The former has to do with the
convergence of series. Classically, the terms of the series are functions, but
there is a conceptual advantage in taking them simply to be vectors in an
abstract Banach space. Respecializing, the terms of the series can be random
variables, whose study is at the heart of probability theory. This point of view
has lately turned out to be very fruitful. More specifically, Professor
Talagrand will continue the introduction of new combinatorial and isoperimetric
methods in probability theory. A particular objective is better understanding of
necessary and sufficient conditions for sample boundedness of p-stable
processes. He will also tackle a famous open problem in Banach space theory
having to do with the classical space of absolutely integrable functions on the
unit interval.
