9354523 Aldridge This project addresses the implementation, evaluation and
refinement of an introductory-level sophomore course for preparing engineering,
business and industrial design students to function effectively on cross-
disciplinary design teams. The project contains three major elements:
application, evaluation and refinement of materials and methods for the course;
evaluation of the course content and teaching methods for preparing students to
work in cross-disciplinary teams in advanced courses and after graduation; and
dissemination of the approach and instructional materials to other institutions.
To maximize opportunities for students to learn how to accommodate and profit
from work team diversity, special efforts are made to recruit women and
minorities into the project. Long-term evaluation of project and program
effectiveness and dissemination of materials is provided by the National
Consortium for Technology in Business headquartered at Auburn University in the
College of Engineering. ***y
