This pilot project will begin to study the impact of a community-based
electronic network linking members of a rural Minnesota county. It will follow
the development of an ambitious electronic network project (Grant Rapids
Network/Itasca Regional Network, or GrandNet/IRNET) that seeks to link
businesses, schools, government agencies and households in Itasca County,
Minnesota. The project will focus on three fundamental values an electronic
community can potentially affect: access to resources, equality of opportunity,
and civic participation. To answer questions concerning whether groups are
relatively advantaged or disadvantaged by this new development, and how it
affects citizen involvement, a multi-method approach will be tested: The team
will collect baseline information and compare it to similar indicators as the
network is implemented. Team members will also administer small-scale surveys
and undertake in-depth interviews and focus group sessions with relevant
individuals and group representatives - including students, teachers, members of
special sub-populations, civic leaders and network users -during the research
period. The combination of multiple methods will help to assure that the results
obtained are robust and useful to future communities considering the
implementation of an electronic network. To share findings with interested
researchers and policy-makers, the researchers will prepare conference
presentations and journal-article manuscripts describing what they have learned
about the implementation and early effects of the network.
