Dr. Gregory C. Fu has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Fu's doctoral degree was from Harvard University under the
supervision of Professor David Evans. Dr. Fu intends to continue his research at
the California Institute of Technology under the sponsorship of Professor Robert
Grubbs. Dr. Fu's area of postdoctoral training and research will be the study of
organometallic reaction mechanisms and the design of stereoselective metal-
catalyzed organic reactions. Specifically, he will investigate the mechanism of
the ruthenium(II)-catalyzed ring-opening metathesis reaction. The Postdoctoral
Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural
program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.Ds and
attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and
teaching.
