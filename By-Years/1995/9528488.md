9528488 Dravid The connection between the interface structure and dynamic
properties of in-situ interphase interfaces in directionally solidified
eutectics (DSEs) is sought__at all length scales, from micrometers to less than
nanometers. Previous work has shown that DSEs form excellent model systems and
permit analysis of interfacial relation and visualization of the atomic
structure in three dimensions. The proposed research will evaluate the atomistic
relaxation and determine the atomic structure of DSE interfaces in oxide-oxide
and metal oxide systems. The dynamics of crack/slip interactions with interfaces
and crack-tip atomic structure will be examined using transmission and scanning
electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. %%% The proposed research is
expected to provide significant clues, if not completely solve, the complex
interplay among all aspects of interface structure__at all length scales__and
dynamic properties that are driven by interfacial phenomena. ***
