9353750 Roberts This is a project to lay the groundwork for developing a program
to provide two-year post-doctoral and sabbatical fellowships to research
mathematicians and computer scientists to work on problems of pre-college
mathematics education. These fellows will continue their regular research
programs, while devoting 50% of their time to educational matters. The present
project is a one-year pilot project to lay the groundwork for the larger scale
5-year program (to begin in 1994/95). Funds are requested for a one-year
fellowship for one research mathemetician with a prior track record of work in
education, whose job will be to marshall and organize the educational resources
at Rutgers and elsewhere, with a view to making possible collaborative efforts
with future fellows.
