As computation and data are moved to the "cloud", there is a need to
significantly increase the capacity and performance of the underlying data
centers through improved hardware and communication infrastructure. A key
component of the communication infrastructure is the network implementation,
currently based upon Ethernet. Technological trends suggest that next-generation
data center networks will be based upon RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access), a
powerful communciation technology used today in high performance computer
systems. While RDMA offers enormous performance potential, current cloud
infrastructures are not designed to exploit this potential. This project will
investigate RDMA-based system designs for distributed storage systems and in-
memory applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the project research
agenda consists of (a) building a high performance distributed key-value store
and a B-tree based store (b) developing several applications in image search and
deep learning whose distribution is made feasible by RDMA's ultra-low-latency
and high throughput; (c) evaluating the performance of the resulting systems and
applications at scale on the NSF-funded PRObE testbed.
