Our goal is to understand the mechanisms by which the expression of the maize
anthocyanin biosynthetic enzymes is coordinately induced by the regulatory
protein B. The B gene product is required for the steady state accumulation of
mRNA from several genes encoding anthocyanin biosynthetic enzymes (structural
genes), and we have recently demonstrated that the B gene plays a major role in
stimulating the transcription of the structural genes. Transient
cotransformation studies using plasmids carrying structural gene promoter
sequences fused to luciferase, and plasmids which produce B protein, demonstrate
B mediates an approximately 100 fold induction in luciferase activity. The
deduced amino acid sequence of the B protein (obtained from the cDNA sequence)
revealed a myc homologous region found in several DNA binding proteins and a
negatively charged region characteristic of transcriptional activators. Both in
vitro and in vivo assays will be used to: examine the in vivo modification of
the B protein and its subcellular location and tissue distribution; dissect the
regions of the B protein necessary for transcriptional control of the structural
genes; determine the functions of these regions (transcriptional activation, DNA
binding, protein/protein interactions, etc.); assess whether the B protein
interacts directly with regulatory regions found in the structural genes;
identify other proteins interacting with B; and investigate if B influences
anthocyanin biosynthesis at levels in addition to transcription of the
structural genes. The maize anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway represents one of a
small number of pathways in higher plants for which regulatory proteins and
their targets are known. Thus, studying the mechanisms utilized by B should
reveal important information regarding regulated gene expression in higher
plants.
