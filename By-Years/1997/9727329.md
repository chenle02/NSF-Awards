Abstract ATM -9727329 Tsonis, Anastasios University of Wisconsin TITLE:
Improving the Information on Precipitation Over Oceans and Studying its Temporal
and Spatial Variability One of the most comprehensive climate data sets is the
University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee/ COADS (UWM/COADS) analysis set.
Precipitation over the oceans is probably the least reliable quantity in the
data set.. This proposal suggests a way to correct for this satellite - derived
rainfall over the oceanic regions by multivariate models that include other
quantities that are more reliable and are directly observed. The proposal
intends to investigate the temporal and spatial variability of the global
precipitation field over selected oceanic regions as well as over the globe
utilizing such corrected precipitation data. The data produced by the proposal
will be of great value for climate studies and research.
