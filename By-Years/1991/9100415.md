NorthWestNet originated as a six state network for supercomputer users. In
three years it has increased from 10 connected sites to over 50 sites with
varying levels of connectivity. In the third year of the orginal award, the
directors of the Northwest Academic Computing Consortium undertook a strategic
planning process to evaluate NorthWestNet and set a course for the next 5 years.
The plan is to extend NorthWestNet to a much wider user community to include all
levels of higher education, primary and secondary school districts, researchers
in the business and non-profit world, and the education comunity in general.
Continued funding will enable NorthWestNet to expand membership; move toward
becoming a value-added service-oriented network; add new users within the
current membership; and hire professional executive management. NorthWestNet
will hire a professional executive director to assist in implementing the
strategic plan which includes the generation of five times the dues revenue of
the immediate past fiscal year.***//
