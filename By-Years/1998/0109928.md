ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Luke E. Achenie &lt;br/&gt;Institution:
University of Connecticut&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
0109928&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address the issue of solvent identification
and/or replacement in the chemical process industries, the PI plans to
systematize solvent design using a computer aided product design (CAPD)
approach. CAPD can be used either by considering the compound in isolation
(e.g., via overall property matching) or by considering the compound and its
interaction with a system (e.g., if it is to be used in an absorption process).
For the former, the designer characterizes the desirable and undesirable
properties of a solvent that needs to be replaced for some reason (e.g.,
environmental regulations). Other solvents are screened which match the
desirable properties and at the same time have minimal undesirable properties.
For example, normal-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) is used by industry as a paint-
stripping solvent. Current OSHA regulations require the solvent to have a flash
point greater than 210oF -- but the flash point of NMP is 190oF. Hence another
solvent needs to be used with the same physico-chemical properties of NMP but
with a higher flash point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall purpose of the
project is to develop a unified framework combining databases, mathematical
programming models and heuristics for reactive and nonreactive solvent design,
and to do this and look for a proper fit for a particular solvent using
computational chemistry. The PI plans to incorporate uncertainty analysis as
part of the design.&lt;br/&gt;
