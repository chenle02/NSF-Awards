The focus of this research is the synthesis of new organosilicon compounds that
have unusual chemical bonding . Targets include silynes, silaallenes and
silamones. Silole anions and dianions with be reacted with transition metals to
obtain new types of silole-metal complexes and the chemical reactions of stable
silylenes will be investigated. Also, by vaporization of carbon mixed with
silicon carbide or elemental phosphorus, new fullerene carbon cages, containing
silicon or phosphorus atoms in the cage framework, will be prepared. With this
renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr.
Robert West of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin.
Professor West will focus his work on the synthesis of new types of
organosilicon compounds that contain unusual chemical bonding patterns. The
molecules to be constructed test the limits of the ability of silicon to bond
with carbon and are expected to have interesting chemical properties.
