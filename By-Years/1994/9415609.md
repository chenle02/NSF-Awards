9415609 Miller This two-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research
in marine biology between Richard L. Miller of Temple University and Jacky
Cosson of the Marine Biology Center, Villefranche Sur Mer, France. The objective
of their research is the study of fertilization patterns and behavior in marine
invertebrates. They will perform a detailed study of salps, which are found in
abundance in warm-temperate to tropical waters. Their existence in huge swarms
makes them important in the economy of the ocean. The project addresses ways to
improve the chances of fertilization and will provide important information
about coordination of reproduction in salps and other zooplankton. Dr. Miller
brings to this collaboration extensive expertise in marine biology. He has wide
experience in studies of fertilization of marine invertebrates. This is
complemented by the French investigator's expertise in biophysics and molecular
biology and in flagellar behaviors of protozoa. The project will advance
understanding of fertilization behavior in primitive invertebrates that can be
used as a model for future investigations of similar problems in marine
vertebrates. ***
