The objective of this study is to develop a kinematic hardening model for soils
that may be used in prediction of soil behavior during large stress reversals
and earthquakes. This model will be developed on the basis of experimental
evidence of the behavior sand and clay during large three-dimensional stress
changes involving unloading and reloading with and without rotation of principal
stress axes. Part of the experimental results are available and part will be
generated under this study. The results available from triaxial, cubical
triaxial, and torsion tests on sand and clay indicate that development of a
kinematic hardening model is feasible.
