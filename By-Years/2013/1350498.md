1350498&lt;br/&gt;Moon, Tae Seok &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Natural regulatory
networks have complex features to ensure robust cellular functions. However,
robustness comes with a price: it requires cellular resources, imposing a
metabolic burden on cells. The overarching goal of this project is to understand
the principles of biological robustness by building genetic circuits from the
bottom-up. The work will benefit society by providing design principles and
engineering strategies to ensure that biological systems behave as designed over
a long time scale. In addition, while the PI's focus is to apply design
principles to biochemical production platforms, the same approach can be applied
to other problems, such as environmental and health issues, by replacing the
actuator modules with toxic chemical degrading pathways and pathogen killing
mechanisms. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The overarching goal of this project is to
understand the principles of biological robustness by building genetic circuits
from the bottom-up. The intellectual merits of this project are threefold.
First, it will enable the quantitative assessment of the burden imposed by
individual genes, providing guidelines for part selection in synthetic biology.
Second, it will help address the issues of metabolic burden and evolution by
using genetic circuits. Last, by building functions from the bottom-up,
hypotheses regarding the dynamics and evolution of highly interconnected natural
regulatory networks will be tested. The research approach will involve (i) the
identification and characterization of sensory and gene regulatory elements,
(ii) the building of negative feedback loops and redundant circuits, and (iii)
the implementation of these synthetic circuits in microbial cell factories for
chemical and drug production.
