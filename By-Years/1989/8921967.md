The proposed research involves the application of asymptotic methods of
singular perturbation type to boundary value problems for ordinary and partial
differential equations, integral equations and difference equations. In
particular, the problems to be studied center on two types that are relevant to
applications: the effects of small random forces on the overall behavior of
solutions of deterministic dynamical systems and the evolution of time-dependent
solutions of boundary value problems to steady states that possess interior
layers. A host of phenomena in nature are described by sets of equations that
contain one or more formally small terms. If one were to try solving such
equations numerically, for example, one usually runs into difficulty because the
small terms can complicate the problems dramatically. An alternative method of
solution, the one espoused in this proposal, is to take advantage of the small
terms by first simplifying the equations that contain the small terms and then
solving the simplified equations. The PI's will use this idea to solve various
problems in probability theory and chemical physics.
