9222651 Vaida This research focuses on the role that the photochemistry of
bimolecular complexes could play in the chemical balance of the troposphere. To
provide the data base needed to include this chemistry in tropospheric models,
the following studies will be conducted. The results anticipated from this work
will give absorption cross-sections and photochemical quantum yields for
bimolecular complexes of 03, S02, and CS2. Based on this data, it will be
possible to predict the importance of the photochemistry of bimolecular
complexes in oxidation processes in the troposphere.
