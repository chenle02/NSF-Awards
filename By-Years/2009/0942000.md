Ecological studies of biodiversity have typically examined plants and animals
living in communities, ecosystems, or across geographic or latitudinal
gradients. New molecular tools make it possible to characterize microbial
diversity; those tools now support studies of microbial communities in a growing
number of environments. Interestingly, the plants and animals that were the
focus of the first studies of biodiversity are themselves environments that can
support highly diverse communities of microbes. Ecologists, interested in
patterns and consequences of biodiversity, and microbiologists, interested in
characterizing an apparently highly diverse community of microbes associated
with the human body, will discuss their distinct approaches to studying
biological diversity and investigate how their approaches can contribute to a
better understanding of the composition and function of microbial communities
associated with humans.

The symposium co-organizer and moderator are both women, as are four
participants, providing positive role models for young women in science. A
second potentially significant broader impact will be an enhanced understanding
of impacts that a diverse microbial community has on organismal health and
function.
