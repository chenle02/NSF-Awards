9503626 Ford Polymers filled with glass fibers and silica particles have many
commercial applications due to increased hardness, abrasion resistance, tensile
modulus, compressive strength, and heat distortion temperature, and to a lower
coefficient of thermal expansion. The silica fibers or particles are irregularly
dispersed and agglomerated, and the fibers may be oriented by shear. Nothing is
known yet about how three- dimensional order of dispersed silica influences the
mechanical properties of a composite. We have synthesized the first composites
having the dispersed phase ordered as colloidal crystals. During the next grant
period we will (1) characterize the crystal structures of the colloidal silica-
polymer composites more completely to answer a number of puzzling aspects of the
optical diffraction of the films, (2) prepare optical diffraction filters having
smaller dispersed particles and a wider range of diffraction wavelengths, (3)
prepare tunable filters using elastomeric matrices, (4) prepare blends of
colloidal crystals of polystyrene latexes in acrylic matrices as diffraction
filters, (5) extend our studies of the optical properties of the colloidal
crystalline films to thermal and mechanical properties, (6) characterize the
silica-PMMA composites by solid state NMR spectroscopy, and (7) synthesize a new
family of colloidal crystalline dispersions in which derivatives of C60 are
trapped in polystyrene and and PMMA latexes. %%% This research could lead to the
development of several types of novel optical filters and improved elastomers.
