9409107 Palmer Although Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) is a
versatile technique for studying the structure and properties of polymers,
dynamic vibrational spectroscopy by the use of FT-IR has had limited application
in the polymer field because of a number of experimental difficulties. This
Small Grant for Exploratory Research will explore the possible application of
step-scan dynamic FT-IR and 2D FT-IR to investigate the dynamics of molecular
reorientation and relaxation in selected liquid crystalline polymers, both of
the lyotropic and thermotropic types. If successful, this method would permit
the study of polymeric liquid crystals with a new level of detail. ***
