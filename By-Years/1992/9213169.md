Ecological interactions between individuals in populations are often dependent
on the relative sizes of the individuals. Because of this, interactions within
and between size-structured populations can have complex dynamics. The dynamics
of size- structured populations will be studied using several species of
salamanders that coexist in Appalachian streamside habitats. These salamanders
grow through a wide range of sizes during their lives, and because all are
generalized predators, there is great potential for competitive, predatory, and
other behavioral interactions between size classes within and among species.
Previous work has shown that some of these interactions between size classes are
strong and are likely to be important in determining community structure. Field
and laboratory experiments will explore these interactions to determine their
mechanisms. These experiments will aid in developing models of the dynamics and
stability of size-structured populations.
