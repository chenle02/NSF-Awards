This award provides support for the 2009 Miami Topical Physics Conference on
Elementary Particles, Astrophysics, and Cosmology. This is a successful annual
conference which is essentially the replacement for the previous Coral Gables
Conference, which had run successfully for many decades. The subject matter is
highly topical, as the intersection between elementary particle physics,
astrophysics, and cosmology is increasingly at the forefront of modern
theoretical physics research. The funds provided through the award are
exclusively for the support (travel and local expenses) of young participants
(graduate students and postdocs) for whom attendance at such a conference can
have a profound effect on their development as scientists.
