This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). This research award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and
Organometallic Chemistry program supports work by Professor Gerald Meyer at
Johns Hopkins University to carry out fundamental/basic studies on molecular
level events that occur at sensitized semiconductor interfaces. This work can
one day lead to the efficient harvesting and storage of energy from the sun. The
investigators utilize time resolved spectroscopic techniques to characterize
excited states and electron transfer reactions that occur after metal-to-ligand
charge-transfer (MLCT) excitation of transition metal compounds anchored to high
surface area mesoporous nanocrystalline thin films comprised of the wide bandgap
semiconductor anatase TiO2 or the insulator ZrO2. These studies are performed
under excitation conditions where, on average, less than one excited state is
created on each metal oxide nanocrystallite and under conditions representative
of one sun or higher steady-state irradiances. The presence of multiple
electrons in each nanocrystallite profoundly influences interfacial behavior
even though the underlying principles are poorly understood. This research is
directly related to a long-term goal of identifying materials that efficiently
convert sunlight into useful forms of energy. If successful, an environmentally
benign energy resource would be realized with an enormous economic and
environmental impact. Scientifically a broad impact is assured as this proposal
will train young scientists to be future professionals and forge links to
interdisciplinary materials chemistry. Results from these fundamental studies
are envisioned to one day enable the rational molecular-level design of
integrated materials capable of harvesting sunlight, charge separation, and
performing multi-electron transfer catalysis to form useful fuels.
