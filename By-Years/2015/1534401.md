With this award, the Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our
Future (DMREF) Program of the Division of Chemistry and the Division of
Materials Research is funding Professors Hai-Ping Cheng, George Christou, and
Xiaoguang Zhang at the University of Florida to study how to make magnetic
materials with some of the smallest dimensions possible. Magnetic materials are
important for the electronics industry and the ongoing trend towards
miniaturization of devices, has made the development of ever-smaller magnets
essential. The team is studying what are termed single-molecule magnets; these
are individual molecules that function as magnets yet are smaller than those of
traditional magnetic materials. The team is using advanced computational methods
to predict which structures will yield the optimal magnetic properties and they
are also studying ways to attach the single-molecule magnets to a surface to
introduce certain effects crucial to the potential use of these materials in new
technologies. The project is providing multi-disciplinary training to the
participating graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, research
opportunities for high school students through the University of Florida's
Summer Student Training Program, and outreach to the general public through the
including "Chemistry Day at the Mall" activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team
led by Professor Cheng has demonstrated from first-principles calculations that
the quantum capacitance of a small molecule or nanocluster depends upon its
magnetic or geometric configuration. In this project they are now focusing on
synthesizing high nuclearity manganese carboxylate clusters with various ligands
and correlating the structures with the self-capacitance of the clusters and the
magnetic field needed for a low-spin state to a high-spin state transition. The
group is using first-principles calculations to predict the effects of changing
carboxylate ligands on the magnetic states of high nuclearity manganese clusters
and the effects of support surfaces (e.g. boron nitride) on the magnetic and
electronic properties of these clusters. The systems are being synthesized, and
various scanning tunneling microscopy, spectroscopic and electrochemical studies
are being used to characterize the "charging" properties of the nanoclusters. By
searching through the three basic "genes," the molecule/cluster, the ligands,
and the supporting substrate, the group is quantifying and characterizing how
different combinations impact properties, and finding the best combination that
produces the largest effect and is most suitable for applications.
