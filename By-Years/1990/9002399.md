The application of high temperature superconductors (HTSC) in electronics
requires a cost-effective deposition process capable of growing epitaxial, in-
situ superconducting thin films below 650oC. Metalorganic Chemical Vapor
Deposition (MOCVD) has the potential to meet this need; however, it is currently
limited by the high temperatures required to decompose the intermediates formed
by the decomposition of Group II source reagents. The research will provide a
fundamental understanding of the barium chemistry occurring at the growth
interface which will facilitate the low temperature preparation of HTSC thin
films. If low growth temperatures can be realized, the development of a
manufacturing process should rapidly follow based on CVD's inherent advantages
in large area uniformity and ease of scale- up.
