The dike-gabbro transition zone is a fundamental lithological and rheological
boundary zone in the oceanic crust, in which the interaction of magmatic and
hydrothermal processes play an important role. Dike-gabbro transitions are
preserved in ophiolite complexes, of which one of the best examples is the
Troodos Ophiolite in Cyprus. This ophiolite has been well studied petrologically
and geochemically, but this study will be the first attempt to systematically
map the deformation associated with the dike-gabbro transition. The results will
have important implications for the tectonics of ophiolite emplacement and will
also have bearing on mid ocean ridge processes.
