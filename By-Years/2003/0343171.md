This planning grant will fund department level reform the manufacturing program
at the University of Cincinnati. The approach is to place students in a virtual
corporate setting, where classes are linked to job functions and the curriculum
becomes a form of job rotation exposing students to traditional theory with
links to practical applications. The central hypothesis and of the proposed
activities is that a virtual manufacturing corporation can unify and energize
the curricula motivating students and faculty to learn, provide a mechanism for
addressing industry wants and needs, and can be marketed to K-12 students and
teachers.

In this planning project, the goal is to restructure the entire manufacturing
curriculum so that it can be mapped into a virtual corporate structure supported
by an information technology based integration mechanism. A corporate oversight
panel will be established, along with a framework for eliciting and integrating
corporate and K-12 suggestions and feedback, taking advantage of the existing
Co-Op program. Finally, evaluation and accountability guidelines will be
developed along with activities to prepare other faculty members for strategy
implementation.
