This project performs fundamental cross-disciplinary cross-layered research into
the design, implementation, and deployment of next-generation harvesting-based
RFID-scale sensing technologies. The effort involves research at the CRFID
hardware/software interface including energy management, data storage systems,
and energy-aware computing to advance knowledge and understanding of zero-power
pervasive devices. It addresses several fundamental research challenges
including: 1) tradeoffs in energy harvesting, storage and usage that can make
RFID sensors more programmable while not compromising energy-efficiency, 2) data
storage systems that exploit probabilistic flash writes at low voltages, and
that can tolerate frequent interruptions of power, and 3) energy management
techniques that expose uncertainty-driven energy management interfaces, and
schedule tasks in a harvesting-aware manner. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Direct
economic and social impacts of this project are expected in the design,
development, and deployment of next-generation RFID-based sensing applications
and businesses including medical, environmental, energy, military, homeland
security, and transportation. Other benefits include involvement of female
minority graduate students in research, and involvement of minority graduate
students through the NSF-funded Northeast Alliance for Graduate Education and
the Professoriate (NEAGEP). Further, the research and teaching from the project
impacts students across the Five Colleges, which includes two all-women's
colleges, Smith and Mount Holyoke, whose students can enroll in courses taught
at UMass because of the consortium's cross-registration policy. Curriculum
development includes exposing students to challenges at the hardware/software
boundary of ultra-low power devices through new or existing courses, tutorials
in conferences, and seminars and demos in science fairs intended for high-
schoolers.
