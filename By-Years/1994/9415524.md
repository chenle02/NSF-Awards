9415524 Murr This award supports Explomet '95: The International Conference on
Metallurgical and Materials Application of Shock-Wave and High-Strain-Rate
Phenomena to be held August 6-10, 1995 in El Paso, Texas (University of Texas at
El Paso). This is the fourth in a series of Explomet conferences which were
initiated in 1980 and held in succeeding 5-year periods. The previous three
Explomet conferences culminated in the publication of three hard-bound volumes,
which total more than 3000 pages. The support provides registration support for
16 students to attend the conference. Explomet '95 will also publish a
proceedings to encourage a world-wide dialogue focusing on applications of
shock-wave and high-strain-rate phenomena in materials. %%% Explomet '95 is
particularly unique because it explores aspects of military-oriented research
which can have impact on commercial and industrial applications and offers
prospects for materials process developments which might be affected by the
recent passage of NAFTA in North America. ***
