This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
the feasibility of integrating molecular modeling with chemical process
simulation in order to provide a mainstream tool for chemical process
development and molecular design of custom compounds. Discontinuous molecular
dynamics (DMD) simulation is combined with thermodynamic perturbation theory
(TPT) to provide a basis for highly leveraged computational effort in all
aspects of molecular modeling. Demonstrations would include applications for
thiophenes, phosphates, and octanol/water partitioning. Extrapolations to
polymers would involve characterizing PRISM parameters based on molecular
simulations of oligomers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Molecular modeling represents
the future of chemical product design, but its present isolation from process
design creates substantial obstacles to its use as a mainstream tool for the
majority of chemical engineers. The resulting product will be an option within a
suite of Process Models. With this option, engineers will be able to draw the
chemical structure of a newly conceived product, estimate its properties from
DMD/TPT simulation, and economically evaluate the chemical process design within
24 hours. This capability will reduce dramatically the time from conception to
production of new compounds and materials. &lt;br/&gt;
