That study will show if micritization takes place by recrystallization in
shallow water sediments. Micritization of Halimeda from shallow water platforms
off Belize a Bahamas will be studies through observation of skeletal alteration
by scanning electron microscope, x-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive x-ray
analysis and microprobe analysis. The result could be as important as the
discovery of submarine cementation in the 1960s.//
