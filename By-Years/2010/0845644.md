Structured hidden databases are widely prevalent on the Web. They provide
restricted form-like search interfaces that allow users to execute search
queries by specifying desired attribute values of the sought-after tuples, and
the system responds by returning a few (e.g., top-k) tuples that satisfy the
selection conditions, sorted by a suitable ranking function. Although search
interfaces for hidden databases are designed with focused search queries in
mind, for certain applications it may be advantageous to infer more aggregated
views of the data from the returned results of search queries. Such aggregated
information will facilitate learning data distributions or building mining
models, which can then be used to power and optimize a multitude of emerging
data analytical applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research involves
developing effective techniques for performing data analytics, especially
sampling, over hidden structured databases via their public interfaces. The
outcomes include efficient algorithms for sampling hidden databases with a
heterogeneous mix of data types, achievability results for sampling different
types of search interfaces, and a prototypical toolset which demonstrates the
sampling of real-world hidden databases. The ability to pose high-level
analytical queries over hidden databases is needed by knowledge workers in a
wide variety of corporations, governments, and security agencies. Parts of this
project will be integrated into teaching and carried out by students as part of
advanced class projects, which will potentially attract motivated students to
pursue doctoral degrees. The project Web site
(http://dbxlab.uta.edu/dataAnalytics.html) will be used for results
dissemination.&lt;br/&gt;
