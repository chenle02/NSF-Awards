This proposal from the University of Wisconsin.Milwaukee requestssupport to
enhance the planning of a Science and TechnologyCenter for Growth and
Characterization of Artificial LayeredMaterials. Faculty researchers from four
departments in twocolleges of the University , as well as the Laboratory
forSurface Studies at Milwaukee, are involved in thisinterdisciplinary effort.
It is anticipated that leadership inhigh technology research will increasingly
rely on the ability todesign and synthesize new layered materials with novel
andtargeted properties. The goals of the proposed Center are thefabrication,
characterization, and modelling of such materials. The Planning Grant activity
will enable the institution tocomplete the assimilation of a group of qualified
personnel,identify the most important scientific issues, plan theadministrative
and scientific structure of the Center, andestablish effective University
Government Research Laboratory .Industrial Research Laboratory linkages.
