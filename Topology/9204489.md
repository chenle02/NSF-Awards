Frohman intends to pursue the study of three-dimensional manifolds, especially
topics associated with Heegaard splittings and minimal surfaces and the
representation theory of knot groups and three-manifold groups. For instance, he
is planning to study the finiteness of Heegaard splittings of bounded genus of
three- manifolds up to homeomorphism. Another problem he is pursuing is the
construction of functors that are similar to coupled topological quantum field
theories using the intersection homology of moduli spaces of semistable
holomorphic bundles with parabolic structure over a nonsingular algebraic curve.
Three-dimensional manifolds are very natural objects for topologists to study,
since (ignoring time) we live in a physical world of three dimensions. Also
dimension three is the first dimension where many types of rich complexity
arise. In fact, it is a notorious and paradoxical fact that some of the
difficulties presented by three-dimensional topology disappear again in higher
dimensions. For example, the celebrated Poincare conjecture about the
characterization of the three-dimensional sphere remains as challenging as when
it was first posed about the turn of the century, while the analogous
propositions in higher dimensions have all now been settled. Frohman is
exploring some of these mysteries and sharpening the available tools of the
trade.
