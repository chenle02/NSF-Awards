This award funds a Workshop on Perception of Action, to be held May 18-20, 1997
in Brewster, MA. As computer vision moves from the processing of static images
to consideration of image streams such as video sequences or real-time robotic
vision, the problem of machine "understanding" of actions represented in the
images is becoming increasingly important, for potential applications such as
security and surveillance, dynamic situation monitoring, guidance and
verification of machine action such as robotic assembly, and support for human
user access to video image and multimedia databases. This workshop will explore
the current state of knowledge in this area, and look into future prospects for
advances in understanding, including schemes that represent action more
naturally than the traditional sequences of static poses or key frames. The
results and recommendations of the workshop will be published in the form of a
report, which will also be made available on a web site.
