The core of this project is the problem of incomplete data: situations where we
only have partial information and need either to estimate the missing data or to
find ways to solve the problem based only on our fragmentary knowledge. In this
project, we use tools from geometry as well as from combinatorics, namely the
sophisticated counting techniques that allow us to analyze patterns in diverse
applications from DNA sequencing to optimization. The work contributes
significantly to developing a more diverse workforce in mathematics, both
increasing the pipeline for women and underrepresented minorities and
strengthening retention further downstream. This includes incorporating student
researchers at all stages of their careers into the PI's
lab.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific research addressed in this proposal is:
1) combinatorially analyzing the transition matrices between two important bases
of irreducible symmetric-group representations, the web basis and the tableau
basis; 2) describing the geometry and topology of components of Springer fibers
and, more generally, Hessenberg varieties; 3) computing the (equivariant)
cohomology rings of Hessenberg varieties; and 4) describing generalized splines
for different edge-labeled graphs. The PI is an expert in Hessenberg varieties
and the GKM approach to equivariant cohomology; a sequence of the PI's papers on
these subjects, together with new work by Harada, Rhoades, and others, leave the
field poised on the brink of new discoveries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
