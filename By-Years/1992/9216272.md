Professor Knize will use this SGER grant (small grants for exploratory
research) to investigate the optical properties of alkali vapors at very high
pressure. The technique is to make ultra-thin cells (less than one micron in
thickness) filled with alkali vapor. Light transmission spectroscopy will be
used to study predicted high-pressure transparency as the absorption coefficient
reaches a constant value with increasing pressure.
