Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solutions. Access to modern NMR spectrometry is essential to
chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The Department of Chemistry at
Montana State University will use an award from the Chemistry Shared
Instrumentation Program and the Biological Instrumentation Program and an award
from NIH to help purchase a state-of-the-art NMR spectrometer. The areas of
chemistry and biology that will be enheanced by the acquisition of the
instrument include: 1) Structural studies of inorganic complexes 2) Structure
determination of natural products 3) NMR studies of visual membranes, membrane
transport and membrane structure 4) Structure and kinetic analyses of novel
organometallic complexes and their reactions 5) Structure analyses in support of
mechanistic studies, synthetic methodology and total syntheses 6) Structural
chemistry of novel phytotoxins In addition to serving the NMR needs of Montana
State, the instrument will be used as a resource by chemists from Montana School
of Mines and Technology, the University of Montana, Eastern Montana College, and
Western Montana College.
