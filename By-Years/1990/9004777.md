Knowledge of the posotion of the supercontinent of Laurentia with respect to
Gondwana and peri-Gondwanide terranes, such as Armorica, Iberia and Avalonia, is
of paramount importance for the proper understanding and quantification of
geodynamic events during the Paleozoic. Unfortunately, the paleomagnetic
database for the Silurian-Devonian of continents once part of Gondwana is
incomplete and provides few constraints on paleogeographic models. The result
has been the appearance of several controversial paleogeographic models with
very different interpretations for this period. One means of constraining or
testing such reconstructions is through comparison with well interpreted and
robust biogeographic patterns. One major group of marine invertebrates, the
nautiloid cephalopods, is particularly well suited to this task. A significant
portion of nautiloid evolution occurred during the Silurian-Devonian, the
biogeographic database is large and can be made much better with reasonable
effort, analytical techniques are available to provide patterns of exceptional
quality, and the spatial distributions of nautiloid cephalopods are now known to
have been particularly well controlled by barriers to dispersal of the magnitude
easily recognized with proper methods.
