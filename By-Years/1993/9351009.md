9351009 Malaviya The purpose of this project is to develop a set of innovative
experimental exercises for a laboratory course in a new engineering physics
program. The program offers a valuable strategic vehicle for students to pursue
education and research in areas cutting across traditional disciplinary lines.
The lab course is an important element in the new baccalaureate engineering
physics curriculum. The equipment requested herein will be used to develop
experiments in such areas as computer interfacing, electromagnetic field
behavior and imaging, laser holography and other laser optics applications,
fluid systems behavior, particle interactions with fields and matter, etc. The
new experiments will involve state-of-the-art techniques with direct relevance
to real-life experiences in the high tech R & D enterprise and should
considerably enhance the scope and diversity of the students' laboratory
experience. Results of the project will be adequately documented and widely
disseminated for use by other universities and colleges for lab and related
course work in their science and engineering curricula. ***
