This US-Argentina Cooperative Science Program award will support the
collaboration of Eduardo Fradkin of the University of Illinois and Fidel
Schaposnik of the University of La Plata, Argentina. The project aims to
investigate fermionic models in condensed matter physics and field theory. The
researchers will use non-perturbative methods to study universal properties of
the wave functionals of conformally invariant (critical) fermionic models. They
will also consider the Multichannel Kondo model, including the possible
existence of states with fractional quantum numbers in Kondo-like systems. The
research has possible applications to one-dimensional systems,
superconductivity, the fractional quantum Hall effect, and the Kondo problem.
The US side has expertise in theoretical and experimental condensed matter
physics, as well as numerical simulations. The Argentine side has theoretical
expertise, particularly in quantum field theory, as well as methodology for
conducting projects in which fermions are strongly coupled.
