&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will
build a small form factor silicon chip antenna for radio frequency
identification (RFID) applications in smart tags. A new high-performance, low
cost, small size silicon chip antenna, fabricated by wafer batch processing,
will be combined with a standard, passive (no battery) RFID chip to form a low
cost, high-performance RFID tag of small dimensions. The antenna and the RFID
chip are stacked directly on top of each other. Phase I used a simplified
process and scaled up structures. In Phase II the process will be optimized,
devices with the intended dimensions will be used, and the antenna chip and the
RFID chip will be stacked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Passive RFID systems are used in
applications such as object tagging, asset management, hazardous materials
tracking, and tracking of important documents. Existing RFID technology is
limited by the need for large transponder antennas (~ 1 inch by 2 inch minimum)
and costly multi-component assembly. The silicon wafer batch processed antenna
chip technology will produce millimeter-scale smart tags (programmable
replacement for bar codes), enabling products for large commercial markets.
