In this CAREER award, co-funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program
of the Chemistry Division and the Molecular Biophysics Program of the Division
of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, Prof. Nien-Hui Ge of the University of
California, Irvine and her post-doctoral and graduate research students will
probe the conformational distributions of peptides using multidimensional
infrared spectroscopy. The ultimate goal of this research is to uncover the
details of how proteins fold and unfold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to her
research activities, Prof. Ge will construct an online infrared resource for use
in education. The resource will include a database of both ordinary and
multidimensional infrared spectra. The resource's most unique feature will be
the incorporation of a multidimensional infrared simulator and interactive
tutorials designed for use by non-experts. The audience for the online resource
includes undergraduate and graduate physical chemistry students, as well as
members of the biophysical research community interested in learning how to
apply the methods of multidimensional infrared spectroscopy to their own
research problems.&lt;br/&gt;
