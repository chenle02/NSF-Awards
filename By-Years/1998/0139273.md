Analysis of mitochondrial DNA obtained from skeletal materials can be used to
examine the relatedness of long extinct populations. This award will be used to
investigate the biological relationships of four populations, totaling
approximately 75 individuals, located in the Great Lakes region, as well as
indicate some aspects of demographic history that are reflected in the pattern
of genetic diversity. This investigation will test ancestral relationships
proposed by linguists and archaeologists regarding the relationship between the
diverse and expanding populations of the Archaic and Woodland periods in this
region.

Specifically, this study will test the genetic relationships within Glacial Kame
and Red Ocher populations, as well as between these and Old Copper,
Mississippian, and modern Algonquian speaking populations in the lower Great
Lakes region. This study can help determine if archaeological similarities were
primarily the result of cultural spreads or population expansions, in addition
to estimating the extent of genetic differentiation that existed in the Great
Lakes during the last 4000 years. The mtDNA of populations included in this
study will also be compared with that of other ancient populations of the Lower
Great Lakes region including Archaic Indian Knoll, early Woodland Adena,
Hopewell, and Late Prehistoric Fort Ancient populations, all previously or
currently being studied. In addition, data generated from this study will
contribute to the growing body of information that can be used to address
broader questions regarding the peopling of the New World.
