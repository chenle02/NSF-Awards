*** 96-60740 Vasudevan This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
Project will test a new method of detecting aromatic hydrocarbons, with
particular application to monitoring subsurface concentrations of these
compounds in both vapor (vadose zone) and liquid phases. Bioremediation has
emerged as the method of choice to treat these contaminants. This is an
opportunistic process, wherein the different aromatic compounds are degraded
sequentially at varied rates. Current methods can be used to monitor the total
hydrocarbon concentrations in situ, but they cannot differentiate between
individual aromatic compounds. In addition, the sensitivity of current
techniques (low parts per million range) is inadequate to meet current
regulatory standards. Hence, new methods are required that improve sensitivity
and selectivity. The Phase I sensor will provide parts per billion sensitivity
for four important aromatic species, independently. Called BTEX compounds, these
are benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, and the xylenes (all isomers). The sensor
will detect changes in the refractive index of a substitute cladding on a fiber-
optic cable. The substitute cladding used here will be a polymer that is
sensitized to bind selectively individual BTEX compounds, using a chemical
method that does not change other material properties, thus imparting
selectivity to an otherwise inert polymer. More than 1.5 million sites exist, in
the U.S. alone, that are contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons, to which this
technology could be applied. Additional environmental sensing applications could
be developed rapidly using this design methodology. ***
