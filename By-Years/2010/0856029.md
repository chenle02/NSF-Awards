Planning Grant for an I/UCRC for Next Generation Photovoltaics
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0856034 Colorado State; W. S. Sampath &lt;br/&gt;0856029
University of Texas at Austin; Brian Korgel &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed
Center, comprised of University of Texas at Austin (UT-Austin) as the lead
institution and Colorado State University (CSU), plans to focus on the
development of Next-Generation Photovoltaic Devices (PVs). The biggest challenge
facing photovoltaic technologies is the need for a low-cost, scalable, and
reliable manufacturing approach to produce solar cells with efficiencies of
10-20% that are suitable for use for 20 years in the field. Thus, the proposed
Center will develop with industrial partners, new materials, precursors, and
formulations for manufacturing high performance, low-cost PVs. The focus of this
Center will be on low-cost inorganic materials, nanomaterials or hybrid
materials solution to PV manufacturing. The research problem is complex and an
interdisciplinary team of researchers is needed (as well as collaboration with
industry) to make progress in this area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
Center's focus on identifying a solution to decrease PV manufacturing costs
would mean widespread adoption of solar cell technology worldwide and an
immediate decrease on the world?s reliance on non-renewable energy resources.
The industry participation will enhance the students? educational experience by
providing a pipeline for talented engineers and scientist to industry. The
efforts at the proposed Center will also be interfaced with some key educational
programs at UT-Austin, such as the Doctoral Portfolio program in Nanoscience and
Nanotechnology and the green technology focus at CSU. The Center plans to have a
team of faculty and students who are diverse in gender, race and ethnicity.
