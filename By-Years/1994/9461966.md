This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project Spire proposes to
develop zinc gallate (ZnGa2O4) as a thin-film host phosphor, and produce full
color (red, green, blue) faceplates by selective ion implantation of recognized
luminescent centers for this material, viz., Cr, Mn, Ga. Field emission displays
(FEDs) based on cathodoluminescent (CL) phosphors are rapidly becoming the
favorite embodiment for flat panel displays in America, and many efforts are
underway to bring FEDs into the marketplace. However, due to their granular
nature and limited operating lifetime, conventional sulfide-based powder
phosphors compromise FED performance. Replacing powdered phosphors with sulfur-
free, thin film oxide materials produced by physical vapor deposition can
improve chromaticity, allow much finer definition, and reduce phosphor
degradation while aiding in process automation to allow control of manufacturing
costs. In parallel ARPA sponsored programs, Spire has used ion implantation in
phosphors to demonstrate 50 fL (60 Hz) yellow with ZnS:Mn and 1 fL (60 Hz) blue
with CaGa2S4:Ce for thin film electroluminescence; and 15 fL (1 mA/cm2) green
with Zn2SiO4:Mn for thin film cathodoluminescence, all state-of-the-art
brightness levels. The proposed program will demonstrate all three colors in
adjacent lines on a single FED faceplate. Phase II will optimize phosphor
chemistry and improve external efficiency by studying various texturing
approaches to minimize waveguiding.
