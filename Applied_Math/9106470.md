The principal investigators study the approximation of the spectrum of singular
self-adjoint Sturm-Liouville problems by regular Sturm-Liouville problems. They
focus efforts on the conjecture that any point in the spectrum of a singular
problem is the limit of a sequence of eigenvalues of a family of regular
problems, and on its computational consequences. A major part of the effort is
devoted to development of SLEIGN2, a successor to the SLEIGN code for computing
eigenvalues of Sturm-Liouville problems. Sturm-Liouville problems arise in
transport theory, quantum physics, quantum chemistry, geophysics, and acoustics.
Computation of their solutions is important. Where the problem is regular,
several software codes are available to help calculate solutions. This project
undertakes to create software for singular problems.
