The epitaxial growth of novel solar cell structures will be investigated. The
metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) process parameters and
associated growth chemistries for solar cell structure will be developed. The
solar cell structure will be grown as a continuous structure within a single
process reactor. Film thickness, compositional uniformity, and electrical
properties will be measured. A test solar cell will be fabricated and evaluated.
