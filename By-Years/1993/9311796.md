The award is for an equipment grant to purchase a Q-switched YAG Laser,
vibration isolation optical table, and optical mounting devices. The equipment
will be used to support research in the evolving area of laser array generation
of ultrasound. This technology will be used on-line to control weld quality in
real- time, in particular the depth of weld penetration and porosity.
Ultrasonics is a promising method for weld quality control because of its
ability to penetrate opaque bodies and be reflected at discontinuities. The
research is expected to yield a significantly more efficient technique of
noncontact laser generation of ultrasound, for nondestructive testing of
materials and processes. The technique being developed uses an array of laser
beams in place of a single laser beam. A noncontact electromagnetic acoustic
transducer will be used as a receiver.//
