9625941 Kostant This project deals with research in various topics related to
representations and geometric quantization of classical as well as exceptional
Lie groups. The investigator proposes to find new approaches to representing the
character of an irreducible representation as the Fourier transform of a
coadjoint orbit. Singular representations, the quantum cohomology ring of the
flag manifold, and representations of a semisimple Lie algebra appearing in its
exterior algebra are among the topics to be pursued. Lie groups often arise as
symmetry groups. For example, so called unitary Lie groups describe symmetries
in elementary particles. Another example is provided by the Carbon 60 molecule,
popularly known as the buckyball. Here the full symmetry group turns out to be
an exceptional Lie group. There are only finitely many exceptional groups -
whereas the number of classical groups are infinite - and much work has been
done on how to realize them as subgroups of classical groups.
