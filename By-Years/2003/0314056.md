Solid state chemistry is currently experiencing rapid growth in the development
of new synthetic tools aimed at the creation of new materials. One such example
is the synthesis of extended solid state materials by assembly from two or more
molecular building blocks -- for example, inorganic clusters linked by organic
polytopic ligands to form polyhedra, rods, layers and three-dimensional extended
structures. This new area is being referred to as "reticular synthesis" where by
a suitable choice of geometry the dimensionality and topology of the synthesized
product can be predesigned to yield materials with predictable properties. This
workshop will explore ways to advance the new area of reticular chemistry by
stimulating the interplay of mathematics, chemistry, and materials science and
engineering to explore the fundamentals of designing and preparing new materials
with desireable properties. The goal of the Conference on Reticular Chemistry:
Principles of Designing Extended Chemical Structures is to integrate and order
the vast amount of geometrical knowledge and the availability mathematical tools
with the experimental and theoretical expertise of organic, inorganic,
biochemical, and materials researchers to identify key problems and progress in
the following areas: enumerating mathematical structures such as minimal
surfaces, knots and three-dimensional networks; describing classification
schemes and inventing nomenclature; exploring relevant mathematical properties
such as symmetry, complexity, and transitivity; to advance the a priori (top-
down) design of functional materials with desired properties (magnetic, optical,
catalytic, porosity); designing secondary building units (SBUs) for optimal
'bottom-up-synthesis' of new materials; describe challenges and opportunities
for the assembly of biological structures and hybrid bio-organic and bio-
inorganic structures; address educational challenges including the teaching of
geometry to chemists and chemistry to mathematicians.
