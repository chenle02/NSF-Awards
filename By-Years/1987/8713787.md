Solar-Terrestrial research is passing through a critical point. From the phase
of exploration and study of the individual components of the solar-terrestrial
system, we are now entering the phase of understanding how these components are
coupled to each other and how the sun-earth system works as a single whole.
Several recent studies and national and international program proposals have
formulated broad objectives for STR during the next 10-15 years. From these
studies, the multidisciplinary nature of STR and the need for a global approach
to the study of the solar-terrestrial system emerge quite clearly. So do the
many potential benefits, intellectual, commercial and security, that science and
society can expect from such an integrated study. However, there is a need to
distill from these broad objectives a modest, well-defined program that
represents the S/T contribution to the NSF's Global Geosciences Initiative. To
this end, and in response to discussions with NSF, the PI, Dr. Roederer, will
lead an effort with the following tasks,- (I) Examine the current status of
scientific research in S/T. (II) Identify new initiatives that are relevant to
the National Solar Terrestrial Program (NSTP) and international S/T programs.
(III) Formulate a plan which maximizes the scientific return within modest
budgetary requirements. (IV) Submit the plan "Solar Terrestrial Research in
Global Geosciences" to NSF by November 1987. A steering meeting exists which
will meet in Baltimore in May 1987. A workshop will be held in August 1987 and a
final executive planning session in September 1987. The end result will be a
well defined set of major projects emphasizing ground- based theoretical and
numerical studies of interaction processes governing the transfer of energy,
momentum and mass in the solar wind/magnetosphere/ionosphere/atmosphere system.
This set of projects will be proposed as the STR component of the NSF Global
Geosciences Program and would represent NSF's contribution to the NSTP and
SCOSTEP's Solar-Terrestrial Energy Program (STEP).
