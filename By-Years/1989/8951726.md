This project enables the Chemistry and Biology Departments of Roanoke College to
introduce HPLC into the undergraduate curriculum. The instrument allows the
departments to: 1. serve as the cornerstone for the setup of a joint chemistry-
biology laboratory facility thus maximizing equipment usage, and enhancing the
cross-disciplinary training of our students; 2. serve students from the
introductory level chemistry courses through the intermediate level Cell
Physiology and Instrumental Analysis courses, to the upper level Independent
Research courses in biology and chemistry; 3. replace an outdated instrument.
The equipment includes a HPLC, UV-VIS detector and a refractive index detector.
