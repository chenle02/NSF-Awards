This project is to investigate the dynamics of large populations of coupled
nonlinear oscillators. Such systems provide simplified models of biological
oscillator networks that occur in the heart, pancreas, intestine and brain.
Oscillator populations are also used to model charge-density wave systems in
solid-state physics. Included in this study are questions about synchronized
clusters in oscillator lattices, enhancement of precision of noisy oscillators
through mutual coupling, genericity of phase models with antisymmetric coupling,
and collective behavior of systems of lambda-omega oscillators with random
pinning and distributed frequencies. This work will continue and extend previous
studies of the collective dynamics of oscillator populations.
