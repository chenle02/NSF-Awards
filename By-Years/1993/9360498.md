9360498 Tang Production of microelectronic devices with pattern features in the
sub 0.25 micron regime will require significant advances in microlithographic
and manufacturing technologies. Current I line stepper tools are patterning
state of the art devices with Depth of Focus (DOF) budgets of 1 micron and
below, a manufacturing nightmare. Recent research has demonstrated that Chemical
Mechanical Polishing (CMP) planarization significantly alleviates DOF problems
by achieving superior global planarization. CMP planarization technology has the
potential to extend current manufacturing tools to the 0.25 micron regime and
beyond. However, the major problem with CMP is that currently, there is no
effective, commercially available means of measuring and controlling the
thickness of the layer being planarized in a real time, in situ manner. The
purpose of this research is to develop a non contact technology and method to
provide real time, in situ process control for CMP planarization. Commercial
applications of the research include: a non iterative, precise CMP process; such
a process is useful and relevant for most all types of integrated circuit
manufacturing.
