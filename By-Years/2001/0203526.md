This award funds a planning visit to Brazil for Dr. Derek Dunn-Rankin of the
University of California-Irvine to meet with Dr. Joao De Carvalho of the
Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP) and to visit the Instituto Nacional de
Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE) to develop a research plan to experimentally analyze
thermoacoustic oscillations in confined combustion systems. A better
understanding of such systems could lead to improved heat transfer and lower
pollutant levels. The detailed experimental plan that will result from this
planning visit could form the basis for a future U.S.-Brazil Cooperative
Research proposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
