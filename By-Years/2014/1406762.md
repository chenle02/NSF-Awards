Many genes control organismal traits and these genes interact in complex ways.
This project focuses on two types of gene interactions - physical and epistatic
(gene-by-gene) - and how their contribution shapes biological diversity. First,
genes are physically located along chromosomes so that the action of genetic
recombination, mutation and selection on a focal gene affects expressed
variation at nearby genes. Second, genes may interact with one another through
common genetic pathways. We will evolve experimental populations of yeast in the
laboratory under different environmental conditions, and then genetically
sequence the populations to test a prevailing model of genetic evolution. We
will also use computer simulation models of evolving genetic networks to
identify how epistatic interactions affect adaptation to changing environmental
pressures. Lastly, we will examine the joint effect of these two types of
interactions on genetic diversity in the experimental yeast
system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will train a graduate student in
genomics and experimental evolution, with mentorship toward a research career.
Furthermore, we will create an educational webpage available to the public,
aimed at high school biology students, that will interactively show how the
complex interaction of various genetic and environmental processes shape
biological diversity.
