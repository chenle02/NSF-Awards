A new type of x-ray detector that utilizes a field effect transistor structure
will be investigated in this project. This new detector offers the advantage of
internal gain, low noise and simple readout electronics. Initial studies show
that this detector type would have improved energy resolution over x-ray
spectrometers currently in use. The field effect transistor detectors would be
very useful in applications in materials science research and materials analysis
or wherever a high performance solid state detector is required for x-ray
spectrometer applications. Owing to their small size and ease of readout these
devices would also be excellent for use in imaging x-ray detectors.
