This project increases the exposure of biology majors to modern biological
techniques and the research process. Through this grant, two new educational
experiences are being added to the biology curriculum. The first is an upper
division course in molecular biology, which engages students in a thematic
series of laboratory experiences based on a specific research problem. The
second is a program of supervised undergraduate research, which provides
students with the opportunity to apply the tools of recombinant DNA technology
to their own investigations. Specific hands-on applications that are being
incorporated into these two new educational opportunities include CDNA library
screening, nucleotide sequencing and computerized analysis, reporter assays for
the analysis of gene promoter function, and the use of the Internet in
scientific communication. Given these new opportunities, many biology majors may
discover a previously unrecognized interest in basic science and view careers in
academic and industrial science as less mysterious.
