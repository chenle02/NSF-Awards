9404642 Cattani The topics covered in the scope of research include the study of
polarized variations of Hodge structures with applications to the mirror-
symmetry conjecture for Calabi-Yau spaces. Further problems related to the
variation of Hodge structure, compactification of moduli spaces and computation
of multidimensional residues will also be pursued. The research has potential
applications to algebraic geometry and superstring theory in mathematical
physics. ***
