This project will continue the development of a family of highly practical
chiral silane Lewis acids for asymmetric synthesis. The silanes activate
acylhydrazones and other imines towards highly enantioselective attack by a wide
variety of nucleophiles. Reactions under investigation include Pictet-Spengler
and Friedel-Crafts reactions, Imine-Diene [4+2] cycloaddition and related
cycloaddition reactions, tandem aza-Darzens/Friedel-Crafts reactions, and
Mannich reactions. Mechanistic studies will guide the development of the
chemistry into new realms of efficiency and practicality, as the development of
a family of enabling reagents and catalysts for the rapid synthesis of a diverse
array of medicinally relevant structures is pursued. Efforts to commercialize
the technology will continue as well.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
the research of Professor James Leighton of the Department of Chemistry at
Columbia University. Professor Leighton's research programs are directed towards
the design of highly practical and useful synthetic methods for the preparation
of a wide variety of compounds with relevance to medicinal chemistry. The
chemistry in this proposal is based upon the use of silicon, and such reactions
will contribute to the development of ever more efficient and environmentally
benign methods in organic synthesis. Success will continue to make a strong
impact in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries, as chemists engaged in
these arenas continue to adopt the methods for use in their own research
projects.
