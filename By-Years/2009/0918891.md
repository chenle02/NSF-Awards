This project will conduct comprehensive surveys and inventories of amphibians
and reptiles throughout Haiti -- in areas of known diversity, as well as in
poorly known and unexplored regions. The primary goals are to determine how much
of the known diversity of species still exists, and how much remains
undescribed. Haiti is one of the poorest countries in the world and its land
surface is now essentially devoid of native vegetation because of human
activities. Some of the once-rich biodiversity of the country can be found in
small, isolated patches of forest, but these forest remnants are largely
unprotected, threatening the survival of nearly all species.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although Haiti shares the island of Hispaniola with the
Dominican Republic, a large number of species occur only in Haiti. It has the
highest proportion of threatened amphibian species of any country in the world.
Many new species are likely to be discovered during this project. Sampling and
analytical methods used during the inventories will provide critical data for
understanding the process of mass extinction, to inform conservation management
decisions, and to help prevent loss of biodiversity elsewhere. The project also
involves training of graduate and undergraduate students. &lt;br/&gt;
