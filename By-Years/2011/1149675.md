This project starts with the assumption that software and hardware faults cannot
be entirely prevented, and seeks to discover new mechanisms by which a computing
system can recover from faults in its components and resume predictable
operation in a timely manner. The focus is on embedded computing systems, such
as those that control our transportation and power systems. One novel aspect of
this work is that even low-level aspects of the operating system are assumed to
be potentially faulty, and designed to recover upon fault. A "Superglue"
component connection language and runtime support system provides a unified
framework for fault detection, isolation, and recovery. The research includes
investigations of mechanisms to track the state required to reconstruct a given
part of a system if it should fail, and the policies to reconstruct this state
in time that the impact of the recovery process on the physical world can be
tolerated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Success of this research will potentially
benefit large segments of society. The physical infrastructure upon which many
aspects of our life depend is increasingly reliant on software for control. The
complexity of the software in these embedded systems, which interact with the
physical world, is increasing with the complexity of the tasks performed and
features required. With this mounting complexity the probability of faults
increases, while our increasing dependency on these systems makes the
consequences of failure more severe. Faults in computing systems may manifest as
brief interruptions of service -- for example, the flickering of control panels
-- or as massive system failures, in the worst case leading to loss of life.
Therefore, the resilience and robustness of these computing systems is of
critical importance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI also will continue and expand
his efforts in connecting this research with graduate and undergraduate
education, including courses on robotics, and outreach to the Washington DC
public schools.
