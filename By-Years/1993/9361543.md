9361543 Kelkar Funded under and SBIR Phase 1 grant, research is to be conducted
on mixing in agitated vessels stirred by a rotating impeller. While such mixers
have been in use for a very long time, predicting mixing performance in a new
design is still highly empirical and uncertain. This research is to develop a
computer model of the process based on a novel method for allowing the method to
couple the rotating flow near the impeller with the more irregular non-rotating
flow elsewhere in the mixer. Software is to be developed for dealing with this
situation as a tool for optimization and scale-up. Beyond permitting mixing
equipment manufacturers to create optimized designs with such a predictive tool,
the code will have other possible applications in all fluid systems where only
parts of the flow are rotating. ***
