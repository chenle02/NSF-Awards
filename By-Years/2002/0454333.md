Abstract Proposal: CNS 0454333 PI: Lydia Kavraki Institution: William Marsh Rice
University Program: NSF 04-588 CISE Computing Research Infrastructure Title:
CRI: Acquisition of Rice Physical and Biological Computing (PBC) Cluster

Rice University investigators will acquire a 32 node computer cluster to advance
research on representations, algorithms, system architectures, and new enabling
technologies for solving complex geometric problems, particularly those arising
from physical and biological sciences. The main collaborative projects of the
Rice group are: (a) the modeling and manipulation of deformable objects that
range from elastic objects to bio-molecules, (b) the development of robotics-
inspired methods for the study of molecular motion and function, and (c) the
reduced-dimension modeling of bio-molecular systems. The infrastructure will
enable them to develop and use computational tools to represent, simulate, and
interact with the physical world at all scales. Broader impacts of this project
include its use in graduate training, supporting collaborations with Rice and
the Texas Medical Center, and use in parallel and distributed computing topics
courses. The facility will also support students at Rice participating in the
CRA Distributed Mentoring project.
