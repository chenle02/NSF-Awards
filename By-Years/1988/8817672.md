The objective of this joint project between Dr. Gene F. Parkin at the University
of Iowa and Dr. Bruce E. Rittmann at the University of Illinois include
evaluation of the rate at which soluble metabolic products are produced during
anaerobic processes for wastewater treatment, determination of their chelation
properties and role in reducing metal toxicity during the respiratory process. A
unified conceptual model will be developed and utilized as a basis for
evaluation of more rational approaches to design of treatment processes than are
now possible be based on effects of solids retention time, metal and substrate
loading on metal toxicity to the reaction and nutritional requirements of the
methanogenic organisms involved in the treatment process. This is a project that
is responsive to recent findings regarding the role played by residual metabolic
products and trace metals in anaerobic wastewater treatment. Through this
cooperative project, the investigators will coordinate their work utilizing
intermediate results to relate results of chemostat research to comparable
reactions on fixed biofilms reactors. Results are expected to result in
improvements in engineering design of biotreatment processes used for industrial
and municipal treatment practice.
