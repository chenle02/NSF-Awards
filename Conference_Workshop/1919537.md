The Berkeley Conference on Inner Model Theory will be held July 8-19, 2019 at
the Department of Mathematics, University of California, Berkeley. It will be
devoted to significant recent progress in inner model theory. The new work
includes advances in iteration tree combinatorics, leading to a general
comparison theorem for the iteration strategies of mice having no long
extenders, and from there to a new theory of the hereditarily ordinal definable
sets in models of the Axiom of Determinacy. The Berkeley conference will gather
experts in inner model theory from around the world, as well as students and
postdocs with a serious interest in the field, in order to communicate and
pursue the new ideas.

Large cardinal hypotheses play a central role in the set-theoretic foundations
of mathematics. The inner model program attempts to associate to each large
cardinal hypothesis a canonical minimal universe of sets in which that
hypothesis is true. Some of our deepest understanding of large cardinal
hypotheses come from this program. The core model induction method is our most
powerful method for constructing such canonical inner models, and this
conference will be devoted to recent work that strengthens the method in
important ways. The website for the conference is https://ivv5hpp.uni-
