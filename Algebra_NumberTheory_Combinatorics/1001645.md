This proposal continues the investigator's research on elliptic analogues of
special functions (hypergeometric functions, Painleve transcendents, and
Macdonald polynomials), with specific attention to the study of degenerations.
One major theme of the research is the classification of difference and
differential equations (viewed as difference equations on a possibly very
singular elliptic curve) using certain moduli spaces of sheaves on (possibly
noncommutative) surfaces, generalizations of the spaces of initial conditions of
the Painleve equations. For instance, this reduces the problem of classifying
degenerations of the elliptic hypergeometric equation to one of classifying -2
curves on certain rational surfaces. Other problems involve classifying and
studying degenerations of the investigator's elliptic analogues of
Macdonald/Koornwinder polynomials (with a long-term goal of understanding how
the Hecke algebra approach might be generalized); proving special cases for
Hall-Littlewood-type polynomials of various multivariate quadratic
transformations conjectured by the investigator; and studying limiting cases of
a random tiling model with elliptic probabilities, generalizing the uniform
distribution on lozenge tilings of a hexagon.

Historically, the study of "special functions" originated in the fact that quite
a few functions of interest in applications turned out to be members of a single
family, the hypergeometric functions; more recently, the "Painleve
transcendents" have also begun to play a significant role in applications. Under
previous grants, the investigator constructed and studied so-called "elliptic"
analogues of these functions (a significant generalization that includes most of
the generalized hypergeometric functions and generalied Painleve transcendents
in the literature); the current research program continues this investigation,
with particular attention to the implications for more classical special
functions.
