0328186&lt;br/&gt;Li&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a cooperative
project between Dr. Jichun Li, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and Professor
Yiu-Chung Hon, City University of Hong Kong, on radial basis function based
meshless methods for numerical simulation with applications for groundwater
modeling. The proposed research on meshless methods has useful applications for
practical large scale numerical simulation such as groundwater contaminant
modeling. The project will develop teaching materials for graduate education and
training. &lt;br/&gt;
