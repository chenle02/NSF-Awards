9531951 Paulson This research was inspired by a number of reports on
competitiveness of the U. S. construction industry in the late 1980's that
recommended encouraging private sector construction R&amp;D and increasing
technoloey transfer efforts. This research will provide insight into ways that
technology transfer can be promoted through understanding of social network
influences on diffusion, including: the direct exchange of advice, the location
of decision-makers in the web of advice relations, and key individuals with many
advice relations. In addition to informing managers and policy makers, the
results will contribute to the background of social network diffusion theory and
empirical results, which can be applied to future studies. ***
