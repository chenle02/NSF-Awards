Dr. Richard Brusca of the San Diego Natural History Museum is nearing
completion of a series of monographs documenting the marine isopods of the
tropical eastern Pacific. His current project, a study of the genus Rocinela
using scanning electron microscopy, will bring his analysis of the suborders
Valvifera and Flabellifera to completion. Members of this genus are parasitic on
fishes, and are poorly represented in most museum collections. Dr. Brusca has
assembled an unprecedented array of new samples for study. The proposed
monograph will add significantly to our understanding of the evolution and
ecology of tropical marine organisms. The completion of this monographic series
will have implications beyond the concerns of crustacean specialists. Marine
ecologists will have new and reliable identification guides. Evolutionary and
biogeographic studies will use the monographs as a basis for studying important
processes in an oceanographically and historically complex part of the world.
