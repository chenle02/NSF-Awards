The project will develop a novel integrated approach for improvement of
reliability, availability, security, and performance of Web-based systems. In
order to handle the intrinsic complexity of Web-based systems, the proposed
approach will be scalable and allow measurements and models with different level
of details and abstraction to be combined together. The project will focus on
the following lines of inquiry: Empirical characterization of reliability,
availability, security, and performance attributes; Development of performance
and reliability/availability models ; Combining multiple quality attributes
based on clustering analysis and hierarchical modeling; Evaluation based on both
real-life case studies, as well as on controlled experiments conducted in a test
bed environment.What makes the proposed research unique and different from
existing research work in the literature, in addition to addressing the
fundamental limitations for quantitative assessment of each quality attribute
treated in isolation, is the aspect of combining individual quality attributes
within an integrated framework aimed at analyzing their interactions and
tradeoffs.
