Gustavus Adolphus College is the recipient of funds from the National Science
Foundation's Academic Research Infrastructure Program to renovated research
space in the Nobel Hall of Science in support of the departments of chemistry
and biology. This project is one element of a multi-phase effort to fortify the
research-based science education at the College. NSF funding will contribute to
the upgrade of mechanical, electrical and life-safety systems, and modernizing
and reconfiguring of 5,226 square feet (578 square meters) of research space.
The facility has never has been renovated since the building opened in 1963. The
deteriorating condition of Nobel Hall compromises Gustavus' ability to maintain
and expand research programs. Improved space chemistry will encompass
laboratories in analytical, inorganic, organic and quantitative chemistry and
materials science, as well as support facilities. Modernized facilities in
biology will include laboratories in freshwater and cell biology, supporting
instrumentation and animal rooms, and a glasshouse with growth chambers for
plant physiology and ecology.
