The conference "Combinatorial, Computational, and Applied Algebraic Geometry
--Seattle 2022 (CCAAGS-22)‚Äù will take place 27 June to 1 July 2022 at University
of Washington Seattle. Algebraic Geometry is broadly interpreted to be the part
of mathematics that studies systems of polynomial equations and inequalities.
While Algebraic Geometry has often been considered a solely pure area of
mathematics, the community of researchers of CCAAGS-22 promotes its applied and
computational nature. Participants of CCAAGS-22 combine Algebraic Geometry with
the techniques and methods from symbolic and numeric computation, algorithms,
complexity theory, as well as problems motivated by applications in multiple
fields. These methods have already seen applications in biology, coding theory,
cryptography, combustion, computational geometry, computer graphics, quantum
computing, control theory, geometric design, complexity theory, machine
learning, nonlinear partial differential equations, optimization, robotics, and
statistics, among others. The interaction between algebraic geometry and any of
these other disciplines is beneficial for both sides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
conference brings together researchers and promotes interdisciplinary work in a
fast growing area. After the lack of contact during the pandemic, this is a long
overdue event. It is particularly useful for junior researchers whose careers
strongly depend on making connections and networking. CCAAGS-22 is indeed
planned with junior researchers and underrepresented groups as the primary
audience we want to attract. For more details see

reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
