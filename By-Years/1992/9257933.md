The research plan involves the rheological behavior of fresh cement paste and
concrete. There are a number of challenging scientific issues in cement
rheology. It is critical to understand the various dynamic microstructural
processes, not only to understand flow behavior of cement paste, but also to
predict and control flow of concrete. One dynamic process is hydration, through
which concrete transforms from liquid to solid. Another is flocculation and the
response of flocculated particles to shear. The long- range objective during the
next five years is to develop a microstructure-based model to simulate the flow
behavior of cement past and concrete. The effort will focus on developing a
dynamic computer-based microstructural simulation of hydration, flocculation and
flow behavior. The simulation will be based on physicochemical aspects of
particle interactions, including those resulting from hydration reactions, an
approach generally similar to non-equilibrium molecular dynamics, a recent
approach for modeling flow behavior of suspensions.
