9205119 McCartney In this project, the PI's will provide scientific leadership
for, and hydrographic measurements on a hydrographic section across the Pacific
along a latitude of about 17 degrees South. This line was originally proposed to
be done in 1993, but was deferred pending availability of both ship time and
science funding. It is a contribution to the World Ocean Circulation Experiment
(WOCE), and is referred to as WOCE line P-21. Many scientific issues crucial to
the role of the ocean in climate change will be addressed by the data to be
generated in this expedition. ***
