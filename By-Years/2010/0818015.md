The award funds two different projects that investigate the effects of secondary
markets on several dimensions of economic activity. An example of a secondary
market is the market for used automobiles; this is 'secondary' to the primary
market for new automobiles.

The first project develops and analyzes a new mathematical model of a durable
goods market. This model highlights the role of a nation's overall income
distribution in determining whether or not secondary markets are important to
the national economy.

The second project calibrates the model using data from the United States, the
United Kingdom, France, and other countries. The calibrated models are then
analyzed to examine the effects of reduced transaction costs on both secondary
markets and the cyclical behavior of the overall economy in each country.

This research extends our understanding of secondary markets and how these
markets affect macroeconomic stability in different countries.
