0855165&lt;br/&gt;Girimaji, Sharath S.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop grant
is to support a gathering of CAREER eligible faculty at the 2008 APS/DFD meeting
in San Antonio, Texas. The workshop will involve discussion of CAREER Award
criteria and issues by NSF personnel and discussion among CAREER eligible
faculty and past CAREER awardees. The intellectual merit of this workshop is to
make new faculty more aware of what NSF is looking for in CAREER proposals to
help young faculty focus their efforts. For broader impacts, this workshop will
also provide a an opportunity for new faculty to learn more about NSF. This
includes NSF budgets, trends in grants and awards and other information that
will be useful to new faculty in submitting proposals to NSF. A specific effort
will be made to invite faculty from under represented groups to this workshop.
