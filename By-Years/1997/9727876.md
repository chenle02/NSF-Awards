institutionalize the Regional Center for Workforce Education (CWE), which was
made possible through a Technology Reinvestment Project (TRP) award. This
project was established to assist the region's defense manufacturing companies

markets. The project has more than met its original objectives, however New York
small business while becoming the new economic engine in the State, have limited
fiscal and human resources. This two year award will help the CWE in the
transition to self-sufficiency and enable it to provide bridge support to the
small business involved as they develop and implement individual plans for full
support of their workforce development programs. The program will have the
guidance and direction of industry representatives, support of the institution's
administration and technical assistance of the New York Network.
