Extensive genetic analyses of the maize anthocyanin pathway have revealed
multiple target genes, whose expression is coordinately controlled by several
regulatory genes. Our goal is to understand the mechanisms by which the
transcription of the genes encoding the anthocyanin biosynthetic enzymes is
coordinately controlled by three regulatory genes, b, c1, and a3. The proposed
in vivo and in vitro experiments should enable us to begin to distinguish
between possible models for how the regulatory proteins are interacting to
control transcription. Our specific aims are to : 1) mutationally dissect the
regions of C1 and B required for their interaction, 2) identify other proteins
involved, 3) develop in vitro assays for analyzing B and C1 protein/protein
interactions, 4) assess whether the B and C1 proteins interact directly with
structural gene regulatory sites, 5) identify the cis-acting sites required for
B and C1 regulation of uncharacterized structural gene promoters, 6) identify
functionally important regions of B using available transposable element
insertions, 7) determine if a3 is acting at the transcriptional level and if so,
clone and characterize a3. %%% Principles of gene regulation learned from these
studies should apply to other systems where a combined genetic and molecular
approach is not yet feasible.
