The structural features of the catalytic RNA subunit and the protein subunit of
RNAase P from E. coli, which are required for catalysis and the accurate
cleavage of tRNA precursor molecules, will be investigated by utilizing subunits
of enzyme that have been altered by chemical enzymatic or genetic methods.
Derivatives of the catalytic subunit or altered forms of the RNase P holoenzyme
with Km or k cat values, different from those of the wild type will be
identified. In particular, subunits of the enzyme, in combination with modified
substrates, will be used to improve the yield of enzyme-substrate complexes, and
thereby facilitate the identification and study by chemical techniques of the
active site of the enzyme. Model substrates will be synthesized to determine the
features of the substrates which are essential for cleavage by the enzyme.
Hybrid enzymes, composed of subunits from different organisms, will also be used
to determine the role played by each subunit in the catalytic activity of the
holoenzyme in vitro. Attempts to crystallize the RNase P from E. coli will
proceed concurrently. The importance of the processing of RNA in the
biosynthesis of RNA molecules and in the regulation of gene expression during
the cell cycle of simple organisms and during differentiation of higher
organisms is well established. It is apparent that the endo and exonucleolytic
cleavages, ligations, modification and addition of nucleotides, which RNA
molecules undergo are not biochemical curiosities, but are essential to the
normal function and expression of all genomes. Many of these reactions involve
novel mechanisms of catalysis and/or novel aggregates of macromolecules which
either directly govern processing reactions or in some way act as cofactors. Dr.
Altman originally discovered that RNA is an essential component of RWase P.
After the discovering of self-splicing introns he showed that RNA above could
perform the catalytic function.
