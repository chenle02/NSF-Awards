This grant will help ensure that the U.S. maintains an internationally
competitive workforce related to the science and technology of short but intense
pulses of light. The funding from this grant will be used to support the
registration fees of students and postdocs so they can attend the 2014
Multiphoton Processes Gordon Research Conference (the 17th in a series of
biennial conferences), which will be held June 15-20, 2014 at Bentley University
in Waltham, MA. This well-established international conference remains vibrant
due to continuing advances in atomic, molecular, optical, and chemical (AMOC)
science and related technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2014 meeting is
structured around contributed posters and 8 sessions of invited talks that will
focus on topics at the forefront of AMOC science including: High Harmonic
Spectroscopy; Attosecond Electron Dynamics; ATI and Photoelectrons; Strong Field
Processes and Sources; Photoionization delay; X-Ray Imaging; and Free-Electron
Laser Experiment and Theory. The broad range of expertise and perspectives among
attendees provides a unique and stimulating environment for the development of
new ideas in these rapidly evolving areas.
