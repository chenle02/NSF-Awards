This grant funds a two-day workshop that brings together academic, industrial,
and government participants with diverse expertise and backgrounds to explore
future directions in networked sensing systems, and to make recommendations to
the NSF on potential new research initiatives. The participants (i) review the
current state of technology, application, and education, (ii) identify promising
new technology and application directions that may drive the networked sensing
systems of the future, (iii) identify the implications of networked sensing
systems in other areas such as on Internet architecture, and security & privacy
management, and (iv) identify open problems that are current barriers to the
large scale use of networked sensing systems. Focus topics include the current
state of networked sensing systems; system software, communications, embedded
processing, energy harvesting, sensing, actuation, human interfaces; theoretical
advances such as sensor signal processing, control theory, information theory
and science, online and randomized algorithms, data management, statistics, and
machine learning; constraints posed by newly emerging applications; and the
impact of Internet architecture on networked sensing systems.
