This project is an experimental and modelling study of a technique for
separating suspended particles which differ in their sedimentation speeds. The
technique uses a combination of appropriately phased forced oscillatory flow in
a horizontal tube with periodic rotation about the tube axis to reverse the
vertical motion of the particles. The technique has been successfully used on
particles in the 100 micron size range. The new research will concentrate on
particles in the technologically much more important size range of 10 micron and
smaller. The research also will explore the use of centrifugal fields instead of
gravity to extend the basic technique to submicron diameter particles. The
proposed technique may fill a useful niche for the size fractionation of small
particles for size analysis or for production of high value added powders such
as closely sized particles for chromatographic separations and closely sized
fibers for fiber reinforced composites.
