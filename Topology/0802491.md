This project will support travel to the conference "Homotopical Group Theory and
Topological Algebraic Geometry," at the University of Copenhagen and at the Max
Planck Institut in Bonn in June 2008. Homotopical Group Theory and Topological
Algebraic Geometry involve the interaction at the highest level of formerly
distant areas of mathematics. They are bound together by a common toolbox from
modern homotopy theory. Homotopical Group Theory has shed light on fundamental
issues such as the structure of classifying spaces and group actions, and the
nature and classification of compact Lie groups. It has very recently shown the
potential of shedding new light on the classification of finite simple groups.
Topological Algebraic Geometry brings together ideas from algebraic geometry and
homotopy theory. It has contributed to significant advances in both areas,
including elliptic cohomology and the relationship between the chromatic stable
homotopy theory and the Langlands program.

Homotopical Group Theory and Topological Algebraic Geometry are new areas of
mathematics, and they have recently enjoyed explosive development by researchers
around the world. The conference supported by this proposal will begin at the
University of Copenhagen, focused on two series of lectures by Paul Goerss of
Northwestern University and Bill Dwyer of the University of Notre Dame and aimed
at beginning researchers. The following week at the Max Planck Institut, leading
researchers will report on the latest developments. The idea is to bring
together current leaders and new researchers, and to enable interaction and
cross-fertilization of ideas among a broad group of mathematicians.
