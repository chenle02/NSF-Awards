9612880 Farlow In what morphological features, and at what taxonomic level,
would tridactyl (three-toed) footprints likely vary across different groups of
bipedal dinosaurs? Because we cannot observe footprint formation by living, non-
avian dinosaurs, it is proposed to investigate these questions indirectly,
through inter-related analyses of within-taxon and across-taxon morphological
variability in: a) hindfoot and toebone proportions in dinosaurs and ground
birds; b) footprint shape in ground birds; c) skeletal and "fleshy" foot
proportions in crocodilians. Morphometric analyses of foot and footprint shape
will be employed to address the question of how different footprints can be, and
still have been made by the same kind of taxon and how similar prints can be,
and yet have been made by different taxa. Each component of the project
addresses a different aspect of the problem of interpreting the diversity of
animals responsible for dinosaur fooprint faunas, and each addresses
shortcomings I the other approaches. Together they will provide a theoretical
framework upon which to base systematic interpretations of tridactyl dinosaur
footprints. Results of these studies will be used to interpret the ichnotaxonomy
of tridactyl dinosaur footprints from Early Cretaceous rocks of Texas.
