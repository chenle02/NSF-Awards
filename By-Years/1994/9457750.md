9457750 Vakakis This is a National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award.
The main research efforts by the PI include dynamics and control of periodic
engineering systems; response of layered composite media and system
identification of mechanical structures using analytical and numerical
techniques. His teaching activities involve a design of laboratory exercises on
the dynamics of physical systems, development of two new graduate courses in the
area of nonlinear dynamics and structural acoustics, and dynamics/control
integration in undergraduate education. ***
