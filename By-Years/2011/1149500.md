Monitoring the detailed characteristics of an operational cognitive radio
network in white space is critical to many system administrative tasks. It faces
unique challenges due to dynamic spectrum access policy, low-power primary
users, wide spectrum, and radio agility. Towards reliable and efficient
monitoring of cognitive radio networks in white space, this project develops
mechanisms for monitoring the activity of low power primary users (wireless
microphones) and secondary networks. There are two main thrusts in this project.
The first thrust focuses on a novel approach for reliable and fast detection of
wireless microphone systems by integrating acoustic sensing and RF sensing under
low SNR and multi-user scenarios. The second thrust is on customizable efficient
monitoring of the traffic and spectrum usage pattern in secondary networks with
limited number of monitors through online learning and dynamic monitoring
channel switching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will open up a new avenue
for reliable, fast, and low-complexity primary user (wireless microphone)
monitoring in white space. It will promote the understanding of the data
monitoring problem in dynamic spectrum access systems, and largely facilitate
the operation and optimization of cognitive radio networks in white space. This
project develops curricula and educates students. Materials of this project will
be available online in the forms of tutorials, talks, publications, and software
toolkits. Major results will be disseminated through presentations and
publications in meetings, conferences and journals.
