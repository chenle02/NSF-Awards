This research project in topology makes use of recent ideas in theoretical
physics, such as gauge theory and topological quantum field theories. The
results will have implications for topology and geometry of 3-manifolds. Three-
manifolds are very natural geometric objects. In fact, ignoring the time
dimension, we live in one. For this reason, plumbing their deepest structure
might have more than purely mathematical interest.//
