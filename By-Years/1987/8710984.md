The research deals with work in spectrum estimation for problems involving
finite samples from stationary Gaussian stochastic processes. Emphasis is on the
general method for achieving estimators with small bias and low variance.
Theoretical work is in three areas: 1) Implementation via lattice filters, 2)
Maximum-entropy extension, 3) Complex exponentials in noise. Investigations also
involve multi-signal array processing, beamforming, and delay-doppler radar
imaging along with mapping of these signal processing algorithms to parallel
architectures. This project is one supported under the Creativity Awards for
Undergraduate Engineering Students.
