Factors believed to stimulate bacteria in marine sediments, and therefore to
enhance their role(s) in benthic communities and nutrient cycles, include
increased nutrient supply, grazing pressure, and physical transport events. Dr.
Deming's research will determine the effects of sediment transport on two key
bacterial parameters, growth and exoenzyme production, in initially simplistic
and progressively more complex simulations: static (single core), gradostatic
(multiple cores linked in series across nutrient gradients), and hydrodynamic
(flume) microcosms. Growth will be assessed in microcosms subjected to a defined
sediment disturbance (and in undisturbed and killed controls), according to
temporal and spatial shifts in bacterial abundance, biovolume, and frequency of
dividing cells, determined by epifluorenscence microscopy. Exoenzyme activity
will be measured using fluorescent substrate analogs. Both processes will be
cross-checked in selected experiments using radiosotopic approaches. A major
goal is to document the degree to which physical disturbance of quiescent
sediments influences subsequent bacterial parameters (which, in turn, influence
food resources for higher trophic levels), ultimately building a basis for
predicting effects of sediment transport events in natural marine sediments.
