9501536 Verardo This project will refine a new method to extract charcoal from
marine sediments. Existing methods cannot distinguish charcoal from other
refractory organic material, such as coal, pollen, kerogens, and lignin. If the
method is successful, it can be used to address a variety of environmentally
important problems, such as the past extent of biomass burning, carbon transfer
between the land and oceans, and the long-term cycle of carbon.
