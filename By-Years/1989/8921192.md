The primary objective of this U.S.-Poland research project between Dr. Jayanth
Banavar of the Pennsylvania State University and Dr. Mark Cieplak of the
University of Warsaw is to characterize the glassy behavior of oxide super-
conductors, with emphasis of improving our basic understanding of mechanisms
known as frustration and pinning. The researchers see these mechanisms as only
part of the physics of relaxation but aim to clarify their role in the
expectation that successful results may yield 1) a scaling theory for
superconducting glasses and 2) models showing self-organized criticality that
demonstrate a generic behavior common to the spatiotemporal dynamics of diverse
systems. The researchers hope that their findings will contribute to a unified
theory of relaxation that encompasses the complex dynamics of random (non-
equalibrium) systems. This project in solid state physics fulfills the program
objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the
United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool
research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
