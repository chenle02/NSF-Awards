The Information Technology Research (ITR) program is a unique, interdisciplinary
program at the National Science Foundation (NSF). It is designed to fund
innovative information technology research and education. To assess and learn
from the experiences of the ITR program, two related phases of work are
proposed. In the first phase, an ITR Principal Investigator (PI) meeting will be
held. This meeting will foster an exchange of information and collaborative
experiences among ITR PIs and NSF Program Officers to learn the outcomes of the
ITR program. Detailed field notes will be collected from the ITR PI meeting.
They will be analyzed systematically, and then applied to the next phase. In the
second phase, the factors that lead to greater success in ITR projects will be
analyzed. A survey will be created and objective data will be collected to
evaluate quantitatively how different attributes of projects, such as geographic
dispersion, number of disciplines and coordination strategies, effect the way
that projects are conducted and research outcomes achieved. Projects will be
assessed in comparison with NSF's GPRA goals to improve research knowledge,
research infrastructure, scientific and engineering training and personnel, and
society's use and understanding of science. The intellectual merit lies in the
use of diverse metrics and systematic user-centered research design to assess
interdisciplinary research programs, such as ITR. The broader impacts include
advancing understanding and policy for successful interdisciplinary, distributed
scientific work.
