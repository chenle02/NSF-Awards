Many failures and accidents in earth dams and their foundations have been
attributed to concentrated water leaks caused by cracks present in the compacted
clays forming the earth dams. Insufficient attention has been given by
researchers of earth dam safety to the topic of time-dependent crack growth and
interaction in stiff clays such as those forming part of earth dams. This will
be addressed in this project. Specifically, the project will study in the
laboratory the mechanisms by which cracks grow and interact in prismatic samples
of brittle clay subjected to constant (creep) as well as statically increasing
biaxial and triaxial stress conditions, and study the effect that parameters
such as clay water content, number of cracks as well as their orientation,
length, separation and overlap have on the way cracks propagate and interact in
brittle clay samples.
