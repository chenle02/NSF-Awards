0139030&lt;br/&gt;Weaver&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chapman Conferences are topical
meetings sponsored by the American Geophysical Union (AGU) and are designed to
promote opportunities not normally available through the format of larger
meetings. Funds in the amount of $21,250 are being requested from the National
Science Foundation to support participant travel for some domestic and
international students and scientists. Applications for travel assistance will
be evaluated and awards issued on a competitive and need basis. We expect to
issue approximately 25 grants at an average of $800 per award. To be fully
effective, approval of this proposal is needed not later than 01 March
2002.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
