9413936 Slocum This grant provides funds for the establishment of a high speed
high precision machining center, based on a scaled Ingersoll Milling Machine
Octahedral Hexapod machining center and a Brown & Sharp Excel Coordinate
Measuring Machine, in the Laboratory for Manufacturing & Productivity at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The Hexapod machine has six degrees of
freedom, and is designed to be rigid and accurate, so it can perform many
manufacturing functions ranging from high speed milling of complex molds for
plastics and composites research, to composite tape laying research. The
measuring machine will be used to measure parts to verify cutting performance of
the Hexapod. By working with machine tool builders, this Center will help enable
researchers in the following areas to more effectively apply their research to
machine tools: internal passive structural damper designs and self-compensated
water, hydrostatic bearings, precision temperature control, precision magnetic
bearing spindles, precision adaptive controllers, and advanced high-efficiency,
linear electric motors. The research will be applied to the Hexapod and Excel
mCMM in an effort to further increase their speed and accuracy, which are
critical parameters required by the United States machine tool industry if it is
to regain its world leadership position.
