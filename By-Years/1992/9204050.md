This program explores containerless liquid phase processing of ceramics,
superconductors, and metals. The process itself is referred to as "AAL", or
aero-acoustic levitation. A CO2 laser heats the particle up to 2700 degrees C.
Phase I demonstrated the AAL process for ceramic and glass. The work in Phase II
has three parts: (1) characterization of the levitator process; (2) automation
of the processing of materials: (3) collaborative research. These steps are
required to apply AAL to materials of interest, prepare quantities of materials,
and evaluate the processed materials. %%% Promising applications of the AAL
process involve the production of high value-added materials with commercial
potential. New methods for crystal, fiber, and non-equilibrium synthesis should
be possible.
