This project increases the engineering ceramics component of the undergraduate
curriculum and permits the offering of an "Area of Specialization" in
Engineering Ceramics for undergraduates. The project goal is to integrate
ceramics into the entire curriculum, especially seven undergraduate courses. The
equipment purchased represents those additional items necessary for this
undertaking and includes a pycnometer, a particle size analyzer, and a
volumetric sorption analyzer for BET surface area and porosity measurements. The
award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal investigator's
institution.
