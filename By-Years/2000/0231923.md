Access Science, a renewed GK-12 project, supports fellows at the University of
Pennsylvania from the departments of Biology, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics,
Computer Science and Engineering, for educational activities with grade K-12
students in the urban public schools in West Philadelphia. The school population
is 98% African American. Penn's Center for Community Partnership participates in
the project. Ten graduate students and twenty advanced undergraduates are
supported per year. The themes are hands-on and inquiry based science,
mathematics, engineering and technology. The nature of the schools involved
result in a broad impact of this project on populations that are currently
underrepresented in the sciences, technology, mathematics, and engineering
professions. This project is receiving partial support from the Directorate for
Mathematics and Physical Sciences
