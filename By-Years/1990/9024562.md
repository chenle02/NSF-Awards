This action provides support for travel of U.S. scientists to Russia to discuss
diffusion and defects in solids in an informal type of atmosphere in June 1991.
Topics of the conference include intergranular diffusion, diffusional processes
in new materials, defects and radiation effects, and applications of diffusion
theory. Scientists from Western and Eastern Europe will attend in addition to
the U.S. scientists. Approximately 25 scientists from the U.S. have expressed
interest in attending. Young scientists would be included in the group
supported.
