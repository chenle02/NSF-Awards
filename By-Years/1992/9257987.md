Burns This research is on developing a unifying design language and framework in
which asynchronous circuit designs can be completely specified, and in which
decisions made during synthesis of the implementation can be recorded. The
language is an extension of Hoare's CSP with a means to specify structural
hierarchy with a refinement hierarchy superimposed upon it. The research
consists of three interconnected tasks: language definition; developing tools
such as a parser, flattener, view generator, handshaking expansions, and
production rule sets; and application of the tools to a large design or a real
time system. An algorithm for determining the maximum time separation of event
occurrences in a concurrent system is being developed.
