ABSTRACT: This proposal deals with problems concerning the isomorphic structure
of classical Banach spaces and their quantized analogues, operator spaces. The
problems to be studied lie in the following four areas: I. The complementation
problem for ideals in C* algebras. II. Certain extension properties for
separable operator spaces. III. The structure of complemented subspaces of
nuclear C*-algebras. IV. The structure of non-commutative L^p-spaces. Specific
problems include the following: Area I: Let J be an ideal (closed, 2-sided) in a
C*-algebra A with A/J separable. Is J Banach complemented in A? An important
special case is where J = K, the ideal of compact operators on separable
infinite-dimensional Hilbert space; this is related to the uniform approximation
property in classical Banach space theory. Area II: Does every separable
operator space X with the CSCP completely embed in K? X is said to have the CSCP
if it is locally reflexive and completely complemented in every separable
locally reflexive superspace. Area III: Is every complemented subspace of a
separable nuclear C*-algebra completely isomorphic to a nuclear operator space?
Is the converse true? Area IV: Let N be a von Neumann algebra and X be a
subspace (infinite- dimensional, linear, and closed) of the predual of N. Does
l^p embed in X for some 1 < or = p < or = 2? If M is another von Neumann
algebra, and the preduals of M and N are Banach isomorphic, do M and N have the
same type?

The study of operator spaces involves mathematics underlying the foundation of
quantum mechanics. Important "quantized" Banach spaces include C*-algebras such
as the Fermion algebra and the algebra of compact operators on Hilbert space,
and the preduals of von Neumann algebras, i.e., non-commutative L^1-spaces. The
problems concerning the structure of these spaces will be approached from the
perspective of classical Banach space theory. This approach has already had
considerable success, yielding basic properties of the space of compact
operators, and the Banach distinction between the preduals of finite and
infinite von Neumann algebras.
