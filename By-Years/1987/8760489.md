Temperature is one of the greatest limiting factors to successful aquaculture
ventures in temperature climates. Because of this many US companies, that
developed important shrimp culture technologies, have moved to more tropical
climates to start shrimp farms, and sell the shrimp to the US. This project
proposes to develop an aquaculture system to culture shrimp in temperate areas.
A greenhouse will be built over a portion of the shrimp ponds and initially used
as an enclosed nursery within the pond. As the shrimp grow and the weather
becomes warmer, additional sections of the pond will received water warmed by
the greenhouse. In this way, it will be possible to start growing shrimp earlier
in the year. If successful, this approach will add about 45 days to the growing
season, and will produce a larger marketable shrimp and improve the economic
viability of the culture operation.
