This award is a Research Planning Grant in the Organic Dynamics Program of the
Chemistry Division. With these funds, Professor Kimberley Waldron of Regis
University will study green fluorescent protein from the organism Aequorea. This
protein is believed to fluoresce as a result of intramolecular cyclization of
sequential amino acids. The fully fluorescent protein can be expressed in a wide
variety of cell types and as a consequence is of active interest in the cell and
developmental biology communities. This work will use fluorescence and Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopies, spectroelectrochemistry, and molecular
modeling to characterize the fluorophore/electrophore and to probe three-
dimensional interactions. Standard molecular biological techniques will be used
to create native and mutant protein. Were science able to insert a
characteristic fluorescent group into arbitrary proteins a powerful general
analytical tool for study and identification of such molecules would result. The
significance of achieving such a goal is manifold, since many biotechnological
applications currently use fluorescence technology. This work will begin the
characterization of a specific fluorescent segment of a protein that holds
substantial promise for meeting this goal.
