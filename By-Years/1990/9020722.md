Funds are provided for the purchase of computer equipment to enhance the
existing UNIDATA program within the Department of Atmospheric Science (DAS) at
the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. A HP 9000 workstation with
additional memory, disk capacity and input/output capabilities will be purchased
and used primarily for data ingest and analysis. The UNIDATA suite of software
will provide the Department with easy and timely access to station data and
gridded analysis and instruction within the DAS. The current meteorological data
system is a micro VAX II and is primarily used by researcher within DAS, but is
inadequate to support current research demands and student loads. There is a
need to reconfigure existing equipment and to acquire new equipment because
UNIDATA will no longer support or continue to develop its software for the micro
VAX II system. This award will facilitate the transition from older to newer
technology.
