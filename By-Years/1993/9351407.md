The Mathematics Concepts and Computers project is based on a 1991 pilot project,
jointly funded by the National Science Foundation and the West Educational
Publishing Company, in which Dowling College was an implementation site. As a
result of the pilot, the number of Dowling students dropping calculus went from
52 percent in 1989-90 to only five percent in 1990- 91. The goal of the project
is to improve student performance and retention at Dowling College, specifically
for the over 500 students enrolled in entry level math courses each year. The
project will incorporate computer laboratory activities into math courses using
the cooperative learning model, beginning with Fundamentals of Mathematics and
Pre-calculus courses.
