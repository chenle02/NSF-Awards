Arc-continent collision during the Mesozoic was a dominant tectonic process
along the western margin of north America. Jurassic events associated with this
process were interpreted to involve a period of short-lived deformation and
metamorphism in the late Jurassic, however recent evidence suggests that
deformation began in the Middle Jurassic, and that the southern part of the
orogen underwent extension while the northern part underwent shortening. This
project will examine the timing of orogenesis in the Black Rock Desert of
northwest Nevada and the Pine Nut Range of west-central Nevada to address these
details, and will employ filed, petrologic and U/Pb and Ar/Ar age dating
techniques. Results should provide new data for refining the regional variations
in timing of Jurassic deformation.
