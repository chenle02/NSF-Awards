9553534 Peters Indiana University will initiate an eight-week, residential,
Young Scholars project in Multi-disciplinary science for 50 students entering
grades 11 and 12. The participants will be recruited from the state of Indiana.
Students will learn about research methodology and career opportunities in
various fields of science through lectures, field trips, and hands-on laboratory
experiences. Students will be provided opportunities to work as apprentice
scientists under the auspices of university faculty on individual research
projects. Throughout the project, emphasis will be placed on philosophy and
ethics of science, careers in science and mathematics, and the
interrelationships of the various scientific areas.
