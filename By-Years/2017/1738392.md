This award provides support for participation in the 31st Midwest Conference on
Combinatorics and Combinatorial Computing (MCCCC), held at the University of
West Georgia, October 20-22, 2017. This long-running conference series has a
reputation for featuring recent relevant progress at the frontiers of
combinatorial mathematics and computing. These fields are interesting on their
own, and also have applications to other sciences and practical problems in
areas including optimization, algorithms, and information processing. This
conference will feature five plenary talks and an additional 50-70 shorter
talks. Participants will include researchers from all career stages, from
undergraduate students to distinguished senior researchers, which should help
effect new and fruitful connections within the research community.

The 31st MCCCC will serve as a catalyst for major collaborative projects among
mathematicians and computer scientists working in pure and applied
combinatorics, particularly graph theory, design theory, enumeration, and
combinatorial computing. It will give researchers an opportunity to share recent
findings, exchange ideas, and discuss research problems. In order to aid in the
advancement of future research, early-career mathematicians in particular will
be recruited to attend. This includes graduate students and advanced
undergraduates, some of whom participated in REU programs during 2015 and 2016.
The proceedings of the conference will be published in a special issue of the
Journal of Combinatorial Mathematics and Combinatorial Computing (JCMCC). The
papers will go through the journals usual process. A conference website is
