This award will support the organization of the annual Principal Investigators
(PI) meeting for the National Robotics Initiative (NRI), which was launched in
2011. The PI meeting will bring together the community of active NRI
participants to provide cross-project coordination of intellectual challenges
and best practices in education, technology transfer and general outreach. This
activity will also establish a repository illustrating the research ideas
explored and milestones achieved by the NRI projects.

The meeting is planned for two days in October 2018 in the vicinity of
Washington DC. The format will include presentations by the attending PIs of
projects in their final year, a poster session with all other projects, keynote
speeches, and panel discussions.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
