Quantum field theory is the major framework for the study of the interactions of
elementary particles. Professor Daniel Freedman from MIT proposes to utilize new
techniques for the computation of scattering amplitudes between these particles
--- techniques which have supplanted the traditional approach via Feynman
diagrams. He plans to focus on the properties of superamplitudes, which
compactly package information concerning many different particle processes in a
single expression. The initial goal, which has already met with success, is to
use superamplitudes to explore properties of the N=8 supergravity theory. These
properties are relevant to the conjecture that N=8 supergravity is the first
consistent field theory of gravity at the quantum level. Numerous other
applications of and extensions to this technology are
envisioned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several broader impacts associated
with this work. At a scientific level, any increase in our ability to evaluate
on-shell amplitudes is extremely valuable, for such amplitudes have been applied
to subjects as diverse as the computation of background QCD events for the Large
Hadron Collider at CERN and the search for an ultraviolet-finite field theory of
quantum gravity. Furthermore, this subject matter is an excellent area for the
advanced education and training of young researchers. Indeed, Freedman's recent
mentees include Henriette Elvang, who recently began an Assistant Professorship
at the University of Michigan and is the recipient of an NSF CAREER Award.
