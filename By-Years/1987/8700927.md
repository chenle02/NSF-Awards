The purpose of this award is to carry out a detailed petrologic study of the
rocks collected by dredging and by DSRV ALVIN from the Galapagos 95.5 degrees W.
propagating rift areas, which include the normal rift, the failed rift, and the
transition area. The investigator will also perform 1-atmosphere experiments to
determine the dependence of the petrologic phase boundaries of the mid-ocean
ridge basalt to the composition of the basalts. All the petrologic data will be
combined with the ongoing tectonic and geophysical interpretations of the
acquired data to produce an integrated petrologic and tectonic model of rift
propagation. The study will contribute to the understanding of rift failure and
rift propagation in a lithospheric plate, generation and evolution of magma in a
propagating rift area, and the crustal evolution of the East Pacific Ridge area.
The project will be supported at $65,000 for 18 months in FY87.
