EAR-0318473&lt;br/&gt;Farley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This instrument development
project will construct and test a miniature Paul ion trap mass spectrometer
designed for noble gas isotope ratio measurements. The project will be a
collaborative undertaking between NASA-JPL and scientists at Caltech with
expertise in noble gas isotope ratio mass spectrometry. The instrument will be
build at JPL with close involvement of a Caltech graduate student. NSF funds are
highly leveraged by substantial institutional support offered by
Caltech.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
