This project exposes students to an Automated Antenna Analysis Laboratory, a
computer-driven test and measurement system equivalent to that used in the
Communications industry. Students using the AAAL study in great detail the
performance of virtually all types of antennas including satellite dishes,
mobile antennas and complex arrays. Using the AAAL equipment, students verify
the performance of their antenna designs while learning the characteristics of
automated-test systems. This laboratory also serves as a regional resource to
other Technical Institutions in the area. This award is being matched by an
equal sum from the grantee.
