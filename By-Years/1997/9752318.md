The aim of this project is to reform the General Education Mathematics course,
MAT 112, at Prince George's Community College with the introduction of more
computer technology, the addition of more links to other disciplines, and the
development of capstone projects. Interdisciplinary faculty teams will design
problem sets that deal with statistics, the mathematics of finance, probability,
and linear algebra. These problem sets will require students to identify and
access data sets, frequently using the Internet as a resource, and then to
analyze these real-world data sets using computer technology. The capstone
projects at the end of the semester will require student teams to access data
sets from broad disciplinary areas, determine the questions that can be answered
from the data, and then to analyze it mathematically. An advisory board that
includes faculty from other two- and four-year institutions, as well as external
resource consultants, will provide guidance for this project.
