The New World Symphony (NWS) vision is to install the bandwidth and network
equipment needed to launch a kind of global musical community that interacts on
a daily basis without geographical limitations. Such a network would be capable
of transmitting multiple interactive master classes simultaneously from a number
of remote locations, and of fostering musical collaborations and experiments
between conservatories, orchestras, and ensembles. Initial experiments conducted
over the Abilene/Internet2 network have demonstrated that musicians, coaches,
and lecturers can effectively teach, learn, and perform together in a virtual
environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also a potential to bring together
students and artists who otherwise might be unable to travel to a particular
performance venue. NWS also seeks to expand the availability of high-quality
interactive music education to secondary schools, particularly those in rural
and underprivileged areas, using the resources developed through its work with
higher education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
