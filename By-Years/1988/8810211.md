This workshop is concerned with the physics of substantially compressible
turbulent mixing processes. In these flows, shock waves or shocklet patterns may
interact with and significantly modulate the turbulence; and there may be strong
coupling between mean and fluctuating components of the acoustic, entropy, and
velocity fields. Descriptions of lower speed flow processes also are sought if
they supply insight on the source and evolution of developing high-speed
compressible features. The workshop is being organized by scientists from the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the Los Alamos National Laboratory,
Princeton University, the AWE-Aldermaston, U.K., and Imperial College, London,
U.K. The organizers seek an approximate balance between experimental and
numerical/ theoretical papers. Potential contributions from Europe, the Soviet
Union, Japan, China, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United States are
being invited. Publication of the longer papers and a general summary of the
discussions will appear as a bound volume of the Springer-Verlag series. It is
expected that the dissemination of this state-of-the-art review of the role of
compressibility in turbulent flows, will accelerate the advent of more realistic
predictive models in a variety of practical fluid dynamic situations.
