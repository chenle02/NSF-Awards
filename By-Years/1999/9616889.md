Dr. Arthur J. Ashe, III, Department of Chemistry, University of Michigan, is
supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of the
Chemistry Division for the study of heteroaromatic compounds involving group 13
and 15 elements and their transition metal complexes. Previous research has
demonstrated that boratabenzene zirconium complexes can serve as homogeneous
catalysts for the polymerization of olefins. Building on this result and by
analogy to ansametallocenes that are known to be active catalysts, a series of
metal complexes containing heteroaromatic ligands will be designed with the goal
of obtaining highly active and stereospecific olefin polymerization catalysts.
Specifically boratabenzene complexes which bear pendant substituents of varying
electronic and steric demand and a series of bridged boratabenzene complexes
will be prepared. These compounds will exploit variations in electron donating
ability possible with the heteroaromatic ligands to fine tuning and develop more
effective polymerization catalysts. Finally new boron containing heterocycles
will be prepared in order to extend the range of heteroaromatic compounds
available to be used as ligands. Transition metal complexes promote very
selective catalytic and stoichiometric transformations of organic compounds.
Much of the unique reactivity at the metal center is a reflection of the density
of electrons surrounding the metal and this electron density can be controlled
by adjusting the groups that are attached to the metal. A very common 'group'
contains a ring of carbon-hydrogen units in what is called an 'aromatic'
arrangement. In this project a series of metal complexes will be prepared in
which an 'aromatic' group composed of carbon-hydrogen and boron species is
attached to a metal. This will permit the electron density about the metal to be
carefully adjusted in order to promote specific chemical and catalytic behavior
and will set the ground work both to understand existing processes and to
rationally design new ones.
