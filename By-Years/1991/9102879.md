High-Tc superconducting films are very promising as coatings for low-temperature
radiation shields, potentially yielding heat leaks an order of magnitude smaller
than gold films. However, accurate knowledge of the high-Tc film optical
properties is required to evaluate the effectiveness of this use of the films.
At present, there are no high-precision experimental data for the infrared
reflectance of high-Tc superconducting films at low temperatures. Existing data
suffer from limited instrument accuracy and reference mirror errors. There are
no engineering methods for the precise prediction of this paramever,
particularly in the high- reflectance region. To address this problem
reflectance measurements of high-Tc superconducting films are being performed
with a precision grating spectrometer using an eightfold reflection technique
that does not employ a reference mirror. Two theories of superconductor optical
properties, based on BCS theory and valid in the pure limit, are compared to
these measurements. Approximate relations for engineering use will be derived.
The precision reflectance data collected in this study provide for the first
time a quantitative assessment of the feasibility of high-Tc superconducting
radiation shields.
