A joint research project is to be undertaken by Soviet and American scientists
in the field of vision as a cooperative exchange effort. The common goal is to
elucidate the molecular basis of visual signaling. The experimental objectives
are to identify, isolate and characterize the molecular components that detect
light and achieve neural signaling and rod and cone photoreceptor cells and to
clone the genes that encode these protein components. The plan is to adapt the
recent techniques of micro-protein chemistry, molecular cloning, gene
expression, and patch-clamp physiological studies to provide new experimental
tools and approaches for studying photoreceptor cells. Working with the most
current techniques of molecular biology, these scientists seek to establish the
mechanisms underlying the triggering of visual information. This joint venture
draws on the strengths of research in the USSR and US in vision. The Soviet
scientists provide particular expertise in protein chemistry and
electrophysiological techniques. The American scientists provide expertise in
molecular cloning techniques and biochemical purification. Monies awarded for
this project provide a stipend for living expenses to Soviet scientists during
their research visit to the University of Chicago and United States; the airfare
for travel to the Soviet Union is covered for the American investigators
visiting the Soviet Union. By establishing a formal mechanism for joint research
they hope to facilitate the exchange of ideas, support exchange of ideas,
support exchange of materials, and accelerate their goal of defining the basis
of visual triggering.
