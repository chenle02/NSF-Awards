9628813 Powell This research involves seismic and potential-field investigations
to improve resolution of seismogenic crustal features in basement rocks below
the Paleozoic thrust sheets in eastern Tennessee. The Eastern Tennessee Seismic
Zone (ETSZ) is a pronounced zone of earthquake activity in a region 300 by 50 km
with earthquake hypocenters extending from 5 to 25 km in depth. The zone
produces the second highest release of seismic strain energy east of the Rocky
Mountains and is unique in that it is associated with regional-scale potential-
field (gravity and magnetic) anomalies. Seismic recording of quarry blasts will
be done to test the feasibility of this technique for the study of crustal
structure. Concurrently, analysis and inversion of existing potential field data
will be done. Seismic and potential-field data analysis will be integrated to
provide a better understanding of structures responsible for earthquakes within
the region and outline the best approach for further efforts. This research is a
component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
