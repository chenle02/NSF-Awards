This project involves a study of supercritical fluid extraction with
experimental techniques developed in the University of California laboratories.
Arrested-flow and flow chromatography are used to measure transport and
equilibrium properties for various solvent-solute systems at supercritical
conditions. Binary bulk and intraparticle diffusivities are determined using the
arrested-flow technique; and flow chromatography is applied to the measurement
of dispersion, equilibrium adsorption, and adsorption rate coefficients. The
second part of the study is the investigation of extraction processes. In
particular, rates of regeneration will be measured for activated carbon
containing caffeine and other adsorbates with solvents such as carbon dioxide
and toluene.
