AST- 0134999&lt;br/&gt;Max Tegmark&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Tegmark is awarded
funds at the University of Pennsylvania to refine current cosmological models.
These models will make use of existing and new data that include observations of
the cosmic microwave background, galaxy surveys, supernova surveys, and others.
With global analysis of these data, he expects to be able to address the natures
of dark matter and dark energy beyond just their current density, the behavior
of gravity on large scales, the nature of the early universe, and the history of
structure formation in the universe. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will also
initiate a high-school outreach program in the Philadelphia school district. The
PI and graduate students will present lectures and demonstrations on cosmology
to high-school science classes, hoping to recruit students into existing
programs that typically reach only the affluent suburbs. In addition to his
regular course development, the PI will also enhance his existing website on
cosmology to contain a comprehensible introduction to state-of-the-art cosmology
research in lay terms, intended for the general public.&lt;br/&gt;
