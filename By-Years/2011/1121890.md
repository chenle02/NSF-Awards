Currently, there is no consensus on which interviewing techniques provide the
most reliable evidence from alleged victims of child physical and sexual abuse.
One style of interviewing, which reflects decades of research on children's
eyewitness testimony, encourages children to describe events in their own words
and avoids specific questions and props. In contrast, another style seeks to
maximize disclosures through the use of body diagrams and specific questions
about touching. Unfortunately, the debate over which method best distinguishes
abused from nonabused children, and the field of children's eyewitness testimony
itself, are at an impasse. This research project uses a new approach that allows
researchers to safely and ethically test between these two different approaches
in a laboratory setting. Results will determine whether eyewitness findings vary
for children with different disclosure histories and whether the positioning of
body diagrams in interviews influences rates of true and false reports.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information about optimal interviewing practices has the
potential to influence state and national-level interviewing policies utilized
by law enforcement officials.
