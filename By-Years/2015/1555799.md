This project will support a workshop that aims to address the role of
distributed spectrum measurements and associated management techniques in
support of making significantly more spectrum available to the U.S. population.
New spectrum management approaches and spectrum sharing regimes promise to
provide greater broadband access, accelerate the pace of wireless innovation,
and increase the competitiveness of the US telecommunication industry and U.S.
commerce in general. This workshop will result in the promotion of research and
educational efforts that enhance our ability to use spectrum sharing
technologies in a manageable and enforceable manner. This work is supportive of
the goals set out in the National Broadband Plan, the PCAST Report on Spectrum
Policy and the two associated Presidential Memorandums on Spectrum issued in the
past 8 years.

The workshop will assess the current state of spectrum measurement techniques,
the datasets that have been collected and importantly the analysis and modeling
tools available to make this data useful and actionable. This should in turn
provide the basis for developing a roadmap for research leading to future
spectrum management, monitoring, and enforcement techniques and policies that
will enable greater and more efficient access to our increasingly scarce
national spectrum resources.
