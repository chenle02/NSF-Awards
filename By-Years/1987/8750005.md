This project provides an Hitachi Model H-300 Transmission Electron Microscope
with a Scanning attachment and the ancillary preparative equipment needed to
install a new electron microscopy facility in space provided through new
construction. The curricular improvements that result have been based on an
extensive review of facilities, equipment and curriculum that firmly established
the need for an electron microscope to make possible more sophisticated student
work in both introductory and advanced courses -- including Biology and Human
Values, Concepts of Biology, Plant Morphology, Anatomy of Vascular Plants,
Parasitology, Physiology, Introduction to Research, and Independent Research
Topics. The instrument's contribution to enhancing options for independent
projects and required student research is of special significance. The
departmental faculty is unusual in that five of its eight full-time members have
had previous experience working with electron microscopy.
