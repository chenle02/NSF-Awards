It is proposed a diagnostic method for the on-line, semi- continuous
determination of the size and density of individual particles in the 5 nm to 100
nm size range. This is accomplished through a double size spectrometry system.
Particles are first sized by their Stokes diameter, and then sized by their
aerodynamic diameter. The Stokes diameter sizing gives the geometric diameter of
the particle for round particles. The aerodynamic sizing is dependent on
particle density as well as Stokes diameter. The result is a distribution of
particle densities at each selected Stokes diameter. The Stokes sizing is done
by an electrical mobility separation, the aerodynamic sizing is done using a
single-stage hypersonic impactor. Since particles are singly charged, the rate
of particle capture in can be measured on-line using an electrometer. The system
is effective over the 5 to 100 nm diameter range.
