This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project is in the area
of materials chemistry. For three summers beginning in 1992, 16 undergraduate
students will spend 10 weeks engaged in materials chemistry research, under the
direction of 11 senior faculty members from both Syracuse University and SUNY at
Potsdam. Four very closely related areas of chemical research in materials
science will be investigated. The first aspect involves the design, synthesis
and characterization of new organometallic compounds with enhanced properties
for use in thin-film depositional techniques such as organometallic vapor phase
epitaxial (OMVPE) and molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) processes. The second
aspect is the preparation and characterization of new materials from the
organometallic precursor compounds described above. The third aspect involves
the study of the physico-chemical properties of these new materials. The final
aspect deals with the chemical applications of these new materials to a variety
of problems.
