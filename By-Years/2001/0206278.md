AST-0206278&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Seager&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Planets orbiting
other stars are too faint to be observed directly with current technology, but
it is possible to detect them indirectly by observing their parent stars. Close
to 80extrasolar planets are currently known, all of them detected via the
"radial velocity "technique. These extrasolar planets are not seen directly, and
thus even their most basic physical characteristics, such as radius and actual
mass, cannot be measured. This project will carry out a planet transit search,
an alternative and complementary approach to the radial velocity technique. The
planet transit search method involves looking for the tiny drop in brightness of
a star caused by a planet as it periodically passes directly in front of its
parent star (i.e. transits). While most stars with planets will not show
transits, stars with planets in short-period ( ?4 days)orbits are most likely to
show transits. Considering the known population of short-period planets,
approximately 1 in 10,000 stars will have a short-period planet that shows
transits in 10 to 15 nights of observations. Looking at 10,000 stars one-by-one
is far too time-consuming to be feasible. Instead the transit search method
involves monitoring tens of thousands of stars simultaneously. Specifically, the
PI will search for a periodic 1%drop in brightness every time the planet passes
in front of the parent star. A successful planet transit search will have a huge
impact on the field of extrasolar planets because every planet detected will
have a measured radius providing a constraint on evolutionary and atmosphere
models for these planets.&lt;br/&gt;
