The PIs will investigate an hypothesis that the anisotropic acquisition of
certain remanent magnetizations will be insensitive to mineralogical variation,
and will thus be solely controlled by the degree of particle alignment. Remanent
anisotropies therefore ought to provide a much clearer indication of principal
strain magnitudes. Partial anhysteretic remanent magnetization (pARM), which has
been shown to be an effective means of recognizing grain-size variation in
magnetite, can be potentially used to estimate the degree of particle alignment
as a function of grain size.
