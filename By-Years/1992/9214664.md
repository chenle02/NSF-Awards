A joint research project between the University of Missouri-Rolla and the Dalian
University of Technology in China is proposed to study optimum design of three-
dimensional flexible and stiff structures with multiple constraints and
objective functions. The constraints include stability, lateral-torsional
motion, design code provisions of allowable displacements, stresses, and P-
effects for various loading conditions. Research efforts are concentrated on 1)
structural modeling of reinforced concrete and steel building systems, 2)
development of optimization algorithms for large structures built of different
construction materials, 3) formulation of objective functions including
construction and damage costs, 4) serviceability and reliability studies of
optimum design parameters of various structures, 5) experimental verification of
the damage model for a selected structural system, and 6)development of optimum-
based design criteria and assessment of current design code provisions. The
collaborative study should provide a unique opportunity to obtain and validate
statistically the new results for improving current design practice.
