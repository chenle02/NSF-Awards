This award supports a study to document and interpret the spore and pollen
assemblages recovered from the Eocene deltaic La Meseta Formation of Seymour
Island, northeastern Antarctic Peninsula. These spores and pollen were derived
from land plants growing on the Eocene Antarctic Peninsula, at a time when the
land connections with the rest of Gondwana were severed. The Eocene spore and
pollen assemblages reflect the vegetation during the last interval of south
polar warmth in earth history - a time when evolutionary innovation was still
apparent in the southern high latitudes. Of special interest are postulated
paleoclimatic fluctuations during Eocene, and the floristic and paleoclimatic
changes near the Eocene/Oligocene boundary which may be recorded in the
uppermost La Meseta Formation.
