The University of Texas, San Antonio will purchase a local-area computer network
consisting of a central file-server, seven high- resolution graphics
workstations, and peripheral equipment. This system will be used to provide
computer-based instruction in structural geology. This equipment also will be
used in other geology courses, and for independent research projects by advanced
undergraduate students. The structural geology component will employ a software
package developed at UT, San Antonio. The University of Texas, San Antonio will
match the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
