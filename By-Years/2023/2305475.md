Optimal control theory deals with finding a control for a dynamical system over
a period of time such that an objective function is optimized. Optimal control
problems are often encountered in engineering and in physical, economic, and
social sciences. Examples of optimal control problems include how to control the
firing of rocket thrusters to reach a selected target with minimum fuel
expenditure, or how to implement monetary policy to minimize unemployment. The
underlying mathematical difficulties of the theory are compounded when the time
interval for the problem under consideration becomes infinite, and
uncertainties, i.e., stochastic effects, need to be accounted for. This project
will study stochastic optimal control problems with infinite horizon and extend
the knowledge in the field through the introduction of significant extensions of
current models to incorporate new effects, and also new models, both of which
necessitate new ideas and approaches for their analysis. The project will also
provide opportunities for the involvement of undergraduate and graduate students
in this research.

This project will investigate several important aspects of stochastic optimal
control problems with infinite horizon, including: (i) Optimal control of linear
stochastic differential equations (SDEs) having mean-field and involving average
quadratic costs, via invariant measures; (ii) Turnpike properties of stochastic
optimal controls for SDEs; (iii) maximum principle of stochastic optimal
controls in infinite horizon for SDEs and for stochastic Volterra integral
equations (SVIEs); (iv) Time-inconsistent optimal controls over infinite time
horizon for SDEs. These problems necessitate the re-examination of old
approaches and development of new tools to expand the scope and enrich the field
of optimal control theory.
