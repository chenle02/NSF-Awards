P.I.:John T. Hackett IBN-9634400 Neurons (nerve cells) in our brains communicate
between each other at contact points (synapses) which excite the following
neurons by means of chemicals known as transmitters. When things go right, this
process of signaling continues repeatedly in an organized way that results in
integration of information coming into and leaving the brain. This process also
is the basis of memory and learning. The proposed research has as its long range
goal to clarify the process by which neurotransmitter substances are released
from neurons. At an early stage, the neurotransmitter are packaged in a stored
form from which they must be mobilized to dock at the membrane of the release
site. To help explain the mobilization process, mathematical calculations will
test various possible outcomes that will be compared with experimentally obtain
results. Of particular interest is the finding that following repetitive
stimulation more and more neurotransmitter substance is release by a process
known as facilitation. Understanding how facilitation comes about will be key to
our understanding of more complicated forms of memory and learning.
