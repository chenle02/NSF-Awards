This proposal requests funds that will enable research groups of physicists and
students at Hampton University to develop and help to construct a sophisticated
tracking device: a Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT) for the ATLAS detector at
the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) located at CERN, in Geneva, Switzerland. This
proposal will allow underrepresented minorities to participate in the highest
priority future experiment of the EPP program and associated educational and
outreach activities, in collaboration with physicists from other universities in
the US and abroad, and in collaboration with nearby Jefferson laboratory.
