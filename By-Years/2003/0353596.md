In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Prof. Reid of Marquette University will conduct a variety of
investigations on the spectroscopic, photophysical and photochemical properties
of carbenes by means of linear and nonlinear spectroscopic techniques. The work
consists of two parts and will focus on the singlet-triplet gap between the
lowest electronic states of these systems. The first part will be devoted to the
characterization of the spin-orbit gap and spin-orbit mediated interactions in a
series of halocarbenes with a singlet electronic ground state and variable
singlet-triplet gaps. The photophysical and photochemistry of the halocarbenes
will be studied in the second part. Progress in the understanding of these
properties has been impeded by experimental challenges owing to the reactive
properties of the carbenes. Simple halocarbenes play an important role in the
chemistry of the earth's upper atmosphere and this work will go a long way
toward the improvement of our understanding of these reactive systems.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will be conducted with graduate and
undergraduate students who will acquire valuable training in contemporary
physical chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
