The proposal aims to develop methodological and theoretical tools for
statistical inference of long memory and/or nonlinear time series, for which the
traditional methods and theory developed for linear ARMA-type series are not
known to be applicable. Since the applications of long memory and nonlinear
models are rapidly growing, there is an urgent and crucial need to either
provide a theoretical justification for existing methods or propose novel
methods that are able to accommodate long memory and nonlinear features. To meet
this need, the investigator proposes to study the following research problems:
confidence interval for spectral means and ratio statistics; Whittle estimation
and diagnostic checking for fractionally integrated time series with
uncorrelated but dependent errors; new tests of independence and non-
correlations between two stationary time series; frequency domain semiparametric
inference for bivariate fractionally integrated nonlinear time series. All of
them are linked to the second order properties of the long/short time series
with nonlinear features, and together, they cover a wide spectrum of important
inference issues for such series.

Time series with long memory and nonlinearities occur in various fields,
including atmosphere science, environmental science, geophysics, hydrology,
economics, finance and others. This work will greatly enhance the available
methodologies and theories, provide more tools and have potential applications
in all such fields. The proposed research has significant impact on education
through involvement of Ph.D students directly in the proposed research and
incorporation of results into graduate statistical courses.
