The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project
is to research: (1) accurate and efficient approximations that facilitate the
modeling of probabilistic dependence, (2) the degree of dependence that must be
captured in order to make high quality decisions, and (3) the implications of
ignoring dependence in important decision problems. These new methods will be
tested via collaborations with decision scientists in pharmaceutical companies
and geoscientists focused on climate change. This research will be integrated
with education through the following activities: (1) teaching decision skills
directly to middle and high school students, while training middle and high
school teachers in the fundamentals of decision making, (2) development of a new
undergraduate certificate at The University of Texas (UT) focused on decision
making under uncertainty, and (3) inclusion of select undergraduate students in
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will
transform our ability to effectively incorporate probabilistic dependence in
important decision models. This new capability should improve decision making.
For example, improving our ability to model dependencies in the climate system
will result in improved climate and energy policies, which have broad impacts.
In the area of drug discovery and development, the ability to effectively
incorporate probabilistic dependence will help pharmaceutical companies properly
sequence their development processes. The project's educational plan is designed
to fundamentally alter education by organizing curricula around a decision-
making framework. If successful, these educational innovations will transform
engineering education, with important implications for society.
