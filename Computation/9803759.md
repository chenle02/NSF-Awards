Chu 9803759 This research concerns the design, analysis and performance
evaluation of adaptive control algorithms for adaptive optics applications. This
investigation could lead to improved techniques for use in several areas of
applications, including ground-based astro-imaging processing, medicine,
communications, and laser technology. One specific area is the deformable mirror
control computation for adaptive-optics systems to compensate for atmospheric
turbulence. The challenges in this application are that atmosphere changes
rapidly and that the statistics of the turbulence usually is unknown. The
purpose of this study is threefold: (1) to develop a mathematical theory on how
the turbulence statistics can be estimated using measured data, (2) to design a
fast algorithm that enables efficient computation in real time, and (3) to
integrate the theory and the algorithm into real application facilities.
