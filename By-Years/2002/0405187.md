This project will investigate nonlinear phenomena exhibited by granular
materials and fluids. The project employs small-scale laboratory experiments
that are carried out by undergraduate students, who are full partners in the
research. There are two main foci for this work: (1) Studies of granular
dynamics in sheared and vibrating systems, using sensitive force measurements
and rapid particle tracking. This work will reveal how the macroscopic flow
properties depend on the internal structure of the material. The role of
polydispersity (variations in particle size) will be emphasized, including the
suppression of ordering, and segregation induced by shear. Other experiments
will explore the statistics of particle motion, slow dynamics and slip in the
presence of stress, and novel effects such as collective rotation due to chiral
particles lacking reflection symmetry; (2) Methods for highly resolved
measurements of stretching in fluid flows will be extended to the important
problems of weak turbulence, mixing of non-Newtonian fluids in small devices,
and advection in simple chemical reactions. Graduate student and postdoctoral
researchers associated with this program learn to mentor undergraduates, and
typically assume faculty positions in undergraduate institutions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will explore so-called "nonlinear phenomena"
exhibited by granular materials and fluids. The project employs small-scale
laboratory experiments that are carried out by undergraduate students, who are
full partners in the research. There are two main foci for this work: (1)
Investigations of sheared and vibrating granular materials will lead to a better
understanding of industrial and natural phenomena involving small particles. The
experiments will reveal how the macroscopic flow properties depend on the
internal structure of the material, and how variations in particle size affect
both structure and flow. Other experiments will explore slow creep in the
presence of stress, and collective rotation that occurs when particles lack
mirror symmetry; (2) Stretching is an important phenomenon in many fluid flows,
and methods developed in this program allow its quantitative measurement for the
first time. Stretching will be used (a) to characterize and control the mixing
of complex fluids such as polymer solutions in small devices that are critical
to future technologies, (b) to study weak turbulence, and (c) to investigate the
role of flow in chemical reactions. Graduate and postdoctoral researchers
associated with this program learn to mentor undergraduates, and typically
assume faculty positions in undergraduate institutions. &lt;br/&gt;
