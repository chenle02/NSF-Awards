EIA 02-24439&lt;br/&gt;Grunwald, Dirk C.&lt;br/&gt;University of
Colorado&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title:CISE RR: Instrumentation Support for Very
Large Data Stores &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal, designing a system using
Massive Arrays of Idle Disks (MAID) as a replacement for data centers that would
normally use tape archives, will utilize infrastructure in the design and
fabrication of an alternative design to conventional mass storage systems that
attempt to address critical data center issues such as data density (i.e.,
reduced floor space), reliability, power efficiency, and manageability. Using a
combination of commodity disk drives, power management, distributed control, and
caching hierarchy, the researcher claims that the MAID storage organization
provides storage densities matching or exceeding those of tape libraries with
performances similar to disk arrays. Studies have shown that through a
combination of effective power management of individual drives and caching, this
performance can be achieved using a very small power envelope. The large backing
store will be composed of inexpensive IDE disks that, rather than spinning, are
allowed to go idle when not in use. The main goal consists of replacing
conventional tape archival storage with an alternative technology at
significantly reduced power cost. The experimental testbed consists of 120 IDE
drives, each of which holds 160GB of data for a total of 19.2TB of online
storage, of which approximately 160TB would be available once redundancy is
addressed. The infrastructure also includes 120 drive enclosures that connect
commodity IDE drives to 1394 (firewire) I/O networks.&lt;br/&gt;
