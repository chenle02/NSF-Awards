The principal objective of this project is to measure UV and visible radiation
at the ground in the Arctic and utilize these data to infer column abundances of
atmospheric ozone and other trace gases important in the ozone chemistry. This
will be accomplished by measuring intensity ratios for wavelength pairs in the
Huggins band to determine column ozone content, and visible absorption
spectroscopy to derive column abundances of NO2, NO3. Measuring OClO is far more
difficult because of its small abundance, but inference of its column abundance
may be attempted. However, the emphasis will be on developing the capability and
demonstrating the feasibility of measuring NO2, O3 and NO3 column abundances in
the Arctic. Thus, the main effort of the research project will be focused on
developing the experimental techniques and acquiring the experience required for
reliable trace gas measurements as well as on developing the theoretical
modeling tools essential for the analysis of the measurements.
