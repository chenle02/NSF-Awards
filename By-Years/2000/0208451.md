For computers and robots to live up to their full potential as human assistants,
they must be able to reliably perceive humans and objects in their environment.
This project addresses the recognition of objects in complex everyday scenes
(e.g.\ office, household, or traffic scenes). Biological vision systems have
successfully solved the vision problem and the philosophy of this project is to
try to extract principles from the information processing in the primate visual
system and to apply them in the design of object recognition algorithms. The
goal is to understand how object recognition in complex environments can be
achieved in a hierarchical architecture that mimics the layout of the object
recognition pathway in the primate brain, and to build a demonstration system
capable of recognizing a large number of objects in complex everyday scenes. In
particular, this project will focus on three processing principles: hierarchical
representations, massive feedback, and active scene analysis. If successful, the
project will further our understanding of how objects can be recognized using
hierarchical view based object representations, how these representations can be
learned from unsegmented training images, and how feedback can aid recognition
in this kind of hierarchical recognition architecture. This will potentially
open a range of new application areas for computer vision systems and may also
lead to a better understanding of object recognition in the brain.
