This awards provides partial support for the Winter Conferences in Elementary
Particle Physics and Astrophysics; Aspen, Colorado; January 8-21, 1989. The
Elementary Particle Conference topics include a discussion on the physics of b
and t quarks, on new charmed quark results, on the latest results on CP-
violation in K decays, on B decays and theoretical work on CP-violation, and on
the experiments to describe them. The Astrophysics Conference topic is
observational constraints on Primordial and Early Galactic Nucleosynthesis and
includes a discussion on constraints from particle physics, from stellar and
galactic evolution, and cosmological models.
