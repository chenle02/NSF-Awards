The project is to gather information on pricing policies by interviewing a large
number of businesspeople responsible for pricing in many different types of
businesses and then to report the results in articles and a book. The objective
is to learn how prices are set and how they are adjusted when demand, costs, or
financial conditions change. The hope is to contribute to theories of
macroeconomics and industrial organization by providing knowledge of price
formation and of the microeconomic mechanisms linking inflation to the general
level of economic activity. I hope also to generate theoretical and empirical
hypotheses that could be tested using other kinds of information, and especially
quantitative data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
