This is an unsolicited proposal submitted by the University of Illinois to
maintain and enhance the data-base of the IEA Second International Mathematics
Study (SIMS) for the next two years. SIMS was a comprehensive survey of the
teaching and learning of mathematics in the secondary schools in 20 countries,
including the U.S. Under this grant, the University of Illinois plans to enhance
the utility of the data for research in a three- pronged effort, as follows: 1)
place the data-base in "user friendly" formats and fully document it; 2) conduct
training sessions on the use of the data-bases; and 3) convene a national
invitational research conference to identify issues raised by SIMS that may lead
to secondary analyses.
