This proposal seeks funds to purchase three Gamma ray spectrometers to be used
in the teaching of nuclear spectroscopy in the upper level undergraduate physics
laboratory courses. The spectrometers have a variety of detectors which will
permit student to understand the significance of energy and timing
characteristics of different detectors and methods of optimizing the equipment.
Overall, these meters will improve the quality of the upper level physics
courses.
