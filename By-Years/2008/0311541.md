New mechanism design issues, deeply rooted in algorithmic considerations,
&lt;br/&gt;have arisen with the Internet, since distribution of limited
resources &lt;br/&gt;among a large number of players with varying degrees of
collaborative and&lt;br/&gt;selfish motives is an important consideration in the
latter.&lt;br/&gt;Computational problems underlying solutions to&lt;br/&gt;these
issues, achieving desirable economic criteria, often turn&lt;br/&gt;out to be
\NP-hard. It is therefore natural to apply notions from&lt;br/&gt;the area of
approximation algorithms to these problems. The&lt;br/&gt;connection is made
more meaningful by the fact that the two areas of&lt;br/&gt;game theory and
approximation algorithms share common methodology&lt;br/&gt;-- both heavily use
machinery from the theory of linear programming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent
works of the PI include using approximate fixed point computations
&lt;br/&gt;and the primal-dual schema to give a profit-maximizing pricing
algorithm and &lt;br/&gt;a cost sharing method ensuring fairness and truth-
revealing for&lt;br/&gt;multicast routing. Besides applying these techniques to
other games,&lt;br/&gt;the PI would like to characterize cross-monotone methods
that&lt;br/&gt;form the equitable methods of Jani and Vazirani.&lt;br/&gt;
