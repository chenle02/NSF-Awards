The author will write a book that tells the story of ecologist Bill Fraser's
life and work by chronicling a season in the field with him at Palmer Station,
Antarctica. Using this narrative device--following the birding team from the
moment the Adelie penguins show up to nest in October until the last fledged
chicks head out to sea in late February--he hopes also to paint a portrait of a
dedicated field biologist, the breathtaking place at the heart of this
scientist's life's work, and the changes affecting the lives of creatures there
as a result of rapid warming. The end intent is to put a human, and animal, face
on a situation that has left many people resigned and perplexed--climate change.
What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity? The proposal describes
a tightly conceived concept based on extensive preliminary research. The
applicant is a Pulitzer Prize nominee with a strong background in writing about
science. The scientist to be featured in the proposed book has spent a lifetime
chronicling the population changes of a unique penguin species traced to the
effect of global warming. The proposed story serves as a narrative line on which
important science, philosophy, and environmental awareness are suspended. What
are the broader impacts of the proposed activity? The book is planned for a
popular audience, the author is well known and has a good writing style in the
nature writing tradition, and the subject and approach are interesting. With
book reviews and potential public appearances by the author, the project should
have a broad impact. With its planned narrative structure, it is likely to draw
in readers who initially have little to no interest in Antarctica or climate
change. Mr. Montaigne has a contract with a publisher to publish the book.
