This Americas Program award will support continuation of a long-term
collaborative study between Dr. Peter Feinsinger, Northern Arizona University,
and Dr. Fabian M. Jaksic, Universidad Catolica de Chile. The researcher's
previous work has shown that small mammal population varies greatly from year to
year whereas the abundance of large insects and other foods appear to be
seasonally determined. The primary objective of this research is to study the
responses of predator assemblages to this complex pattern of local variation in
prey densities. Based on the nature of long-term variation in the predators' use
of different habitat patches over the landscape, the researchers will propose
landscape-level conservation plans that will serve to buffer these predators
from future local shortages in their prey. This study is likely to yield
significant contributions to our knowledge of neotropical guild structure and
provide guidelines for the design of refuges and preserves that will maintain
populations of wide-ranging carnivores. This is an excellent collaboration in
which the areas of expertise of the researchers complement each other.
