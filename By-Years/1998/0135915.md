The National Research Council (NRC) through its Division on Engineering and
Physical Sciences, will conduct a study to assist the National Science
Foundation in the formulation of a comprehensive, long-term agenda for the
earthquake engineering research that fully utilizes the capabilities of the
George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES). This
effort will result in a report that articulates a dynamic, stakeholder-inclusive
process for determining research needs, identifies the principal issues in
earthquake engineering amenable to an integrated research approach that
incorporates analysis, computational modeling, simulation, and physical testing;
and assesses and comments on the possible roles of information and communication
technologies for collaborative on-site and remote research. It will produce a
long-term research plan based on short-, intermediate-, and long-term needs,
general program to address them, and the estimated costs and benefits of the
research program
