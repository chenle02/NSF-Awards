This project will compute efficiency bounds for a large class of semiparametric
discrete choice models. (These models relax some of the distributional
assumptions, which are not supported by economic theory, that occur in
traditional models of discrete choice.) Efficiency bounds provide benchmarks for
evaluating the performance of alternative statistical estimation strategies by
providing lower bounds on the variability of any estimate. It is expected that
the project will show that a large class of existing estimators are not
efficient relative to the benchmark bounds on estimator variance. The project
will identify strategies for improving upon the existing estimators through
exploitation of qualitative shape restrictions on the choice probabilities --
restrictions that are ignored by most existing methodologies. This project will
provide important guidance for future improvements in the econometric methods
available for analysis of discrete behavior.
