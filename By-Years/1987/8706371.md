The Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology cares for important
anthropological collections. One of these is theMecklenburg collection of Iron
Age materials (ca. 750 BC.AD 20). This collection consists of 18,900 objects, as
well as human and horse skeletal remains from 894 grave lots. This materials is
from several sites in Austria and Yugoslavia. The collection is enhanced by good
documentation and provenience information. It represents the largest collection
of Central European Iron Age artifacts in the United States. Unfortunately, the
collection is presently inaccessible to researchers because it has never been
properly catalogued and entered into the museum's catalogue system. Also the
objects are deteriorating and cannot be safely handled. With this grant, the
staff of the Peabody Museum will begin to upgrade the collection and make them
accessible to researchers. The collections will be catalogued by individual
object and the information integrated into the museum's computerized database
system. A conservation needs survey will be undertaken by a highly trained
conservator who will recommend treatment for the most unstable objects. This
will allow researchers to then use this significant collection and increase our
knowledge of early European societies and processes of social complexity.
