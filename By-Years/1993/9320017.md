9320017 Khatib The research studies concepts and methods for development of an
automated mobile robotic assistant to aid human workers in various aspects of
transporting, fixturing, and attaching or assembling heavy materials. The
project investigates the planning, sensing, perception, and control needed for
robots to work cooperatively with humans and other robots. In the first stage of
the research, a robot assistant will act as an amplifier for a human operator,
responding under guidance to lift and move heavy or awkward material. Next,
real-time 3D range and motion vision will be incorporated to extend the system's
capabilities with respect to obstacles and dynamic path considerations. Finally,
multiple assistants, each with vision, force sensing, and communication
capabilities, will work cooperatively and with the operator to handle more
difficult pieces, while continuing under human supervision. The results of this
research should be applicable to construction-site operations, heavy
manufacturing, and a variety of other applications involving heavy and/or
awkward-sized objects.
