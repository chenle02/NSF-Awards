The principal investigator will study the general problem of how geometric or
dynamic properties characterize negatively curved locally symmetric spaces.
Specifically, she will consider the relationship between time-preserving
geodesic flows on the unit tangent bundle, and constant curvature. She will also
work toward proving that if the metric and topological entropy of a geodesic
flow coincide, and the Riemannian metric is 1/4-pinched, then the manifold must
have constant curvature. Dr. Hamenstadt will teach a graduate course in the
geometry of manifolds of negative curvature; she will serve as an advisor for
the undergraduate honors mathematics society, Pi Mu Epsilon, and lecture in
departmental seminars. This project furthers VPW program objectives which are
(1) to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering
and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women to
pursue careers in science and engineering by providing greater visibility for
women scientists and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic
institutions. By encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a
valuable investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.
