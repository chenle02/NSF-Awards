This project develops the science of teaching engineering ethics by engaging
students as expert witnesses in a litigation role play experience. Standard
pedagogies expose students to broad ethical dilemmas that they may encounter in
their careers and provide valuable practice in ethical reasoning related to
these problems. Expert witness role plays have the potential to expand on this
base of knowledge to help students develop awareness and practical skills to
deal with the ethical challenges of maintaining scientific objectivity as an
expert witness in their specifica area of study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
intellectual merit of this research comes from extending an anecdotally
successful role play experience based on reconstructing a traffic crash by
developing five complete expert witness role plays and evaluating the efficacy
of this approach in two institutions using both formative and summative
evaluation techniques. The broader impact of this work includes developing a
framework to aid other educators in developing expert witness role plays on
additional engineering expert topics and disseminating the result of this
project on commonly used ethics web portals to incorporate expert witness role
plays in their own classrooms.
