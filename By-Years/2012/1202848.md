Doctoral Dissertation Research:&lt;br/&gt;Latinos and African Americans in the
New South&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This project examines the incorporation of
Latino/a migrants in the U.S. South, focusing on workplace intergroup dynamics
at a meatpacking plant. It includes participant observation of the interactions
of Latinos/as and African American workers as well as interviews with workers.
The project seeks to understand the dynamics of economic competition theories
and to see how intergroup relations figure into the incorporation of migrants,
and racial and ethnic relations. It will bridge and extend important theoretical
traditions that have so far developed in isolation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Findings will be of interest to a diverse audience including local and national
organizations working to facilitate Latino/a migrant incorporation and address
grievances between Latinos/as and African Americans at the community level.
Findings will also aid efforts to improve the working conditions of all workers,
given insights into the sources of conflict and opportunities for cooperation
between Latinos and African Americans.
