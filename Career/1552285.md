Topology is the study of the shape of different spaces. One- and two-dimensional
spaces are well-understood, as are dimensions five and above; roughly, in the
former, there are not enough dimensions for interesting phenomena, and in the
latter, there are so many dimensions that anything interesting has enough room
to become uninteresting. Low-dimensional topology focuses on three- and four-
dimensions, where many unique phenomena occur. One central question is whether a
knotted loop in three-dimensions becomes unknotted when one allows a fourth
dimension. One can also ask what happens upon cutting a knot out of space, and
then filling in the resulting void in a different way. Knot theory has
applications to the very small (e.g., the behavior of knotted strands of DNA) as
well as the extremely large (e.g., the shape of the universe). In tandem with
the research component, the PI plans to further her mentoring and outreach
efforts, for example, by supervising undergraduate and graduate research, and by
leading local math events for middle and high school students. She will also
organize a workshop for undergraduates to present their research and learn more
about careers in mathematics.

Heegaard Floer homology, developed by Ozsvath and Szabo, is a powerful tool for
understanding low-dimensional topology. The PI plans to use several recent
developments to provide answers to long-standing questions in the field. For
example, the recently defined involutive Heegaard Floer homology of Hendricks
and Manolescu may have applications to understanding divisibility in the
concordance group. In a different direction, the PI plans to study which
manifolds arise from surgery on an n-component link, using the link surgery
formula of Manolescu and Ozsvath. She also proposes to study homology cobordism,
which is closely related to knot concordance, with the hope of providing
obstructions to being homology cobordant to surgery on a knot.
