This project is a theoretical study of metastable liquids at temperatures and
pressures which are simultaneously lower than the triple point temperature and
pressure (sub-triple liquids): a stable liquid cannot exist below the triple
temperature. The proposed work consists of a computer simulation study of a
unique and previously unexplored rapid phase transition whereby a sub-triple
liquid relaxes to form an equilibrium vapour-solid mixture. The thermodynamics
and stability limits of sub-triple liquids are important to the understanding of
fluid transport in plants, where liquids are frequently under tension and below
their freezing point. The phenomenon of loss of tensile strength at low
temperatures (tensile instability) has very important consequences in the
general area of cavitation, and in any application where liquids close to their
freezing point are subject to tensile stresses (impeller blades, ship
propellers).
