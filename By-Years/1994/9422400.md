This research addresses the question of whether quality management and fast
product innovation represent a tradeoff, or whether quality practices can
enhance the speed of product innovation. Specific research propositions to be
investigated include 1) reduced development time and reduced ramp-up time
contribute to fast product innovation, 2) firms which pursue fast product
development in the absence of a well-established quality management initiative
will achieve inferior results, and 3) the use of overlapping product development
stages will lead to less design rework and faster product innovation. Both
exploratory and confirmatory research methods will be used. In the exploratory
phase, eight case studies will be developedusing structured interviews, site
tours, archival sources, and qualitative data analysis techniques. In the
confirmatory phase, themes, concepts, and relationships emerging from the
exploratory work will be tested using large-scale survey methods and
quantitative analysis techniques. Companies participating in this study include
Texas Instruments, Honeywell, Unisys, and Medtronic.
