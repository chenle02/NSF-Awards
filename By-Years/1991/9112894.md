This project supports the dissertation research of a cultural anthropologist
studying the nature of Turkish ethnic identity in North Cyprus. Two competing
alternatives, the "purely Turkish" and the "Cypriot" compete for the allegiance
of the population. The project will investigate how adherents of each position
redefine the critical period of history from Cypriot independence (1960) to the
division of the island into two separate ethnic communities (1974) to support
their political goals. Methods include the examination of archives of official
documents as well as in-depth interviews and participant observation. This
research is important because ethnic identity and contestation seems to be an
increasing feature of the modern world. Understanding how, and why similar
groups define themselves as different can help policy makers cope with the
resulting antagonisms.
