Plant seeds are the world's most important agricultural product and the lowest
cost biological source of carbohydrates, oils and proteins. An important goal of
plant metabolic engineering is to develop chemical and nutritional production
systems in seeds that are amenable to rational genetic engineering. To reach
this goal, a quantitative understanding of fluxes through biochemical pathways
is needed for seeds. This project will begin to provide such an understanding
through analysis and engineering of the accumulation of storage oils in Brassica
napus seeds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three central questions about oilseed
metabolism will be addressed: How do seeds cope with the CO2 generated during
oil synthesis? By what pathways does carbon flow from sucrose to oil and storage
proteins and how are these pathways influenced by availability of light? What is
the source of reductant for fatty acid biosynthesis? These problems are
interlinked by shared metabolic intermediates and pathways and the processes
they represent must be coordinately regulated during seed development.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will lead to a quantitative description of
metabolic networks in a major agricultural production system, and to improved
strategies for engineering changes in metabolism. The resulting progress in
understanding, modeling and engineering seed metabolism and the
interdisciplinary training of students and postdocs will help move plant
metabolic engineering from the current hit and miss state toward a framework of
rational design and analysis. This information will be crucial to expanding the
use of plants as green factories that provide renewable and sustainable
alternatives to petroleum and also aid nutritional improvements in the seeds
that provide most of the world's food. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
