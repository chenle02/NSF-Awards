Abstract DBI 9750190 Gregory M. Erickson This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral
Research Fellowship in Biosciences Related to the Environment for 1997. This
fellowship provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain additional scientific
training beyond the doctoral degree and to pursue innovative and imaginative
into the fundamental mechanisms underlying the interactions between organisms
and their environment at the molecular, cellular, organismal, population,
community and/or ecosystem level in any area of biology supported by the
Directorate for Biological Sciences of the National Science Foundation. Each
fellowship supports a research and training plan to be carried out in a
sponsoring laboratory. The research and training plan for this fellowship is
entitled "How bones of amphibious fish are modified for terrestrial locomotion
during evolutionary water-to-land transitions." The emergence of vertebrates
onto land was made possible by biomechanical modification of the appendicular
skeleton. The nature of such changes is being determined by testing the
biomechanical properties of bones from amphibious fish and their aquatic sister
taxa. The results are important for understanding how bone form and function are
regulated by mechanical demand during evolution.
