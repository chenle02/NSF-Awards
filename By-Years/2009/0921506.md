Sranan Tongo is the most widely spoken lingua franca in the multi-ethnic and
multi-lingual South American country of Surinam, but as a creole, it has been
stigmatized as a kind of "baby talk." Historically, Sranan is not only one of
the oldest but also one of the most divergent of the Caribbean English creoles.
This evolution is the ultimate outcome of an intriguing colonial history,
involving a swapping of colonies between the English and the Dutch, which led
English in Surinam to evolve under a complex web of influences, especially from
Dutch and several African languages.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;With support from the
National Science Foundation, Ms. Jacqueline Bunting will conduct fieldwork in
Paramaribo, Surinam's capital city, observing the language in its natural
ecology. Narratives, some specific constructions, and translations will be
elicited and recorded from native Sranan speakers in order to examine three
areas where Sranan syntactic structures diverge from their English counterparts:
case marking, comparative constructions, and serial verb constructions. These
materials will be analyzed in comparison with the relevant structures in
English, Dutch, Ewe, and Kikongo - all languages which bore heavily on the
emergence of Sranan as a creole - in order to develop a clearer understanding of
how the grammatical system of Sranan has evolved or been influenced by Dutch,
the Gbe family of West African languages (notably Ewe), or Kikongo. The results
of this dissertation research will bear on hypotheses about hybridization in
language evolution.
