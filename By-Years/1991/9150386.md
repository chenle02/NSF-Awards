The goal of the course being developed in this project is to integrate
mathematics-teaching and computer-learning into an applied science, meteorology.
The course includes both lecture (three credit hours) and lab (two credit hours)
sections for one semester. It is being offered to university students at the
freshman or sophomore level to fulfill natural science requirements.The recently
upgraded Meteorology Lab in the Atmospheric Sciences Program at UNCA as
supported by the National Science Foundation provides a high-tech environment
for students to archive, manipulate, display, and present satellite/radar
imagery and other weather information interactively. Three specialized
meteorological software packages (PC-McIDAS, The WXP, and UNAWIPS) allow
students to fully visualize the development and movement of weather
systems.Students have hands-on experience in lab sections and learn applications
of microcomputers in meteorology.This multidisciplinary course maintains its
integrity as meteorology and offers students practical training in mathematics
and computer literacy.
