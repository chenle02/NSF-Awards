Philip Reid of the University of Washington has received a CAREER award in the
Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study reaction dynamics of
environmentally important compounds. Reid will focus on condensed phase
reactions of halooxides and other halogenated species. Resonance Raman intensity
analysis or time-resolved Resonance Raman spectroscopy will be used to
investigate the reactivity from initial excited-state nuclear evolution to the
appearance of ground state photoproducts. The teaching program will involve the
creation of new courses and instructional tools to enhance the undergraduate
chemistry curriculum. Internet-based teaching methods and a new course in
physical chemistry for environmental scientists are being developed in response
to a recently created interdisciplinary program in environmental education.
Undergraduate and graduate students from the University of Washington will
participate in collaborative research at Pacific Northwest National
Laboratories.
