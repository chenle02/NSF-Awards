9550560 Fratiello The project will involve the application of multinuclear
magnectic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to two research programs. The instrument
to be utilized is a Bruker AM-400 MHz superconducting Fouier transform NMR
spectrometer, capable of high resolution and sensitivity for studying low
abundance nuclei, and equipped with accessories for the variable temperature,
two dimensional, and multinuclear experiments to be emphasized in these
programs. The research program titles and the nuclei to be studied are
"Lanthanide lon Complexation" (1H, 12C, 15N, 27Al, 31Cl, 8lBr, 89Y, 113Cd, 127l,
139La) and "Polyborane/Carbon Cluster Chemistry" (lH, llB, 13C, 19F, 31P). The
project will involve six to twelve students from minority groups
underrepresented in the sciences, specifically, African Americans, Hispanics,
and Native Americans, with the objective of preparing them for graduate school
and careers in science. Activities will include research training, as well as
seminars, and academic and career counseling. ***
