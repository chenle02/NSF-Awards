This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of California-Santa
Barbara to acquire an Applied Photophysics stopped-flow kinetics
spectrophotometer. Research projects to be carried out with these instruments
include: reductive nitrosation of ferriheme proteins, mechanisms of vanadium(V)
peroxo species relevant to the enzymatic bromoperoxidase activity, and the
characterization of intermediates in reactions of activated nitroarenes and
nitrogen heterocycles. The stopped-flow kinetics spectrophotometer is useful
when studying very fast chemical reactions. The stopped-flow method permits
mixing of two solutions in less than one (1) millisecond. This provides a
complete concentration-time record of the reactant solutions. The stopped-flow
method is especially useful when studying enzyme-catalyzed reactions and in
catalysis where the common need is rapid mixing for kinetic studies.
