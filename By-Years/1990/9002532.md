Multiple-interaction molecular dynamics simulation techniques will be used to
study: (1) nonlinear effects in ion-surface collisions, (2) cluster emission and
formation in sputtering, (3) problems related to surface sticking and film
growth, (4) isotopic effects in sputtering from layered targets, and (5) other
basic properties of collision cascades induced by low energy ions. This work
will be carried out at California State University, Fullerton (a predominantly
undergraduate institution), and in collaboration with the Basic and Applied
Science Group at Caltech and the Surface Physics Group at the National Institute
of Standards and Technology. Our aims are two-fold. Namely, to extend the
fundamental understanding of ion-surface collision phenomena, and to guide
future experimental work in this area.
