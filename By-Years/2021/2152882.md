The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to deliver an engaging, scalable, and
effective social emotional learning platform by integrating soft skills training
with major streaming media sites. By leveraging the reach and appeal of popular
streaming media platforms with the latest emotion and learning science, the
project may lead to improved academic performance, health, and quality of life
for America’s youth. The product seeks to benefit mental health professionals
and K-12 schools, with potential future areas of growth in corporate training
and social emotional skills certification &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small
Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to improve social and
emotional skills like emotional literacy, empathy, and resilience among
children, adolescents, and young adults at scale. The project aims to deliver a
solution that addresses some of the shortcomings of existing social emotional
learning (SEL) offerings, namely content quality and diversity. The technology
will do so through the development of a platform that integrates SEL directly
with major media streaming platforms using a browser extension technology. This
technology will make it possible to leverage the wide range of popular content
available on those platforms to build critical skills like empathy and emotion
regulation. The platform will be powered by a training engine based on
established emotion science principles to enable flexibility and
personalization. The platform will support user collaboration as well as
detailed performance analytics and will be designed to facilitate eventual
integration with streaming applications on mobile devices and smart televisions.
Efficacy studies will be conducted to evaluate the platform’s impact on social
emotional skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
