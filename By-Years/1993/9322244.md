9322244 JONES This is a request to continue an REU SITE at the Bermuda
Biological Station for Research. This program provides a three month intensive
immersion in marine science research during the fall (mid-September to mid-
December). Some of the students will be involved with projects related to the
U.S.JGOFS (Joint Global Ocean Flux Study), while others will focus on the links
between near shore processes and oceanic and atmospheric events. This allows
students to participate in large-scale interdisciplinary research programs as
they concentrate on the primary objective of doing original scientific research.
