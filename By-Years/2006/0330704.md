This award supports a summer school, that is a series of lectures and workshops,
on the general theme of SOLAS (Surface Ocean - Lower Atmosphere Study). The
SOLAS program (sponsored by IGBP/SCOR/CACGP - International Global
Biogeochemistry Program/Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research/Commission on
Atmospheric Chemistry and Global Pollution) is aimed at achieving a quantitative
understanding of key biogeochemical-physical interactions and feedbacks between
the ocean and the atmosphere, while understanding how this coupled system
affects and is affected by climate and environmental change. The SOLAS program
attempts to foster interdisciplinary and international collaborations in this
area. The 2003 Summer school will provide the opportunity for young researchers
interested in these science issues to learn about the various scientific aspects
of the field, meet one another and current leaders of the field, and develop the
basis for future collaborations. A distinguished and diverse group of scientists
has been recruited as lecturers. This project will be supported with
contributions from NSF, NASA, NOAA and ONR.
