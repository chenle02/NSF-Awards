Insight into the functioning of computer networks is of increasing importance
for many students. As an illustration of computer science, a relatively in-depth
treatment of the topic of computer networks is also an excellent alternative to
the more traditional, breadth-first approach. In this project, the department is
developing courseware that provides an introduction to computer networks, to be
used in an introductory computer science course for students who are not
planning on majoring in computer science. The courseware uses the World Wide Web
and consists of Hypertext mark-up language documents and a set of `executable
content` applications using the Java programming language. The Java applications
use interactive algorithm animation to illustrate key concepts. Highlighted
areas include CSMA/CD, Internet protocol routing, TCP error and flow control,
cryptography and secure sockets, domain name resolution, and Hypertext
telecommunications protocol. The role of each concept in the design of the Web
can serve as an organizing theme. With a focus on the key concepts and animated
applications, a significant understanding of this material is possible in a
course for nonmajors. The courseware is a major component of the primary course
for nonmajors. The audience of the course includes a broad range of students,
primarily undergraduates, but with some in-service teachers. Preservice teachers
and technology majors form a large fraction of the students. The importance of
understanding computer networks for our preservice and in-service teachers and
technology majors is a primary factor in the project design. The courseware can
be used in a computer classroom of networked PCs. One situation in which Java
applications may be used is in closed student laboratories.
