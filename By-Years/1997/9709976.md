9709976 Lo If price and quantity are the fundamental building blocks of any
theory of market transactions, the importance of trading volume in understanding
the behavior of financial markets is clear. However while many economic models
of financial markets have been developed to explain the behavior of prices -
predictability, variability, and information content- far less attention has
been devoted to explaining the behavior of trading volume. This project expands
our understanding of trading volume by developing well-articulated economic
models of asset prices and volume and empirically estimating them using recently
available daily volume data for individual securities from the University of
Chicago's Center for Research in Securities Prices (CRSP) from 1962 to 1996. ??
