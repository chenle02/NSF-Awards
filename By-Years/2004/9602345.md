Pac-Tec II: Pacific Technological Education Project The future of the United
States depends on our producing well-educated and talented science and
engineering technicians. However, student interest in technical fields has
declined; and students in traditionally underrepresented groups comprise 65
percent of the student population, continue to be severely underrepresented in
these fields. The Phase I of the Pac-TEC Project is a grassroots, collaborative
network of 24 faculty from eleven schools, from middle school grades through
university level. In Phase I of Pac-TEC , teachers are defining learning and
teaching styles and preferences typical of many people in the underrepresented
groups. From this definition, the project is building and testing solutions for
classroom teachers--teaching methods that are inclusive but that do not require
major changes in course content, but instead, revolutionize new teaching methods
within existing content. Phase II of Pac-TEC project is expanding the network of
participating teachers and other professionals who together focus on
disseminating working solutions. This project is also broadening its research,
establishing a center that coordinates and disseminates information, training
preservice teachers, presenting models for authentic student assessment tools,
and producing a second edition of its innovative manual with national
distribution.
