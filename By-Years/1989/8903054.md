This action is to support the refurbishing and the conversion to geotechnical
use of a government surplus centrifuge that has been obtained by the Civil
Engineering Department at Texas A&amp;M University. (Geotechnical centrifuges
are used for experimentation and testing of soil and rock). Laboratory space has
been dedicated to the installation of this facility, with space for sample
preparation and data collection and reduction. Geotechnical testing in a
centrifuge is second only to full scale testing for research, and as a means of
verifying theories and design calculations. It is particularly useful in civil
engineering, for which full scale experimentation is usually prohibitively
expensive. This facility at Texas A&amp;M University provides an important
contribution to the infrastructure needed to utilize the exceptional capability
for geotechnical centrifuge research and testing that is now becoming available
in the United States; especially with the large geotechnical centrifuges coming
on line at the University of California at Davis, the University of Colorado at
Boulder, and at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
