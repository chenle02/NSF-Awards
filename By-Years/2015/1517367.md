The ages of stars are notoriously difficult to determine, and our current
inability to measure stellar ages is severely limiting our progress in many
areas of astrophysics. For example, the age of a star is the age of its planets,
and we must know the age in order to evaluate the likelihood that a given planet
has conditions favorable to life. This work advances our understanding of
observable proxies for age, namely a star's rotation and magnetic activity, so
that we can eventually use these to obtain ages for stars less massive than the
Sun. It will also support a hands-on teacher-training program that seeds and
supports astronomy clubs at public schools around New York City.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The existence of an age-rotation-activity relation (ARAR)
has been known for 40 years now, generating hope that measurements of rotation
or activity could be used to obtain the ages of isolated field stars. This
project will improve the empirical calibration of the ARAR by using observations
of stars in open clusters. These stars' well-defined ages make them valuable
targets for measuring rotation periods and indicators of magnetic activity such
as H-alpha and X-ray luminosities. The goal of the project is to complete a
sensitive, unbiased survey of rotation and magnetic activity in the Hyades and
Praesepe, two key, nearby 600-Myr-old clusters. New observations will be used to
test the relationship between rotation and activity in a mass-independent
manner. This will help calibrate the low-mass ARAR beyond 100 Myr.
