The Organization for Tropical Studies, Inc., a consortium and Costa Rican
universities and research institutions, has operated the La Selva Biological
Stations in the Atlantic rainforest of Cost Rica since 1968. This project will
provide the critically important operational support for one of the world's
premier research and training sites in the wet tropics. High quality
laboratories and infrastructure, a state-of-the-art Geographic
Information/Database System, spectacular biodiversity, and a welcoming host
country have all contributed to La Selva's dramatic growth and success. Over 230
researchers and more than 50 university courses now use the station annually. La
Selva serves an unusually broad segment of the U.S. academic community, is
playing an increasingly important role in the development of science in Latin
America, and has become a world center for the study of tropical rain forests
and their associated altered ecosystems. As such, the station is a valuable
element of the United States' programs on biodiversity, global change and
international science.
