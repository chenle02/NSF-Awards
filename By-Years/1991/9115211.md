This project will develop a new observational approach to investigate water-
rock interaction in oceanic hydrothermal systems. The goal is to determine the
distribution of trace elements in hydrothermally altered rocks on a micron scale
using the ion microprobe at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Data for
primary/secondary mineral pairs and vein minerals will allow the evaluation of
how specific metamorphic reactions influence the composition of hydrothermal
fluids and altered oceanic crust.
