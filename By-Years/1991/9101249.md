This program addresses the challenge of increasing the enrollment of women and
minorities in graduate engineering study. The key aspects of this program are:
1) the active recruitment of minorities and women by visiting selected "target"
schools, and 2) a student oriented research program that contains social as well
as instructional aspects designed for successful integration of the participants
into an exciting research environment. Ten faculty members from the Department
of Chemical Engineering at Penn State have volunteered to support recruitment,
instruction, and research supervision. The projects offered span a wide range of
research, from plant tissue culture, to thermodynamics - held together by common
chemical engineering principles. REU participants are matched with projects
prior to selection to maximize mutual interests and capabilities. The
participants enroll for 3 credits of Chemical Engineering Undergraduate Research
during the summer semester. An instructional program at the beginning of the
program has been designed to give the students a quick start on research. To
stress the importance of communication, an introductory and final oral
presentation, as well as a final written report is required of each student.
