This is a research project to analyze an extensive set of high latitude
convection velocity measurements to examine how plasma flow in the polar regions
varies with magnetic activity and solar wind conditions. The measurements were
made primarily with an HF coherent scatter radar located at Goose Bay, Labrador,
over a six-year period. The data will be used to define the properties of the
convection that are characteristic of such factors as (1) the signs of the
interplanetary magnetic field components, (2) the relative magnitudes of the IMF
components, (3) season, (4) geomagnetic disturbance level, and (5) time
dependency. The outputs of this study will be of value to modelers of
magnetospheric and neutral atmosphere dynamics and help understand the coupling
mechanisms between the two.
