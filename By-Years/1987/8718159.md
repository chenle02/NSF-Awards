This award will support the participation of U.S. scientists in a seminar on the
"Mechanisms Regulating Initiation and Conduction of the Cardiac Impulse,"
organized by Professor Melvyn Lieberman of Duke University and Dr. David Gadsby
of Rockefeller University, together with Professor Akinori Noma of Kyushu
University, Japan. United States and Japanese participants will meet at the
National Institute for Physiological Sciences in Okazaki, Japan during April
1988. The seminar will focus on recent developments in electrophysiology and
biophysics which have advanced studies on understanding how the heart functions.
The major areas that will be examined are ion channel current, ion transport
systems, mechanisms of extracellular and intracellular regulatory signals, and
intercellular communication. Research in cardiac electrophysiology has
progressed considerably because of contributions from laboratories both in the
United States and Japan. Cooperative efforts between investigators in both
countries have led to the development of several technological and intellectual
breakthroughs. This seminar, by providing a forum for the exchange of current
research results and ideas, will promote continued cooperation and progress in
the field.
