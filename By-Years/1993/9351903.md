The laboratory contains a common thread that integrates the techniques used into
a cohesive unit. The Molecular Biology laboratory emphasizes isolation,
detection, cloning and sequencing a fragment of the >-galactosidase gene, the
expression of this gene in vitro, and the analysis of the protein product by gel
electrophoresis. Upon completion of the restructured labs, students have used
all the basic molecular protocols and have an increased appreciation of how a
series of these techniques are used in an overall molecular strategy designed to
study a specific gene.
