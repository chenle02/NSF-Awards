Non-specialists often have difficulty designing the features used to formulate
machine learning problems. This small grant for exploratory research will
explore the possibility of automating this "feature engineering" aspect of
machine learning problems. Specifically, this project will investigate the
feasibility of representing the background knowledge in a modern knowledge
representation language and then automatically (or semi-automatically) deriving
the relevant input features. The project will study two application problems
where there is extensive background knowledge but sparse training data: (a)
predicting future grasshopper infestations; and (b) understanding the spread of
West Nile virus. This research will provide a deeper understanding of the
process of feature engineering and help articulate an agenda for future
research.
