The PI of this Career Advancement Award/ROW is a young researcher with great
potential. She is dedicated to the study of the optical properties of glasses
and their applications. In addition, she is involved in III-IV compound
semiconductor technology and integrated optics. Her ideas along superlattice
disordering is particularly worthy of note and her expertise in X-ray analysis
(EXAFS) make her very much a prime candidate for this Career Advancement Award.
Her proximity to the many optically related projects at the Institute of Optics
and her strengths in both materials and optics also add substantially to the
potential success of her proposal. Moreover, she has had a fine career to date
with considerable experience with industry.
