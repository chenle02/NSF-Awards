This CPATH award supports a distinguished group of computer scientists to
develop, implement, and test a Field Guide for computing. The Field Guide
includes a body of content with deep insights to provide a scientific framework
for computing. The content is then tested by a collaborative partnership network
including the ACM Education Board, the Computer Science Teachers Association, CS
Unplugged, and LabRats. Implementation will occur in a wide variety of settings,
including the BASIS Middle School and High School in Tuscon, one of the top high
schools in the United States, and the Hartnell College, a 2 year college in
California. The project includes a large team of experts broken into 4 working
groups and distinguished scientific advisors. An external evaluator will measure
the effectiveness of the content and field guide to attain the project
goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project's long-range objective is to replace
current views of computing with a new understanding, that computing is great
domain of science, on par with the physical, life, and social sciences. This
project directly supports the three main CPATH goals. (1) It contributes to US
competitiveness by providing a scientific framework for computing, which will
advance technology development and attract many more bright students, including
more women and underrepresented groups. (2) It increases the number of students
developing computational thinking by offering new learning possibilities, for
undergraduates as well as for pre-college students. (3) It is transformative
because it brings forward a science framework for computing, which has not been
done before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. The project brings to the
fore an underappreciated side of&lt;br/&gt;Computing, that it is a great domain
of science based on sound scientific theories and first principles. The
ambitious project has amassed a stellar team of experts and organizational
partners that span broad sectors of computing and the computing pipeline. It
includes not only development of content, but deployment in real settings, and
concrete plans for sustainability. Computation science offer deep insights and
surprising predictions, and an experimental method to validate predictions and
make discoveries. This project has the potential to substantially impact the
fundamental nature of computing and its relationship to other disciplines and
the way in which computing is taught.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. By
reaching out from hard-core computer science to representatives of different age
groups, the project will find ways to convey the science message to many
generations. It will also provide solid grounding for other scientists to
interact with computer scientists as peers in the search for new discoveries.
