This project will incorporate a Fourier-transform nuclear magnetic resonance
spectrometer in the undergraduate curriculum for Chemistry majors, Biology
majors, Biochemistry majors, and premedical students at Whitman College. A new
NMR will fill a serious gap in the otherwise excellent instrumentation available
in this vigorous and growing science program. The existing continuous-wave NMR
spectrometer is over twenty years old, and replacement parts are unavailable.
The new instrument will permit a variety of additional experiments to be
accomplished, and it will introduce students to several of the modern NMR
techniques available. This instrument will also be used in Whitman's science
research program, which involves most of the science majors in continuing
research projects. These goals will all be accomplished in a highly cost-
effective manner, because the proposed instrument uses a modern permanent
magnet, avoiding the high purchase and operating costs, complexity, and
cryogenic cooling associated with superconducting NMR instruments.
