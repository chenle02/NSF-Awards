9732538&lt;br/&gt;Yamada&lt;br/&gt;This project is concerned with the
fundamental physics of magnetic reconnection in laboratory plasmas. The primary
goal is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the local and global
characteristics of the reconnection phenomenon and to compare the experimental
results with existing theory.
