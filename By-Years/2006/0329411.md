This proposal is a request for funds to help support scientists from both U.S.
and foreign institutions that otherwise could not afford to attend the IVth
International Symposium on LHC Physics and Detectors. The symposium will take
place from May 1-3, 2003 at Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois. This symposium takes
place every two years with the goals of discussing and evaluating the latest
experimental results relating to LHC physics and to foster and encourage the
exchange of ideas for LHC upgrades to the accelerators, experimental facilities,
detectors and computational techniques. The funds provided would be used to
expand the participation of young physicists and physicists from developing
nations.
