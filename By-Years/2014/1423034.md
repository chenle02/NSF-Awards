Processing and analysis of large data sets presents substantial computational
challenges. New computational models which distill the essence of computing over
massive data sets are needed to address the challenges. "Local computation
algorithm" (LCA) is a new computation model proposed by the PI and his
collaborators. LCAs are randomized algorithms computing required portion of the
output super-efficiently.

In this project, the PI aims to extend LCAs to new frontiers such as error
correction codes, matrix analysis, approximation algorithms. The PI also plans
to improve upon prior results by applying tools and techniques from other fields
such as Monte Carlo Markov chains, online and distributed algorithms, and local
graph partitioning.

The broader impacts of the project include mentoring of undergraduate and
graduate students from under-represented groups in theoretical computer science
and other computationally-oriented scientific fields.
