The "solvent like" characteristics of alumina under a variety of conditions will
be determined. Diagnostic Diels-Alder reactions will be evaluated with emphasis
on the stereochemical and rate consequences of carrying out reactions on
activated alumina. In addition to the investigation of cycloaddition processes,
the ability of alumina surfaces to enhance the acidity of hydrogen halides will
be evaluated by the spectroscopic analysis of protonated polycyclic aromatics.
By comparison of the behaviour of the cycloaddition and protonation reactions on
alumina with similar reactions in solution, solvent parameters will be assigned
to the surface of alumina as a function of the activation temperature. %%% This
grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of Professors R. A.
Pagni and G. W. Kabalka at the University of Tennessee. Alumina, a form of
aluminum oxide, is a porous solid which is widely used in the chemical industry,
both as a medium for chromatographic separations as well as a catalyst to
accelerate chemical processes. The studies will be directed to providing a
framework for defining the parameters which will enhance the utilization of
alumina as an effective catalyst for organic reactions, many of which have
important industrial applications. By determination of the solvent-like nature
of alumina, it is possible to learn how the properties of the surface can be
altered to maximize the yield of well defined chemical structures. This work
will provide the understanding required to efficiently make chemical structures
with specific architecture or "stereochemistry."
