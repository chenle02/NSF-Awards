The biological role of structural fluctuations in proteins has not been
established although their presence has been amply demonstrated. This is partly
due to uncertainty about the thermodynamic basis for the phenomenon.
Possibilities range from passage between defined conformational substrates, as
in the allosteric model for hemoglobin, to pure kinetic regulation of the
passage along the reaction coordinate of enzyme substrate complex. Dr. Rosenberg
will base the planned research on a physical model that he has developed for
these phenomena. The overall goal will be to test the validity of model and then
demonstrate its usefulness in explaining the possible function of structural
fluctuations in biological processes. He has selected sound experimental systems
using well- characterized proteins and tested analytical methodologies. A major
strength of this project is the diversity of methodologies (hydrogen-exchange,
fluorescence-quenching, thermal stability) being applied to the study of protein
motions.
