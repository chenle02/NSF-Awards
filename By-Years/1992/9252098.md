The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a Nitrogen/Dye Laser to revitalize and
improve physical chemistry laboratory. Physical chemistry students are
introduced to basic laser principles and the uses of the laser in experimental
physical chemistry. Specific experiments conducted by students include
luminescence quenching of ruthenium complexes in aqueous solution,
photochemistry of benzophenone, and the two photon absorption spectrum of
phenanthrene. In addition, undergraduate research projects make use of the
instrument for a variety of photochemical investigations.
