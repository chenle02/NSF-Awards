IBN: 9706830 PI: Peterson The bewildering complexity of the adult central
nervous system (CNS) arises through a precisely orchestrated set of events
during embryonic development. The subdivision of the CNS into distinct regions
early in development is a key part of this overall process. At early stages of
embryogenesis the CNS consists of four regions that are precursors to distinct
areas of the adult brain and spinal cord. The most anterior region, the
forebrain, gives rise to the retina, thalamus, hypothalamus, basal ganglia and
cerebral cortex. These areas arise from sub-regions of the embryonic forebrain:
the optic vesicles, the diencephalon and the telencephalon. Dr. Peterson is
interested in the question of how the sub-regions within the forebrain are
specified and how the early development of those sub-regions is regulated. A
novel approach that takes advantage of random mutagenesis is being used. Single
gene mutations can be isolated and analyzed for their effects on forebrain
development. The mutations will provide a valuable resource for identifying key
regulatory steps in forebrain development. Mutants that block the formation of
the telencephalon, for example, will provide information on how the development
of the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia is initiated and regulated.
