9300951 Fang This project is concerned with the development of analytical and
numerical techniques for the identification of parameters in nonlinear partial
differential equations which model semiconductor devices. A particular focus is
the quantitative relationship between measurements collected by nondestructive
testing techniques and the desired model parameters. This analysis will form the
basis for the development of effective numerical algorithms to be used for
identification of parameters directly from the measurements. It is anticipated
that such algorithms will have an immediate impact on parameter estimation in
semiconductor devices. In the semiconductor industry, there are newly developed
nondestructive testing techniques for detection of interior properties of
semiconductor devices that are not directly measurable. The relation between the
measurements collected by such techniques and the desired interior property is
not well understood quantitatively. In this project, the quantitative
relationship between the quantity that describes the interior property and the
measurements obtained will be explored. Such an analysis will allow the
semiconductor industry to better understand the practical aspects of
nondestructive testing techniques and hence provide information for improved
estimation of critical parameters in semiconductor devices. Based on this
analysis, computer programs will be developed that can be used to compute the
desired quantity directly from measured data. ***
