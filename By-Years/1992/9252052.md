The present project is designed to improve undergraduate psychology students'
research skills by introducing microcomputer research skills in the psychology
curriculum. The specific goal is to teach undergraduate students how to employ
microcomputers to increase their understanding of human mental behavior and
psychological research. The major instruments to achieve this goal are ten
Macintosh microcomputers and the software necessary to examine and understand
the complexities of human mental behavior. Students are taught how to use
microcomputers to answer research questions, specifically for the experimental
study of human learning and memory. This project integrates the psychology
curriculum, enabling students to link the statistical analysis of large data
bases, stimulus presentation and experimental design into the existing academic
framework.
