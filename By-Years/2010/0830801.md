Quantum information processing (QIP) uses quantum phenomena to perform
information-processing tasks that are difficult or impossible with classical
resources. These include communication protocols using quantum channels--for
example, photons through optical fibers--to transmit quantum or classical
information. In general, these quantum &lt;br/&gt;channels are noisy, causing
decoherence of the transmitted states. &lt;br/&gt;This decoherence is countered
by quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs), analogous to classical error
correction. These codes are constructed from classical models, but with a
certain restriction: the "dual-containing" constraint. The PI and collaborators
have generalized the most common "stabilizer" codes to include both standard
QECCs and entanglement-assisted QECCs
(EAQECCs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Entanglement is a property of quantum states
that are correlated more strongly than classically possible: classical
correlations cannot &lt;br/&gt;boost the rate of information transmission, but
entanglement can. &lt;br/&gt;Entanglement is a resource for protocols such as
teleportation and dense coding. In error correction, entanglement can either
boost the rate of information transmission or increase the number of correctable
errors. EAQECCs can be constructed from arbitrary classical linear codes, with
good classical codes yielding good EAQECCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
explores the properties of EAQECCs, their construction, and applications. The PI
will study classes of codes such as quantum Turbo codes, LDPC codes, and
convolutional codes, evaluate their performance, and determine the entanglement
that they require. He will combine entanglement assistance with other coding
ideas-- particularly operator codes--producing families of codes with a broad
range of properties for different applications. The PI will also study hybrid
codes for transmitting both classical and quantum information, and versions of
EAQECCs for continuous-variable systems.&lt;br/&gt;
