The "RNA Processing Meetings" will be held in 1988, 89 and 90 at Cold Spring
Harbor, Long Island, during the month of May. The organizers for the upcoming
meeting are Drs. Christine Guthrie, U of California (13), Michael Green, Harvard
and Alan Lambowitz. RNA processing is a dynamic and growing area of research.
The growth in the field is reflected in the attendance at the meeting which has
grown from + 30 in 1981 to + 374 in 1987. The rapid pace of development in part
has been, the excellent communication and critical evaluation of ideas and data
provided by these annual RNA processing meetings.
