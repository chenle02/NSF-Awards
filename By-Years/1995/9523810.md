A new type of All-Sky Imaging Fabry-Perot spectrometer developed at the
Geophysical Institute performs ground-based imaging of upper atmospheric wind
and temperature fields. The PI will use this instrument to explore small-scale
structures in thermospheric wind and temperature, particularly near auroral
arcs. In addition, the existing detector will be replaced with a CCD camera.
This will improve the instrument's sensitivity, so data can be obtained with
shorter exposures, reducing uncertainty due to advective smearing of the small-
scale features this project will examine.***
