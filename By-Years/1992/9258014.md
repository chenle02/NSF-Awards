An NYI award supports experimental studies and modeling of the fundamental
structure and properties of the type of lubricated contacts which are found in
magnetic recording and micromechanical systems. They are characterized by the
presence of very thin lubricant films and by the significant influence of
capillary forces on the friction behavior. The effects of time scale and surface
diffusion of lubricant on friction forces will be investigated as well as the
effects of surface topography and surface reactions on lubricant retention and
mobility. The effect of lubricant properties on the wear of the lubricant film
and the substrate will be evaluated also.
