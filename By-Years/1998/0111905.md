&lt;br/&gt; Many residents of Central Africa's forested Congo Basin rely on the
meat of wild animals as their primary source of dietary protein. As a result
over one million metric tons of antelope, monkeys, apes, elephants, pigs and
rodents are killed and eaten each year. As the human population is growing
rapidly, the threat to forest animals is severe. This research studies the
reasons why people eat bushmeat, testing the proposition that it is not
invariably a deeply-rooted cultural preference, but is subject to price
preferences. The researchers, including a human ecologist, a cultural
anthropologist and an economist will collaborate with local researchers in a
qualitative ethnographic study, household surveys of game consumption, and
experiments designed to parse out the effect of culture and economics in
consumption decisions. The research will provide the most detailed ethnographic
account of cultural attitudes towards and preferences for bushmeat consumption
in a tropical rain forest; will be the first to assess the response of bushmeat
consumption to changes in economic variables; will combine surveys and
experiments in an innovative methodology to estimate empirical variables, and
will provide a better understanding of the likely effectiveness of market-based
approaches to mitigating the adverse impact of bushmeat consumption. The
empirical results will be valuable to conservationists and policy makers as well
as contributing to the theoretical debate about the role of culture and
economics in behavior. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
