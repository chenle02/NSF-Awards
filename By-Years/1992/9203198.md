The PIs propose to operate the CEDAR Class-I Imaging System compiling a multi-
wavelength database containing sub-auroral phenomena. Topics the PIs will study
include: (1) investigation of the under-reported and poorly understood
temporal/spatial variabilities in Stabel Auroral Red arcs, (2) study of
ionospheric storms and field-aligned current signatures upon the sub-auroral
ionosphere, and (3) continuing development of a prototype imaging spectrograph
for use with a bare CCD detector.
