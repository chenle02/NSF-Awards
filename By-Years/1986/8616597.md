This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of separation science. The thrust of this experimental program is
the elaboration of linear solvation energy relationships as reliable predictors
of the effects of solvent on liquid-liquid and liquid-vapor separation processes
that are critically important in analytical gas-liquid chromatography and in
separations engineering. Specifically, the fundamental chemical factors
controlling the partitioning of solutes between gas and liquid phases will be
studied by head space gas chromatography. Solutes and solvents to be examined
have been selected to reflect a broad spectrum of solvatochromic parameters
including dipolarity, hydrogen bonding acidity, and basicity and the extent of
utilization of these solvents in analytical chromatography and technologically
relevant separations processes. These studies should provide a unifying and
fundamentally sound bridge between modern partition equilibrium theory and
commonly used empirical relationships and may provide a basis for the rational
selection of systems with which desired analytical and industrial-scale
separations could be achieved efficiently and economically.
