High resolution mass spectrometers are increasingly important in chemical
analysis. More specifically, an LC QTOF can provide accurate mass determination,
characterization of small molecules and identification of proteins and peptides.
This broad array of functionality is ideally suited to the requirements of the
UWSP chemistry department. In this proposal, 7 different research projects are
described that require high resolution mass spectrometric instrumentation. All
of these projects are currently funded by either external or internal granting
agencies. A high resolution QTOF instrument will also be used in upper-level
chemistry and biochemistry courses. Students will have multiple hands-on
opportunities with the QTOF instrument in both teaching and research
laboratories. This experience will immediately prepare the students for research
opportunities at UWSP and ultimately prepare them for graduate and professional
careers.

UWSP offers Bachelor's degrees in Chemistry. In 2006, for the first time, the
Chemistry department began a Biochemistry major also. It is the Chemistry
department's long term goal to improve student's educational experience through
hands on laboratory experiences as well as faculty guided undergraduate
research. Modern instrumentation is mandatory to achieve our commitment to our
students and community. A high resolution QTOF instrument would be an important
part of that commitment. The QTOF will be used in Sophomore, Junior and Senior
level chemistry classes that will provide practical experiences for the
students. Many of these students go on to individual research projects at UWSP.
In addition, because high resolution mass spectrometry is so prevalent in
chemical and biochemical applications and our students will have multiple
opportunities to use the QTOF, our graduates will be well prepared to enter
graduate or professional careers. Knowledge gained from the research supported b
