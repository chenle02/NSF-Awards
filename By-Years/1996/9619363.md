ECS-9619363 Tao This proposal describes a university-industry collaborative
research project to explore a new area of adaptive control: adaptive control of
sandwich nonlinear systems, and to solve some long-standing and wide-range
control problems of urgent relevance to theory as well as applications. The
proposed research will focus on adaptive control of sandwich systems with linear
and nonsmooth nonlinear dynamics and on adaptive control of two-layer systems
with smooth and nonsmooth nonlinear dynamics. Typical nonsmooth nonlinear
characteristics are dead-zone, backlash, hysteresis, other piecewise-linearities
as well as frictions which are the main sources of component imperfections in
control systems. The proposed adaptive inverse control approach employs an
adaptive inverse to cancel the nonlinearity effects in order to achieve system
performance improvements. This approach points to a new direction to design
control systems using a new algorithm-based technology, which, after a period of
learning or adaptation, can recognize component imperfections and compensate for
their harmful effects. With such adaptive controllers, the component
specifications could be greatly relaxed, their cost reduced, and their
reliability increased. The results of this research will advance the knowledge
of adaptive control significantly, provide new tools to effectively handle
practical nonlinearities which have haunted the constructors of control systems
for many years, and have many applications in defense and civil industries in
which high-precision control systems are vital components. A-1
