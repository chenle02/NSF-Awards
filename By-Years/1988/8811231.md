Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules,and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectroscopy is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research and educating students who
will become the next generation of chemists. The Department of Chemistry at
Colgate University will use this RUI award from the Chemistry Shared
Instrumentation Program to help acquire a high-field NMR spectrometer. The
acquisition will enhance the ability of the Department to educate undergraduate
students and will enhance chemical research in the following areas: 1)
Thermodynamic studies of metal-carbon bond formation in rhodium porphyrin
compounds 2) Structural characterization and dynamics of organotin complexes 3)
Gas phase kinetics of deuterated small cyclic hydrocarbons 4) Stereo- and
regiochemical characterization of intermediates in the synthesis of echinosporin
5) Kinetic studies on mammalian carbonic anhydrases 6) Stereochemical
characterization of rhodium-multidentate amine complexes.
