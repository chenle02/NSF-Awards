This request is for funds to purchase a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager for
use in research and teaching in molecular biology. This instrument will be
critical for research applications of at least eight faculty as well as in
training undergraduate and graduate students in molecular biology.
Autoradiography using storage phosphor technology offers several advantages over
traditional detection methods. Quantitation of amounts of radioactive protein or
DNA on gels or filters has traditionally been done using X- ray film and
densitometry or using scintillation counters. Storage phosphors are up to 100
times more sensitive than X-ray film, enabling measurements well below levels of
detection for film. Also, screens are quantitatively accurate over five orders
of magnitude as compared to X-ray film which has a linear range over only two
orders of magnitude. The new technology is also environmentally advantageous
because it eliminates the heavy metal waste disposal problems associated with
film processing, and when it replaces scintillation counting it reduces mixed
organic and radiochemical waste disposal problems. This technology will enable
new experimental approaches, improve quantitation, enhance productivity, and it
will afford our students state of the art training.
