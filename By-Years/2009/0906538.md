This award will support the participation of US-based mathematicians, especially
women, graduate students, postdocs, and young faculty, in "Dynamical Systems II,
Denton 2009," a conference that will be held at the University of North Texas
from May 17-23, 2009. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference has four major
scientific themes: holomorphic dynamics; continued fractions, dynamics, and
number theory; random dynamical systems; hyperbolic dynamical systems and
transfer operators. The format of the conference is such that young people will
have ample opportunities to speak.
