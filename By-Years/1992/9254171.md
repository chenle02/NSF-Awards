The "non-majors" biology laboratory course has been substantially revised at
Baylor University to include activities shown by recent research to be
effective. Methods including cooperative learning, inquiry-based instruction,
and emphasis on critical thinking and writing have been successful, but problems
remain. Interdisciplinary studies, expanded biology experiences, training of
teaching assistants, feedback on writing assignments, sensitivity to ethnic and
gender differences in learning styles, and structure of the teaching laboratory
are all topics that have been identified for further study and improvement. The
National Science Foundation grant will support interdisciplinary workgroups to
address these problems and to recruit and support exceptional science graduate
students who are interested in teaching. Baylor has committed funds for
renovation of the laboratory, and a separate grant or corporate partnership will
be solicited to improve technology. This innovative curriculum for undergraduate
bioliteracy instruction and an intensive program for training of teaching
assistants will serve as models for introductory biology education at
comprehensive research universities and colleges.
