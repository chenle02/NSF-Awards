The PI proposes that a major consequence of the calcium rise at fertilization
in the sea urchin isthe activation of the calmodulin dependend enzyme, NAD
kinase, which produces NADP. The calcium rise also activates Glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase, with the result that the NADP is rapidly reduced to NADPH. The
resultant increase in the NADPH/NADP ratio then shifts the redox poise of the
cell to favor reduction which has consequences for protein synthesis activation.
Other regulatory changes emanate from the calcuim rise. The specific goals of
the proposed research are to 1) affirm or negate the role of the NADPH change in
regulating protein synthesis in vivo and 2) determine whether the NADPH/NADP
ratio change is, in addition, acting through alteration of protein disulphide
groups, as through a thioredoxin or other protein oxidoreductase system.
