An electron energy loss spectrometer (EELS) is being added to an existing
ultrahigh vacuum system. It will be used to test the applicability of some
important principles from coordination chemistry to the reactions of olefins and
amines on heterogeneous catalysts. This will contribute to a major effort to
develop a conceptual framework that would permit prediction of chemical
reactions on catalyst surfaces.
