The establishment and maintenance of embryonic determination and differential
patterns of gene expression is essential for normal animal development. In
Drosophila embryonic determination is, at least in part, under the control of
the selector genes of the bithorax and Antennapedia complexes. I have been
studying a genetic region, referred to as the PAS-R, that contains a number of
related genes. The proper function of these genes is essential for normal
development and it appears to be required for the proper regulation of selector
genes. This proposal consists of a molecular and developmental genetic analysis
of the PAS-R. I propose to use classical genetics, in vitro mutagenesis, and
germ line transformation to rigorously identify individual proteins and RNAs
with functional genes. I will sequence cDNA clones derived from these genes to
determine the amino acid sequences of the proteins they encode. This may tell us
something about their function, and is valuable information for making antibody
probes for the proteins. I propose to use both developmental and molecular
approaches to identify genes whose regulation requires the presence of PAS-R
gene products. Experimental systems will be developed that will enable us to
study this regulation, and to identify functional domains of PAS-R proteins and
target recognition sequences. The orchestration of gene expression which results
in the development of an adult is still largely not understood. Insight into the
function of genes such as those found in the PAS-R region which are thought to
regulate the expression of genes known to be developmentally essential should
result from this study.
