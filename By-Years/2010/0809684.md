In this proposal, the molecular level crystallization and phase transformation
phenomena of assorted uric acid phases will be investigated. Uric acid is known
to precipitate under physiological conditions in its protonated state as either
an anhydrous material (UA) or as a less stable dihydrate (UAD), and as a number
of different urate salts, including monosodium urate monohydrate (MSU) and
ammonium acid urate (AAU). The studies proposed address the following four
specific aims: (1) To elucidate molecular-level changes in the UA surface
topology and step kinetics when growth occurs in the presence of impurities
(e.g., molecular dye probes and model urine components) with in situ atomic
force microscopy (AFM), (2) To establish baseline growth kinetics and mechanisms
on UAD and MSU single crystal surfaces in model solutions as a function of
fundamental solution parameters such as pH, super-saturation, and temperature
using in situ AFM, (3) To study the phase transformation of metastable UAD and
UA both in air and in solution, and, in doing so, elucidate the effects of
particle size, shape, temperature, pH, impurity composition and concentration on
this process, and (4) To explore hydrothermal methods as a means to map out the
conditions (e.g., pH, temperature, cooling rate) under which uric acid phases
grow individually or simultaneously and to generate diffraction quality crystals
of AAU as well as other metal-urate complexes. The insights gained from the
proposed studies will help to elucidate pathological crystallization events in a
direct sense and molecular crystal growth processes in general. &lt;br/&gt;This
research program provides solid interdisciplinary training for PhD students and
an excellent opportunity for undergraduates and high school students to gain
experience with research methods. Educational impact will also be realized in
the ongoing development of lectures/exercises which are used in graduate and
undergraduate professional development workshops.
