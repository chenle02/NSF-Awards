ABSTRACT DMS - 0203434.

Frank Morgan will study minimal structures in singular universes: with conical
singularities or with Lipschitz metrics, for example. He will also study
mathematical models for soap bubbles clusters and immiscible fluids "with
multiplicities," following work of Fleming and White. Methods include standard
and innovative applications of geometric measure theory, differentiable
geometry, differential equations, and techniques from the proof of the Double
Bubble Conjecture. He will supervise related undergraduate research, especially
on variations on the double bubble problem in various ambients and settings.

The guiding principle of nature seems to be energy minimization, from the
microstructure of materials to black holes in the universe. As one of the
simplest examples, soap bubble clusters seek to minimize surface area. If
successful, Morgan's study of such problems will enhance our understanding of
fundamental physical principles, with implications for the structure of
materials and the universe.
