This research will cover two major topics, inference problems when data are
corrupted by errors of measurement and inequalities for martingale type
sequences of random variables. The first topic focusses primarily on
instrumental variable estimation in generalized linear and nonlinear measurement
error regression models. Inference methods to be studied include maximum
likelihood, conditional likelihood and quasilikelihood estimation based on
approximate data models. The second topic involves comparison methods for
tangent sequences of martingale differences. Special attention will be given to
problems involving domination of martingales by martingales with conditionally
independent increments. Specific topics to be investigated include norm
inequalities, exponential inequalities and stability properties for martingale
type sequences. This research is focussed on two different topics. The first
area involves problems of inference and data analysis when data are not measured
precisely. The second topic is concerned with comparison methods for sums of
random variables. These methods provide a better understanding of modern
probability theory.
