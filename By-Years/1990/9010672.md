This project explores methods for improving the performance of parallel
discrete-event simulation by combining features of both conservative and
optimistic synchronization strategies. Rather than attempting to avoid rollback,
which is accomplished by slowing down the fastest components of the simulation,
the strategy is to avoid state checkpointing, which should speed up the slowest
components. The project is experimental in nature. A single implementation will
allow one to make fair comparisons between the performance of pure conservative
synchronization, and a hybrid method. Furthermore, by adding a mechanism for
limiting the degree of optimism in both the pure optimistic and the hybrid
cases, it will be possible to verify or refute the hypothesis that the overhead
of optimistic rollback is a second-order effect compared to the overhead of
state checkpointing. Subject to the successful verification of this hypothesis,
this research will continue with heuristics for dynamically adapting the degree
of optimism in a simulation during its execution.
