This is a Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award. The research
component will employ eye tracking and other means to infer the cognitive
processes of people engaged in particular tasks, and will develop a
computational framework, called mind-tracking architecture, for mapping observed
actions to the unobserved thoughts that produce them. This work will draw upon
existing psychology and engineering research and synthesize these efforts into a
unified methodology. The project will employ two frameworks at different levels
to achieve mind tracking: the production-system architecture ACT-R and cognitive
grammars that represent behavior as rules from intentions to actions. Three
specific application areas will motivate, demonstrate, and test the methodology:
intelligent tutoring, automobile driver assistance, and assistive technology for
the disabled. The educational component will develop a new human-computer
interaction curriculum and an outreach program to foster communication among
students, researchers and industry professionals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
CAREER award recognizes and supports the early career-development activities of
a teacher-scholar who is likely to become an academic leader of the twenty-first
century. Each of the three application areas has the potential for significant
benefit to members of the general public: students, drivers, and the
disabled.&lt;br/&gt;
