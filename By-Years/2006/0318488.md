0318488&lt;br/&gt;Kavner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support for this grant will allow
a new assistant Professor at UCLA (Abby Kavner) to develop a first-class high
pressure mineral physics/experimental petrology laboratory focused on studies of
earth materials at extreme temperatures and pressures in the diamond anvil cell
(DAC). Equipment to be purchased includes a laser that will be used with an
existing laser to build a dual-sided laser heating system for DAC experiments, a
CCD camera, spectrometer and optical components to develop a 2-D radial
temperature measurement system capable of making precision measurements of in
situ temperature gradients in the DAC, and a Raman spectroscopy system to assist
in pressure measurements and in characterizing materials both in situ and after
quenching. This laboratory will support the PI's and student research on
possible electrochemical reactions at the Earth's core-mantle boundary. The
facility will also support collaborative research with mineral physicists
nationwide through associations developed within the Consortium for Materials
Properties Research in the Earth Sciences (COMPRES).
