9511698 Goldstein This is a proposal for two workshop/conferences leading to a
book on Domestic Politics and International Law. The conferences will explore
the inherent links between domestic politics and international law in an era
which nations have agreed to more binding international commitments and rules
far more than could be predicted in the Hobbesian state of nature that
supposedly characterizes international relations. The objective of the
conferences will be to bring together under a common social science methodology
to try to enhance systematic understanding of the legalization going on in
international politics. The conferences will involve up to 20 scholars from
around the United States. The first conference will be exploratory. The second
will apply a rigorous research design to book chapter/papers written to the
conference theme. **** Oh +' 0 $ H l D h R:\WWUSER\TE MPLATE\NORMAL.DOT S u m m
