The principal investigators will establish a manufacturing research,
development and implementation organization to perform basic research, advanced
development and pilot scale implementation of new materials processing
technology in cooperation with and with the support of United States industry.
The work includes the establishment of a multi-investigator organization which
is supported jointly by government and industry. The initial focus of the
research will be on materials and manufacturing process innovations for rapid
response manufacturing with enhanced performance and reduced cost. Specific
activities will include the development of implementable manufacturing
technologies in the areas of adaptive sheet metal forming, three- dimensional
printing, high rate material removal via three- dimensional laser machining,
microcellular plastics processing and metal matrix composites processing.
