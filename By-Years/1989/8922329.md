This award will support in part the 1990 Aspen Winter Elementary Particle
Physics Conference; Aspen, Colorado; January 14-20, 1990. This conference is
devoted on collider physics. Results from hadron colliders at Fermilab and CERN
will be discussed as well as the results from the initial run of the new
electron-positron colliders at SLC (Stanford) and LEP (CERN). Among others,
sessions will cover the properties of the Z and W bosons, search for the top
quark and prospects for development of new facilities for collider physics.
