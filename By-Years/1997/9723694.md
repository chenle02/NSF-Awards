9723694 Russu The research will address the question of intramolecular
recognition in triple helix formation by mapping the energetics and dynamics of
DNA triple helical structures at the level of individual bases. The five DNA
triple helices proposed for investigation contain canonical as well as
noncanonical base triplets. The structural free energies that stabilize each
base in its closed, hydrogen-bonded conformation in the DNA triple helices of
interest will be obtained by measuring the thermodynamics and kinetics of
opening of individual base pairs using proton exchange and NMR spectroscopy.
These parameters will define the stability of individual Hoogsteen base pairs
within canonical and noncanonical base triplets, the energetics perturbations of
Watson-Crick base pairs in duplex DNA resulting from triple helix formation, and
the influence of noncanonical base triplets upon the stability of other triplets
in the structures. The resolution of the energetic maps of the DNA triple
helices of interest will be enhanced by labeling the molecules with 15N at sites
involved in triple helix formation. The isotopic labeling will allow novel
heteronuclear 1H - 15N methods to be used to probe conformational fluctuations
at these sites, and to correlate them with local stability in the triple helical
structures of DNA. Triple helices are alternative DNA structures that involve
recognition of base sequences in the double helix by a third strand of DNA
oligonucleotide. This recognition reaction has an outstanding base sequence
specificity, and thus allows triple helical structures to participate in
selective control of gene expression and in chemical modification reactions of
the genetic material targeted at specific sites. The molecular mechanisms by
which this high degree of specificity is achieved represents a fundamental
question in understanding the biological functions of these DNA structures. ***
