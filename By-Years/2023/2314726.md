This project investigates the interconnected role of amenities, residential
preferences, mortgage lending practices, and real estate advertisements in
neighborhood change processes. In this project, the researchers analyze how the
language used in real estate advertisement text has evolved over time and varies
by the race and income of anticipated neighborhood mortgage applicants. The use
of real-time real estate listings at a point-level spatial resolution offers the
potential to predict changes before they become too entrenched, enabling public
policies to adapt timely. Finally, the project promotes public engagement and
the use of science and technology in public policy by developing an online
textbook for integrating natural language processing (NLP) in spatial analyses
and by teaching K-12 girls enrolled in a STEM Camp about NLP methods and
applications.

Housing market professionals, including realtors and mortgage lenders, have
played a significant role in shaping neighborhoods by aiding in establishing and
maintaining observed patterns of racial and income segregation across US cities.
This project uses a combination of novel, theory-guided NLP, machine learning,
and classic statistical methods to predict the racial and income composition of
anticipated mortgage applicants in a neighborhood over time-based on the words
used in property advertisements. It also investigates trends in mortgage denial
rates as advertised housing and neighborhood amenities have shifted. Finally,
the project develops new methodological approaches for examining housing
dynamics at a fine spatial and temporal resolution.
