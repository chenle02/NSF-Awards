The proposed research will play an important role in the development of a
fundamental understanding of transition metal catalysts. In these studies, the
results would be related to understanding how to produce functionalized organic
substrates for use as chemicals. There are three objectives for this project.
The first will prepare a series of transition metal hydrido-phosphine compounds
which possess a cyclopentadiene-"dangling" phosphine ligand. This ligand will
enable the metal to interact with a second metal center and form dimers by using
the "dangling" phosphine as a two electron donor. Metals included in the study
are Mo and W. Once the above compounds are prepared, the compounds will be
reacted with a series of likely partner complexes. The dimers formed should be
able to react similarly to related monomeric compounds. Properties of the likely
partners are the ability to: insert into C-H bonds, coordinate CO and/or carbon
dioxide and form molecular hydrogen compounds. The heterobimetallic dimers
formed will be investigated for the change in the reactivity in relation to the
number of hydride ligands. The number of hydride ligands can be controlled in
two ways. The first involves the choice of starting compounds. The second will
involve the reactions of the bimetallic dimers with either an acid or a base.
