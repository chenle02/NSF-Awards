This research is planned to determine eolian input fluxes of Cd, T1, and Pb
into the North Atlantic by analysing the metals in rain and air. Fluxes and
sources of these dissimilar elements will be determined from deposition on
plates over measured time intervals and analysis of their isotopes. Input and
sedimentation fluxes derived from this study should provide a basis for the
development of improved models for present and past cycling of these metals in
the oceans.
