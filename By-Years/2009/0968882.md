Research in algebraic geometry is concerned with the solution sets to systems of
algebraic equations, and it offers tools and models for non-linear problems
across the mathematical spectrum. It now has numerous applications in the
sciences and in engineering. This project is aimed at four specific directions:
Spectrahedra and Orbitopes, Algebraic Statistics, Tropical Geometry, and
Implicitization of Higher-Dimensional Varieties.

Spectrahedra and Orbitopes are fundamental objects in convex algebraic geometry,
an emerging interdisciplinary direction that focuses on convex bodies with a
distinguished algebraic representation. It is driven by applications in convex
optimization, especially in the theory of semidefinite programming. The project
will cement the development of convex algebraic geometry, and it will lead to
new semi-numerical algorithms for non-linear optimization problems with a
special algebraic structure. Such problems arise frequently in Algebraic
Statistics. That area is concerned with statistical models that can be
represented by polynomials in the model parameters. These include graphical
models for both Gaussian and discrete random variables. The project will resolve
fundamental questions concerning these models, and it promises novel
computational tools for statistical inference. Tropical Geometry is a piecewise-
linear version of algebraic geometry that is custom-taylored for modeling
applied problems. The project is aimed at key open problems on the combinatorial
side of the field. Implicitization in Higher Dimensions is a new paradigm for
computer algebra, and it will lead to new tools for finding the defining
equations of parametrically specified algebraic varieties.
