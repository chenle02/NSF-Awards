A central concept in evolution is the escalation of biotic interaction over
geologic time. Among the most testable of escalation hypotheses is the
"bulldozing hypothesis:" accelerating bioturbation caused a commensurate decline
of non- locomotive taxa living on unconsolidated substrata. The changing
intensity of bioturbation can change the rock record, altering taphonomy,
sedimentology and stratigraphic resolution. PI will test the bulldozing
hypothesis for a critical interval of geologic time. Data covers 7 time
intervals (formations) and 3 shelf environments. PI will gather quantitative
data on lighology, ichnology and body fossils from >1200 samples via bed by bed
logging of 400-500 m of Silurian and Devonian carbonates and siliciclastics in
New York and Pennsylvania during 6 person-months of field work. The interval
(Wenlockian-Eifelian) spans some 40 million years, during which preliminary work
indicates that ecologically significant bioturbation first affected the
Appalachian Basin. This is the first study to test the association between
bioturbation and vulnerable body fossils. These data will also document cross-
shelf environmental trends of bioturbation during the study interval.
