*** Grusky and Weeden 9711510 Social inequality in industrial society is
generated by three processes: the differentiation of positions in the division
of labor, the matching of positions to rewards, and the allocation of
individuals to positions. Scholars of occupations explore the first component,
stratification research examines the third, but the second has received little
recent sociological attention. To address this gap in our knowledge, this
dissertation project will analyze cross-sectional data at three points in time
to separate the effects of occupational closure (or the ability of an occupation
to limit membership, through professional associations, licensing, unionization
or credential requirements) from the effects of human capital characteristics of
occupation members (including education, experience, gender, and race). ***
