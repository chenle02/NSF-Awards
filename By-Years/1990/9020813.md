A program of proposed measurements on electron - electron correlations will be
carried out using a unique ion - atom collision apparatus. The experiments will
include the first measurement of differential cross-sections for excitation,
elastic scattering, and charge transfer for alpha particle - atomic hydrogen
collisions in the energy range up to 300KeV.
