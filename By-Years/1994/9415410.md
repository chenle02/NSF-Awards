Computer systems of the future may consist of thousands or even millions of
processors. Inevitably some of the processors will fail. Faulty processors need
to be repaired so that the system on continue functioning. The goal of this
project is to investigate improvements to the existing algorithms for parallel
fault diagnosis. Second, and more importantly, the project will develop dynamic
models for fault diagnosis that are more realistic than previous models.
