9350636 Tang This project addresses undergraduate instruction in areas of
control systems and engineering. Control system courses are currently taught in
a traditional lecture oriented fashion as in many other universities. Even
simple systems can appear abstract and daunting when described only in
mathematical terms. The project changes this situation by developing experiments
and demonstrations to help students comprehend theoretical concepts and gain
experience. The project involves implementation of motor servo and temperature
control equipment in analog control systems, digital control systems, and power
system courses. Equipment includes a Complete Modular Servo, and a Three-Term
Temperature Control. Other ancillary equipment such as a 386-type computer, a
data interface board, and analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters are
also included. This equipment is used by the students for various experiments
including time and frequency response analysis, steady-state error analysis,
stability analysis, and controller design, and for their semester-long design
project, giving them hands-on experience in solving realistic problems, and thus
bridging the gap between theoretical studies and the application of these
theories to practical systems.
