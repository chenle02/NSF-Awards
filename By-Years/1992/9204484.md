Shelstad will continue her work on twisted endoscopy for reductive groups. This
is a part of the theory of automorphic forms which she has been instrumental in
developing, and is based on the general representation theory of reductive Lie
groups. It is also planned to develop Igusa theory for orbital integrals on real
groups. The goal is to obtain results useful for multiplicity formulas for
automorphic representations. The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the
Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in
twentieth century mathematics. As the mathematical vehicle for exploiting the
symmetries inherent in a system, the representation theory of Lie groups has had
a profound impact upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number
theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum mechanics and
elementary particle physics.
