9731960 Schadler The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) will establish a
Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site in materials science and
engineering. Undergraduate students will be recruited from universities and
colleges with strong engineering and science programs, including women's
colleges and Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Students will
participate in a wide range of materials research, from the stability of thermal
barrier coatings to the synthesis of nanostructured materials; the underlying
common theme is structure-property relationships. %%% A goal of this REU program
is to expose the students to application of their fundamental work to solve an
engineering problem. For this, the students will spend a portion of their time
at a local industrial site. The multidisciplinary nature of the research
projects and close liaison with industry associates will provide a valuable
experience to the undergraduate students participating in the program ***
