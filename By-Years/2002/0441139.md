Abstract&lt;br/&gt;After more than seventeen years of civil war, Lebanon
embarked in the mid 1990s on a new era of reconstruction and rehabilitation. In
its drive towards re-normalization it has earmarked a spending level of over $12
billion for reconstruction, upgrading, and renovation of almost every aspect of
its infrastructure systems: building structures, bridges, transportation
systems, sewer and water supply lines, electrical power plants, communication
lines, sea-ports and tourist facilities.&lt;br/&gt;The Workshop is organized on
the premise that the exchange of existing American and foreign experience in the
area of civil engineering infrastructure system is beneficial for both parties.
The workshop will focus on the high performance materials, monitoring, and
management. The development of high performance materials can perhaps be
considered one of the most significant developments in construction materials of
the past twenty-five years. The proposed location of the workshop is intended to
serve as a live laboratory for the discussions in a country where various
construction, repair and rehabilitation schemes have been and are being
currently applied on a large scale. On the technical side, the goals are to
present and discuss latest ideas and development, practical solutions, identify
needs and gaps in existing knowledge, and suggest directions to
follow.&lt;br/&gt;Issues planned for discussion deal with structural systems,
with emphasis on buildings and bridges, and include: 1) High performance
materials: Fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites, high performance concrete,
high strength steel, etc.; 2) Monitoring, diagnosis and assessment; and 3)
Management of Civil Engineering infrastructure systems.&lt;br/&gt;The
discussions, additional contributions and final recommendations will be included
in the Workshop Proceedings. The Proceedings will be posted on the workshop web
site and will be widely distributed in the US to researchers and engineers. The
presentations will also be made available at various professional meetings and
conferences (ASCE, ACI, TRB, etc.) as well as in professional
journals.&lt;br/&gt;The Workshop is scheduled for two days starting on the
morning of Monday, June 6, and ending on the afternoon of Tuesday, June 7, 2005,
at the American University of Beirut, Lebanon. Beirut is the capital of
Lebanon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
