Two ultra-high-vacuum chambers for a scanning tunneling microscope will be
constructed. The system will include an Arion bombardment gun, a precision
manipulator, a load-lock system, pumping stations and an isolation table. The
equipment will greatly enhance the power of the STM to examine problems relevant
to semiconductor surfaces and interfaces. It will be used in a program of
research including the following topics: (i) atomic relaxation and surface
electronic structure, (ii) metal- semiconductor interfaces, (iii) adatom-induced
relaxation of semiconductor surfaces and Schottky barrier formation, and (iv)
epitaxial growth of semiconductors and insulators, e.g., semiconductor
heterojunctions and semiconductor-fluoride interfaces grown by molecular-beam
epitaxy.
