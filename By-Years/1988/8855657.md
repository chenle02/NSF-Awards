The Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS) project-Science and Technology:
Investigating Human Dimensions is a three-year, activity- based, middle school
science and technology program for grades 5-9 with the following
characteristics: o a focus on the development of the early adolescent o
strategies to encourage the participation of female, minority, and handicapped
students, o an emphasis on reasoning and critical thinking skills, o cooperative
learning as a key instructional strategy o an instructional model that enhances
student learning, o a conceptual approach to science and technology o an
introduction to careers in science and technology fields, o a continuation of
the BSCS K-6 program, o inclusion of science-technology-society (STS) themes,
and o a plan to enhance the implementation of the program. Science and
Technology: Investigating Human Dimensions will be a unique program for the
middle school. Because the program is unique, both evaluation and implementation
will be an integral aspect of the program. The BSCS program will be published by
Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company and the materials supplied by Science Kit &amp;
