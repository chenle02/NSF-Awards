9561823 Daughton This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
will investigate how narrow width (0.1-0.3 micron) stripes of Giant
Magnetoresistance multilayers can form new magnetic structures, which look
promising for magnetic field sensors and for tape and disk read heads. Initial
data on these narrow stripes show two magnetic states, each of which gives
linear changes in stripe resistance with applied magnetic fields, but with
opposite polarities. This magnetic structure results from a number of magnetic
characteristics, including bilinear and biquadratic exchange between magnetic
layers, exchange coupling within magnetic layers, magnetostatic energy, and
crystalline and field-induced anisotropies. The magnetic configuration improves
sensitivity by compensating anti-ferromagnetic coupling with size effects in the
nanometer scale stripes, and improves noise characteristics by utilizing single
domain devices. In Phase I a computer model will be developed to predict the
magnetoresistance behavior of the stripes as a function of line width and
material parameters. A hybrid sensor assembly will be fabricated and
characterized using these narrow stripes, and a read head will be designed for
very narrow track widths. In Phase II a monolithic sensor and a narrow track
read head will be demonstrated. Commercial applications include high sensitivity
magnetic field sensors for medical, industrial, and automotive sectors and read
heads for very high density disk and tape drives.
