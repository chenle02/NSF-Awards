With their ability to sustain an outstanding dielectric response in the
microwave region and accommodate extensive chemical substitution, oxide
perovskites (ABO3) are the most widely studied and
technologically&lt;br/&gt;important family of microwave dielectrics. For mixed-
metal perovskites, where the A or B (or both) positions in the structure contain
mixtures of different cations, a correlation between a high quality factor (low
dielectric loss) and improved cation order has been clearly established.
However, only a limited sub-set of ordered perovskite-forming stoichiometries
has been examined, and many new systems are still to be explored. This proposal
uses new approaches based on "non-integer" valence A-site chemistries to
stabilize several completely new families of B-site ordered perovskites suitable
for application as low-loss dielectrics in microwave communications. Many of the
new materials lie in systems known to exhibit low melting points and high
reactivity at low temperature, which also make them potentially useful for
applications in low temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC)
technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unique electrical properties of ceramic
microwave dielectric oxides have revolutionized microwave-based communications
by reducing the size and cost of resonators, filters, and oscillators in systems
ranging from cellular telephones to global positioning technologies. Although
the existing materials are adequate for current applications the next generation
of systems requires new materials with an enhanced dielectric response. The
research in this proposal is aimed toward identifying these materials by using a
novel design strategy to prepare new families of ceramic microwave dielectrics
based on the perovskite structure.&lt;br/&gt;
