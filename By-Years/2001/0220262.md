Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The ARM processor, a leading processor design for the
embedded domain, supports a 32 bit ARM instruction set as well as a 16 bit Thumb
instruction set. This project is aimed at exploring two approaches for
generating code that will simultaneously achieve the goals of small code size,
low energy consumption, and good performance. The first approach judiciously
combines the use of ARM and Thumb instructions to generate mixed code either
dynamically or at compile time. The second approach focusses on changing the
data and code layout in a way that compact code can be generated without
sacrifcing good performance. To thoroughly explore the above approaches an
experimental infrastructure based upon the Simplescalar simulator and the gcc
compiler is being developed.
