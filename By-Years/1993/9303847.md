A particular model for the treatment of the fragmentation process in heavy-ion
collisions will be investigated. The transition-state treatment, based on a
generalization of the method commonly used to study nuclear fission, will serve
as the basis for a computer code aimed at predicting the mass, energy, momentum,
and spin distributions of the fragments that emerge from energetic nuclear
collision.
