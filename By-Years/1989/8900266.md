This is an innovative project which will investigate the feasibility of
determining the amount of loss of prestress in the tendons of a prestressed
girder by vibrating the entire bridge at various intervals and comparing the
data from subsequent observations to the original data, thus establishing a rate
of loss and total loss of the prestressing force.
