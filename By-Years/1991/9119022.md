Myelin is a compact, multilammellar structure that insulates the axons of nerve
cells and promotes the rapid conduction of nerve impulses. This project is
designed to test the application of Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) microscopy
to examine myelin. Due to its simple protein composition, and compact nature,
myelin is an ideal substance for analysis by FTIR microscopy. The method will
enable Dr. LeVine to resolve the infrared spectra of minute amounts of material.
This analysis entails utilizing FTIR microscopy to distinguish the in situ,
infrared spectrum of myelin from normal animals, and myelin from animals with
genetic mutations which affect myelin. In addition, Dr. LeVine will study the
infrared spectrum of myelin during different stages of development. The infrared
spectrum of this substance will reveal chemical differences that exist between
the two forms of myelin and prompt the identification of these differences. If
successful, this technology could be a new frontier in the neurosciences,
opening a new field of exploration.
