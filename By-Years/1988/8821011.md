This award supports cooperative research on the reduction of fire risk from
earthquake-generated tsunamis (large waves) to be conducted by Jane and Rolf
Preuss of Urban Regional Research in Seattle, Washington and Julio Kuroiwa of
the National University of Engineering of Peru. First, the vulnerability to
ignition of fuel sources in the port of Callao will be analyzed and correlated
in terms of fire spread with the population and greater area of the port. The
emphasis will be on gross damage potential rather than monetary loss. Then, a
risk management program will be developed which will combine risk mitigation and
emergency preparedness measures. The Peruvian team will have the responsibility
for data collection and public coordination. Urban Regional Research will assist
technically in the preparation of alternative plans, evaluation techniques and
preparation of the detailed site plans. While Lima is the case study area, there
are many comparable U.S. ports with similar potential for risk such as
Anchorage, Alaska, badly damaged in 1964. Methodologies for defining and
responding to risk will aid both countries even when fire and contamination are
not caused by tsunamis.
