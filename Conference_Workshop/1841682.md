A one-and-half-day workshop will be held at the Wharton School, University of
Pennsylvania, on November 30 - December 1, 2018. This workshop will bring
together some of the most prominent researchers in the field of statistics from
around the world. The main goals are to facilitate the exchange of recent
research developments, to provide opportunities for new researchers and
underrepresented groups, and to establish new collaborations that will channel
efforts into pending problems and open new directions for future investigation.

The workshop will cover topics of fundamental statistical theory having broad
applicability. It will also emphasize areas of statistical research offering
innovative approaches to problems arising in various branches of the sciences
including bioinformatics, image analysis, signal processing and genomics. In
addition to the core invited talks, the workshop will feature discussion
sessions. Slides of all the talks will be posted on the conference web site
https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/research/seminars-conferences/.
