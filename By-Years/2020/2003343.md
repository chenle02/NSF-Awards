Non-Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;In recent years a new kind of phase of matter
has been predicted, called a Higher Order topological state. This state contains
specific new modes on intersections of different surfaces of the crystal. These
so-called "hinge" or "corner" modes have the potential to form the basis of
future topological quantum computers, immune to errors and able to perform
calculations currently unthinkable. An exciting example of such materials is
FeTeSe, where the PI provided the first evidence that it is a higher order
topological superconductor. Using expertise in fabrication, electrical, and
optical spectroscopy, the PI will develop new means to probe the properties of
the hinge modes in FeTeSe systematically. The topics and techniques also provide
an excellent starting point for creating public talks and recruiting a diverse
set of trainees, undergraduate and graduate students, who also participate in
public outreach. The project's participants gain valuable professional skills
in: collaboration, computation, fabrication, and characterization.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Higher order topological
phases have recently emerged, with boundary modes in two or more dimensions
smaller than the bulk. These are systems whose boundary states are themselves
topological, gapped with different signs. Using his expertise in fabrication,
electrical, and optical spectroscopy, the PI will develop new means to probe the
properties of the hinge modes in FeTeSe. An array of contact configurations and
protocols will determine the best method to isolate the hinge from the bulk.
This effort is aided by photothermal measurements to image the hinges. Careful
studies of the effects of magnetic fields and magnetic contacts will determine
the details of spin momentum locking. The studies will reveal the transport,
thermal, and spin-momentum locking of the hinge modes. As such, their robustness
will be directly probed, along with determining the proper ground-state
Hamiltonian to describe the hinges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
