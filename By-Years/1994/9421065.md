9421065 Nunn This award provides partial funding (63% of total cost) for the
acquisition of computer equipment for the Earth Systems Computational and
Visualization Laboratory in the Department of Geology and Geophysics at the
Louisiana State University. LSU is committed to providing the remaining funds
necessary to purchase the equipment. The new equipment consists of a network
server with large RAM capacity. The Earth Systems Computational and
Visualization Laboratory at LSU is used by faculty and students for research and
teaching in the areas of tectonics, seismology, hydrologic sciences, chemical
oceanography, and marine geology and geophysics. ***
