Abstract 9318754 Gaisser The South Pole Air Shower Experiment (SPASE) consists
of a large (about 20,000 square meters) array of 24 scintillation detectors. It
was originally designed to search for ultra high energy (>100 TeV) gamma rays,
but since it was first built in 1989 it has evolved to become a part of one of
the most comprehensive high energy astrophysics observatories in existence. In
conjunction with other instruments at Pole, SPASE will continue its search for
sources for very highest energy cosmic rays, and will also be a key component of
what will become the most sensitive instrument on Earth for the measurement of
the masses of cosmic rays with energies above 100 TeV. This award provides funds
for the continuation of the operation of SPASE, to somewhat improve its
capabilities and to relocate it in the newly established Astrophysics Sector,
about one kilometer from the South Pole station. SPASE is supported by a
collaboration between the Bartol Research Foundation of the University of
Delaware and the University of Leeds, England. Several other institutions are
also involved in the overall high energy astrophysics experimental effort at
South Pole. ***
