This award supports a research project aimed at exploring novel process
strategies to develop closed-cell polymer foams that have cell sizes in the
range of nanometers. The idea of creating nano-scaled cells in polymeric
materials is exciting and largely unexplored. Due to the unique structures,
nanofoams are expected to have many properties that are superior to those of
existing materials, such as a much higher strength-to-weight ratio. In addition,
nanofoams would provide novel functional materials that could be tailored for
the needed properties, for example, thermal conductivity, dielectric constant,
acoustic and damping coefficients. Nanofoams have the potential to be used for
any applications where foamed polymers are currently used, with the benefit of
further material savings and improved performance. These novel materials will
find a wide range of applications in construction, packaging, motor vehicle,
microelectronics, and household products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
will explore the creation of nanofoams from the PMMA-CO2 system using a solid-
state foaming method. The retrograde vitrification phenomenon will be employed
to increase the gas diffusivity and solubility. Both conventional solid-state
foaming techniques and the stress induced bubble nucleation method will be
explored to develop the nanofoaming process. A low temperature and high pressure
vessel will be designed and instrumented. Gas solubility and diffusivity will be
measured. Properties of the new nanofoam materials, such as the morphology,
mechanical properties, and dielectric properties, will be characterized in this
research.
