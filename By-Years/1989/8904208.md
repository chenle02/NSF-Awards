The purpose of this research is to investigate the petrographic and palynologic
characteristics, surficial processes of formation, and early stages of
coalification (peatification) of several contrasting wet-tropical, peat deposits
in the Caribbean region. This data will be compared and contrasted with data
generated previously from temperate settings, such as the Okefenokee Swamp of
Georgia, and Snuggedy Swamp of South Carolina. Three tropical deposits have been
selected for study: 1) the Moin Deposit of Costa Rica; 2) the Changuinola
Deposit of Panama; and 3) the Arecibo Deposit of Puerto Rico. Although all of
these are found in the same general type of setting, each exhibits one or more
significant differences from the others and was selected because it is expected
to yield new and essential information with which to interpret and predict the
composition and geometry of the many ancients coals that have been reported in
the literature to have formed in tropical shoreline-related settings.
Methodology to be employed in this study will include: 1) field measurements of
pH, salinity and other surface conditions; 2) field descriptions of peat
sequences; 3) collection of surface litter and surface samples; 4) collection of
oriented piston cores; 5) transmitted, reflected, and fluorescent light
microscopy from microtome thin sections; 6) low temperature ashing and x-ray
analysis of surface and subsurface samples combined with radiocarbon dating, for
interpreting the paleoecological and developmental history of the deposits.
