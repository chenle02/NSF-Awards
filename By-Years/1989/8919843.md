The program outlined continues successful earlier NSF supported research in
transport process in two phase flow. The general objectives are to understand
how turbulent transport of molecular species is related to Lagrangian
statistics, to understand the turbulent transport of particles, droplets and
bubbles that have a density different from the fluid in which they are
suspended, to understand how the turbulent transport of mass at a solid/liquid
or a gas/liquid boundary is related to fluid mechanical factors close to the
interface, and to understand non-linear waves caused by air flow over a liquid
surface. Five projects are proposed: (1) Computer studies that relate the
Lagrangian and Eulerian descriptions of turbulent transport, and that provide
information on the role of molecular diffusivity in diminishing turbulent
transport; (2) Optical studies on the turbulent transport of drops, particles
and bubbles; (3) Influence of waves on gas absorption in stratified flows; (4)
Finite amplitude waves in gas-liquid stratified flows; (5) Turbulent mass
transfer at a solid- liquid boundary. Important aspects of this work are that
combined laboratory and supercomputer experiments will be conducted and that
newly developed optical techniques will be used to study Lagrangian turbulence
characteristics of particles, drops and bubbles and finally, one of the most
immediate consequences to be derived from this study will be the application
leading to development of improved design equations for gas/liquid flow in
pipelines. The system chosen to study gas absorption is of practical importance
in many process problems. However, it is also of interest to geophysicists,
since the transfer across the surface of environmental waters is an important
phase of the geophysical and natural biochemical cycles of numerous substances.
This explains the widespread interest in it by chemists, geophysicists, civil
engineers, mechanical engineers, and environmentalists.
