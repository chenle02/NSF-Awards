This joint Chemistry Division, Division of Engineering Education and Centers,
and Office of Multidisciplinary Activities award supports the continuation of a
Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Virginia Commonwealth
University. Suzanne Ruder is the site's Program Director and Sally Hunnicutt is
the Co-Program Director. Sixteen faculty members from the Departments of
Chemistry and Chemical Engineering will serve as REU student mentors. Over the
award period (2002-2004), eleven students will be supported each summer in a
ten-week program and five teachers in a seven-week program. The students are
drawn mostly from regional colleges, where research opportunities are generally
not available. Recruitment approaches similar to those in the past, will be
used. These have been successful with recruiting minorities into their REU
program at the level of 40%. The teachers that are recruited are mostly from the
Richmond Public School system. Students and teachers have a wide selection of
research projects from which to select, that are divided into the three areas of
synthesis, analysis, and modeling. Throughout the program there are research
meetings, workshops, and seminars. At the halfway point the students and
teachers give an oral presentation on the progress of their research. At the
close of the program participants present their research results at a final
symposium. For assessment of the program all participants and research mentors
complete evaluation forms and students are tracked after their departure.
