In this project, the Center for the Study of Ethics in the Professions, Illinois
Institute of Technology (IIT) will transfer to science and engineering programs
at other campuses what IIT has learned about teaching ethics across the
curriculum. The project includes a) an intensive seven-day summer workshop to
develop specific materials to use in class and the skills and confidence to use
them; b) a required testing of those materials in class at the home institution;
and c) an evaluation of the results (a faculty self-report, student assessment,
and follow-up questionnaires). Faculty will be taught both to integrate ethics
into their own technical course and how to help other faculty do the same.
