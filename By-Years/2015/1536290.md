This project examines the recent expansion of large-scale oil palm projects to
investigate how geographies of resource booms are produced and how different
coalitions of interests affect the role of the state in environmental
governance. The project addresses the struggles between "growth" and "counter"
coalitions to promote or resist large-scale oil palm projects; the ways in which
the material nature of oil palm shapes the expansion process; and the forms
state interventions take to govern the expansion of oil palm. This research will
contribute to the literature on resource booms by providing a policy relevant
analysis of the social and environmental criteria required for the sound
development of oil palm plantations. This study will also produce academic
papers and pieces written for broader audiences that link this case to
theoretically grounded policy debates in political ecology and development
studies.

The theoretical framework for this study draws on literature within political
ecology that is concerned with the social dimensions of land transformation and
with large scale land acquisitions and "land grabs". The project focuses on a
case study of oil palm expansion in several sites of the Peruvian Amazon and
utilizes principally qualitative methods that include open-ended semi-structured
interviews, field observation in project areas, participant observation in
technical coordination boards and spatial analysis, and a review of policy
documents, legal frameworks and press reports related to oil palm investment.
The sites for data collection involve different investors, are at different
stages of project development, and three of them have reported conflicts while
one has not. This diversity will allow the investigators to assess causal claims
about how the geographies of resource booms are produced across different
contexts.
