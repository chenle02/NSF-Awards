Experimental studies will be carried out on the quantum dynamics of classically
chaotic quantum diffusion. The quantum system to be utilized is the nearly one
dimensional highly excited hydrogen atom in intense microwave and static
electric fields. This semiclassical system is a prototype for atoms in intense
electromagnetic radiation fields. As such, the research pertains to atomic
processes induced by very intense optical fields. The measurements involve the
passage of a fast laser excited atomic hydrogen beam through a microwave
waveguide structure, to produce a microwave pulse in each atom's reference
frame. Measured will be final bound state probability distributions and
ionization probabilities. Other topics studied include research on the quantum
suppression of diffusion in action space, the measurement of quantum diffusion
constants and breakpoint times, classical and quantum resonance effects, static
field quantum tunneling enhancement of quantum diffusion, and the effects of
stochastic microwave fields.
