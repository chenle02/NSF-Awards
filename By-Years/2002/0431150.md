Over the past twenty years multiscale methods like the discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) have evolutionized signal processing; for example, wavelets lie
at the core of the FBI fingerprint data base and the new JPEG 2000 image
compression standard for digital photos. While wavelets are arguably ideal or
near-ideal for analyzing and processing 1-dimensional (1-D) signals (price
fluctuations of interest rates, for example), a surprising realization of the
past few years is their inability to capitalize in a similar way on 2-D, 3-D,
&lt;br/&gt;and higher-D signals containing "singularities" (edges and ridges in
2-D digital photos or 3-D videos, for example). The new, confounding aspect is
"geometry": the singularities are typically localized along smooth, lower-
dimensional manifolds. There is a great need for new theory and tools to exploit
these geometric structures. Other than a few scattered promising results,
however, such theory and tools do not exist today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project aims toward a unified theory and practical toolset for the analysis and
processing of higher-dimensional piecewise smooth signals that feature geometric
manifold structures. In particular,the research involves (1) new multiscale
signal representations based on local, directional atoms having a clear
geometric meaning with respect to the underlying manifolds; (2) new statistical
models for these representations; (3) new multiscale processing algorithms that
exploit the new representations and models; and (4) educational outreach to
engage undergraduates, graduate students, and other researchers in this timely
research area. Given recent successful preliminary results in 2-D and 3-D, there
is significant potential for progress in these directions to eventually yield
orders of magnitude better compression, approximation, modeling, and denoising
performance in real applications in higher dimensions.
