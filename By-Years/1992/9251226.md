The Department of Chemistry is purchasing spectrometers, computers and
associated instrumentation to automate data collection in several lower and
upper division laboratory courses. The new equipment is providing students with
an increased opportunity to engage in experimental design and conduct open-ended
investigations. The instrumentation is also being used by advanced
undergraduates undertaking independent research.
