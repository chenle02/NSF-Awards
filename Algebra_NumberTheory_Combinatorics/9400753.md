9400753 Cutkosky The principle investigator will investigate four problems in
algebraic geometry. He will work on the Riemann-Roch problem which is to compute
the cohomology groups of high multiples of a line bundle on a projective
variety. He will also work on the local analogue of this problem which is the
computation of Hilbert functions of valuation ideals determined by vanishing to
high multiplicity along fixed valuations. In addition, the principle
investigator will study ramification and the equivalence of homomorphisms of
modules. This research is concerned with a number of questions in commutative
algebra and algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry studies solutions of families
of polynomial equations. One can either study the geometry of the solution set
or approach problems algebraically by investigating certain functions on the
solution set that form what is called a commutative ring. This dual perspective
creates a close connection between commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.
