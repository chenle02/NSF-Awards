9726584 Stern The project is to conduct finite-amplitude numerical calculations
of salt fingers in an unbounded domain with uniform vertical temperature and
salinity gradient. The research will focus initially on an asymptotic state in
the vicinity of absolute thermohaline instability. It is intended to obtain
predictions for the rms T-S fluctuations, which are testable in future sugar-
salt experiments. Some insight into the ergodic question might be obtained from
the simpler two-dimensional small epsilon case.
