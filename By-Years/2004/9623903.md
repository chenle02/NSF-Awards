This is a Faculty Early Career project. In research, the work will study
ditryptophan crosslinking units within proteins. The ditryptophans are highly
fluorescent and easily detected for that reason. The fluorescence will be
studied in model systems with constrained geometries. Combinatorial chemistry
will be used to optimize the ditryptophan chromophore formation. The work will
determine the structural consequences of tryptophan dimerization within
peptides. Hen egg white lysozyme will be used as a substrate and the work will
demonstrate that fluorescence of ditryptophan units can be coupled to antibody
binding. In education, Dr. VanVranken will develop a graduate class which
applies advanced concepts in organic chemistry to biology, will organize a
seminar at the biology/chemistry interface, and will mentor students from small
colleges and minority students in research. This project will develop a light-
initiated technique for stabilizing the structure of proteins. A fluorescent
probe will result and it will be used to study biological events. The project
will develop educational activities at the chemistry/biology interface and will
involve mentoring minority students and students from small colleges.
