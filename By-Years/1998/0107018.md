Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0107018&lt;br/&gt;Principal
Investigator: Christopher M. Judge&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bloomington Geometry
Workshop is the first of an intended&lt;br/&gt;series of regional conferences on
geometry. The main purpose of&lt;br/&gt;the Bloomington Geometry Workshop, to be
held at the University&lt;br/&gt;of Indiana, is to promote scientific
cooperation and&lt;br/&gt;communication between geometers and geometric analysts
in a&lt;br/&gt;region including Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio,
and&lt;br/&gt;Tennessee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern geometry addresses problems
such as understanding the ways&lt;br/&gt;in which typical spaces are curved and
how far from the flat&lt;br/&gt;Euclidean model a space might be, the influence
of curvature upon&lt;br/&gt;analysis in a particular geometry, interactions of
large-scale&lt;br/&gt;geometry with probability theory and the algebraic
properties of&lt;br/&gt;the fundamental group, hyperbolic geometry and the
portion of&lt;br/&gt;low-dimensional topology that increasingly depends
upon&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic structures, and gauge field theories and other
ideas&lt;br/&gt;from theoretical physics.
