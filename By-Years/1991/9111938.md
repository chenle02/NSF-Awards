This will try to identify homologous regions of the polydnaviruses from
different parasitic wasp groups in an attempt to determine the phylogenetic
affinities of the viruses. These trees can then be compared to those of the
wasps for congruence testing. The polydnavirus association with the wasps is an
extremely interesting relationship and represents the only known example of
mutualism between eukaryotes and viruses. It appears that the virus is necessary
for the wasp to successfully complete its lifecycle since the products that it
produces successfully suppresses the host immune response to the parasitoids. A
determination of when this trait arose and if it is lineage specific would be
highly valuable to a wide range of individuals in the scientific community and
may also have wide ranging effects in the insect control community. The
procedures to be attempted are new and offer a high potential return if the
project is successful.
