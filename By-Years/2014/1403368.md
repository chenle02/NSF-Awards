The proliferation of chronic infectious diseases in the developed and developing
world demonstrates the vital need to make presently slow and labor intensive
laboratory diagnostics cheaper and more portable with the requisite sensitivity
and specificity to be deployed as field diagnostic assays. The integrated
barcode diagnostic tool developed at UC Berkeley significantly reduces assay
cost and time while providing health practitioners with critical new information
on disease state for accurate on-the spot screening and treatment of infectious
diseases including HIV/HCV (hepatitis C) co-infection. The proposed work will
enable prototyping, needs assessment and collection of customer and industry
feedback towards development of the first multiplexed electrophoretic platform
for immunoassay of biomarkers from whole blood. The team's core technology is a
three-dimensional hydrogel matrix which enables specific antibody (IgG) capture
and detection.

There exists an opportunity to introduce an integrated diagnostic platform
technology preserving the low cost, small footprint, ease-of-use and portability
of current screening diagnostics while adding the high-specificity (accuracy)
provided by slow, manual-labor intensive confirmatory diagnostics that are
presently run in large centralized laboratories. The key advances in
biologically-functionalized polyacrylamide photo-patterning technology provide a
multiplexed barcode blotting immunoassay with simple and fast operation.
Transforming sophisticated and high performance assays into a single low-cost
portable tool can significantly advance diagnosis of HIV and hepatitis C (HCV).
Commercializing the barcode blotting technology for rapid (30 min) and
multiplexed HIV/HCV screening diagnostics would make a major contribution to
improving world healthcare while also providing entry into a commercial market
primed for significant growth over the next several years.
