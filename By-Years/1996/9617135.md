The California College of Podiatric Medicine requests support from NSF to
connect it's campus to the Internet. The College, located in the San Francisco
with approximately 400 students, is one of seven podiatric medical schools in
the nation. The college intends to connect through AimNet a local Internet
service provider. The campus needs the Internet connection to be able to access
information resources throughout the state, the nation and the world. The
connection will benefit the faculty, staff students of this institution as well
as the community in general. The award provides partial support of the project
for two years.
