The investigator studies moduli spaces of finite, flat covers and line bundles
of those covers. Important basic examples include orders in number fields
(finite flat covers of the integers) and finite covers of the complex projective
line. The methods involve working over an arbitrary base scheme, so for example
one gets results about both the number theoretic and geometric examples above.
The project is to find moduli spaces that have explicit descriptions and
reasonable geometry so that they can be worked with concretely.

Since the work of Gauss in 1801, polynomials have been use to study number
systems that are bigger than the usual counting numbers 1,2,3.., For example, a
larger number system might also include the square root of 2, which cannot be
found among 1,2,3... When we include the square root of 2, it is a quadratic
extension of the usual numbers, and if we had included the cube root of 2 it
would have been a cubic extension of the usual numbers. This work tries to
understand what the possible low degree extensions of the usual numbers are by
working explicitly with polynomials that are related to the extensions. This
then allows one to make computations regarding the larger number systems by
reducing them to easier computations about polynomials.
