This work addresses the need for improved non-destructive diagnostics to probe
the composition of surfaces relevant to materials processing. In particular,
detection of process materials and impurities important in the production of
silicon and gallium arsenide based semiconductors will be made. They will employ
non-linear mixing of laser frequencies at the surface of the material of
interest. This mixing will create emission at new frequencies which are easily
detectable and are characteristic of the surface composition. In Phase 1 they
will use an existing UHV surface science apparatus and pulsed laser system to
prove the feasibility of detecting aluminum and carbon on GaAs and silicon on
aluminum. Auger electron spectroscopy will be employed to quantitatively
determine surface composition and non-linear optical output will be correlated
with the composition. Interferences affecting the signal will be probed.
Standard CVD techniques will be employed to prepare the desired surface
coverage. Sub-monolayer sensitivity is expected using this method.
