&lt;br/&gt;The Indiana Research Experience for Undergraduates program at Indiana
University, begun in 1966, offers a small, select, talented group of students
the opportunity to experience the intensity of working on a problem whose
solution is currently unknown. Working one-on-one with an IU faculty member for
eight weeks during the summer, students develop their abstract problem solving
skills, intellectual stamina, creativity, perseverance, communication skills,
and work ethic. Most alumni of our program go on to pursue advanced degrees, and
many now hold prestigious positions in academia, business, and government.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall experience will give these students, whose
interests may be quite diverse, an appreciation of the power, evolution, and
usefulness of mathematics and of working mathematicians. This group will come to
understand on the one hand the amazing diversity of mathematics, and on the
other hand the deep unifying themes which span disciplines and centuries. The
long term impact of this program is to increase the mathematical awareness of
future decision makers and leaders. Such awareness may lead to wider use of
mathematical methods in decision making and in creating new technologies.
