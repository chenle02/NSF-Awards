&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed program is to develop new, fundamental
technologies for bringing the periodically poled LiNb03 into a new regime in
which the domains are of sub-wavelength scale. By forming a nanodomain structure
with a period of the wavelength of light, an electrically controlled reflection
grating can be formed inside the wave guide, which can serve as a dynamically
switchable reflection device. A nanodomain grating can be formed in a LiNbO3
wave guide by applying electric field poling techniques using periodic
electrodes, which are formed by, e.g., laser
interference&lt;br/&gt;(holographic) lithography. The basic grating structure
can be used in a variety of architectures to form tunable add-drop filters,
dynamic switches and routers, as well as tunable lasers all with nanosecond
response times and no moving parts. These devices can be made loss less by
including an integrated amplifier onto the same
substrate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The particular practical significance of
periodic nanodomain structures is that they enable a completely new application
of the periodic domain structures, namely, ultra fast dynamically switchable
optical telecommunications filters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our approach
is a platform technology, with wide applicability in a variety of optical
communications applications, ranging from optical ultra fast WDM switches and
routers with no moving parts to small highly efficient tunable
lasers.&lt;br/&gt;
