In this project, Dr. L. R. Staronski of the Central Laboratory of Optics in
Warsaw, Poland, will cooperate with Dr. Duncan Moore of the University of
Rochester under the U.S.-Poland Marie Sklodowska-Curie Joint Fund to research
"GRIN Methods in Conventional Optical Systems: Design and Technology." The
researchers will apply gradient-index (=GRIN) methods to improve properties of
conventional optical systems, to manufacture optical elements or materials whose
index of refraction varies continuously, where the changes of the index of
refraction are designed to compensate for the aberration of optical systems and
to reduce the number of optical components. This project in optics fulfills the
program objectives of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts
in the U.S. and Poland to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in
areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality,
reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
