This is a Career Advancement Award funded under the Research Opportunities for
Women Program. This award will allow the investigator to expand her research
activities from the relatively narrow area of applied production theory, and to
apply her expertise to the wider consideration of firm behavior and performance
in different market contexts and countries. More specifically, this project will
involve studying price markup behavior and firm decision-making regarding
inventory investment and advertising. These three aspects of firm behavior have
important impacts on the observed economic performance of industries and
countries, both in terms of their impacts on the actual trends of indicators,
such as productivity and capacity utilization, and also in terms of the
appropriateness of the measures used to represent these trends. Firm behavior
and the implications for overall economic performance will be analyzed and
compared for the U.S., Canada, and Japan.
