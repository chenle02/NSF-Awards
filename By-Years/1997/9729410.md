The existing prototype Biodiversity Insight System, which developed at the San
Diego Supercomputer Center to integrate geographical and informational database
with a "generic modeling engine" to permit predictions of species distributions,
will be tested on museum and multi-national databases. In addition, a
description of the characteristics of the BIS system will be widely provided to
museums and other biodiversity database holders.
