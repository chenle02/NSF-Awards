This award will provide support for a three-day Advanced Training Institute
(ATI) for about 30 junior researchers, all already engaged in dark matter
research from diverse backgrounds and subfields. The Institute will take place
on Feb 18-20, 2018, immediately preceding the well-established three-day
international conference on "Sources and Detection of Dark Matter and Dark
Energy in the Universe," which will take place on Feb. 21-23, 2018 on the UCLA
campus.

This conference is aligned with NSF interests in developing a diverse workforce.
The organizers will pay particular attention to the diversity of the students
and the lecturers, in particular to the participation of women and other under-
represented groups.

The UCLA ATI, devoted entirely to dark matter, would significantly enhance the
opportunities in the US for junior researchers on the dark matter problem to get
a high-level training on forefront research issues in different subfields from
the experts in each of these subfields. The hunt for the dark matter is truly an
interdisciplinary enterprise that involves laboratory experiments, astrophysical
and cosmological observations combined with simulations of structure formation
in the Universe, searches at accelerators, such as the LHC, and particle physics
theory. The ATI will cover a variety of different subjects in these areas,
highlighting the most interesting advances. This award will provide partial
financial support to non-local junior researchers participating in the UCLA Dark
Matter Advanced Training Institute.
