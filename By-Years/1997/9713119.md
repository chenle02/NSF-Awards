This project is a continuation of ongoing work supported by NSF. The objective
of the project is directed toward the understanding of the processes associated
with the Earth's aurora which generate radio waves. It is asserted that auroral
associated radio waves are neither understood theoretically nor fully described
observationally. The project aims at radio-frequenct imaging by constructing a
radio-frequency interferometer at Sondrestrom, Greenland, a location suited to
the investigation of the phenomena and one which is rich in additional
complimentary diagnostic measurements. A series of coordinated ground-based and
in situ observations (with the FAST) satellite will be undertaken to test
proposed auroral radio wave generation mechanisms.
