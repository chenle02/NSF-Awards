9554162 Tinker The Concord Consortium and ten collaborators provide a unique
approach to delivering courses to grade 9-12 teachers through computer
networking and other technologies. Collaborators include six USIs (Chicago,
Columbus, New Orleans, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix), one RSI (American
Indian Science and Engineering Society), three school districts (in California,
Massachusetts, Kentucky), and Fermi Lab (Illinois). They are responsible for all
local support for the courses. The project uses innovative delivery techniques
and new technologies to support asynchronous instruction. The first eighteen
months emphasize examining and improving the effectiveness of the course
delivery, monitoring and structure. The last half of the project expands the
scope to include more disciplines as well as a broader range of teachers. Using
a combination of on-line instruction, real and "virtual" study groups, video,
and other techniques, participants receive the equivalent of 125 contact hours.
The emphasis is on getting teachers involved in extended investigations and
supporting these with just-in-time assistance in the requisite skills and
knowledge in core disciplines and educational strategies. Continuing Education
Units are available and university graduate credit is anticipated. An impressive
list of instructors ensures expertise in mathematics and all school science
disciplines. Although beginning with just 75 participants, 925 are anticipated.
Cost-sharing and other in-kind contributions will make the project self-
sustaining at less that $900 per teacher for approximately 8 credits. Cost
sharing is 9%. 1 1
