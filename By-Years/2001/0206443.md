Anthropogenic activities involving nitrogen (N) are contributing to
eutrophication in marine and fresh waters. Because headwater streams are the
primary interface between terrestrial and aquatic systems, they are an important
link in the transport of N from enriched landscapes. However, N may be retained
or removed through ecological processes occurring within streams. We will
investigate the effects of enrichment on the ability of streams to retain N by
comparing retention in study streams that span a gradient of N use and
concentration. Retention will be measured by tracking the fate of N tracers
experimentally released into study streams. We will quantify changes in
ecosystem structure (biotic standing stocks) and function (metabolic activity)
associated with enrichment and evaluate the influence of environmental factors
(e.g., hydrology) on N retention. This approach to linking N enrichment and
retentitive efficiency will increase understanding of theoretical and managerial
aspects of N loading to lotic systems.
