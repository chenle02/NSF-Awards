NORC/SUNY-Buffalo propose to develop a 12th grade exit examination in Physics,
Chemistry, Biology, Earth Science. The NSF award is to collect and adapt/adopt
performance tasks and test procedures for such a test in each of the major
domains of seconadry science -- chemistry, biology, physics, and earth/space
science. This effort will be combined with the development of an objective
multiple-choice/short answer instrument supported by the Center for Research on
Evaluation, Standards, and Student Testing at UCLA. In addition, SUNY- Buffalo
will develop a clearinghouse of performance assessment tasks, items, procedures,
and scoring protocols for use by state and local education agencies. cost
sharing: The NORC cost sharing is 28% of the total NSF award.
