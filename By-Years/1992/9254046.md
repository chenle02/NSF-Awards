The Multicultural Mathematics Project (McMath) will develop an introductory,
general education course in geometry. The course will use architecture--
particularly the architectural constructions of the dwelling places of various
cultural and social groups--as a vehicle to link the discipline of mathematics
with the disciplines of physics, engineering, urban geography, and anthropology.
The course will foster multicultural understanding in its exploration of the
cultural embeddedness of mathematics as reflected in the dwelling places of
diverse groups of people. Instructors will employ multiple teaching strategies
as a response to diverse ways of knowing, in order to encourage the academic
achievement of all students, both those who have had prior success in
mathematics and those who have not. Course materials will be piloted and will be
evaluated both by the development team and by an outside evaluator.
