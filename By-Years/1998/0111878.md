The Workshop on Software Engineering and Mobility will be held on May 13-14,
2001, in Toronto, Canada, in conjunction with the 23 rd International Conference
on Software Engineering. The two-day meeting is designed to bring together
leading software engineering researchers whose work is concerned with mobility
in all its forms, i.e., both logical movement of code fragments and physical
movement of hosts. This proposal seeks to stimulate the participation of
graduate students in the workshop proceedings by providing travel grants in the
amount of $500 to $1,000. The goal is to enable between 8 and 16 graduate
students involved in doctoral research on topics related to the themes of the
workshop to&lt;br/&gt;participate in its workings. Special attention will be
paid to ensure diverse geographic, racial, and gender representation among the
invited students. Specialized workshops, such as this, have a tendency to
attract established researches and a very small contingent of students whose
dissertations are near completion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since discussions taking
place in the workshop often reshape the research agenda of the field, students
who are in the earlier stages of research could benefit the most from being
involved in the workshop. Yet, they are least likely to attend. The funding we
are requesting from NSF to support travel grants to the workshop will
significantly affect the level of student participation. Even though the size of
the travel grants is relatively small, the prestige of receiving one will make
both advisors and students give serious consideration to applying for the
grants. Finally, if successful, we hope to create a culture in which conference
travel by students happens earlier than customary for the long-term benefit of
the entire&lt;br/&gt;research community, e.g., improved retention in the
doctoral program.&lt;br/&gt;
