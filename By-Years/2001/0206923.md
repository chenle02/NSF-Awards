The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and
engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research abroad. The
program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique
or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.

This award will support a twenty-four month research fellowship by Dr. Eliza
Hutter to work with Dr. Marie-Paule Pileni at the University P. et M. Curie in
Paris, France. This project will be supported by the Math and Physical Sciences
Directorate's Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.

The self-assembly of functionalized oligonucleotide (single stranded short chain
DNA) films and their hybridized counterparts (double stranded short chain DNA),
with controlled density and order is the primary objective of this project. This
will be accomplished by (1) selecting relatively simple two complimentary pairs
of thiol functionalized oligonucleotides, O12-OC12, and O25-OC25, (containing
12, and 25 base units, respectively) for self-assembly onto gold substrates and
onto gold nanoparticles, as well as for the in situ generation of gold
nanochains on their backbones; (2) application of an electric field to align the
functionalized DNA perpendicularly to the substrate; and (3) the in-depth
characterizations of the single and double stranded functionalized DNA in
solution (water and reversed micelles) and on gold substrates by combined
electrochemical, optical, electrical, spectroscopic, microscopic, X-ray
diffraction and NMR measurements. This research provides a fresh approach to the
construction of DNA based biosensors and biochips.

Dr. Pileni has pioneered the use of reversed micelles for controlling the sizes
and shapes of nanoparticles. The work in her lab is directed to the synthesis
and characterization of reverse micelles and for the in situ generation and
incorporation of nanoparticles in reverse micelles.
