The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Utah State University will
purchase an eight processor Silicon Graphics worhstation which will be dedicated
to the support of research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be
used for many research projects, including: * Enhanced methods for predicting
high-dimensional multivariate time series. * Computational modeling of
groundwater flow in fractured material and fault zones. * Computational modeling
of temporal-spatial population dynamics of insect infestation, with applications
to forest management. * New statistical methods for the understanding and
control of dynamical systems, with applications to combustion and fluid flow. *
Numerical methods for large-scale nonlinear systems, with applications to fluid
dynamics and reactive flows.
