This study is part of an ongoing project on the economics of airline hub-and-
spoke networks. To date, work has focused on how airline fares in an individual
city-pair market are related to the characteristics of the hub-and-spoke network
serving the market. Empirical findings suggest that, by allowing airlines to
exploit economies of traffic density, networks reduce airlines costs and thereby
lower the fares charged to passengers. Several extensions of this work are
pursued in this project. A version of the model will be estimated where spoke
traffic levels replace network characteristics in the regression equation. With
economies of density, high traffic levels on the spokes connecting the cities in
a given market should lead to low fares. Spoke traffic levels, however, must be
treated as endogenous, being determined in part by network characteristics,
Second, a structural model of network traffic determination will be estimated
that allows the parameters of the airlines cost function to be identified. The
estimates should indicate the actual magnitude of economies of traffic density.
Finally, the impact of the TWA-Ozark and Northwest-Republic mergers on the fares
paid by connecting passengers at the St. Louis and Minneapolis hubs will be
estimated. Simulations based on previous empirical estimates suggest that these
fares should have fallen in response to the mergers.
