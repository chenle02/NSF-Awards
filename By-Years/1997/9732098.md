9732098 Vanderah The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST.) will
establish a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site in its Materials
Science and Engineering Laboratory. Students will be recruited from across the
country, a special target will be members of underrepresented groups in science
and engineering. Students will participate in a wide range of research in the
areas of ceramics, solid state chemistry, metallurgy, polymers, neutron
condensed matter science, and materials reliability. In addition, students will
attend a weekly seminar by scientists and by previous REU participants, and a
number of social activities. %%% The REU students will have access to
exceptional instrumentation and facilities at NIST. The experience also includes
an early and valuable exposure to the interdisciplinary research environment of
a national laboratory. ***
