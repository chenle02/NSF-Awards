Our previous work has demonstrated that Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) is a
simple and highly sensitive method to investigate, through changes in the Gd3+
spectra, the magnetic ordering of the CuO2 planes in the parent compounds of the
copper oxide superconductors. We propose to extend our research to the doped
derivatives that are superconducting. % % % Owing to the strong magnetic
correlations in these compounds, it is likely that the microscopic specificity
of ESR will be an important contributor to the eventual explanation of high-
temperature superconductivity.
