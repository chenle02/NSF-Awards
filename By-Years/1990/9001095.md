This program aims to obtain basic engineering information on the kinetics of
feeding, growth, and reproduction of the organism Tetrahymena pyriformis.
Emphasis is placed on observing distributions of single cell properties and
developing models for prediction of how such distributions change in response to
changes in environmental conditions. Flow cytometry is the principal
experimental tool used to obtain the desired data. This technique allows rapid
and accurate determination of how various properties of single cells are jointly
distributed among the many cells in a population, and it can also be used to
provide quantitative information on the spatial distribution of some materials,
like DNA, in a single cell.
