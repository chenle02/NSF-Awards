This award provides funding for a three-year Combined Research-Curriculum
Development (CRCD) program, entitled, "Photovoltaic Device Processing-A Systemic
Curriculum and Research Program, " at the University of Arizona, under the
direction of Dr. Dunbar P. Birnie. The overall objective of this project is to
expose and integrate numerous students into the complexities of photovoltaic
device design-both in their class work and by incorporating them into state-of-
the-art research.
