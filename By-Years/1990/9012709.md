This grant is for investigations of highly nonlinear magnetic and electric
field configurations which are of interest to space plasma physics. The unique
feature of the laboratory experiment is the capability to fully map three-
dimensional, time dependent vector fields such as electric and magnetic fields
and to drive current systems and space charge distributions. Configurations of
interest are the propagation of intense current pulses and charged particle
beams through magnetized plasmas. Such phenomena arise naturally in solar
flares, auroral arcs, and current sheets. *** //
