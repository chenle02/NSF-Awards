The microbiology curriculum in the biology department needs to be updated to
provide students with the background to assimilate into an increasingly
scientific and technological society. The two areas of microbiology that need
the most improvement are microbial physiology and biotechnology. A high-speed
centrifuge, high-pressure liquid chromatography system and fermentation system
are provided by this project to implement a course in microbial biotechnology
and improve an existing course in bacterial metabolism. The equipment is also
used in existing biology core courses, microbiology and cell biology. The goals
of this project are to strengthen the microbiology laboratory curriculum,
improve the students' learning experiences in this area, aid in the recruitment
of undergraduates to these underrepresented areas in microbiology through more
attractive courses, and promote undergraduate interest in these areas by
presenting a more realistic laboratory environment. The main learning objectives
that can be accomplished through the purchase of this equipment are that
students learn extensively about growth of bacteria from a basic as well as
applied research approach and that students be exposed to and learn to operate
some computer-based analytical equipment.
