This proposal requests NSF support to broaden participation in The International
Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO) to be held in Chamonix,
France April 2-6, 2011. The International Symposium on Code Generation and
Optimization (CGO) is the premier venue to bring together researchers and
practitioners working on bridging the gap between software abstraction and
hardware execution. This proposal aims to increase the impact of this conference
by enabling participation by studentsfrom US-based institutions for whom travel
support would otherwise preclude their attendance.
