The PI will continue his studies of the low latitude ionosphere using incoherent
radar measurements, global convection, and thermospheric and ionospheric
numerical models. These studies' objectives are basic understanding of
electrodynamic processes controlling the low latitude and equatorial
ionospheres, and developing quiet time global climatological and storm time
predictive analytical ionospheric electric field models. The PIs will use
extensive radar measurements from Jicamarca and Arecibo, and auroral magnetic
field data to model the response of the low and equatorial ionosphere-to-
magnetosphere disturbances. Fejer will apply new data analysis procedures to
examine the low latitude electrodynamic effects associated with high latitude
convection enhancements and substorms, also with storm time wind driven electric
fields, followed by large energy depositions into the high latitude ionosphere.
High resolution experiments carried out at Arecibo and Jicamarca will use
significantly more data taking and analysis procedures to study coupling of
energy and momentum from lower altitudes into the low latitude ionosphere.
Finally, the PIs will study effects of middle atmospheric and mesospheric
processes on the variability of quiet-time equatorial plasma drifts using long
period observational campaigns.***
