95-26292 Chapman As part of NSF-funded follow-up studies of the Comet Shoemaker-
Levy 9 impact on Jupiter in July 1994, Dr. Chapman will focus on the luminous
first seconds and minute of the fragment impacts -- when the fragment kinetic
energies were converted into complex explosions, from which all other observed
phenomena ensued. The basis for his investigation will be imaging data obtained
with NASA's Galileo spacecraft, combined with other relevant earth-based data
sets. As part of this work, Dr. Chapman and his team will reduce the full
Galileo imaging data set. The investigation's chief objectives are to understand
the origin of the spikes in the impact light curves. Questions that Dr. Chapman
will address are these: "Are the spikes due to the crashing of the comet
fragments?" "Were there additional fragments, in addition to the roughly 20
major ones?" "Can the spikes be explained by multi-component models for the
comet fragments?" **
