This project promotes a way to encourage undergraduate work on "real-world"
problems culled from sources outside the academic environment. Funds will
support a workshop/symposium on undergraduate consultancy programs to bring
together those with experience in consultancy programs, those who wish to start
such programs, and representatives from industry, business, and government. Not
only is there growing evidence of the educational merit of such activity, but it
has the added advantage of tying more closely the non-academic world with the
world of undergraduate mathematics. This fosters a greater appreciation of the
role which mathematics plays in solving problems which routinely arise in
situations where the applicability of mathematics is not fully understood. This
workshop will take an important first step in extending the opportunity offered
by consultancy work, in a curricular context, to a much wider population of
undergraduates. Until now, only large institutions with the in-house resources
to support such programs could offer them. Creating organizational
infrastructure and taking advantage of electronic communication are required,
and are available, to open up the opportunities of a vital research-like
activity to small colleges and universities with limited resources.
