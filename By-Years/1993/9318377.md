9318377 Bartschat The research focuses on the collision of electrons and
positrons with atoms and ions. Special attention is paid to spin- dependent,
coherence and correlation effects and the development of reliable numerical
methods to permit the calculation of the scattering observables. Perturbative
and non-perturbative techniques are explored and the reduced density matrix
formalism developed earlier used to provide a systematic description of the
connection between the theory and the experiments. Accurate atomic data will be
generated for applications to stars, lasers and plasmas. ***
