Chemistry (12) The project centers around acquisition of a 300 MHz nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer to enhance the undergraduate laboratory
sciences teaching curriculum. The NMR spectrometer is providing a hands-on
training resource for undergraduate students in six separate chemistry courses.
These courses range from introductory organic chemistry to an instrumental
methods course in physical chemistry. In each case, experiments are being
adapted from the literature which target a specific use of the instrument which
complements the particular course goals. The NMR is also being used in cross-
disciplinary integrated projects that are defined by students' capstone
experiences. The instrument is also being incorporated into an outreach program
to local public schools through teachers who are trained on NMR during in-
service and pre-service programs.
