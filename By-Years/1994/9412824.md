94-12824 Manuccia This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
project will develop a new kind of compact flow sensor and control system,
called the Optical Flow Controller (OFC), for use in chemical vapor deposition
(CVD) and other semiconductor processing operations. Phase I successfully tested
a laboratory prototype flow controller that uses a new technique called spectral
correlation detection (SCD). This is an improved variant of infrared absorption
spectroscopy that provides enhanced sensitivity and stability as well as a
simplified optical design. Phase II will provide several alpha-test devices for
later Phase II development. The OFC device is particularly useful when the
analyte is dilute in a carrier gas and is generated by bubbling the carrier
through a liquid phase sample of the analyte. This configuration is commonly
used in organometallic-CVD and other semiconductor processing applications. The
OFC technology is expected to find wide application in commercial manufacture of
semiconductor devices, optical components, and thin films.
