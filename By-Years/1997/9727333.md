9727333 Grassl A major international scientific conference will be convened to
review the World Climate Research Program (WCRP), the research component of the
World Climate Program (WCP). Conference participants will include scientists
from the United States and other countries involved in the WCRP and its
component research projects; science administrators involved in management and
oversight of the WCRP and its projects; and users of the scientific results of
the WCRP and its projects. The conference will review scientific progress of the
WCRP and its projects in comparison with the original objectives and plans for
the WCRP and its projects and to determine if these objectives and plans should
be updated or otherwise modified. The conference will prepare recommendations
for such updating and/or modification for consideration by the scientific
community, the international sponsors of the WCRP, and research funding
agencies. The conference will also develop input for the Second
Intergovernmental Meeting on the WCP expected to be convened sometime in 1998.
