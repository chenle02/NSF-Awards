The focus of this research is the use of cobaloxime and cosalen substituted
1,3-dienyl complexes in (4 + 2) cycloaddition reactions. Methodology for
enantio- and exo-selective cycloadditon reactions as well as exo-selective
hetero (4 + 2) routes to dihydropyrans will be developed. The resulting products
will serve as intermediates for the construction of decalone and dihydropyran
containing natural products. With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular
Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Mark E. Welker of the
Department of Chemistry at Wake Forest University. Professor Welker will focus
his work on developing new methodology for the preparation of carbon-containing
rings using C-C bond forming, cycloaddition reactions. The products thus formed
are important intermediates for the preparation of natural products having
interesting biological properties.
