This project will enhance of our understanding of how entrepreneurs cope with
crisis and loss as well as how various resilience factors can facilitate
recovery and rebuilding in communities disrupted by war or other disasters.
Knowledge from this project will significantly inform the development of future
support for entrepreneurs who experience trauma.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project will assess and track the well-being and coping processes of Ukrainian
small business owners displaced by war. Specifically, it will assess personality
and social factors associated with resilience as well as the nature of the
trauma and loss they experienced. Participants will be tracked over the course
of a year and assessed on their current well-being, coping strategies, and
future plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
