The project will take advantage of the opportunity provided by Hurricane Hugo
to study its impact on historical buildings in Charleston, S.C. The study
consists of three parts: 1) a detailed compilation of the structural and other
damages to historic buildings; 2) the identification of the steps taken by
managers and owners of cultural property to reduce vulnerability; and 3) the
effectiveness of the preparedness plans, organizational arrangements and
response capabilities used in the emergency response, salvage and recovery
operations, before and after the hurricane. The identification and assessment of
the measures taken in this case which resulted in the effective mitigation of
damages will benefit those responsible for cultural property in other disaster
prone areas with these measures serving as models.
