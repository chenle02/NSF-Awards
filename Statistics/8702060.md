This reseach will focus on several problems in applied probability and
statistics which stem from biophysical experiments that aim to measure current
flow through ionic channels in cell membranes. This measurements are usually
noisy binary signals; the mathematical model usually used by neurophysiologists
is that the state of the molecule is a Markov jump process with a finite state
space, and that the observed data is a function of that process. The fundamental
reseach questions are: What may be learned about the Markov process from the
observations, and how may it be learned? Other research topics in the area of
nonparametric function estimation and smoothing will also be studied. This
research is in the general area of statistical time series analysis. This
research will focus on developing better methods to get information from data
that can take on only one of two values at any given time, but that can move
from one state to the other as time goes by. Such data is a common result of
biophysical experiments and this research promises to inhance and, to make more
efficient, the accrual of knowledge from biophysical research.
