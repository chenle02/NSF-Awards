Kraft will observe and analyze spectra of about a dozen giant stars in each of
six globular clusters. The goal is a better determination of the oxygen
abundance in these stars. The observations have become possible with the advent
of the Hamilton spectrograph at the 3-meter telescope of Lick Observatory. Most
of the award supports a named graduate student. Globular star clusters were
formed at the time when our Galaxy was formed. Their observation can inform us
of the elements present at that time and the formation of the elements since
then by stars in our Galaxy. Oxygen is one of the elements made in stars and an
element that is most important both for the evolution of aging stars and for
chemistry everywhere. For the first time, new observational facilities permit a
reliable measurement of the oxygen abundance in giant stars within globular star
clusters. Kraft and a graduate student will obtain such measurements and
evaluate the oxygen abundances for stars in six globular star clusters.
