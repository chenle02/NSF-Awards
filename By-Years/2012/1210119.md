This action funds Jonathan Sherette (Jessica Sherette) of The University of
Texas at San Antonio to conduct a research project, entitled "Exploring core
problems in computing the similarity of surfaces," during the summer of 2012 at
Pohang University of Science and Technology in Pohang. The host scientist is
Hee-Kap Ahn.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is in its potential impact for
applications which require computing the similarity of surfaces. These
applications range from problems in computer aided design to ones in
evolutionary biology. In addition, computing the similarity of surfaces is a
theoretically challenging problem with an active research community. This
research project explores core problems in computing the similarity of surfaces
with the aim that a better understanding of the theoretical complexity of these
problems will facilitate innovation in these wide-ranging practical
applications.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
