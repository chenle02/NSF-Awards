The aim of the project is to furnish the Behavioral Neuroscience laboratory,
housed within the Department of Psychology, with high quality light and
darkfield microscopy as well as fluorescent options. The new microscopy
equipment will permit students to carry out retrograde labeling of neurons with
various types of probes, and to conduct classical morphometric studies. Through
the use of video cameras, VCR, framegrabber video board, and editing software,
the laboratory will gain the ability to produce interactive computer programs
combining text with high resolution graphics. The interactive programs are used
to more effectively demonstrate all lab activities, including light microscopy,
dissections, safety protocols, and procedures involving live animals.
