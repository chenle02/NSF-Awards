9451216 Wheeler The project will acquire modern, computer-controlled
voltammetric and amperometric equipment to enable student exposure to
electrochemical principles and applications. Initial development will be in
Analytical, Physical, Biological chemistry courses as well as undergraduate
research. This will allow Furman to markedly improve curriculum in the area of
electrochemistry. Further, the simultaneous application of spectroscopic and
chromatographic methods will serve to amplify the distinct advantages and uses
of such techniques.
