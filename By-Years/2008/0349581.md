This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research proposes to
complete the development of an environmental information system - the Hydro-
Optical Analysis System (HOPAS). HOPAS combines an advanced radiative transfer
model with a powerful nonlinear programming algorithm to enable transforms
&lt;br/&gt;of optical water measurements into information on the composition and
concentration of &lt;br/&gt;materials that effect water quality. For the first
time, measurements of the light field from &lt;br/&gt;satellites, aircraft,
moorings, and ships can be rapidly inverted to obtain accurate estimates of
&lt;br/&gt;phytoplankton, suspended mineral particles, and dissolved materials.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOPAS will enable scientists, environmental engineers, and
aquatic resource managers to use easily obtained in situ or remotely sensed
optical data to understand and manage aquatic ecosystems. HOPAS will alleviate
the need for expensive, labor-intensive laboratory analysis of water samples for
use in addressing water quality issues, including microbial growth in drinking
water supplies, surface pollutants from farms, industries, vessels, and domestic
sources, algal blooms, fisheries and mariculture, and protection of coral reefs
and sea grass beds. &lt;br/&gt;
