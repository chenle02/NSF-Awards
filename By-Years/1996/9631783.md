For the past three decades, the mainstream of linguistics has focused its
research agenda on the formal aspects of language, primarily syntax. By
contrast, the more recent tradition of cognitive linguistics centers its
research directly within the semantic stratum of language in order to observe
how languages organize meaning and structure conception; and it examines the
more formal stratum of language for its role in supporting these semantic
functions. The main goal of this project will be to outline the fundamental
conceptual structuring system of language. Language has a formally distinct
component - that of closed-class forms whose specific role is to serve a
structuring function: for example, schematizing the spatial relations between
entities and the temporal relations between events. In this regard, language is
perhaps unique within the range of cognitive systems such as perception,
reasoning, and affect, so that mapping out the conceptual structuring system of
language may serve as a model for comparable undertakings in the other cognitive
systems. In the book that will result from the research project, the
investigator's work in cognitive linguistics will be extended and integrated.
The analysis of language as a cognitive system will be developed further, and it
will be placed within a theoretical matrix that includes the relation of
language to other cognitive systems.
