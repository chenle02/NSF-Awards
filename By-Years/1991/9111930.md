Professor James Lisy is supported by a grant from the Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program for studies of large clusters of alkali ions with ten or more
molecules of solvation. A study of the competitive binding of ions to water
versus other solvents, the use of vibrational spectroscopy to investigate the
structures of products of intracluster ion chemistry, and the study of solvent
shell structures around halide anions, will be accompanied by Monte Carlo and
molecular dynamics calculations. %%% The interaction between ions and neutral
molecules is of fundamental importance to the understanding of condensed phase
chemistry, ion transport in biological systems and atmospheric chemistry. These
experimental and theoretical studies on isolated clusters, consisting of an ion
and ten or more solvent molecules, are expected to provide the information that
is necessary to formulate our understanding of the nature of the interactions of
ions with the surrounding molecules.
