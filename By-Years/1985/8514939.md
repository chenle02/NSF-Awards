Travel assistance is provided for six foreign scientists and engineers to
participate in the Gordon Research Conference on Reverse Osmosis,
Ultrafiltration, and Gas Separation to be held July 8-12, 1985, at Colby-Sawyer
College, New London, New Hampshire. The purpose of this conference is to bring
together research members and engineers from universities, research foundations,
and industrial laboratories to discuss and exchange ideas in their common field
of interest. The agenda for this meeting consists of discussions in the
following areas: membrane formation/structure-property relationships; membrane
synthesis and preparation; membranes for desalination; other separations with
reverse osmosis membranes; membranes for ultrafiltration; applications of
ultrafiltration membranes; mechanisms for gas separations; liquid-liquid
separations with membranes.
