The project will enhance students' conceptual understanding of organic
chemistry,develop students' scientific problem solving skills, and increase
students' enjoyment of science using an adaptation of the discovery approach of
the new University of Michigan organic chemistry sequence to a format suitable
for a suburban community college. The key modification is the provision for a
more supportive environment to encourage and motivate a very diverse student
population. Computer based tools will be used to provide conceptual organization
and structure to laboratory work and to establish stronger links between the
lecture and laboratory. The computer based organizational shell will combine
visualizations of molecular models and mechanistic animations with spectroscopic
data and laboratory observations to help students build mental models of
chemical phenomena based upon how chemists think at the molecular level. In
classroom and laboratory lectures, faculty routinely will use computer displays
to illustrate basic concepts of organic chemistry and to show the inter-
relationships between theory and experiments. Students will use the software in
the laboratory to better understand the underlying concepts, experimental
design, and analysis of instrumental data.
