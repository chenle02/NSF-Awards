NSF Award Abstract-DMS-0203858 Mathematical Sciences: $L^1$ stability of
hyperbolic conservation laws with geometrical sources and kinetic equations

Abstract

0203858 Ha

This research addresses the stability of weak solutions of hyperbolic
conservation laws and related problems in kinetic theory. Stability will be
studied by constructing explicit Lyapunov functionals. Specific goals are: (i)
establish the stability of weak solutions to hyperbolic conservation laws with
geometric source terms and certain kinetic models with collision terms; (ii)
study the nonlinear stability of shock waves of the Boltzmann equation with
boundary effects, and hydrodynamic limits of some collisional kinetic equations.

Hyperbolic conservation laws with geometric source terms appear in many physical
situations, such as shallow water flow through a channel, nozzle flow through a
duct, and self-similar gas flow in multi-dimensional Euler equations. The issue
of stability of solutions is important in the design of systems modeled by these
equations, which include aircraft and space shuttle engines. The Boltzmann
equation and the Smoluchowski equation are fundamental equations in kinetic
theory. Stability analysis for these equations can be used in development of
accurate methods for numerical simulation of the corresponding physical systems.
