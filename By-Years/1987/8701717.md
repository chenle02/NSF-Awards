This project will investigate the relationship between the theory of locales
and the theory of ideals. The principal investigators will examine the interplay
of ring theory and topology as it relates to spatiality of sublocales and prime
decompositions; closure and coclosure operators on closed posets; localization;
and the development of the theory of modules over a closed poset. The proposed
research is in the area of general algebra. It concerns a study of partially
ordered algebraic structures with the hope of clarifying algebraic and lattice
theoretic aspects of ring theory and topos theory.
