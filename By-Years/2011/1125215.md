This proposal requests funds to partially support the participation of US early
career scientists (within 7 years of earning a Ph.D.) and graduate students at
the XVIII International Union for Quaternary Research Congress. The participants
supported by this grant will be provided the opportunity to present their
research at the Congress, to develop international collaborations, and gain
knowledge of global research initiatives. The proposal presents a clear plan for
advertisement of this funding opportunity, including outreach to a wide range of
disciplines and institutions and members of under-represented groups. Proposal
sets out clear criteria on which to select the award
recipients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The United States is a world leader in
Quaternary research and continued participation by young U.S. scientists it is
vital to sustain this leadership. The XVIII INQUA Congress is a key
multidisciplinary forum for the exchange of scientific information and ideas and
based on feedback from previous travel award recipients, this is an effective
venue to inspire and encourage U.S. students and early career scientists to
effectively address problems with global impact. Effective U.S. participation in
this congress will build international science partnerships and foster future
international collaborations to address problems that are far greater than the
United States can address on its own. This proposal will contribute to the
advancement of science in Quaternary Research and will promote the professional
development of US early career scientists in an international forum.
