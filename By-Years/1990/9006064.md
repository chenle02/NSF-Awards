This is a basic research program concerning semantic models for parallel
programming languages. Initial emphasis is on the design of a mathematical model
of parallel algorithms extending and generalizing earlier work of Berry and
Curien on sequential algorithms and concrete data structures. The model is
intensional, in that the denotation of a program includes information about
parallel computation strategy in addition to information about the extensional
or functional behavior of the program. This allows a novel intensional
strictness ordering on parallel algorithms that plays a fundamental role in our
theory; for instance, application of a parallel algorithm to its arguments is a
continuous operation with respect to this ordering. It will be shown that the
model forms a cartesian closed category in which an elegant account of parallel
functional computation can be given. It will support semantically-based
techniques for proving both traditional (extensional) correctness properties and
efficiency properties that depend on intensional aspects of program behavior.
The intensional information will be used to determine a hierarchical class of
algorithms based on an intuitively reasonable notion of "degree of parallelism".
This idea will provide a framework for assessing the relative expressive powers
of various sequential and parallel primitives. In the long term theoretical
insights gained in this investigation will be in the design of new programming
languages that employ parallelism uniformly and generally, yet whose semantic
properties are well understood, and for which tractable proof methods can be
devised.
