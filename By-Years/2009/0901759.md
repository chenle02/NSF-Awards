The objective of this research is to develop an optimal morphology of vertically
bi-continuous donor and acceptor materials interpenetrating into each other to
achieve high efficiency in organic solar cells. This morphology decouples
absorption depth from diffusion length, allowing effective exciton diffusion to
large interfacial areas as well as vertical charge transport with reduced
recombination. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The proposed
nanoimprint lithography with innovative mold technologies provides a practical
means with greater precision than currently available techniques to make an
optimal solar cell design. The thermal imprinting process can also induce
favorable polymer chain alignment and crystallization, leading to higher hole
mobility and light absorption. By decoupling absorption depth from diffusion
length, a thicker polymer film than in conventional bulk heterojunction devices
can be used to enhance light adsorption considerably. This morphology provides a
basic nano-platform to study the interrelated polymer properties (crystallinity,
mobility, chain orientation, stability, thermal dynamic properties, etc) and
their correlation with geometry, imprint temperature, surface effects, and
device quantum efficiency. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: This study
will establish a comprehensive understanding of the effects of heterojunction
nano-morphology on material properties and device characteristics, which is
transformative to other materials and devices. What may naturally follow is the
demonstration of 7-12% PCE in polymer solar cells. This research will be
integrated with education through available programs at UTD to provide research
opportunities for students. Particularly, this program aims to bring greater
nanotechnology exposure to a broad range of individuals including undergraduates
and the education community on the whole. &lt;br/&gt;
