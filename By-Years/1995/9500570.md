PI: Rabinowitz DMS-9500570 Rabinowitz will investigate the existence of basic
homoclinic solutions of Hamiltonian systems of various types such as singular
systems, systems where there seem to be solutions homoclinic to infinity, and
systems with almost periodic potentials. Once basic homoclinics have been
determined, recent variational methods suggest that one can also find infinitely
many so-called multibump solutions which are near sums of translates of the
basic solutions. This is another question Rabinowitz will pursue. Finally, for
PDE's he will look at some nonlinear wave and Schrodinger equations with almost
periodic potentials. Partial differential equations form a basis for
mathematical modeling of the physical world. The role of mathematical analysis
is not so much to create the equations as it is to provide qualitative and
quantitative information about the solutions. This may include answers to
questions about uniqueness, smoothness and growth. In addition, analysis often
develops methods for approximation of solutions and estimates on the accuracy of
these approximations.
