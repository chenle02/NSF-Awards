It is proposed to synthesize film forming biodegradable polymers, specifically a
series of polylactic and polyglycolic acid copolymers, to serve as primary
vehicles for anti-foul marine coatings. The coatings are non-metal containing
films which will controllably react with sea water at the desired rate to
continuously provide a new surface for further erosion. The products of the
degradation will provide a localized pH unfavorable to barnacle and weed
attachment while not producing pollutants or biological toxins. Additionally the
polymers exhibit excellent abrasion and oil resistance. "In vitro" and "vivo"
testing of coated panels in synthetic and natural sea water should clearly
establish the commercial potential and provide the necessary data for
optimization and scale-up of the polymer synthesis in a follow up study. Based
upon current consumption of anti-foul coatings, approx. 1.5 x 10(8) pounds of
copper and tin are introduced into the world's waterways annually creating
significant environmental problems manifested by polluted harbors and endangered
marine life. Our proposed coatings will allow protection of ships hulls but will
not pollute the oceans. The potential market is worldwide.
