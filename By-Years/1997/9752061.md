To meet the demand for highly trained technicians in photonics (optics, lasers,
fiber optics) improved classroom, texts and tutorial materials in laser and
fiber-optics will be developed and used to train technicians in the Laser and
Fiber-Optic Technology Program (LFOT) at Queensborough Community College (QCC)
and at other institutions in the region. To meet the needs of the industry, the
QCC LFOT advisory board of representatives from local companies will be
consulted throughout the development process. Multimedia courseware, interactive
video, on-line laboratory manuals, remote laboratory access through PC driven
instrumentation and shared facilities, will be used to train technicians at QCC
and other institutions. By making the computer-based materials available on CD-
ROM, students will have access to the computer-based materials with or without
connecting to the QCC physics department network. Students at remote locations
(schools other than QCC) will use the access to the QCC network for direct real-
time contact with instructors and laboratories. The materials developed and
tested at QCC will be used for training of students through distance learning at
Suffolk Community College (SCC). The distance learning approach will then be
expanded to other regional colleges. Student internships will be provided by
industry and research institutions, and their performance evaluated as part of
an ongoing evaluation of the program. Regional and national workshops will be
used to disseminate the materials and help establish similar networks of
colleges nationally.
