This project is a nondestructive testing method based on the use of transient
stress waves, to determine the quality of bond at interfaces in layered
structures, such as in bridge decks with overlays, or at an interface between
repair concrete and the parent concrete in the structure being repaired.
Research includes numerical, laboratory, and field studies to determine which
factors, such as porosity and tensile strength, at an interface have the most
significant effects on the reflection and transmission of stress waves incident
upon the interface. Three- dimensional, dynamic, finite element models will be
used to simulate the impact-echo response of layered structures containing
various interface conditions. These numerical studies will be complemented by
laboratory studies in which specimens with different interface conditions will
be constructed and tested using the impact-echo method. The bond strength at the
interfaces in the specimens will be determined using commercially available bond
test equipment to determine whether any information can be gained through
correlating bond strength at an interface with impact- echo results. The
numerical and laboratory studies will establish the basis for using the impact-
echo technique for determining bond quality in existing structures.
