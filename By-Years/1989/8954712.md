The Exploratorium plans to develop a set of interactive teaching exhibits that
will deal with epidemiology, immunology and virology, and through those
subjects, with AIDS treatment and prevention. The purpose is to provide a
comprehensive description of how the immune system works in the context of AIDS,
and so help people to make rational decisions about personal and social
responses to the disease. The primary thrust will be to supplement the more
general AIDS educational materials by providing an understanding of the
scientific basis of the disease, and to involve the public in the scientific and
educative process, rather than just informing them about the subject.
