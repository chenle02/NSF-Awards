It is proposed to instrument a surface meteorological buoy with temperature
sensors and an acoustic current profiler between 30 and 300 m to measure the
structure of the upper ocean in the Western Pacific Warm Pool. The observations
will take place in late 1992 to early 1993 during the Intensive Observation
Period (IOP) of the Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean Atmosphere
Response Experiment (TOGA COARE). The goal of the experiment is to understand
and describe the oceanic response to Westerly wind bursts and rainfall.
