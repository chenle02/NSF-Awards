With this new award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program A
(CSDM-A) of the Division of Chemistry supports Professor Steven Baldelli of
University of Houston in a project that will use a technique to provide images
of the boundaries between liquids and solids at the molecular level, helping us
to learn how liquids wet surfaces. Although wetting of surfaces by liquids has
been studied for many years, the process is not understood at the molecular
level. The use of this novel imaging technique will provide the basis for a
fundamental understanding of liquid-solid boundaries that will impact areas
including catalysis, materials chemistry, adhesion, and basic surface science.
In addition to university researchers, the project will include high school
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will use surface sum frequency
generation (SFG) imaging to provide spatial and spectroscopic information on
liquid wetting of a heterogeneous surface. The goal of these investigations is
to uncover the molecular basis of processes that rely on interfacial properties.
