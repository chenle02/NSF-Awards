A general purpose, self-consistent ensemble Monte Carlo model will be developed
for two- dimensional high-field transport &amp; ultrafast phenomena in compound
semiconductor devices. A "super-particle" with "cloud-in-cell" charge assignment
scheme for either separate or combined background electron and photo- generated
carrier sub-ensembles, which couples an efficient Poisson solver to the Monte
Carlo algorithm using the evolving distribution functions in a self-consistent
way. The program will employ an adaptive energy scale in combination with a
scheme to reduce self- scattering rate while maintaining resolution of the
energy distribution without a prior assumption on the maximum electron energy.
These feature will enable, for the first time, interactive implementation of
such complex computations on a work-station level platform.
