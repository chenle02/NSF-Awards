The Colorado School of Mines will to establish an Environmental Scanning
Electron Microscope (ESEM) laboratory to meet the growing research and education
needs of the CSM campus. The proposed ESEM laboratory will be a shared-use
facility, with extensive participation from the majority of departments across
campus. The facility will augment the recently established electron microscopy
center in the materials science department, providing a focal point to enrich
undergraduate and graduate education.

In addition, it will serve as a resource facility for local industry. The
proposed to acquire an ESEM equipped with temperature controlled sample stages
(both heated and cooled), as well as energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) for
elemental mapping. This configuration was chosen as the optimum with respect to
maximizing versatility at a reasonable cost. An ESEM retains the performance
advantages of a conventional SEM, but removes the high vacuum (<10-6 torr)
constraints. The ESEM derives its name from its ability to manipulate the sample
environment through a range of pressure (10-6. 20 torr), temperature (-20 - 1000
degrees C), and gas composition. The flexibility offered by this research will
allow it to find widespread use on the CSM campus.
