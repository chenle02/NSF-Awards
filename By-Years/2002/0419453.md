This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project will
develop a miniature implantable, remotely powered, and wireless recording and
stimulating device. The ability to electrically stimulate the nervous tissue
using the same implant with the same electrode arrays would allow for
experimental paradigms involving a real-time feedback loop, where the current
state of the neural area-of-interest serves to modulate the manner in which it
is stimulated.

The commercial application of this project will be in the area of
neuroprosthetics. The neuroprosthetic market is projected to be of the order of
1 billion dollar a year by 2005. There are over 220,000 paraplegics in the
United States and 1 million worldwide who are paralyzed from spinal cord injury
or from multiple sclerosis. Age related macular degeneration and retinitis
pigmentosa affect more than 10 million people around the world. When this
implantable wireless recording and stimulation system becomes available, human
clinical prosthetics designed to cure or alleviate these afflictions will come
one step closer to reality.
