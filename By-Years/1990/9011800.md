This research constitutes the first phase of a project to test theories of
policy making and of mass media effects on the foreign policy process which
predicts changes in policy officials' national security paradigm due to mass
media coverage. The research tests the hypothesis that media coverage of global
environmental change has initiated an institutional adaptive response in the
form of an expansion of the official paradigm of national security to include
environmental threats. In this phase of the research the investigators will
conduct in-depth interviews using both structured open and closed-ended
questions to determine the depth and conditions of the relationship between
media and policy makers paradigm formation, especially between environmental
reporting and national security paradigm formation. Of particular interest will
be questions relating to which media are most effective in influencing
environmental and national security questions, what kinds of issues and under
what conditions do media impact policy maker perceptions, the relationship
between media impact and other factors such as agency, rank, sex, issue and
functional area of responsibility, and appointed versus elected policy makers.
This research should provide valuable insights about the use to which policy
makers make of media inputs on global environmental change.
