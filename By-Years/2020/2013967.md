The broader impact/commercial potnetial of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve hydroponic production of leafy
greens. Growing food indoors hydroponically produces locally grown vegetables
with minimal or no pesticide or herbicide use. A key challenge is the limitation
on crop volume based on farm size. This project will advance a fertilizer that
can grow an additional 10 to 20% more with current space and equipment. It will
have an impact on global farming by increasing crop volume without environmental
impact.

This SBIR Phase I project will explore translation of an innovative method for
trisulfide production for use in fertilizers. Tasks include development of a
simple, one-step synthesis of the fertilizer from inexpensive, commercially
available starting materials. Further work includes investigation of synthesis
parameters for development of a process at the 500 g scale, then further
exploration of the parameter space for eventual industrial production.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
