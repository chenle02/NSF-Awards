This award will support a seminar, "Spectroscopic Characterization of Electrode
Processes," organized jointly by Prof. William R. Heineman of the University of
Cincinnati, Prof. Stanley Pons, University of Utah, and Prof. Katsumi Niki,
Yokohama National University, Japan. Participants will meet in Honolulu, Hawaii,
June 6-9, 1989, to view the current state of the art of spectroscopic
characterization of chemical processes that occur on the surface of electrodes,
as well as new methods of characterizing such surfaces. In addition, new ways of
coupling electrochemistry to spectroscopy, and also future research directions
that may enhance the understanding of electrode processes, will be discussed.
The seminar will bring together electrochemists and experts in surface
characterization in an attempt to see how spectroscopic characteriza- tion of
electrode surfaces by such modern electron spectroscopic techniques as ESCA,
LEEDS, EELS, and Auger spectroscopy before and after electrochemical reactions
occur may be used to better understand those reactions. The seminar may be
expected to yield important results applicable to the improvement of electrodes,
such as, for example, those with tailored surfaces, for use in many types of
industrial and laboratory chemical reactions.
