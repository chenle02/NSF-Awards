Three aspects of the reaction of oxygen with microporous carbons are
investigated in this study: the kinetics of the formation of the surface
complex; the role of hydrogen in the solid; and the influence of structural
characteristics on the kinetics. Steady-state and transient kinetic data are
obtained using thermograivmetric techniques and gas analysis. Chars are
characterized by surface area, micropore volume, and micropore size analysis
from physisorption data. Interpretation of the data requires a site-distribution
model; therefore the study includes a critical analysis of such models. Although
gas-solid reactions are central to many chemical and energy prosesses, they are
poorly understood. This project addresses the issue systematically. The
particular system chosen for study is of vital interest in combustion science.
Improved efficiency and control are possible spinoffs from this work.
