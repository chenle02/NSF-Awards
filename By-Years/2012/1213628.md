In this project, funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division, Ilya Zharov of the University of Utah will
prepare and investigate novel nanostructured proton- and lithium-conducting
membranes, in which ordered inorganic nanopores are surface-modified with well-
defined polymer molecules carrying acidic and/or basic functional groups. The
highly ordered inorganic materials displaying continuous networks of nanopores
that will be investigated are silica colloidal crystals, inverse silica
colloidal crystals and silica-coated anodized alumina. They will serve as solid
matrixes providing mechanical stability and supporting the proton- and ion-
conducting polymers. The architecture of these membranes makes them particularly
suitable for systematic studies needed to understand the ion transport through
polymer brushes inside confined spaces. Structure-property relationships will be
determined for nanopores of different geometry and for polymer brush
architectures prepared by surface-initiated living polymerization inside the
inorganic nanopores. The broader impacts involve interdisciplinary training of
graduate and undergraduate students, recruitment of underrepresented groups in
chemical sciences to participate in the research project, and outreach to local
elementary, middle and high schools through the Natural History Museum of Utah's
Youth Teaching Youth (YTY) program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In practical terms,
proton- and lithium-conducting membranes are key components of fuel cells and
batteries, respectively, and the membranes that will be investigated possess
unique features that are fundamentally different from the traditional
polyelectrolyte or composite organic-inorganic membranes. Therefore, this
research, although fundamental in nature, has the potential to lead to
breakthroughs in energy technology.
