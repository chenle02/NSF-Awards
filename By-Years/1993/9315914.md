9315914 Kaner In this research, metathesis reactions are used to prepare
refractory and electronically and magnetically important materials. These
reactions are effective for the rapid synthesis (< 2 s) of a large variety of
materials. Targeted systems include refractory main group borides, carbides,
nitrides and phosphides and conductive refractory transition metal nitrides and
phosphides and magnetic rare earth phosphides. Additionally, special efforts
will be made to refine methods for the preparation of metastable high
temperature compounds. Further studies will examine the processing of ceramic
materials, specifically studying the effects of varying crystallinity and
particle size on the densification and mechanical properties of hot-pressed
samples. % % % Direct solid-state reactions often are complicated by the need
for long reaction times at elevated temperatures. Metathesis reactions allow the
preparation of materials in seconds. In this research, metathesis reactions are
used to prepare refractory and electronically and magnetically important
materials. The effects of varying crystallinity and particle size on the
densification and mechanical properties of hot-pressed samples will be explored.
