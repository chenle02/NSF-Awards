This Research Opportunities for Women Career Advancement Award is in the general
area of inorganic chemistry. Dr. Linda D. Schultz of Tarleton State University
will study the mechanisms of reaction for alkali metal polytellurides with
transition metal carbonyl compounds using conventional thermal techniques and
pulsed laser flash photolysis. While Dr. Schultz has studied both metal
carbonyls and polytellurides previously, this will be her first investigation
using pulsed laser flash photolysis. The instrumentation is located in Dr.
Gerard R. Dobson's laboratories at the University of North Texas in Denton,
Texas. This award will assist her in establishing an expanded research program
and if the project is successful may enable a proposal for sustained study.
