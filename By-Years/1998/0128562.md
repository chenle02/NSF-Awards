This Small Business Innovation (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate the
feasibility of a computerized projection system to be used in planetariums in
the nation's schools. With such a digital projector, a simulated night sky can
be imaged with the capacity for a multitude of motions and displays surpassing
all but the most sophisticated of museum planetariums. When coupled with
suitable simulation software, information-based technology can be used to
encourage interactive and inquiry-based activities. In addition, the planetarium
projector will have capabilities shared by no other; that is, being able to
project dynamically changing information displays of the earth, including plate
tectonics, weather patterns, and biological distributions.

The system proffered will help promote interdisciplinary studies, use the latest
astronomical and GIS data, and aid in teaching the content of the national
standards, especially earth science at the elementary and middle school level.
