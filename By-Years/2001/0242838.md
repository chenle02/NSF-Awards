This Planning Grant will enable the Ohio State University to address the
shortage of professional engineers in the United States by designing an
engineering curriculum for dissemination through the 4-H system. Planning
activities include the establishment of a nationwide advisory committee,
solicitation of input from the target audience via focus groups and the
development of a plan for the curriculum and its content, designed to address
the needs of young women and underserved groups. Pilot testing of sample units
will occur in Ohio, Louisiana and Indiana. A recruitment plan will also be
developed to aide with national dissemination.
