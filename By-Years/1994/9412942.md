9412942 Islam In the environment, natural cementation of geological formations
occurs constantly over the geological time due to physical, chemical and
biological reactions. The research launches a plan to develop a new technique of
microbial cementation of fissures or fractures of buildings and monuments.
Laboratory-scale experiments are to be used in order to optimize parameters that
govern the microbial cementation process. Laboratory results will then be scaled
up using a numerical simulator and a design for field application will be
completed.
