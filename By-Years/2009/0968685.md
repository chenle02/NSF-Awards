The redox state controls many important chemical reactions in natural systems,
including the reactions in the deep interior of the Earth. The oxidation state
of iron has been extensively used to infer the redox state. It has been well
understood that the upper mantle has reducing redox conditions and thermodynamic
studies have predicted even more reducing conditions in the lower mantle.
However, recent studies at pressure-temperature conditions related to the
topmost lower mantle have shown that about 60% of iron in the dominant lower-
mantle mineral, magnesium silicate perovskite, is ferric. This is very
surprising because only 2% of iron is ferric in upper-mantle minerals. If this
result is extrapolated to the deep lower mantle, it would imply that the lower
mantle is chemically distinct from the upper mantle, which may conflict with
recent seismic tomography evidence of mixing between the upper and lower mantle.

Our preliminary work showed that the oxidation state of iron in mantle silicate
perovskite is strongly coupled with the electronic configuration of iron at high
pressure. As recent studies have shown that the electronic configuration of iron
in mantle minerals changes with depth, our preliminary work implies that the
oxidation state of iron may change with depth as well. In addition, aluminum in
silicate perovskite can influence the oxidation state of iron. In this project,
we will combine experiment (Shim) and theory (Morgan) to measure how the
oxidation state of iron in lower-mantle silicate perovskite changes with depth
and composition. In the experimental effort, we will measure the oxidation state
of iron by controlling the redox state of the sample chamber to that of the
lower mantle at high pressure-temperature. We use ab-initio based techniques,
which solve the fundamental quantum mechanical equations for the material, to
predict reaction energies and volumes as a function of composition, pressure,
and temperature. This joint effort will provide graduate students and postdocs
with new opportunities to combine experimental and theoretical approaches.
