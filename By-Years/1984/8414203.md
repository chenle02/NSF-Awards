This project aims to upgrade the experimental capability presently available at
the University of North Carolina at Charlotte and to conduct investigations to
evaluate liquefaction behavior of soils. A new cyclic multiaxial soil test
device will be assembled for the experimental study. The results of the
experimental tests will help to improve the constitutive relations of soils and
provide engineering parameters for practical evaluation of liquefaction
phenomena.
