The project will organize symposia at the Fall 1993, 1994, and 1995 National
American Chemical Society Meetings to report, by the appropriate Principal
Investigators, results from projects supported by the NSF Instrumentation
programs. The choice of presentations will be made via review of abstracts
submitted as the result of solicitation to former Principal Investigators in
these programs. This project will fulfill the desired broad dissemination of
information and resources developed at the host institutions.
