Description: This project supports participation of 12 U.S. scientists in an
Indo-U.S. joint workshop on material processing, thin films and applications.
The objectives of the workshop are to identify fields of research of mutual
interest in the area of material synthesis, process development and
applications, and to plan outlines of joint research projects by institutes in
the two countries. Topics to be covered include: Deposition technologies with
emphasis on plasma assisted techniques; material properties for thin and thick
films including tribological, optical, optoelectrical, and semiconductor
properties; and current technological applications of candidate materials in
specific fields, including mechanisms of failure of coatings and relation to
material properties. Scope: The workshop is in an area of great interest to the
U.S. and India and where applications are being developed worldwide at a rapid
rate. The topics of the workshop are current, and the U.S. P.I is a leader in
research in this field. Other proposed U.S. participants are well established
researchers who, along with the Indian counterparts, should ensure a successful
outcome of the meeting. A report of the results will be produced.
