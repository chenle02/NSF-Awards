The ubiquity of multi-core processors has brought parallel computing squarely
into the mainstream. It is now essential to develop parallel implementations of
a large number of existing sequential codes. The difficulty of programming these
architectures to effectively tap the potential of multiple on-chip processing
units is a significant challenge. Although there has been significant progress
in compiler techniques towards automatic parallelization, the current state-of-
practice leaves much to be desired. The pressing need for systematic, general,
and effective theoretical foundations for such efforts is a major motivation for
this project.

This project will build on some very recent developments using polyhedral models
showing great promise for developing effective automatic parallelization
frameworks for multi-core architectures. With the polyhedral model, it is
possible to reason about the correctness of complex loop transformations in a
completely mathematical setting using powerful machinery from linear algebra and
linear programming. This enables effective integrated transformation, and
therefore can be the basis for developing a very powerful automatic
parallelization framework that can target different multi-core platforms. The
project will address a number of key issues that are very important in
developing an automatic parallelization and data locality optimization framework
that is effective over a range of user application codes: (i) model-driven
search for determination of effective tile sizes and loop fusion choices; (ii)
extended tiling approaches like overlapped/split tiles to enhance concurrency;
(iii) automatic generation of parallel code for accelerators with multiple
distinct address spaces; and (iv) development of an extensive benchmark suite
for assessment of automatic parallelization systems. The developed software will
be made publicly available.
