This project will investigate foundational problems in algebraic geometry and
related areas of mathematics. Algebraic geometry is the study of solutions to
polynomial equations; it has many applications in other areas of mathematics,
the sciences, and engineering. The project will focus on the structure of
algebraic transformations over arbitrary fields and real and complex analytic
transformations. The results of this research have potential for practical
application to computer science.

The research in this project is in the areas of commutative algebra, algebraic
geometry, valuation theory, and singularity theory. The local structure of
algebraic and analytic mappings will be investigated, especially with regard to
ramification and good stable forms of mappings after enough blowups along a
valuation or an Ã©toile. Motivating problems are local uniformization, resolution
of singularities and equisingularity in positive characteristic, and the global
structure of algebraic and analytic maps.
