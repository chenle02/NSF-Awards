The objective of this proposal is to develop direct image reconstruction methods
for optical tomography. Optical tomography is an emerging biomedical imaging
modality that uses multiply-scattered light as a probe of tissue structure and
function. The project will involve three components. (i) We will develop direct
reconstruction methods, based on the inverse Born series, for recovering the
absorption and diffusion coefficients of the radiative transport equation and
the diffusion equation from boundary measurements. We will characterize the
convergence, approximation error and stability of the proposed methods. (ii) We
will develop fast reconstruction algorithms based on the inverse Born series.
The algorithms will be designed to be used with data sets as large as 10^8
measurements. The algorithms will be tested using numerically simulated forward
data and experimental data obtained from a noncontact optical tomography system.
(iii) We will explore direct inversion methods for related inverse problems that
share a common mathematical structure with optical tomography. In particular, we
will develop and analyze reconstruction methods, based on inversion of the Born
series, for electrical impedance tomography and for the Maxwell equations in the
near-field.

One of the grand challenges in biomedical imaging is to develop high-resolution
methods for imaging of physiological and molecular function. The long-term goal
of this research is to contribute to the solution to this problem by developing
the necessary mathematical tools. The ability to detect and characterize disease
at much earlier stages than is currently possible would be transformative and is
critically linked to the development of robust and accurate image reconstruction
algorithms for functional imaging. Two graduate students and an undergraduate
will be trained to function in this interdisciplinary environment. The results
of the research will be broadly disseminated and computer codes will be made
publicly available for noncommercial use.
