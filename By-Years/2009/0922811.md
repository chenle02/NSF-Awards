This award will support the acquisition of a computer cluster which will be used
by six faculty members in the Department of Physics at Oakland University to
support their research in fields ranging from materials science to the
electrical properties of the heart, from the formation of black holes to the
nonlinear dynamics of tumor growth, and from spintronics to nanotechnology. The
common thread relating all these projects is that they are computationally
demanding. This computer cluster will have an impact in achieving the research
and education goals of Oakland University. The main contribution will be in
student research, at both the graduate and undergraduate levels.
