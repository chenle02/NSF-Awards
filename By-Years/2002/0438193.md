This proposal is a three-year RUI project to implement "AgentTeamwork", a mobile
agent-based middleware system for coordinating distributed jobs in a
computational community of computer owners. Each mobile agent represents a
client user by carrying client job requests, searching for resources available
for a given request, executing the job at suitable computers, and migrating it
to other resources when needed. All the features of job migration will be
encapsulated in a user program wrapper implemented on a Java layer between a
mobile agent and the corresponding user program.&lt;br/&gt;The wrapper captures
all execution state of the user program, and is carried by the agent upon a job
migration. A user program is preprocessed with JavaCC and ANTLR to interact with
its corresponding wrapper at run time. Previous work has implemented a mobile-
agent execution platform, mobile agents running on top of this platform, a user
program wrapper, and a inter-process communication library. The main objective
of this proposed project is to complete the implementation, tie-in a language
preprocessor, evaluate system performance, and disseminate the system and its
design techniques to the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
