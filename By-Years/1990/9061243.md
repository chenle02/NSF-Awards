Fine, ultrapure, spherical particles are desirable starting materials for
producing high performance afvanced ceramic products. AeroChem has a unique
flame synthesis process for preparing such high quality powders, including
silicon nitride. This process differs from the usual combustion synthesis in
that no oxygen is used: the particle-producing reactants also support the flame.
For silicon nitride, silane, ammonia, hydrazine, and nitrogen are burned on a
flat flame burner. A high quality powder is produced of which a sample, without
additives, was successfully subjected to hot isostatic pressing. However, the
use of hydrazine makes the process commercially unacceptable because of the
cost, explosive nature, and toxicity of hydrazine. While thermodynamic and other
considerations indicate that ammonia should support a flame without hydrazine
present, we have not been able to operate without some hydrazine. A computer
modeling study is proposed to understand why the ammonia/silane system does not
support a flame under the conditions which have been employed, and to define the
conditions under which a flame could be supported. Experiments will then be
performed to determine the practical feasibility of operating under the defined
conditions. Successful completion of this program would make available for
advanced ceramic manufacture a higher quality powder than is currently
available. The final product of the proposed research would be an economical
process for the preparation of a high quality silicon nitride powder for use in
advanced ceramics. Present progress in advanced ceramics is limited by the
unavailability of a US made high quality powder.
