The objective of this research is to identify the neural circuitry involved in
value-based decision-making. The experiments to be conducted involve a unique
subject group -- participant-patients with intractable epilepsy who have
undergone implantation of intracranial electrodes for periods of up to two weeks
in attempts to identify the locus of seizures using EEG-like recordings. These
implants enable direct recording of neural activity of regions of the brain
region - in the present study in the region known as the amygdala. Subjects will
respond to decision making tasks designed to test specific hypotheses of
decision-making. The project is organized into three major aims: 1) to record
the neural coding of primitive economic variables such as reward probability and
magnitude, 2) to record the neural coding of risk and ambiguity, and 3) to
ascertain the impact of microstimulation of specific locations in the brain on
observed preferences. Because of its relatively precise temporal and spatial
characteristics, microstimulation is a particularly powerful tool for
establishing causal relationships between physiologically characterized neurons
and behavioral performance. This project has the potential to fundamentally
impact our understanding of how economic decisions are made.
