The NSF Summer Institute on Microscale Organic Laboratory Techniques is designed
to assist faculty who contemplate undertaking this type of laboratory approach
by introducing them to the experimental methods involved. The Institute is
organized around a framework of lecture-demonstrations, laboratory exercises,
and informal group discussions of microscale techniques. "Hands- on" laboratory
experience is emphasized with particular attention paid to manipulative
procedures involved in preparation, isolation, purification, and
characterization of reaction products at the milligram level. The first Summer
Institute on Microscale Organic Laboratory Techniques was conducted in 1986 with
funding from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. The NSF Undergraduate Faculty
Enhancement Program funded the 1988 Institute. Bowdoin has successfully
supported the 1987 Institute and received funding for the 1989 and 1990
Institutes from the Pew Charitable Trust.
