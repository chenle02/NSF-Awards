This project aims at studying the relationship between Teichmuller theory and
quantum invariants of knots and three-manifolds. The Teichmuller space, defined
as the space of hyperbolic metrics on a surface up to isotopy, is a key object
in understanding the geometry and ultimately the topology of low-dimensional
manifolds. Its quantization, giving rise to the so-called quantum Teichmuller
space, finds its origin in mathematical physics, more specifically in the study
of 2+1 quantum gravity. Two approaches will be developed in understanding this
connection more deeply. The first approach will consist in studying the
possibility of constructing a finite dimensional modular functor associated to
the representation theory of the quantum Teichmuller space. If this approach is
successful, it would lead to the construction of a family of representations of
the mapping class groups of punctured surfaces and ultimately to the
construction of a topological quantum field theory. The second approach will
consist in studying the relationship between the quantum Teichmuller space and
the skein algebra of arcs and links developed recently by the PI and a
collaborator. The possible connections between the two points of view is
expected to be similar to the relationship between the geometrical and the
combinatorial approach to SU(2)-TQFT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study
of three-manifolds is in essence the study of the possible shapes of the
universe and as such sits naturally at the intersection of mathematics and
theoretical physics. The subject experienced several major breakthrough in the
past thirty years following two a priori unrelated approaches: one coming from
the study of the possible geometries a three-manifold admits and the other
coming from mathematical physics and the notion of quantum invariants. In recent
years, numerous results and conjectures have aimed at reconciling the two points
of view. The PI intends on studying these connections further with the goal of
translating methods from one to the other.
