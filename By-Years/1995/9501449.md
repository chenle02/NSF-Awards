9501449 Schneider This is a career award for young engineering investigators.The
object of this project is to develop practical and economical alternative
details for the fully welded and the partially- constrained moment-resisting
connection. Clearly, from the observed performance of steel connections during
the Northridge earthquake, it is essential to provide ductility for the bottom
flange. Therefore, this research proposes several viable connection alternatives
to be investigated analytically and experimentally. Results from the one-year
Northridge research program will be used to determine appropriate prototype
frames and appropriate structural steel sizes for testing. The primary focus of
the research is the experimental performance of alternate details for steel
beam-to column connections. A series of large-to full-scale near-real-time
cyclic deformation tests will be performed on tee-shaped beam-column specimens
using a 110 kip hydraulic actuator to deform the tip of the cantilevered beam.
Deformations will be imposed at approximately the same frequency as a beam-to
column joint might experience during the seismic vibration of a structural
frame. Also a series of earthquake simulator tests will be conducted to
investigate true dynamic behavior of the joints. Results from this research will
have a great impact within the earthquake engineering comity. The near-real time
full-scale tests will begin to resolve some of the differences between joint
damage noted after the Northridge earthquake and typical joint performance
observed in the laboratory. Connection alternatives will be tested in an effort
to improve the ductility of the connection, and relieve some of the high stress
concentrations associated with the highly confined region of the joint. ***
