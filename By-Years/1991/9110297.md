The power of three message context modification techniques: priming, planning
and participation, to enhance the effectiveness of risk communication, will be
tested. Priming is the provision of message-relevant information prior to
receipt of the target message. Planning refers to cognitive and behavioral
activities engaged in by the audience, whether singly or in groups. The purpose
of planning is improved hazard management. Participation refers to interaction
among persons acting as a problem-solving team. The objectives of the project
are to: (1) assess the efficacy of the Involvement/Relevance/Ability context
modification approach to risk communication improvement within an interactive
process, (2) to assess the relative efficacy of the two approaches to risk
communication improvement both when attempting to reduce public concern about a
risk and when attempting to increase public concern about a risk. Results from
this study will contribute to the development of risk communication theory and
improved risk communication practice.
