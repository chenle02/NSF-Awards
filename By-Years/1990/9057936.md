Numerical solution of partial differential equations is one of the most
computationally difficult tasks in existence, so only the most efficient
algorithms can be used. The actual numerical formulas used in the algorithms are
fairly well understood by now, but the computational issues arising from
geometrical issues are less so. One line of research is intended to determine
the proper handling of grids for partial differential equations. Solution
techniques such as finite element methods require the subdivision of the
geometric domain into small polygonal elements. This research will establish the
best ways to carry out this subdivision, especially when the domain has a
complicated shape. It will determine the proper method to partition the domain
among processors of a parallel computer. Boundary element techniques show great
promise for handling complicated geometries. They are receiving recent attention
because of their newly-discovered links to wavelet transformations. The research
seeks new algorithms that will speed up boundary element calculations.
