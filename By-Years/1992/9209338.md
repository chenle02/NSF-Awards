The overall objective of this Research Initiation Award grant is to understand
how hot-electron degradation impacts circuit and system performance. In order to
evaluate the reliability of different circuit classes, a hierarchical framework
will be formulated. Within this functional classification, fundamental
subcircuits, along with their key performance parameters and typical operating
conditions will be identified. Using analytical modeling, numerical circuit and
reliability simulations, and experimental measurements, the specific
relationship between subcircuit performance and individual device degradation
will be established. Based on these results, new hot-electron reliability
criteria will be formulated that are based on circuit and system performance
requirements. In addition, general guidelines will be created for designing hot-
electron reliability into circuits. These goals will allow future VLSI circuits
and technologies to be developed for maximum performance and reliability.
