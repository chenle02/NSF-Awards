9354655 Ross The objective of this project is the design and development of an
infrastructure around which formal laboratories in computer science can be
implemented. The central component of the infrastructure is a software system
called DYNALAB, for DYNAmic LABoratory. DYNALAB will run on Macintosh and IBM-
compatible personal computers, as well as X-terminals connected to central
computers. Students using DYNALAB will have access -- through a user interface
oriented towards complete novices -- to a comprehensive, easily modifiable, and
extendible library of programs and experiments, including experiments in program
structure (e.g., iteration, selection, recursion, execution-path determination,
parameter passing mechanisms, functions, procedures, and so forth), black box
determination of algorithms, time complexity, space complexity, program
verification, and others. A sophisticated program animation component will allow
the execution of programs both forwards and in reverse, while displaying
dynamically and in interactive fashion the pertinent aspects of program
execution, such as the currently executing statement, values of variables,
pointer references, and statement and memory cell counts (for time and space
complexity experiments). An algorithm animation component will allow abstract
graphical representations of algorithms to be presented on a screen in forward
and reverse modes for algorithm studies. The desirability of formal laboratories
in the computer science curriculum is well-documented, but few institutions have
incorporated them for lack of laboratory resources. It is expected that DYNALAB
will be widely adopted as a tool around which computer science laboratories can
be designed.
