This research examines the asymmetric functionalization of alkenes and ketones
by square-planar palladium(II) catalysts containing mono- and bi-dentate chiral
ligands. Yield and enantioselectivity of the catalyzed oxidation of
monosubstituted olefins, oxidation of acyclic and cyclic ketones and the
halogenation of olefins will be determined as functions of catalyst composition
and reaction parameters, principally hydrogen ion concentration. New synthetic
methodologies based on the palladium(II) catalyzed asymmetric functionalization
of different alkenes will be developed and optimized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With
this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the
research and educational activities of Dr. Patrick Henry of the Chemistry
Department of Loyola University of Chicago. Professor Henry's research will
focus on elucidating the mechanism by which palladium(II) complexes catalyze the
asymmetric oxidation and halogenation of different alkenes. New synthetic
methodologies, in some cases, capable of one-step syntheses of asymmetrically
functionalized alkenes will be tested and optimized. Professor Henry's
educational activities involve the training of postdoctoral students.
