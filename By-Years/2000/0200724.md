Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Przebinda&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this project is to
study the characters and matrix coefficients of the representations of the
classical groups from the view point of the theory of reductive dual pairs. In
particular of interest are formulas for the characters in terms of the natural
moment maps, and the wave front sets. Regarding the matrix coefficients, the
central question is to decide which absolutely integrable positive definite
matrix coefficients have positive integral, and corollaries regarding the
preservation of unitarity under Howe's correspondence.&lt;br/&gt;We shall apply
the ideas sketched above to signal processing. Specifically we are interested in
the information compression and denoising of signals which are well balanced in
the time-frequency domain. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
