Abstract of Grant Proposal

In this proposal the researcher will study the geometry, asymptotic behavior,
conformal structure and topology of properly embedded minimal and constant mean
curvature surfaces in the 3-dimensional Euclidean space and in a general simply-
connected homogeneous 3-manifolds X. There are several goals of the proposal
which include: (1) To classify the asymptotic behavior of complete embedded
constant mean curvature surfaces of finite topology in 3-dimensional Euclidean
space, and more generally, in a general X. (2) To prove that the moduli space
M(X) of constant mean curvature spheres in X is an interval parametrized by the
mean curvature function and consists entirely of index-1 spheres (this interval
has an end point with an index-0 sphere in the case X the the product of a round
sphere with R). (3) When X is homeomorphic to 3-dimensional Euclidean space,
then the spheres in M(X) are embedded and can be chosen to give rise to a
foliation of the space X punctured in a single point. (4) When X is homeomorphic
to 3-dimensional Euclidean space, then solutions to the isoperimetric problems
in X are unique and bounded by the spheres in M(X). Related theoretical
techniques concerning compactness, removable singularities results, regularity
and convergence of embedded minimal and constant mean curvature surfaces of
locally bounded genus will be investigated as well. Another main goal is to
understand the existence and nonexistence of complete, bounded embedded minimal
and constant mean curvature surfaces in Euclidean 3-space and in other
3-dimensional manifolds.

Classical minimal and constant mean curvature surface theory has its roots
in18-th and 19-{th century mathematics. Minimal surfaces are the first important
two dimensional examples of what is called the calculus of variations, first
described by Euler around 1735; constant mean curvature surfaces were first
studied by Delaunay in 1835 also represent important examples in the calculus of
variations. Physically minimal surfaces can be modeled locally as soap films on
wires or by surfaces of least-area relative to their local boundaries;
physically constant mean curvature surfaces can be modeled locally as soap films
on wires with a constant pressure difference on each side. Minimal surfaces play
an important role as a tool in the study of 3-dimensional topology and
Riemannian geometry. The research in this proposal concerns global and local
properties of embedded minimal and constant mean curvature surfaces and possible
applications of these results to basic research in three-dimensional topology
and geometry. In part because of the important connections with other areas of
mathematics and the ease in which it is possible to make computer graphics
pictures of beautiful classical examples, minimal and constant mean curvature
surfaces continue to be one of the principal topics for popular science articles
and public science exhibits. Thus, indirectly, the exciting research problems
outlined in this proposal help bring many young scientists and mathematicians to
the frontiers of research.
