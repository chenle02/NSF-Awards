This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support from the NSF MRI-R2 program has
allowed the purchase of a Beckman Coulter MoFlo XDP cell sorter, a BD Pathway
885 High-Content Bioimager, and a Miltenyi Gentle Macs Dissociator, and related
equipment to support research focused on understanding the biodynamics of
molecular interactions leading to cellular differentiation. This
interdisciplinary effort integrates faculty, post-doctoral and student
researchers in the disciplines of biochemistry, immunology, physiology,
molecular cell biology, neurobiology and plant biology. Results of studies
planned for this suite of instruments will allow specific subsets of T cells to
be identified, separated, cultured, and their interactions with specific
activating and inhibiting factors imaged in real time. The differential effects
of growth factors on freshly isolated subpopulations of dorsal root ganglion
neurons grown on carbon and magnetic nanotube substrates will be characterized.
The uptake of plant lectins and fluorescent nanocrystals by pulmonary and immune
cells in intact animals and the subsequent effects of this absorption on
cellular molecular dynamics will be characterized. The equipment will also be
used to support science education outreach to high school, undergraduate and
graduate students. ASU has active NSF-funded REU, URM, GK-12, and Louis Stokes
Minority Alliance programs, as well as a recently funded McNair project, that
focus on recruiting, retaining and enhancing the educational experience of
students of under-represented minorities. Many of these students are actively
participating in research projects in the PIs labs. To further broaden potential
impacts, training and applications seminars will be held in addition to
integrating these technologies into our Molecular Biosciences PhD techniques
courses in immunology and microscopy. Enhanced research capabilities will
strengthen the University's effort to recruit and retain minority students,
faculty, and collaborators who might otherwise choose other universities or
other disciplines to study. Results from the studies will be published in peer-
reviewed journals and presented by students and faculty at regional and national
meetings.
