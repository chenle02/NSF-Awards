We will analyze the features of membrane proteins which determine their
arrangement within the lipid bilayer. We will use fusions of the periplasmic
protein, alkaline phosphatase (AP), to the integral E. coli membrane protein,
MalF. Our results so far show that such fusions allow a reading-out of the
information within a membrane protein that is important for its topology. We
will use oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis to alter sequences within such
fusions and examine the effect on topology. Specific features of the protein
which will be examined for their importance in determining topology are 1) the
charged amino acids within cytoplasmic or periplasmic domains; 2) the charge
distribution between periplasmic and cytoplasmic domains surrounding a membrane-
spanning segment; 3) the length of membrane-spanning segments; and 4) the
possible interaction between membrane-spanning segments.
