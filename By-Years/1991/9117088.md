The focus of this research is the formation of polycyclic ring systems by the
interaction of alpha-diazo alkynyl substituted ketones with various transition
metals. The initially formed ketocarbenoid intermediate is projected to undergo
an intramolecular addition to the acetylenic pi-bond to produce a vinylcarbenoid
intermediate. The latter will be probed to study the potential for insertion
into C-H bonds, addition to pi-bonds, 1,2-hydrogen and alkyl group migration and
electrocyclization. %%% With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is
supporting the research of Dr. Albert Padwa of the Department of Chemistry at
Emory University. Professor Padwa will focus his work on the development of new
synthetic methods for the production of carbenoid intermediates and, thus, the
preparation of unusual polycyclic ring systems.
