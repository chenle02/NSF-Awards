Economics (82)&lt;br/&gt;In recent years there has been growing concern that the
teaching of economics is lagging behind other disciplines in implementing
innovations that engage students more actively in the learning process. To
address this problem, our project is exploring a set of previously-NSF-funded
teaching innovations from STEM disciplines that have demonstrated success, in
terms of instructor use, student learning, and professional research, and is
investigating their adaptability into economics education. The project is making
significant intellectual contributions to the economics education knowledge base
by: (1) undertaking a comprehensive analysis of six well-developed teaching
innovations in STEM disciplines and applying them to economics education; (2)
field-testing these teaching innovations, with a special focus on assessing the
applicability of these innovations in economics, the linkages between modern
learning theory and classroom experience, and the incorporation of new
assessment techniques; and (3) providing an external review of our analysis and
assessment of class-based field-testing by experts in economic education and
STEM-related fields.
