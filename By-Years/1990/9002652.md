Comparison of the amino acid sequences of plant vacuolar proteins indicates
that there is no sequence in common among these proteins which can be solely
responsible for targeting to vacuoles. Therefore, the study of sorting signals
from different proteins will be required to understand the structural
determinants involved in this process. Gramineae lectins, which are vacuolar
proteins, are among the best characterized plant proteins. Amino acid sequences,
3-D protein structures, and cDNAs for these lectins are available. Transgenic
tobacco plants and suspension cultures have been obtained which correctly
express and process barley lectin. The goals of this research for the next five
years include the analysis and characterization of protein sequences responsible
for sorting to the vacuole and the identification of a putative receptor (or
receptors) which recognizes these sorting sequences and subsequently mediates
protein transport to vacuoles. The vacuolar sorting signal of the barley lectin
proprotein will be identified and analyzed. Once the sorting signal is
identified, the following questions will be addressed: 1) What is the shortest
sequence capable of redirecting a reporter protein to the vacuole? 2) What are
the specific amino acids within the sorting domain that are responsible for
correct targeting? 3) Is secondary structure of the sorting signal important?
The characteristics of binding of probarley lectin to its putative receptor(s)
will also be determined. Maintenance of separate subcellular compartments in
eukaryotic cells depends on the correct sorting and targeting of newly
synthesized proteins. Thus, mechanisms must exist in the cell to assure that
these proteins are targeted to the correct intracellular membranes. In plants,
many proteins are deposited in multifunctional organelles called vacuoles. These
proteins contribute to the lysosomal, storage, and plant defense functions of
the vacuole. The goal of this research is to understand the mechanisms by which
proteins are targeted to the plant cell vacuole. The results will contribute
important new information on this important problem in plant cell biology.
