In recent years environmental concerns about anthropogenic perturbations to the
earth's middle atmosphere have led to the development of many radiative
photochemical-dynamical coupled models to study basic chemical and physical
processes and their long term effects. This grant aims to develop an improved
computer model of infrared radiative cooling/heating based on recent research by
the principal investigator. Research on radiative damping in the middle
atmosphere will be performed to investigate its importance in wave mean-flow
interactions. Related work will focus on improving our understanding of gravity
wave saturation by studying gravity waves radiating from a region of wave
forcing in the vicinity of a critical level through geostrophic adjustment or
instability. Finally, an effort will be made to understand why ground-based
microwave measurements of mesospheric H2O seasonal concentration variation
inconsistent with SME derived semiannual variations of 03. The H measurements
show very large semiannual variations which are consistent with SME derived
semiannual variations of 03 densities at 80km, while the inferred O
concentrations at 80 km show a predominantly annual variation well correlated
with the H2O measurements but, on the basis of current photochemical theory,
inconsistent with the seasonal H 03 density variation.
