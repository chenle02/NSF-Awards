This award is for the partial support of the Southeastern-Atlantic Regional
Conference on Differential Equations (SEARCDE) that has met annually since 1981.
Conferences traditionally cover broad range of topics in the areas of ordinary
and partial differential equations, numerical methods, inverse problems and
provide a necessary forum for communication and collaboration between senior and
junior investigators.
