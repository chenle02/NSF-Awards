Eastern New Mexico University is establishing a connection to NSFNET via a
56,000 bits per second line through the New Mexico TECHNET state network and the
WESTNET mid-level network. The connection enhances collaborations of campus
scientists with colleagues at other institutions in fields such as chemistry,
geology, anthropology, and the social and behavioral sciences, and allows access
to libraries and other remote facilities throughout the internet. This award
funds part of the costs for two years.***
