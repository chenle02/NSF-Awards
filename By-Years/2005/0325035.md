Value Sensitive Design is an emerging approach to information and computer
system design that seeks to account for human values in a principled and
comprehensive manner throughout the design process. The purpose of this project
is to extend and validate Value Sensitive Design on a large scale. Value
Sensitive Design will be applied across five research strands: (1) personal
robots in human lives; (2) plasma display technologies; (3) children and
information systems; (4) large-scale computer simulation for urban environments
("UrbanSim"); and (5) industry contexts, specifically, Sun Microsystems,
Microsoft, and Openwave. Along with stand-alone scientific contributions within
each strand, the research will address the following hard but tractable problems
for integrating values into the design of information and computer systems:
handling diverse values, including privacy, intellectual property, civil rights,
security, accessibility, physical health, freedom from bias, and trust; handling
diverse populations and technologies; accounting for cultural diversity;
developing an integrative and iterative methodology; adapting to an industry
context; providing evaluation metrics; and providing means to transfer the
methodology to others in academia and industry. This project aims to shape the
IT design and development process such that the next generation of IT can
pervasively enhance human lives, on the individual and societal level.
