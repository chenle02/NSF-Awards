This project aims to study the structure and dynamics of high latitude auroral
arcs using data from the Sondrestrom incoherent scatter radar and an all-sky
imaging photometer. The study will also make use of simultaneous and coincident
low and mid-altitude in-situ satellite measurements of plasmas and fields to
quantify electrodynamic parameters involved in magnetosphere-ionosphere
coupling. The main objectives of this project are to study (1) the electrical
structure near high latitude arcs with emphasis on the relative motion between
the arc and the ambient plasma, (2) the relationship between radar, optical and
satellite signatures of arcs, and (3) quiet time temporal and spatial variations
of auroral structures. A future campaign is planned in which radar and optical
measurements will be made in coordination with overpasses of the NASA FAST Small
Explorer satellite.
