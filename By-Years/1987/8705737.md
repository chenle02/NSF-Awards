Soils are often loaded to such high stresses that the individual particles
break. Examples include soils adjacent to driven pile foundations and soils used
in large rock filled dams. The theories used to predict the response of these
soils to loading do not include the effects of particle crushing. The principal
investigator has performed preliminary work that establishes the importance of
particle crushing and now proposes to perform experimental and theoretical
studies to develop models.
