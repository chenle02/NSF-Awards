The University of Virginia WICAT research site focuses on technology to support
Rapid Configuration of Wireless Systems. The proposed research plan will focus
on two activities important to serving mobile users in a large enterprise that
requires user security. The proposed research relates to the special interests
of the National Reconnaissance Office who is a member of the WICAT I/UCRC at the
University of Virginia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A successful completion of the
proposed research will make a significant contribution to improving the
knowledge base for secure mobile computing. The proposed activities will provide
all sites with an expanded set of data and results to complement their component
technology results. The proposed effort will also broaden currently provided
opportunities to achieve greater diversity by creating additional invited
student interactions across the WICAT research institutions. &lt;br/&gt;
