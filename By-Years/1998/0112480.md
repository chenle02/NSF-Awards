EAR-0112480&lt;br/&gt;Elmore&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial
funding for the operation and maintenance of the Purdue Rare Isotope Measurement
Laboratory (PRIME Lab), a multi-user national facility supported by NSF to
provide accelerator-based mass spectrometry (AMS) capabilities in measuring the
cosmogenic nuclides 10Be, 14C, 26Al, 36Cl, 41Ca, and 129I for the U.S. research
community. The technical goals of the facility are to develop and calibrate
methods for the analysis of very low concentrations of cosmogenic radionuclides
found in natural samples. The analytical data are used in tracer and
geochronological methods applied to studies of the geological history of rocks,
soils, ground water and extraterrestrial materials. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
