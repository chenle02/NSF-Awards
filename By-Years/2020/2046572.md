This project asks what determines whether salient ethnic divisions from conflict
continue to be the source of political mobilization in post-conflict elections.
The PIs identify an empirical puzzle that suggests that even an ethnic group
heavily affected by conflict may choose representation through a national rather
than an ethnic party. The key to the puzzle lies in the different experiences of
conflict that bred different rebel-civilian relationships. The PIs theorize that
the experience of 'in-group betrayal' (siding with state counterinsurgency
rather than ethnic rebels) during ethnic war can undermine the perceived
legitimacy of ethno-national political movement and thereby disincentivize
ethnic mobilization in post-conflict elections. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While
political scientists have linked elections in post-conflict environments as
arenas for renewed violence, little is known about how wartime identity politics
might have influenced these outcomes. This project connects ethnic politics
literature with conflict literature by drawing attention to how the rebel-
civilian relationship affects post-conflict electoral politics. The PIs propose
that experience of harm inflicted by in-group rebel leaders affect the
likelihood of ethnic political mobilization among conflict-affected groups.
Methodologically, the PIs use a survey experiment procedure to assess the
validity of the causal mechanism of 'in-group betrayal' in a highly sensitive
political environment. Identifying the source of cross-ethnic political
mobilization after a violent conflict has important implications for post-war
reconstruction. In line with the U.S. efforts for peaceful transition of war-
torn states, this project contributes to making better peace-building
strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
