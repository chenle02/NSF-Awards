The development of a simple, efficient, nonchemistry-specific effluent treatment
system would be of tremendous benefit to the semiconductor process industry. The
scrubber proposed in this SBIR project would remove reaction by-products from
the process exhaust by condensation onto cryogenically cooled surfaces. Once
condensed as liquid or solid, the waste would be separated mechanically,
nonhazardous material would be released, toxic material would be incinerated,
and the ash collected for hazardous waste disposal. A secondary objective of the
research is to examine the feasibility of using the (liquid) nitrogen as the
working fluid of a heat engine, to extract waste heat as work from the gas
stream. The final goal of the research will be a commercial system which will
liquefy air, separate out the oxygen from the nitrogen, condense and then
incinerate the waste from industrial effluent, condense the waste from the
incineration, and use the energy thus collected to liquefy more air. Such a
system may well be able to generate excess energy, as well as decrease toxic
waste emissions.
