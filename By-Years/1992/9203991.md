This award from the U.S.-Argentina Cooperative Science Program supports
research in mathematics to be conducted by Dr. Jim Douglas, Jr. of Purdue
University and Dr. Juan E. Santos of the University of La Plata, Argentina. The
goal of the project is to continue development of a parallelizable technique for
approximating waves in composite media with one outcome being mathematically-
justified parallel algorithms. The project continues an active collaboration
between two well-regarded researchers. The project focuses on the development of
an efficient, parallelizable technique for approximating waves in a composite
medium consisting in part of a fluid region and in part of a fluid-saturated
elastic region; a problem that arises in the simulation of acoustic well-
logging. The numerical methods to be studied relate to space-frequency
descriptions of the waves in place of the more common space-time descriptions.
The research is to be divided almost evenly between the Purdue and La Plata
groups, with a major part of the experimental calculations carried out by the
former. ***
