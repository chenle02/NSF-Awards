9415968 Grove Experiments designed to examine the diffusion of Ti, Ce, Yb, Th,
and U in pyroxene are planned to understand melting and melt transport beneath
mid-ocean ridges. This information can be used to interpret the composition of
magmas that erupt at ocean ridges. This will lead to a better understanding of
the conditions of melting, and whether melting occurs under equilibrium or
disequilibrium conditions. Experiments will be done in piston cylinder high-
pressure furnaces at pressures and temperatures that are relevant to melting in
the upper mantle. Analysis of run products will be done with the ion microprobe.
The measurement of the diffusion rates of elements that may have different rates
could also tell us something on the rate of melting. ***
