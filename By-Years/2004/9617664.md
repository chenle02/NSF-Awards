Currently the size of primate groups is believed to be determined by the density
and distribution of food resources. However, this model rests on a number of
assumptions, and there are reasons to question the widespread acceptance of
these assumptions. For example, the model assumes that as group size increases,
animals will have to travel further to find food. However, studies of leaf-
eating monkeys find no such relationship. The model also assumes that food
resources are clumped, however some primates rely on resources that are quite
dispersed. It is unclear how this group size model, as presently developed,
would apply to either of these situations. We will conduct a 3-year study in
Kibale National Park, Uganda to examine what determines the size of primate
groups in three species that differ in their foraging strategies. Based on
previous three species of monkeys have been selected for study; one species for
which the assumptions of the model are probably upheld (mangabeys - Cercocebus
albigena) and two species for which the assumptions are violated (red colobus -
Colobus badius rely on leaf resources which have been suggested to be non-
depleting; and redtail monkeys - Cercopithecus ascanius rely on dispersed
foods).
