This is a Research Opportunities for Women Career Advancement Award, to enable
Dr. Ernst to devote full time to her research on sea urchin development, and to
spend some time in Dr. William Klein's laboratory in Houston in order to do
microinjection and immunogold labeling experiments. These are techniques which
are used routinely by Dr. Klein, but which would be unrealistic for her to
attempt on her own.
