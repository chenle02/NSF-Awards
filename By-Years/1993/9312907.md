This three-year award supports U.S.-Italy cooperative research on solar
diameter changes and involves Sabatino Sofia of Yale University and Professors
A. Egidi and B. Caccin in the Department of Physics at the University of Rome
II. The investigators will be studying the effects of active regions on solar
irradiance in order to interpret the results of the Solar Disk Sextant
experiment in terms of parameters related to climate change. The Italian group
is an active one in solar research. It has collaborated in estimating the
effects of various instrumental distortions, using a solar telescope to carry
out observations of the sizes and locations of sunspots and faculae, and their
respective intensities. They have developed a parallel and independent method
for data reduction and analysis. The joint project results will be used to
improve models of the active regions modulations of irradiance and to ascertain
the relative importance between global faculae and the global magnetic network.
