Partial support is requested to defray costs for graduate students and some
invited speakers attending the West Coast Regional Developmental Biology
Conference to be held May 4-7, 1989 at Fallen Leaf Lake, California. The
tentative schedule calls for thirty speakers, reflecting as full a mix of
gender, race and degree of professional advancement as is compatible with the
primary criterion of scientific excellence. Topics to be addressed in the formal
sessions include: Evolution and Development, Kinetic Analyses of Development,
Early Events in Embryogenesis, Interactions in Development, Morphogenesis, and
Cell Biology in Development. In addition, all attendees will be invited to
contribute to a formal poster session. %%% These regional meetings have provided
important opportunities for developmental biologists at all levels to meet with
their colleagues within the region. They serve a valuable educational purpose
for the graduate students and post doctoral students.
