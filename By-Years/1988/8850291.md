This Young Scholars Project involves an intensive six week summer commuter
course and an academic year follow-up for sixteen minority students entering
eleventh and twelfth grade. The Project will be conducted primarily on the Lake
Shore campus of Loyola University of Chicago, and will focus on mathematics and
computer science. The summer phase involves five components: a computer science
lecture and discussion course stressing mathematical investigation; related
programming activity; a computer hardware design and circuitry course; a physics
laboratory experience, in which students will construct PC- compatible
microcomputers; and a series of career seminars involving facility visits hosted
by area computer science and mathematics professionals. The academic year
follow-up involves a preparation course for college entrance examinations,
continuation of the integrated mathematics and computer course, and career
development activities. Students will keep the computers they construct during
the summer phase, and will use them for programming activities during the
academic year phase.
