9554605 Ackerman This Local Systemic Change project is submitted by a
partnership that demonstrates broad community involvement for the reform of
science education-Support and expertise is drawn from business, industry, the
mayor's office, the school district and academia. The project will initiate a
hands-on science program in all 70 elementary schools in the Seattle school
district, which is urban and multiethnic. Approximately 1400 elementary teachers
in the program will receive more than 100 hours of professional development in
small groups which will be led by skilled resource teachers and practicing
scientists. Teachers will select instructional materials from FOSS, Insights and
Science and Technology for Children. The first summer the teachers will receive
one week of in-depth immersion in kit activities. During the following school
year teachers will receive 2 full day and 4 half day inservice presentations by
resource teachers. Resource teachers and the scientists will be available on a
continuing basis for classroom visits and consultations. The formal "training"
will be completed during a second summer institute. The award is $4,200,000 for
5 years with cost sharing estimated as $3,864,316.
