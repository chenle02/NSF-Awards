Winn/Abstract The objective of this research is the electrical structure and its
evolution within thunderstorms particularly with respect to a central hypothesis
for the separation of change. A field experiment will be conducted near Langmuir
Laboratory (Socorro, NM) using an instrumental aircraft, ballon borne devices
designed to measure the change on ice particles, and various electric field
mills installed near the observatory. A new feature of the aircraft, in addition
to an proved interpretation of the electric field measured by the aircraft, will
enable it to be quickly directed to regious of known charge whose value on
individual ice particles developed by Bateman.
