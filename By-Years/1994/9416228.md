9416228 Alesch This project is being funded as part of the National Earthquake
Hazards Reduction Program's investigation into the causes and effects of the
January 17, 1994 earthquake. The purpose of the research is to: learn the extent
to which the earthquake contributed to small business failures; identify the
extent to which structural mitigation, insurance, noninsurance risk management
techniques, and disaster assistance contributed to small business survival and
recovery; field test a theoretical model that estimates the probable financial
effects of damaging earthquakes on small businesses based on business and
industry characteristics; and provide a basis for furthering risk management
strategies for small businesses. Data will be collected through telephone and
face-to-face interviews with a stratified, random sample of small business
owners and operators in the Los Angeles area. ***
