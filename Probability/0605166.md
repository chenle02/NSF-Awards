This proposal describes problems in several areas of probability, involving
stochastic geometry, Markov chains, and stochastic games. Determinantal point
processes arise naturally in several settings, including eigenvalues of random
matrices. One goal of the proposal is to develop robust methods to recognize
determinantal processes that do not require calculating correlation functions of
all orders. Two methods of allocating equal volumes to the points of a point
process, one based on the Gale-Shapley stable matching algorithm, the other on
gravitational potentials, will be compared. In the area of Markov chain mixing,
the ``cutoff phenomenon'' where distance to stationarity decreases rapidly from
near 1 to near zero is believed to hold in most natural chains but is
established for very few. A robust and easily checkable possible criterion for
cutoff will be investigated. Recently, the classical connection between random
walks and harmonic functions has been extended to nonlinear potential theory
using ideas from game theory and optimal control. A major aim of the proposal is
to develop and study stochastic games whose value functions, in the scaling
limit, solve other important PDE.

Random scatters (Point processes) that exhibit clumping have effective models in
statistics, but random scatters that exhibit repulsion are less well understood.
The proposed project aims to develop a better understanding of such processes
which should enable wider use for them in statistical modeling. Given a random
scatter, different algorithms for allocating equal areas to the points of the
scatter will be investigated. Markov chains are a widely used tool in simulation
and randomized algorithms. Basic features of convergence to equilibrium in these
chains will be studied. These should have an impact on the analysis of
algorithms. The project has a substantial educational component, in mentoring of
graduate students and preparation of educational materials at the undergraduate
level on Markov chains and game theory.
