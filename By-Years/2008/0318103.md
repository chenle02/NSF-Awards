The project is a continuation of theoretical economic research in the areas of
dynamics, auctions, and voting. Within dynamics, the questions posed bear on
Markov perfect equilibrium, unforeseen contingencies, hyperbolic discounting,
and the soft budget constraint. Work in auctions will investigate asymmetries
between buyers, the high bid auction, efficient auctions, and auctions with
seller budget constraints, while research in the area of voting will examine
issues related to accountability and the robustness of voting
rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The findings on Markov perfect equilibrium should
prove useful to the many applied researchers who use this equilibrium concept in
their work. Research on unforeseen contingencies will be of interest to those
working on the foundations of contract theory and, more generally, the
foundations of decision theory. The work in hyperbolic discounting will
contribute to the literature on the boundary between economics and psychology.
Findings in the area of the soft budget constraint will have significance not
only for academic researchers but also for those involved in designing policy
for the transformation of centralized economies to decentralized systems. The
questions posed under the heading of auction theory will be of interest to the
large community of auction theorists, as well as to those wishing to design
auctions for such purposes as privatization and pollution reduction, while the
work on voting should be helpful to political economists, political scientists,
and to those envisaging reform of electoral systems. &lt;br/&gt;
