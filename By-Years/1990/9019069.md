The development of more efficient methods for storing genome- related
information into computer systems and software applications for data analysis
are important aspects of the Human Genome initiative and of other genome
projects currently underway. The need to develop improved computer-assisted
information repositories is obvious; genome-related research is producing
massive amounts of data that cannot be adequately modelled using currently
relational database technologies. This project will test the hypothesis that the
object-oriented approach outperforms the relational approach for modelling
genome- related data. In addition, this project will test whether the object-
oriented approach provides a better interface development environment that the
relational approach. E. coli genome data will be used to develop an object-
oriented prototype database that contains genetic maps, physical maps, DNA
sequences, and transposon insertion sites. For prototyping, the most recent
version of a second generation object-oriented database, ONTOS from Ontologic,
Inc., will be used.
