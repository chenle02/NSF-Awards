&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal
intends to design algorithms and protocols for a Semantic Routed Network for
sensor data based cyber infrastructure. This project will design technologies
(protocols and algorithms) that support high-level resource (data/service)
discovery in sensor networks and data archives. The novel aspects of this
proposal include mechanism for easy and automatic discovery of sensors for
variety of tasks. This will enable easy manipulation of sensor data, services
and data archives in an intelligent cyber infrastructure. Many useful and
interesting sensor based applications and cyber physical systems would be
possible if such an intelligent cyber infrastructure is
available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A vision of
this project is to increase the potential user community for atmospheric and
earth science sensor data by removing the need of device level understanding
about how to identify useful sensors and use them. When successful, the
increased access to these sensors and data resources will enhance scientific
productivity and improve decision making regarding public utilities and
services. Observing any phenomena or collecting any information with sensors
will be as easy as searching the internet, querying a database, or as economical
as putting up a web application on the internet. Additionally, the technical
material developed here will be integrated in Computer Science courses on
Networking, and Hardware-Software Codesign. Undergraduate and minority students
will benefit from exposure to these novel technologies
