9614773 Wood This proposal aims to address the lack of data on the behavior of
Re and Os in hydrothermal solutions with a series of reconnaissance solubility
experiments to be conducted under a broad range of carefully constrained
conditions. The study has the following objectives: 1) determine those
conditions under which Re and Os are most soluble and place constraints on the
conditions under which they might be mobile in nature; 2) obtain preliminary
evidence as to the nature of the predominant dissolved metal species in solution
(e.g., chloride complex, bisulfide complex, oxyanion); 3) determine the
feasibility of further experimentation designed to obtain detailed
stoichiometric and thermodynamic data. If successful, the results of this study
could be of immense value in assisting in the interpretation of Re-Os
systematics in a variety of geological environments. Furthermore, owing to the
strong geochemical similarities between rhenium and technicium, knowledge of Re
solubilities could be relevant to the evaluation of migration of this long-lived
radionuclide in the near-field environment of deeply buried nuclear waste
repositories.
