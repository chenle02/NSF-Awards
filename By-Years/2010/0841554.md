University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAREER: Semantic Programming, Aaron Stump.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Correct software has never been more societally important,
yet approaches to developing correct software remain too costly for widespread
use. This project aims to make a fundamental alteration to the programming
paradigm, to enable the creation of provably correct code at a reasonable cost.
The project proposes to develop new programming languages where programs can be
written with tightly integrated formal proofs of correctness. Proofs are data in
the programming language, just like booleans or strings. Type checking ensures
that if a function requires a proof of some fact (e.g., a pointer is not null)
in order to operate correctly, such a proof is indeed supplied where the
function is called. Functions may also produce proofs as part of their output.
Technical problems that must be solved arise in supporting programming with
proofs in the presence of mutable state (i.e., program variables whose values
can change) and other effects. &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the proposed work
include developing new languages for correct programming, together with publicly
available prototype implementations; and the creation of new courses for
graduate students&lt;br/&gt;and advanced undergraduates incorporating the ideas
of the research. The proposal also includes a K-12 outreach component.
