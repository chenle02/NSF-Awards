The Wilcox Solar Observatory (at Stanford University) continues its resourceful
investigations of evolving solar conditions. Investigators analyze the gathered
data for further understanding of the solar cycle and solar activity causes,
solar interior conditions, interactions between motions and magnetic field,
temporal evolution of coronal magnetic structure and both magnetic and velocity
fields in the photosphere, prediction of solar wind CME features'
size/importance, and the large scale structure of the heliosphere. The
Observatory is upgrading and replacing some of its instrumentation.
