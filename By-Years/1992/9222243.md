The objective of this workshop is to identify critical product life cycle
issues in biomedical engineering design. The participants include
representatives from academia, industry, consulting organizations and providers
of health care delivery. Special efforts have been made to engage users, be they
consumers, professionals or physicians. The workshop addresses the challenges
created by the impact of devices and materials on living systems in the
engineering design process. The effective transfer of general design theory and
methodology concepts to the domain of biomedical engineering is another
motivation for this activity. The ultimate goal is the development of a research
agenda that will more fully incorporate issues of safety, process control and
efficacy assessment in the life cycle design, manufacturing and deployment of
biomedical engineering products.
