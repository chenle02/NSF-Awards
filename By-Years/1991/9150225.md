The National Learning Center requests $31,767 from NSF in support of a
conference focused on research on learning in children's museums, with a special
emphasis on science. With funds from the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, a conference
is being held in March at the Indianapolis Children's Museum. Participants are
from these fields: Children's museums, cognitive psychology, and education. What
will emerge are papers and a video that relate to how we learn in museums, how
we can better design exhibits to support learning, and especially learning in
science, a survey on permanent science exhibits in children's museums, and a
research agenda with researchers matched to sites with preliminary timelines and
costs for a number of projects on how we learn, and learn science, in museums.
All principals are contributing their time. Rockefeller funds will pay for
travel, hotel, and food. NSF funds are requested to support documentation and
dissemination which will include a video of the full proceedings for study
purposes, a finished 20 - 30 minute video highlighting key ideas. The viseo will
be transcribed and edited to produce a series of papers suitable for
dissemination.
