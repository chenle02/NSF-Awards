A singular implicit differential equation is an implicit ordinary differential
equation of the form F(y',y,u,t) = 0 where y is a vector valued function, the
Jacobian Fy' is a singular matrix, u is a vector valued function, and t is time.
Such implicit systems frequently arise in a variety of control problems in
flight control, robotics, and contact or constrained problems in mechanics. In
addition, implicit differential equations occur in the solution of partial
differential equations by the method of lines and in many circuit models.
Singular systems are frequently called differential algebraic equations (DAEs)
or discriptor systems. It is proposed to develop methods for analyzing nonlinear
implicit differential equations and computing their solutions. These results
will also be of interest when the state equations exist, but the sparsity,
nonlinearity, or dependence on parameters of the equations, make the original
implicit system preferable to a lower order, but non-sparse, (or difficult to
compute local) explicit state system. The numerical computation of control
theoretic information directly from the original equations will be investigated
as part of the proposed research.
