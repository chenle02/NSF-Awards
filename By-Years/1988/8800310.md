This research has theoretical and practical implications for the current debates
about America's industrial competitiveness. It involves the optimal structure,
costs and quality of buyer and seller relationships between and within firms in
an industry. This project will investigate the product delivery process and the
performance of supplier relationships within the context of two large U.S.
multinational consumer durable and capital goods firms. It also has the
potential of adding to our knowledge on how to foster innovation. Supplier
performance is studied in the framework of three research objectives. First, the
recent spate of empirical work using Williamson's transaction cost model is
consolidated and expanded to generate hypotheses specifying differences in
performance between suppliers inside and outside the buyer firm and between
outside suppliers. Second, an administrative innovation in supplier management
recently implemented in both firms provides an opportunity to examine a form of
"relational" contracting that applies to both inside and outside suppliers. The
third research objective focuses on differences between the two participating
firms in the success of implementing the supplier management innovation; the
basis for the hypothesized differences is the dissimilarity of the firms'
vertical integration policies.
