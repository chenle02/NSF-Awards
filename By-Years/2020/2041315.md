Dolomite and calcite are the minerals that make up the sedimentary rocks
limestone and dolostone. Limestone is converted into dolostone by a chemical
process called dolomitization in which waters flowing through the strata add
magnesium, changing the mineralogy from calcite to dolomite. A wide variety of
environments have been proposed for the process of dolomitization, ranging from
Earth surface marine or saline lagoons to the deep subsurface realm with high
temperature hydrothermal fluids. The chemistry and temperature of the
dolomitizing fluids leaves a signature in the rock that differs depending on the
environment of dolomitization. This study will evaluate the processes that cause
dolomitization over vast areas. Results will improve understanding of mechanisms
of formation for a rock that commonly contains aquifers, energy and mineral
resources, and is widely used in construction materials. The project will
stimulate interest in science for underrepresented women and minority groups
through research projects, educational workshops, and published educational
modules for undergraduates and high school students.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will test mechanisms of
dolomitization in outcrops of south China that provide a natural laboratory to
evaluate regional distribution of both surface and deep subsurface environments.
Within this framework, the temperatures and chemistry of dolomitization will be
evaluated through microscopic analysis of mineral phases, heating and freezing
experiments on fluids trapped within dolomite crystals, analysis of oxygen,
carbon and strontium isotopes, and microanalysis of trace elements within
dolomite crystals. Results will be valuable for understanding spatial
distribution of dolomite resources, aquifers, and processes that operated over
Earthâ€™s history. Undergraduate students will complete field and laboratory work,
conference presentations and senior theses. Women and minority students will be
recruited through university workshops. Outreach will involve high school
students from Upward Bound in research and summer courses. Course modules will
be published on the Science Education Resource Center
website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
