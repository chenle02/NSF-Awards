This engineering education research project will support a workshop to create
peer networks among pre-tenure faculty who are pursuing careers in engineering
education research. Because many faculty who do research in engineering
education are hired in departments where all or most of the faculty pursue
discipline-specific engineering research, previous research has shown these
faculty face several challenges in long-term career success. The peer and
mentoring relationships that will be established by this workshop are
anticipated to provide guidance on how to increase the success of faculty and
thus retain them in engineering education research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader significance and importance of this project will be to build peer
mentoring networks among faculty engaged in engineering education research. By
sharing success strategies, these networks can lead to greater success of
engineering faculty members, particularly those at institutions without
established engineering education programs or faculty and administrative
expertise in engineering education. The PIs have addressed how the network
established by this workshop can be sustained following termination of NSF
funding.
