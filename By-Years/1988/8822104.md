This award will support Professor Roger Barry of the University of Colorado-
Boulder in collaboration with A. Moreau and M. Perdomo of the Ministerio del
Ambiente (MARNR) and R. Andressen of the Universidad de los Andes (ULA) in
Merida, Venezuela. The purpose of the collaboration is to extend currently
supported work on precipitation regimes in northern South America. By conducting
research on long-term climatology and climatic change in Venezuela, the
researchers will gain access to a unique geographical setting whose climatology
is virtually unknown. More specifically, the PI's intend to study precipitation
regimes and their relationship to atmospheric dynamics and topographic forcing,
the causes of their interannual variability, and the effects of altitude and
topography on precipitation in low latitudes. The U.S. side will contribute
their expertise and resources to the collaboration while the Venezuelan
investigators will provide access to hydro-meteorological data and assistance
from their station networks. The results of this study should provide important
information to researchers interested in tropical and global climatology and
climatic change.
