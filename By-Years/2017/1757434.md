The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to serve the
"Convergence Insufficiency" clinical population, which includes millions of
people in the US alone, as well as 50% of the brain injury population who has
post concussive syndrome (PCS). Designing engaging vision therapy protocols that
leverage virtual reality gaming technology will have a dramatic impact in
particular on this young population's academic and professional career growth
and goals. Broad market impacts also include the opportunity for translational
research funded by prior NSF grants to reach the general public. This solution
has the potential to be an affordable alternative to traditional vision therapy
administered in the comfort of one's home saving both healthcare cost and
patient's time.

This I-Corps project seeks to explore the commercial potential of a novel
combination of virtual reality and vision therapy technologies. Convergence
Insufficiency is a binocular vision dysfunction which causes the following
vision symptoms: blurry and double vision, eye stress and strain, headaches, and
a 'halo' effect where words appear to float above the page while reading. These
visual symptoms negatively impact a person's ability to perform near work such
as reading and computer/tablet use. The Virtual Reality Vision Therapy developed
here encompasses integration of eye tracking with traditional vision therapy
methodologies, promotion of patient compliance through a suite of engaging
virtual reality video game experiences, objective assessments of patient
progress throughout the course of vision therapy, and a flexible platform to
create a patient specific therapeutic intervention.
