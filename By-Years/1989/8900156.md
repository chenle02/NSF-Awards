Radio wavelength observations of objects in the Solar System give information on
their physical and chemical structure and the structure of their magnetospheres
and atmospheres. The magnetospheric studies use observations of the synchrotron
radiation from relativistic electrons trapped in a magnetosphere to map out the
particle distributions and magnetic field topologies. Atmospheric studies use
radio data to probe levels in the atmosphere deeper than those which are probed
with observations at other wavelengths. Dr. De Pater will use this grant to
continue her studies of objects in the Solar System at centimeter and millimeter
wavelengths. The objects to be investigated include the gaseous giant planets
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune; the Earth- like planets Venus, Mars, and
Mercury; the galilean satellites; and various new and periodic comets which come
close to the Sun.
