This award will support the research of Dr. Malcolm Forbes at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The award is the starter grant portion of Dr.
Forbes Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Chemistry and deals with the matrix
isolation and characterization of reactive intermediates prepared by gas-phase
photolysis. With the modification of a recently developed Electron Paramagnetic
Resonance/Matrix Isolation apparatus and the use of well-established gas-phase
photochemistry, a series of small alkyl biradicals and rigid, caged adamantyl
biradicals will be investigated. Information regarding structure, reactivity and
spin multiplicity will be obtained. Application of mass spectrometric and
optical techniques will provide kinetic and structural analyses. Molecular
orbital calculations will be performed on many of the compounds and
intermediates proposed for study.
