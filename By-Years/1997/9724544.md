9724544 Griffin Sacred Heart University is an independent, liberal arts
institution with 3500 undergraduate and 1500 graduate students. The school does
NOT offer any Ph.D. programs. The proposal requests $94,500 to purchase
equipment that will be used to investigate the biology of hypothalamic neurons
and their response to chemical and environmental pressures. Among the equipment
required are computers, signal amplifiers, oscilloscopes, data recorders,
microtomes, etc. Until recently the University has provided little opportunity
for undergraduate research. There is a current high level commitment to improve
these opportunities as illustrated by the construction and renovation of new
biology and chemistry laboratories, new science faculty, and by the appreciable
matching funds to this proposal. One goal of this proposal is to improve the
recruiting and retention of talented undergraduates, and to improve the quality
of the undergraduate training. ***
