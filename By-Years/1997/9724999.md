Long 9724999 This Small Grant for Exploratory Research is based on the discovery
that the filamentous fungus, Pestalotiopsis microspora, has a unique ability to
convert non-replicating transforming DNA into self-replicating plasmids. This is
in stark contrast, in terms of both efficiency and mechanism, to essentially all
other filamentous fungi which replicate transforming DNA through chromosomal
integration. Two aspects of P. microspora transformation, high efficiency and
generation of self-replicating plasmids, could, if applicable to other
filamentous fungi, have substantial impact on the growing field of molecular
genetic engineering of this important class of organisms. This research develops
methods for amplification of P. microspora plasmids, structural and functional
characterization of these plasmids, and experiments to test their ability to
replicate in other filamentous fungi.
