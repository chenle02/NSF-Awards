This study examines the relationship between capacity building in computer
science and economic innovation. Data will consist of 1) a quantitative survey
of computer science researchers; 2) in-depth qualitative interviews with
researchers, students, policymakers, funders, entrepreneurs and staff of
nongovernmental organizations; and 3) video ethnographic observation of
researchers in their everyday interactions with students, funders, community
organizations and other nodes of the innovation system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In
addition to presenting results at scholarly meetings and in scholarly
publications, the PIs plan an outreach event in Washington, DC for congressional
staff, international policy makers and managers of technology companies.
