0113050&lt;br/&gt;Bunge&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project deals with the very
challenging problem of the generation of the Earth's magnetic field. The P.I.s
will adopt a dual strategy in which the computer hardware and software are each
specifically designed to function together at peak efficiency. In particular,
the hardware will consist of a 144 processor Beowulf PC-cluster, yielding an
estimated peak sustained performance of 100 Gflops - competitive with high-
performance National Supercomputer Center machines, but at a fraction of the
cost. To take full advantage of such a cluster, the software under consideration
must be easily and efficiently parallelizable. The P.I. will derive the software
from a finite element mantle convection code that is already fully parallelized,
and already runs at high parallel efficiency on precisely such Beowulf clusters.
Much of the conversion from mantle to core convection has already been done,
with no loss in parallel efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
