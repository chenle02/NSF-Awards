The objective of this program is to advance the understanding of the mechanisms
for enhancing optical nonlinearity in subwavelength metallic nanostructures. The
approach is: (1) to examine the nonlinearity enhancement in subwavelength metal-
nonlinear dielectric grating systems; (2) to develop an effective medium
(metamaterial) description to assess the enhancement and to predict new optical
phenomena; and (3) to investigate the fundamental limit of the enhancement and
to explore the dependence of enhancement on grating geometry. The success of
this proposal will be transformative to optical science, providing a viable
mechanism for enhancing and tailoring the optical nonlinearity to create multi-
functional nonlinear optical materials.

Intellectual merit: Recent advances in artificially created inhomogeneous
composite materials have established the opportunity for synthesis of new
classes of material that will enable new families of linear and nonlinear
nanophotonic devices. The PI will examine the mechanisms for extraordinary
enhancement of optical nonlinearity in nano-structures and the applications. The
research findings of this proposal will make possible ultra-compact, ultrafast,
and energy-efficient nonlinear optical devices for optical switching and
modulation to prepare for future demands for broadband signal processing.

Broader impacts: This research program presents an approach to develop novel
nonlinear artificially engineered material structures. The interdisciplinary
science and engineering training and education will also involve working with
minority, women and K-12 teachers and students. The PI participates in a
technology outreach program, and will further contribute to general public
science awareness programs through outreach activities.
