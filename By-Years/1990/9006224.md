This project will study general optimization and control problems with
nonsmooth data and develop effective methods for the analysis and the solution
of such problems based on their approximation by problems of a simpler nature.
Using approximation methods, tools of nonconvex analysis connected with the
concepts of generalized differentials, normals, and conjugate mappings will be
developed. Various applications of these methods will be made to sensitivity
analysis, controllability, stability, optimality conditions, and other aspects
of optimization and control in numerous problems. Finite difference
approximations for continuous-time optimal control systems with constraints will
be analyzed. Application to modeling in engineering and related areas are
expected.
