Observations of the structure of conductivity weighting in the water column and
bottom conductance near Cape Hatteras will further electromagnetic (EM) studies
in strong baroclinic currents (Gulf Stream). This proposal includes
oceanographic goals and validation of a suite of previously developed EM
instruments in energetic regimes.
