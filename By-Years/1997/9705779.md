9705779 King There are three projects described in this proposal, all concerned
with the physics of interacting many-body systems. The first is "Spontaneous and
stimulated emission of photons"; the problem here is to find a useful
approximation for the time evolution operator in the simplest interacting
quantum field theory, namely a two-state atom coupled to the quantized radiation
field, and to investigate stimulated photon emission in this model. The second
project is titled "Mutually avoiding self-avoiding random walks"; the goal is to
locate the exact phase boundaries of a model of non-intersecting random walks on
the lattice and to determine the correlation functions in each phase. The third
project is "Scaling behavior of correlations in a critical model", where it is
proposed to find the scaling and large deviation properties of an order
parameter in a model of non-intersecting random loops on the two-dimensional
torus. The broad goal of this project is to elucidate the macroscopic behavior
of a large system which is composed of many small components by drawing
mathematical conclusions from its microscopic formulation. At the microscopic
level, physics provides well-understood laws which allow a consistent
mathematical description. The challenge is to predict the macroscopic
consequences of these laws. This project focuses on two areas: first, the
interaction of photons with an atom, where the macroscopic behavior is the
emission and absorption of light, and second, the spatial fluctuations of vortex
lines in superconductors, where the macroscopic behavior is the sudden
occurrence of long-range correlations. There are many areas in science and
technology where local rules may conspire to produce huge effects (for example
congestion in high-speed communications networks). This project will use
mathematical analysis to address questions of this type in the realm of
theoretical physics.
