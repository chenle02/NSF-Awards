This Phase 1 project is producing 30 new middle or high school mathematics and
science teachers who commit to teach in any of the 134 high-need Coalition of
Rural and Appalachian Schools (CORAS) districts. Scholarship recipients are
enrolled and remain in good standing at one of the South East Ohio Center for
Excellence in Mathematics and Science (SEOCEMS) partner universities' accredited
programs. SEOCEMS is a partnership of Ohio University, Shawnee State University,
the University of Rio Grande, superintendents from CORAS, and superintendents
from regional Education Service Centers (ESC). This project is increasing the
capacity of this teacher preparation consortium by at least 10%. The project is
(1) identifying and recruiting talented students and displaced second career
professionals from the Appalachian region with preference for the under-
represented first generation college bound; (2) providing a university training
and support system to ensure each Noyce Scholarship recipients' successful
development as a mathematics or science teacher; and (3) incorporating field
experiences in rural schools with systematic feedback and professional support
as part of a preparation and retention plan.
