This project will use three imaging Doppler spectrometers to study wind and
temperature in the Earth's thermosphere from about 120 to 240 km altitude over a
grid spanning approximately 2000 x 1300 km in latitude and longitude
respectively. Within the field of view some volumes will be observed tri-
statically by all three instruments allowing for the first time unambiguous
spatial mapping of the three vector components of the thermospheric wind field
over an extended region. There will in addition be extended bi-static and mono-
static coverage as well. This new Doppler imaging array will be applied to the
following four science questions: &lt;br/&gt;1) Do thermospheric wind and
temperature fields contain local structure arising because the wind field can
become dynamically unstable? &lt;br/&gt;2) What is the spatial distribution of
vertical wind disturbances in the auroral thermosphere? &lt;br/&gt;3) How do
thermospheric gravity waves perturb thermospheric winds and temperatures?
&lt;br/&gt;4) How do small-scale wind gradients affect dispersion of
thermospheric air masses?
