An examination of the factors that shape the recruitment and retention of women
and minority students in mathematics, biology, psychology, physics, and
chemistry classes and majors in comprehensive public universities. The study
isgrounded in an integrative theoretical model of the factors determining
academicchoice. Three levels of academic community structure will be explored--
institutional, departmental, and student. The structure of students' experience
in introductory courses and gender and race differences will be explored
applying an expectancy-value model to the prediction of students' choices of
major and describing the most influential determinants. A theoretical model for
the successful recruitment and retention of women and minorities will be
developed.
