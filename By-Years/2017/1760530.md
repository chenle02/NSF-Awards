TECHNICAL AND NON TECHNICAL ABSTRACT Funds in the amount of $5000 are requested
for support of US based participants in the 2018 ACS Symposium on "Polymers with
Complex Architecture: From Synthesis to Self-Assembly " to be held at the 2018
National ACS meeting in New Orleans, LA, on March 18-22, 2018. The funds will be
used to cover the registration fees for participating postdocs, assistant and
associate professors. The symposium aims to highlight recent advances in
controlled polymerization and functionalization techniques enabling the
synthesis of chemically heterogeneous copolymers (and block copolymers) with
complex architectures, as well as their self-assembly characteristics. The
symposium offers opportunity for the cross-fertilization between academic
faculty, R&D industrial researchers, postdocs and graduate students regarding
progress in both fundamental and technological aspects of polymer synthesis,
self-assembly and applications.
