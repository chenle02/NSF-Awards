The proposal involves continuation of a two year study investigating mineral-
solution equilibria and low-grade metamorphism induced by circulatory fluids in
the Salton Sea hydrothermal system. Cores and fluid samples obtained by the
Salton Sea Scientific Drilling Project have been characterized in terms of
structures and compositions of vein and alteration minerals (especially
epidote). An analog study of sample from an Icelandic geothermal system was
carried out in addition. Continued research will evaluate (1) details of fluid-
mineral equilibria, (2) crystal, chemical, and isotopic characteristics of
hydrothermal epidotes, (3) low temperature reactions in sandstone reservoir
rocks, and (4) relations between fracturing, hydrothermal circulation, and
fracture sealing in a hydrothermal system. These results will be applied to
evaluation of reaction processes in water-rock systems worldwide.
