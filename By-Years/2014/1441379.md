The award supports the attendance of students to the International Symposium on
Workload Characterization (IISWC) which is a top-notch technical forum for the
presentation of new and exciting advances in the understanding of emerging
computer applications and workloads). The conference will be hosted in Raleigh,
North Carolina, USA, in October 2014. Students have much to gain from attending
IISWC like learning state-of-the-art methodologies, being exposed to novel
techniques, and interacting with senior researchers in their chosen area of
expertise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IISWC is a top-tier conference on workload
characterization research with a long and successful history. The conference is
often used as the primary venue for interaction between academic and industrial
researchers and designers. Historically, the conferences have attracted top
research papers from both academia and industry, and many innovations published
in the proceedings have been influential in the understanding&lt;br/&gt;of
emerging applications and computing systems. Increasing the attendance of
students in IISWC will expose more students to the exciting developments in the
field and in the long run will help to build a broad base of expertise in the
field, which will impact both industry and academia.
