9310328 Mallet-Paret We propose to study fundamental qualitative properties of
several classes of dynamical systems which arise in various areas of science.
Among the systems of interest are those involving geometric theory of singularly
perturbed differential equations, differential delay equations, and associated
linear problems. We propose to study fundamental qualitative properties of
several classes of dynamical systems which arise in various areas of science.
The dynamical systems model a wide range of important phenomena in a number of
areas of science. Among them are problems of cell population growth (modeling
various disease processes), problems of fluid flow, and problems involving
interaction of diffusion and chemical reaction. ***
