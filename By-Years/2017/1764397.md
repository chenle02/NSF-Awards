A New X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometer at University of Massachusetts-
Amherst&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant pays for a new X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF)
spectrometer to replace two old and failing X-ray spectrometers at UMass-
Amherst. The current instruments have operated constantly for more than 30
years. The new instrument will continue to be an important resource for the
students and faculty at UMass, the Five College consortium in the region and
universities worldwide. The UMass laboratory has served scientists the world
over for more than 30 years. It will now be able to continue the tradition as a
valuable and trusted resource for high quality XRF chemical analyses to the U.S.
scientific community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant pays for a new X-Ray
Fluorescence spectrometer to replace two old and failing X-ray spectrometers at
UMass-Amherst. It also pays for an upgraded XRF sample preparation facility
through the acquisition of an automated fusion furnace. The two current X-ray
spectrometers have served the geological community for 33 years (Siemens MRS-4)
and 23 years (Philips PW2400) and have been in constant operation over this
period. Now, however, both need to be replaced because replacement parts are no
longer available. The XRF Analytical Facility at UMass has provided high quality
XRF major and trace element analyses to faculty and students at UMass, the
neighboring Five Colleges, and the U.S. petrological, volcanological and
geochemical community for more than 30 years, and this can now continue into the
future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
