The North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) coordinated by the U.S. and
Canadian Fish and Wildlife Services provides potentially valuable data for
assessing the effects of natural variation and human activities on the
distribution and abundance of wild organisms. The BBS consists of standardized
censuses of breeding birds conducted annually for the last 20 years at
approximately 1,800 local sites in the U.S. and Canada. The main reason why the
BBS has not been more heavily used by scientists is that the sheer magnitude of
the data set requires sophisticated computer techniques for analysis. This
proposed research will begin an intensive computer analysis of the BBS to
determine: 1) the size and pattern of fluctuations in bird populations from
year-to-year within a local census site and among the numerous sites across the
North American continent; 2) the extent to which these fluctuations are
correlated with and caused by changes in climate, land use, and other factors;
and 3) the degree to which different bird species show similar or different
patterns of variation in abundance and distribution. Special attention will be
devoted to identifying factors that are associated with declines in abundances
and contractions in geographic ranges. The proposed research will provide
increased understanding of the relationships between animal populations and
their environment on time scales of decades and spatial scales of an entire
continent. The research will also contribute importantly to assessing the
effects of human-caused changes in climate and land use on the abundance and
diversity of wild species.
