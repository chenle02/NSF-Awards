The project supports 10 students to attend the 22nd ACM International Symposium
on High Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing (HPDC-2013) to be held in
New York, NY, June 17-21, 2013. HPDC 2013 comprises the main conference as well
as 8 affiliated workshops, and is the premier forum for presenting the latest
research findings on the design and use of parallel and distributed systems for
high end computing, collaboration, data analysis, and other innovative
applications. Student attendance at the conference will greatly benefit the
students by exposing them to a variety of issues in high end computing.
