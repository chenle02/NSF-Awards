The problem addressed here is the recognition of cursive hand- writing by
machine. The approach taken involves two stages: 1) a dynamic programming
algorithm, and 2) rules-based discrimina- tion. The objective of this project is
to determine the feasi- bility of this approach. A successful outcome would add
another modality to those avail- able for communication between a computing
system and its user. Cursive handwriting recognition has the potential to open
up the use of computers to people who find the conventional keyboard unnatural
or intimidating and to increase the efficiency of applications for which
handwriting is more natural.
