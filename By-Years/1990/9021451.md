This research will examine the physiological and genetic basis of disease
resistance and plant fitness in wild and agricultural populations of the mustard
Brassica campestris. Variation in plant chemistry and enzymes that are believed
to control resistance to insects and microbial pathogens, will be related to
theories about plant protection. Integrating molecular information from the DNA
level with biochemistry and quantitative analysis of disease resistance, will
lead to a better understanding of the process of plant growth and plant defense.
In addition to the fundamental scientific understanding deriving from this work,
there are potential agricultural and environmental benefits. This work may lead
to genetically improved crops (canola, broccoli, etc.) that are more resistant
to insects or diseases and require reduced application of toxic chemical
pesticides.
