The objective of this research is to investigate the wavelet design for
optimizing its performance for specific applications in power systems. Another
objective of the research is to develop a time-domain transmission line model
that can represent frequency dependent parameters in an accurate manner and to
incorporate it into a time-domain transient simulation program. The approach is
to first concentrate on creating a family of electrical transient signals by
using a simulator such as the electromagnetic transients program. The
characteristics of each type of transient will be identified in order to define
the main properties to represent by a wavelet. Once the signal characteristics
are identified, a quadrature mirror filter wavelet/wavepacket orthogonal basis
will be constructed by selecting an appropriate binary tree structure and
optimizing the mother wavelet/scaling function with respect to its filter
lattice parameters.

Intellectual Merit

The project advances the knowledge and understanding in the area of wavelet
transforms when used for power system transient analysis by customizing the
mother wavelet to specific characteristics of power networks.

Broader Impacts

Results of the project will lead to significant reliability improvements in the
operation of the nation's power grid by allowing accurate and reliable fault
location. This will produce cost savings by minimizing the duration of
unexpected power outages.

The project will also train two graduate students who will teach the developed
material in the undergraduate laboratory classes. The results of the project
will be disseminated as journal publications. The project will also involve
undergraduate students from under-represented groups using REU supplemental
funds.
