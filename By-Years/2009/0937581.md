The Gordon Conference in Nuclear physics with its new addition of the Gordon
Research Seminar offers a unique venue for the presentation and discussion of
frontier research in nuclear physics at large and beyond. The conference runs
across different subfields of nuclear physics, from nuclear structure to nuclear
astrophysics including subfields at the interface between nuclear and particle
physics. The conference will be held at Bryant University, Smithfield, RI, July
12-17, and preceded by the Research Seminar on July 11-12.

This Conference and Research Seminar present young scientists (graduate
students, postdocs and young faculty) with a special opportunity to hear
unfettered discussions among top scientists of the latest results and ideas over
a wide range of subfields of nuclear physics. The modest size of the conference
and its cross disciplinary aspect as well as the addition of the new research
seminar enhance the learning experience and provides serious training of the new
generation of leaders in the field nuclear physics and across disciplines.
