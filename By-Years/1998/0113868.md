This project involves the development of a web-based tool to support ad-hoc
international workgroups interested in global/regional-scale aerosols events
such as forest fires, dust storms, air pollution transport episodes, and
volcanoes. This tool will be made available to the international scientific
community, disaster managers, and the lay public for use in detecting the
occurrence of aerosol events, monitoring their evolution, and analyzing their
impacts. The web-based tool is an XML-based system designed as a standard data
description and transmission language/protocol and is capable of receiving
queries and delivering XML data to any other computer on the Internet. A new
data integration and browsing tool for exploration and presentation is being
developed that allows the superposition of spatial and temporal data submitted
by work group participants or generally available through the web. Data from the
system can be distributed among servers who subscribe to a common sharing
standards for data and metadata.
