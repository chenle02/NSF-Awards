9625715 Patten PIs proposed a three year program of research that will
establish the effectiveness and implementability of semiactive vibration absorbs
(SAVA) for bridge impact vibration control. The purpose of this proposal is to
conduct a long term study of the engineering issues raised by the application of
SAVA to the ODOT (Oklahoma Dept. of Transportation) test bridge. The research
will examine the testing of different control algorithms including feedback
linearization, and a nonlinear bi-state control that is based on an extension of
Lyapunou's method. Work will be conducted to verify the performance developed
and tested. The research will also address the question of best topologies for
actuators, including: (a) kinematic arrangement of actuators; (b) optimal
location and placement of actuators; and (3) effect of number of actuators.
