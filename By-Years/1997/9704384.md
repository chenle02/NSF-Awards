9704384 Shen The focus of this research project on optics in liquid crystals
falls into two general areas: studies of novel optical phenomena in liquid
crystals, and use of novel optical techniques to study liquid crystals.
Nonlinear optical effects to be studied include laser-induced polarization, dye-
enhanced nonlinearity, and stimulated Raman scattering emphasizing surface and
interfacial properties, and surface-induced bulk alignment effects. %%% These
studies are aimed at enhancing our knowledge of the many unique and interesting
ways that liquid crystals interact with laser light. These discoveries will that
help in the search for novel applications of liquid crystals as extraordinary
materials for modern optoelectronic applications such as display, memory, and
sensor devices. ***
