The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary cooperative research project between
Dr. Bob B. Buchanan of the University of California, Berkeley, and Dr. Arpad
Balogh of Gyorgy Bessenyei College, Nyiregyhaza, is to study cytosolic
carbohydrate metabolism in uncellular algae. Specifically, the researchers will
examine sucrose synthesis and breakdown in green alga, Chlorella pyrenoidosa,
with the intent of characterizing three enzymes that function as catalysts in
this interconversion process. Characterization of the enzymes envolves
determination of their physical properties, including molecular weight and
kinetic constants. Knowledge of metabolic mechanisms yielded by this study of
algae will also contribute to our understanding of enzyme regulation in higher
plants. This project in metabolic biology fulfills the program objective of
advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and
Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in
areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
