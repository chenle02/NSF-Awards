The current trends in computer architecture suggest that in the future it will
be common to use computer networks where some of the nodes are multiprocessors -
either shared memory multiprocessors or distributed multiprocessors. In such an
environment a parallel application need not be confined to a single parallel
machine. Instead it can be composed of several components each executing on a
different node of the network to yield the best possible results. Each such
component can be viewed as a shared resource providing services to the other
components of the parallel application and the interactions between the
components can be implemented as remote procedure calls. The issues in
programming the remote components of a parallel application as shared resources
are similiar to the issues in programming shared resources in general such as
file servers and database systems. In both cases it is important to implement a
shared resource as a parallel system so that the speed-up possible in parallel
applications is not compromised due to delays in accessing the resource. This
project is to develop an object oriented parallel programming system called ALPS
using which a parallel application can be implemented efficiently on the
multiple nodes of a network of parallel machines. The ALPS programming systems
consists of a strongly typed high-level language and a kernel that forms the
run-time support for the ALPS language and which can also be used from other
languages such as C, Pascal and Fortran. The ALPS system is currently being
implemented on 16-node transputer network. In the future it is plan to implement
it on a 12-processor Encore Multimax.
