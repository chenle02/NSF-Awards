Insect molecular genetics is growing rapidly and its application will be of
increasing significance to humankind. Some key developments include the
completion of insect genome sequencing projects, the development of germ-line
transformation technologies, and the routine production of transgenic insects.
Despite progress, pivotal problems remain, such as identifying targets for
genetic manipulation, developing methodologies to introduce and spread
transgenes, mapping target insect population architecture, predicting the fate
of transgenes, and assessing the impact of transgenic insects, including their
impact on the environment. The goals of this meeting are to facilitate
discussion about the genetic manipulation of insects among scientists from a
variety of disciplines, to foster dialog and technology transfer between
scientists, and to encourage new collaborations. Risk and safety issues raised
by the genetic manipulation of insects will be discussed, and interactions
between young and established scientists will be encouraged.
