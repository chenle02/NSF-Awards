This project is supporting a workshop to convene biology education researchers
to plan out the development and validation of a Biology Competencies Assessment
Series (BCAS). The BCAS will consist of several multiple-choice and short-answer
questions validated by students and designed to evaluate student progress on
learning biology concepts and achieving the competencies recommended in "Vision
and Change: A Call to Action." In particular, the workshop is bringing together
Principal Investigators of both new and established TUES projects related to
developing assessment tools to address effectiveness of instruction.

Intellectual merit: The project provides the opportunity for experts in biology
educational research to work towards the development of assessments that track
the progress of students at multiple points in their undergraduate careers. The
opportunity to plan also allows participants to share (and not replicate)
efforts to standardize the protocols for validating the questions important to
the biology community.

Broader impacts: The project plans a consensus set of tools to help the larger
biology community assess how well students are mastering the concepts and
competencies outlined in national initiatives. From an educational perspective,
this workshop provides promising advances to standard measurement for student
learning that allows biology departments across the country to use data-driven
processes to align their teaching practices and curricula with learning goals
prescribed in several national reports including "Vision and Change."

This project is being funded by the Directorate for Education and Human
Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of its efforts toward
supporting the goals and objectives of "Vision and Change in Undergraduate
Biology Education."
