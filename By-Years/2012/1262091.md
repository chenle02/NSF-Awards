This project will advance our understanding of the physical processes
responsible for the genesis, development and tracking of North Atlantic and US
landfalling tropical cyclones (TCs). The team will apply newly gained physical
insights towards the development of a seasonal forecasting system of North
Atlantic and US landfalling TCs and associated rainfall. The approach follows in
three phases: Phase I will focus on advancing the understanding of the physical
processes responsible for the North Atlantic and US landfalling TC activity.
Phase II will develop a seasonal forecasting system of TC activity using the
knowledge established in Phase I. Phase III will focus on the seasonal forecast
of rainfall associated with TCs during and after US landfall. The methodologies
build on analysis tools and data sets that the PI and Co-PI have extensive
experience with, and developed further here to address the problem of rainfall
associated with landfalling TCs.
