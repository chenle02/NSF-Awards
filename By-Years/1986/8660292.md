YOUNG Excavation of hard rock is controlled by dynamic tensile fracture which is
a process that is poorly understood. Available data on the dynamic tensile
strength of brittle materials such as rocks and ceramics is extremely limited,
and the data available is open to question because it is obtained by surface
measurements where surface flws may have an influence on the fracture
properties. This research program involves the measurement of dynamic tensile
strength with an embedded gage placed in the interior of the test specimen.
Specifically, the research program entails the development of an electromagnetic
gage of small dimension which will sense particle velocities which can be
related to the imposed dynamic stresses. Gage placment techniques in the
specimen will be an important part of the project. The data will be recorded
digitally and processed automaticallly to give velocity, displacement and stress
as a function of time during the dynamic fracture process. The method will be
demonstrated and dynamic tensile strength and/or toughness will be determined
for several brittle rocks, plastics, composites and ceramics. Sunburst Recovery
is a small company with an excellent laboratory for conducting this experimental
program. The principal investigator has an excellent background in rock
mechanics and has shown the feasibility of using electromagnetic transducers in
measuring properties of geo- materials. An award is recommended.
