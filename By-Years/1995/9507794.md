9507794 Schedl This U.S.-Hungary research project, between Dr. Paul Schedl of
Princeton University and Drs. Janos Gausz and Henrik Gyurokovics of the
Hungarian Biological Research Center, will address a Drosophila protein, GAGA,
that appears to play a critical role in generating accessible, nucleosome free
regions of chromatin. Binding of this protein to chromatin in vivo is thought to
facilitate transcription of particular genes. Together, the researchers intend
to characterize the phenotypic effects of mutations in this Drosophila gene,
called the GAGA factor. They will use a combination of molecular, genetic and
developmental approaches. Results are expected to yield new basic information on
the genetic hierarchy of regulation in this incompletely understood type of DNA-
binding protein. This project in genetic biology fulfills the program objective
of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United
States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research
resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence. ***
