Funding is requested to support the travel and living expenses of several
scientists from European and Third World communities so that they may attend the
6th Biennial Regeneration Forum, to be held at the Ohio State University, June
26-27, 1987. Those to be invited will be scientists who have been active in
various aspects of regeneration research during the past few years. Their
presence will insure an exchange of ideas between European, Third Workd and
North American scientists, post-doctoral associates, and graduate students who
are presently active in regeneration research. This exchange is expected to lead
to new approaches and collaborataive research efforts. There is a great deal of
research activity abroad in this field and in the past meetings have been either
American national meeting or European meetings. The organizers hope by breaking
this pattern to encourage more productive interchange and collaboration between
these communities of scientits with resulting benefits for the field.
