The Association for Women in Mathematics will administer the NSF-AWM Travel
Grants Program for a three-year period beginning October 15, 2008. This program,
which has run for the past twenty years, supports the travel of women
mathematicians who wish to actively participate in domestic or international
research conferences, as well as longer-term visits to work with a mentor.
Funding is allocated competitively, and allows approximately one hundred and
forty-five regular travel grants and twenty-five mentoring grants to be awarded
over the three-year period. Most of the funding is intended to benefit
mathematics research, but one fifth of the travel grants will fund mathematics
researchers to participate in mathematics education research conferences and
mathematics education researchers to travel to mathematics conferences.

Data indicate that women's participation rates in conferences and mathematics
workshops remain lower than their proportion in academic departments, especially
at the junior ranks. By providing grants that draw women's attention to the
benefits of sharing their knowledge and communicating their results, AWM is
intervening positively to increase the role of women in the profession. Reports
by an independent evaluator have confirmed that this program is reaching its
target group of women with excellent training and serious research potential who
do not have consistent access to resources enabling them to attend mathematics
meetings. In addition, the mentoring grants have succeeded in starting many of
the young women participants in fresh new research directions and have broadened
their view of mathematical research careers. The mathematics education research
track is beginning to be utilized by women at all stages of their careers and
will advance the understanding of mathematics by education researchers and of
education research by mathematicians. This communication between different
communities has the potential of contributing constructively to the ongoing
dialogue about the learning of mathematics by girls and women.
