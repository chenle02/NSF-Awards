This research used the theory of repeated games to deepen our understanding of
the endogenous process by which economic relationships survive and fail. It will
also help us understand how the prospect of exit creates dynamics within a
relationship. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Repeated game theory provides some of the
most richly applied tools in modern economics. For example, price wars,
collusion, and relational contracts have been widely studied as equilibrium
outcomes in repeated games. The possibility that a game may end is typically
captured in the formal mathematical model through an exogenous probability that
the relationship dies. However, in many real world situations people choose when
to leave a relationship, such as when a partnership breaks up or when a customer
switches its business to a different supplier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research shows how the prospect of endogenous exit changes incentives and
creates a variety of interesting dynamics in a variant of the widely used
'Prisoner's Dilemma' game. Preliminary results demonstrate that partnerships are
more profitable when they are less likely to end soon, that older partnerships
tend to be more profitable than younger partnerships, and also help us
understand why partnerships often 'break down before they break up'. The
research results have wide implications for public policy and business practice.
