Research in the broad area of theoretical elementary particle physics will
concentrate on features within, and related to, superstring theory, the
candidate fundamental theory of all forces at the atomic and subatomic level. An
essential aspect of superstring theory is supersymmetry, a theoretical concept
that puts pairs (or larger groupings) of superficially different particles into
unified families, so-called supersymmetric multiplets. Much of the research will
concentrate on studying properties of these supersymmetric systems in two-
dimensions, where they form the basis of superstring constructions, and in our
(space + time) four-dimensional world, where they are predicted by superstring
theory to actually be experimentally observed. Ultimately, these studies will
lead to new tools for investigating superstring theory and its implications, and
eventually help unravel some of the mysteries that Nature has encoded in our
physical world at the most fundamental level.
