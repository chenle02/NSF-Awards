Dr. Clark Chapman at the Planetary Science Institute will implement an
observing program to obtain spectrophotometric colors on a set of approximately
100 main-belt asteroids in the 2-20 km diameter size range. These data will
enable him to identify taxonomic types of these asteroids and will thus provide
a statistically significant sample of the distribution of types that exist among
small main-belt asteroids. Dr. Chapman will compare the distribution of types
for small asteroids with those of larger asteroids and will use the results to
address several fundamental science questions about asteroids. Among these are:
(i) Are there parent bodies for the ordinary chondrite meteorites among the
small main-belt asteroids? (ii) are there significant numbers of small olivine-
rich asteroids? (iii) Does the size distribution of small S-type asteroids
flatten at sizes less than 20 km diameter? Dr. Chapman will acquire Charge
Coupled Device observations in eight filters in the wavelength range of 0.35
micron to 1.1 micron using 1m and 2m telescopes. An important part of this
program is to establish faint standard stars in the eight-color system located
at regular intervals along the ecliptic plane. Dr. Chapman will also obtain
rotation periods and lightcurve amplitudes of a subset of the asteroids
observed.
