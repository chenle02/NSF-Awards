This project is funding the purchase of field and laboratory equipment to
support environmental education at the university. The equipment forms the core
of the Environmental Instrumentation Lab (EIL) for use by undergraduates in
integrated Environmental Geology and Biology courses and for B.S. Thesis
research in both departments. The EIL provides hands-on experience with the
sophisticated analytical tools commonly used in environmental investigations.
Undergraduate students learn both abiotic and biotic analytical field and
laboratory methods. These tools are used in the characterization, assessment,
and restoration/management aspects of particular sites. Results from these
investigations are synthesized to provide the basis for long-term monitoring of
the sites studied, thus providing a real-world approach to environmental
investigations that require ecosystem level analyses.
