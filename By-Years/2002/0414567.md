Data-stream processing has become critical in numerous present-day applications.
Example stream applications that use Extensible Markup Language (XML) for
representing the data include selective dissemination of information such as
personalized news delivery, XML message brokers for Business to Business (B2B)
message-oriented middleware servers. This project explores a novel paradigm for
XML stream processing that integrates token-based automata computation and
tuple-based algebraic computation into one uniform framework. The resulting
Raindrop architecture supports the flexible exploitation of both automata and
algebra computation paradigms. This, among other advantages, enables the
application of mature algebraic optimization techniques such as query plan
rewriting and cost estimation within this new context. Furthermore, this
approach enables pushing operators in and out of the automata, based on data
statistics. The Raindrop framework incorporates additional advanced features,
such as schema-based optimization, multiple execution modes and run-time
physical plan reformulation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A long-reaching impact is
expected in many real-world applications that are Internet centric, as these can
benefit from the resulting XML-based stream monitoring technology. Broader
impacts include the development and dissemination of the software systems
developed via the project's Web site (http://davis.wpi.edu/~dsrg/raindrop), and
the integration of the PIs' research activities with undergraduate and graduate
teaching in line with the project-based spirit of education at WPI. &lt;br/&gt;
