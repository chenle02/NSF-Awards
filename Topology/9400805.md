9400805 Milgram Milgram will work mainly in areas related to the geometry of
moduli spaces of Yang-Mills instantons on 4-manifolds and monopoles on
3-manifolds. He will focus on the explicit relations between instantons on ruled
surfaces (which are now reasonably well understood) and instantons on general
algebraic surfaces. Cohen will emphasize Floer homology and a conjectured Floer
homotopy theory. S. Kerckhoff will primarily study the deformation spaces of
hyperbolic structures on 3-manifolds, with particular attention to problems of
degeneration at the boundaries. Recent interactions between mathematics and
physics have brought new ideas and problems into mathematics related in part to
the physicists' desire better to understand quantum field theory. Among the
mathematical results of this interaction have been extensive new information
about the geometry of 3- and 4-dimensional spaces, including counterexamples to
basic conjectures and new structure results. The major focus of this project is
to apply much more advanced results from deep, well-developed areas of
mathematics, such as algebraic topology and homotopy theory, to these new ideas
and problems, as well as to related questions. ***
