The objective of this Growing Convergence Research project is to develop
emotionally-responsive computing systems that can detect human emotions and
automatically deploy resources or prioritize services to meet human needs in
disaster or crises situations. This research is motivated by the need to more
rapidly assess the massive data flows that occur during crisis events to better
respond to the situations. Through the convergence of computer and computational
sciences, neurotechnology, and psychological sciences, this project will develop
technologies that can monitor humans' emotions and process the emotional states
to strategically deploy resources to address human needs. Emotionally-responsive
computing systems could be used by 911 call-centers to prioritize calls or by
first-responders responding to a public threat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
exploratory research will a) develop and validate computational assessments of
human behavior in controlled virtual reality simulation, b) develop an
integrated physiological measurement package targeting electrodermal activity,
heart rate, electroencephalography, and pupillometry, and c) assess whether
systems that adapt to emotional states must be trained toward the individual or
group types. Key research questions focus on understanding the timescale at
which emotions can and should be sensed in reaction to situational changes and
the diversity of human emotional responses and group
dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
