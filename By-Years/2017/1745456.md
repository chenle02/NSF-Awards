The College of St. Scholastica requests funding to expand a summer 2017
professional development program for teachers--Mobile CSP Immersion Week--to
include a 2.5-day workshop for school counselors. School counselors can have a
large influence on the participation of underrepresented students, enrolling
them in computer science courses, exposing them to computing careers, and
guiding them in this course of study and job preparation in their post-secondary
lives. The workshop will leverage the Counselors for Computing (C4C) program
developed at the National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT).

In the past, Mobile CSP has provided C4C kits and webinars to teachers
completing the Mobile CSP professional development course, with the goal of
having the teachers engage their school's counselors as allies in the effort to
broaden participation in computing. With this workshop, counselors will join
their Mobile CSP teacher colleagues for distinct, and also shared, professional
learning. The expectation is that schools will be more effective in broadening
participation in their CS classes when a team of professionals are working
together as a common effort. The workshop will encourage counselors to complete
at least 5 follow-up activities, and to carry out events within the 2017-2018
academic year in the five-state Midwest region. Evaluation of the conference
attendees (both Mobile CSP teachers and C4C counselors) will be used to
determine effectiveness of the training as well as, when applicable, what effect
attending professional development together has on recruitment activities at
local schools.
