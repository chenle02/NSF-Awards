This three-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research on
the neural mechanisms underlying spatial cognition. The collaboration involves
researchers, Jeffrey S. Taube at Dartmouth College, Patricia Sharp at Yale
University, and Alain Berthoz, Director of the Laboratory for the Physiology of
Perception at the College de France. The investigators will perform experimental
studies to determine the respective roles and mechanisms for integrating sensory
and motor information in head orientation. The US investigators bring to this
collaboration expertise in the area of head direction cells. This is
complemented by the French investigators' expertise on physiological methods,
mechanism of navigation, and vestibular systems. The project will advance
understanding of how internal sensory cues contribute to navigation and neural
mechanisms of navigation.
