9319517 Linker The investigators will study the stability and evolution of
magnetic arcades on the sun that can lead to coronal mass ejections (CME's).
CME's provide a spectacular manifestation of solar activity. The plasma and
magnetic flux ejected into the solar wind by CME's subsequently interacts with
the Earth's magnetic field to produce geomagnetic disturbances. The underlying
mechanism which is responsible for the initiation of CME's is not well
understood. The investigators will continue a line of research that they have
conducted over the past three years by studying the effect of photospheric shear
flows on 2-D and 3-D helmet streamers. They will also consider the effect of
shear on 3-D arcades and 3-D helmet streamers. They will develop a model of
coronal magnetic fields based on observed fields and direct comparison between
theory and white-light coronal observations. The main emphasis will be to
investigate the stability and evolution of more realistic magnetic field
configurations. ***
