Abstract

Award: DMS-9972172 Principal Investigator: Chuu-Lian Terng

The principal investigator proposes jointly with Karen Uhlenbeck to work on the
following projects concerning geometric integrable systems: (1) to understand
the symmetries and geometric aspects of soliton equations, (2) to study the
relations among Lax pairs, bi-Hamiltonian structures, infinitely many commuting
Hamiltonians, Backlund and Darboux transformations, and the inverse scattering
transform, (3) to apply the techniques of soliton theory to geometric problems,
in particular, submanifolds in symmetric spaces, harmonic maps and self-dual
Yang Mills fields.

The three most well-known soliton equations are KdV, SGE and NLS equations. The
KdV equation describes wave motion in a shallow canal; the SGE equation arose
from plasma physics; and the NLS equation describes the propogation of light in
a fiber optic cable and is currently used in telecommunication. These equations
also arose in the 19 century differential geometry. The geometric connection
gives interesting methods to construct more soliton equations and solutions.
Many interesting problems in mathematical physics and geometry are now known to
be related to soliton equations. The main goal of this proposal is to use
geometric method to study soliton equations and apply the theory of soliton
equations to problems in differential geometry.
