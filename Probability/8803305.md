The principal investigator will continue his investigation of the use of
Vapnik-Cervonenkis (V-C) classes in estimation of multivariate distributions.
The validity of the estimates is judged from the deviation of the estimated from
the true probability for some collection of regions C. A class C is called a V-C
class for m if it "shatters" no set of m points. By definition a class C
shatters a set F if every subset of F can be viewed as the intersection of F
with some element of C. The principal investigator has shown before that the
deviation of the estimates from the true probability multiplied by square root
of n, approaches a normal limit for all possible distributions only if C is a
V-C class. This theoretical result will be made practical and useful by finding
tight bounds on the deviations for fixed n and designing computationally
efficient methods. Other applications relate to tests for normality and
classification problems.
