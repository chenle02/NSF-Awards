This Small Business Innovation Research Program (SBIR) Phase I project will
develop an optical wireless system. The proliferation of wireless devices and
new applications are pushing Radio-Frequency (RF) wireless technologies to their
limits. Optics can fundamentally alter high-speed wireless communications
because, relative to RF, optical systems provide more spectral bandwidth,
higher-performance, and freedom from regulatory burdens. However current optical
wireless approaches are fixed in nature, limited in data rate, and susceptible
to interference. An optical wireless system is proposed that can adjust to
optimize performance in many configurations by combining Multiple Input Multiple
Output (MIMO) Digital Signal Processing (DSP) techniques with novel, adaptive
optical component technology. The anticipated technical results include creating
the system architecture, developing the design, and demonstrating key
technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this
project includes transformative technology, knowledge generation, and industry-
university interaction. The emergence of high-speed broadband Internet access
enhanced numerous aspects of American society. The increased bandwidth of
optical relative to RF wireless solutions makes dramatically higher data rates
possible, transforming wireless applications and societal usage. Commercially
the adaptive solution is a major differentiator for optical wireless, enabling
optimization by application with a single design to address numerous large
consumer and enterprise markets. The emergence of optical wireless technology
and the multi-disciplinary nature of the system offer many opportunities for
knowledge generation and provide enhanced industry-university interaction.
