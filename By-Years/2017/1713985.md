Systems in which charged particles interact with complex fluids are of great
importance in science and arise in a great variety of contexts, from plasma
physics to biology and medicine. The emphasis of this project is on boundary and
interface interactions. Two different applications of the unified theoretical
approach of this research are highlighted in the project: one to boundary
interaction of charged particles in fluids of engineering and biological
interest, and the other, to models of extreme coastal events due to tropical
storms (storm surge). The methodology developed in the project is widely
applicable, from small scale particles interacting with fields and solvents, to
large scale geophysical phenomena. The project is directly relevant to studies
in neighboring scientific and engineering disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In
recent years, there has been significant progress in the study of nonlocal
interaction in extended systems, with application to free boundary evolution and
complex fluids. The project considers electromagnetic fields, charged particles,
and complex flu ids coupled through nonlinear and nonlocal equations. This
project is aimed at introducing, developing and extending methods of treatment
of coupled systems in which there are dimensional contrasts, in particular,
active interfaces and boundaries. New developments in multi-scale and nonlocal
analysis are proposed to address the challenges presented by the nonlinear
systems with active interfaces and boundaries. Lagrangian-Eulerian methods based
on natural path spaces will be developed in conjunction with stochastic
descriptions which are appropriate for systems in which random forces influence
large scale behavior.
