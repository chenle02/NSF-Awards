The Y.E.S. Summer Science Camp is a six week commuter mathematics and science
program along with a follow-up academic year program. The program serves two
hundred and twenty-five seventh through ninth grade African-American, Hispanic
and Native-American students over a three year period. The objectives of the
program are to: 1) introduce students to science, engineering and mathematics
concepts in a culturally relevant manner; 2) teach students how academic
coursework relates to their futures; 3) show students how science, engineering
and math relates to the world around them; and 4) help parents become better
informed and actively involved in the education of their children. The program
involves volunteer scientists and engineers from local industry and San
Francisco State University. Program activities include: science, computer
science, mathematics and communications courses, guests speakers, laboratory
demonstrations/experiments, field trips and group research projects. During the
academic year students participate in the existing MESA Program at their school
site.
