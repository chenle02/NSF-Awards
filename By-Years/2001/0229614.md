Laboratory experiments are carried out on three fluid systems that manifest
processes important in the dynamics of terrestrial and planetary atmospheres:
(1) Nonlinear waves and turbulence in a rotating cylinder driven by a
differentially rotating lid. Instabilities in this system lead to rotating waves
that deviate from smooth circular or elliptical shape by having sharp corners.
These so-called "polygonal" waves are similar in appearance to waves observed in
hurricane eyewalls and in the polar atmosphere of Saturn. (2) Instability and
wave formation in a rotating hydraulic jump. A circular hydraulic jump in a
rotating outflow layer is an alternative mechanism for the formation of
polygonal waves. (3) The structure and mechanics of precessing mean flows in
turbulent rotating convection. Direct measurements of eddy stresses and mean
flow profiles will explain the mechanism of mean-flow generation in rotating
turbulent convection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These experiments provide data on
nonlinear flows analogous to those in the atmosphere that are difficult to
obtain by any other means. Moreover, they give the information needed to
evaluate small-scale turbulence parameterization in large-eddy simulations (LES)
of geophysical flows. Controlled laboratory experiments that involve constraints
similar to those in the atmosphere (particularly rotation and stratification)
provide a valuable testing ground. These and similar laboratory experiments are
used in graduate and undergraduate classes to demonstrate fundamental fluid
processes of relevance to atmospheric science.
