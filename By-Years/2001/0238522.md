Abstract (0238522)&lt;br/&gt;Chad Landis, Rice
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER project is focused on the studies
that are aimed at developing the 3 dimensional, fully coupled, constitutive laws
and fracture mechanics theories for performance and reliability modeling of
ferroelectric ceramics devices. Information obtained from microelectromechanical
self consistent models will be incorporated into a phenomenological constitutive
framework, and the constitutive laws will be applied to analyze the fracture
processes in ferroelectric ceramics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad impacts
include both domestic and international collaborations,wide dissemination of
computer codes over the web, graduate and undergraduate students involvement and
mentoring, and the transfer of the modeling and analytical tools to device
designers and researchers. Out reach to undergraduate groups and women and
minorities will be emphasized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a new CAREER award
of the CMS/ENG Division.&lt;br/&gt;
