Narrative: Micoorganisms found in aquatic volcanic environments have been
isolated and shown to grow at temperatures exceeding l00 C. The characteristic
to withstand high temperatures presents interesting possibilities from a
biotechnological perspective, such as the production of highly thermostable
proteins, unusual metabolic behavior, and new genetic material. A road block to
commercialization has been the difficulty in growing and manipulating these
organisms on a large scale. This work is focused on the development of protocols
and associated bioreactors that can be used for the growth and study of
extremely thermophilic archaebacteria. Particular emphasis has been placed on
those archaebacteria that are classified as sulfur-dependent extreme
thermophiles, and include both the Sulfolobus and Pyrodictium genera. This
choice was made because of the potential industrial importance of microorganisms
for industrial application.
