9302936 Fine In this field study, the PI's will participate with Indonesian
scientists in a study of the flow of water from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean
through the Indonesian archipelago. In this particular component, the PI will
carry out tracer measurements designed to identify water mass ages and paths,
and to provide constraints on the hydrography, biological property, and nutrient
measurements, supported under other grants. The Indonesians will supply the
research vessel. Joint work by Australian and other neighboring countries will
provide current meters and sea level measurements.
