This project has two major objectives: (1) to improve substantially the science
education of non-science majors and (2) to enhance the upper- level laboratory
program for chemistry majors. A modern gas chromatograph (GC) will be used in a
new, popular course in forensic chemistry for non-majors. With the GC, students
will study methods of arson investigation and analyze the components of
flammable liquid mixtures, accelerants, and residues from fires. These
investigations provide a vehicle for students who are not science majors to
learn important concepts in chemistry, principles of scientific reasoning,
experimental design, and critical interpretation of data. Chemistry majors will
use the modern GC system, which can be interfaced to the department's computers,
for laboratory course experiments and projects in Instrumental Analysis, Organic
Chemistry, Physical Chemistry, and Integrated Advanced Laboratory.
