This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address a
novel approach for improving the efficiency of net shape forming operations. In
particular, it would benefit Powder Metal (PM) processing in the costly area of
post finishing operations for PM parts. These operations contribute
significantly to the overall part cost. Elimination or reduction of post
finishing operations would have a significant impact on PM processing economics.
Phase I will develop a process based on the application of electric field energy
to enhance the surface finish of PM parts during the sintering operation. The
technique appears to improve surface finish by reducing surface porosity. The
Phase I effort will focus on determining the optimum conditions under which
Electric Field Sintering (EFS) can improve PM surface finishes. Commercial
application of EFS equipment focuses on PM sintering operations by metal powder
and parts producers. In addition, manufacture of high performance transmission
gears is one of several other fields of potential application.
