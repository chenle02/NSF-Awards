The goal of this research is to identify and characterize the genes involved in
the unique surface-inducible inhibition of septation associated with swarmer
cell differentiation in Proteus mirabilis. Initial experiments will to provide
an initial understanding of the molecular mechanisms that allows Proteus to
inhibit cellular septation as a consequence of surface-induced swarmer cell
differentiation. To do so, surface-induced elo genes will be cloned from P.
mirabillis using previously constructed Tn5 insertions. Selected elo genes will
be characterized by nucleotide sequence analysis and possible homology to the
DNA sequence of known E. coli morphogenes determined. The 5' upstream regulatory
region of select elo genes will be examined to identify putative sites
controlling gene expression. Lastly, transcriptional fusions between selected
elo genes and promoterless luciferase genes will be constructed so that elo gene
expression can be measured in P. mirabilis. %%% The significance of this
research lies in the uniqueness of the control of elo gene expression. The
environmental regulator controlling septation (formation of two cells from one)
in E. coli is currently unknown. Using P. mirabilis as a model, it may be
possible to provide the missing data needed to understanding the regulation of
septation in E. coli.
