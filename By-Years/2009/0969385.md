The major objective of this research effort is to study the stabilization of
mine tailings through geopolymerization so that they can be used as construction
material in large scale and in a cost-effective way. The research will use an
innovative multi-scale and multi-disciplinary approach and consist of (a) macro-
scale study of the mechanical and environmental properties of mine tailings
after geopolymerization; (b) investigation of the micro/nano-scale structures
and interactions of mine tailings after geopolymerization; and (c) discrete
element method simulations to investigate how the micro/nano-scale
characteristics affect the macro-scale behavior. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project will help promote the utilization of mine tailings as construction
material and reduce the disposal of mine tailings, saving the land required for
the disposal impoundments and the related high monetary, environmental and
ecological costs, reducing the demand for virgin materials that would need
quarrying, and decreasing the use of energy-intensive ordinary Portland cement.
So it will contribute to sustainable development and have major economical,
environmental and societal impacts. By integrating the research results into
graduate, undergraduate, and online courses, this project will broaden awareness
and knowledge of civil engineering students on sustainable development, a topic
increasingly emphasized in Civil Engineering. Combining the research with the on
campus Summer Engineering Academy and K-12 mentoring programs will introduce
K-12 students from diverse backgrounds to the field of sustainable development.
This research will also broaden participation of underrepresented groups in a
significant way, by recruiting and mentoring graduate and undergraduate
assistants from underrepresented groups.
