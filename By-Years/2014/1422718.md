Since the late 1970s, the National Science Foundation has sponsored a series of
surveys to gauge public attitudes toward and understanding of science and
technology. The scientific community has raised concerns about two of the survey
items that have been part of the factual knowledge scale for many years. One of
the items is intended to measure understanding of evolution, and the other is
about the origins of the universe. In both items, there is a concern that a
respondent?s answer may not be measuring scientific knowledge, but rather some
aspect of religious belief. This potential interaction of religious belief and
knowledge may vary among religious groups, and therefore influence the
understanding of scientific knowledge in the U.S. population.

This proposal focuses on how different wordings of the questions about evolution
and the origins of the universe may affect conclusions about science literacy.
An experiment in the 2012 General Social Survey varied the question wording of
these items by adding ?According to the theory of evolution?? or ?According to
astronomers?? to stress that the questions are about the current state of
scientific knowledge, not the respondent?s personal beliefs. Preliminary
analyses show that higher percentages of the U.S. population answer these
versions of the questions correctly than the original versions. This project
investigates the measurement properties of these questions more thoroughly. We
use confirmatory factor analysis to study measurement equivalence across
religious groups on both the original and experimental versions of these science
literacy measures.

The level of science literacy in the U.S. population can affect many aspects of
society. Science literacy serves as a resource for individuals and communities.
For example, individuals with higher levels of science literacy can make better
decisions about their own health or the health of others. Science literacy can
also impact economic growth and development by influencing factors such as the
rate of new discoveries and technological development. Hence, it is important
for policy makers to understand the level of science literacy in the population.
The goal of this proposal is to clarify the degree to which survey questions
provide accurate measures of science literacy. It specifically focuses on how
different wordings of survey questions about the origins of the universe and
evolution may affect how one draws conclusions about science literacy.
