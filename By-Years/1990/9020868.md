Transport ATPases play a central role in the bioenergetics of all living cells.
In the past we have shown that the F-(eubacterial) and V-type (eukaryotic and
archaebacterial) ATPases are very useful molecular markers for early organismal
evolution. The proposed research aims to extend the use of the nuclear encoded
ATPAse subunits to the early radiation of eukaryotes (especially flagellates and
algae) and to the evolution of land plants. Parts of the genes encoding the
catalytic subunits of V-type ATPASes will be amplified directly from the genomic
or cDNA of various organisms using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The
obtained sequences will be used to determine the phylogenetic relations between
these organisms, including evaluations of the significance of the derived
branching patterns.
