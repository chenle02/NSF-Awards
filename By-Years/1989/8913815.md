The National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) of Michigan State
University is a national users facility for fundamental research in nuclear
science. This cooperative agreement provides funds for operation of the NSCL,
for support of its users program and for support of the research of the MSU
staff in nuclear science and in accelerator and instrumentation physics.
Facilities at the Laboratory include two compact superconducting cyclotrons of
NSCL design and construction. The K500 cyclotron, the world's first
superconducting cyclotron, began operation in 1982, and the K1200 cyclotron, the
world's largest superconducting cyclotron, was commissioned in June 1988. A
flexible array of detection equipment will be complete for use during the
proposal period. The NSCL will then be an exceptionally powerful international
facility for research on nucleus-nucleus collisions. High quality beams will be
available over the whole range of projectile mass, from hydrogen to uranium, for
studies of nuclear phenomena in the transition region where the projectile
velocity crosses the velocity of nuclear sound, and nuclear shock waves compress
the nuclear material. These beams will also make possible unique studies of the
structure of nuclei. The cyclotrons provide an array of heavy ions unique in the
U.S. and, together with the associated instrumentation, support an extensive
national users program in heavy ion physics. The MSU research activity supported
under this cooperative agreement includes an active accelerator physics research
program. Instrumentation development, particularly involving superconducting
technology, is another major activity. Graduate student training is a prominent
aspect of the NSCL activity. Approximately 30 graduate students in residence are
supported by this cooperative agreement.
