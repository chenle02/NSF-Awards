This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
provides continued support to Dr. Michael Lattman of the Chemistry Department,
Southern Methodist University, for the investigation of main group elements with
macrocycles, that is, large organic species which bind to the main group element
through more than one atom. The macrocycles used in this project,
calix(4)arenes, can bind through up to four oxygen atoms, imposing constraints
which result in unusual types of bonding. For example, six coordinate compounds
of phosphorus and silicon have been observed in these systems. The goal of this
research is to prepare and characterize phosphorus and silicon compounds of this
type, including the synthesis of clusters of the macrocyclic units. In some
cases, silicon-transition metal bonds will be formed in the chain-links between
the macrocyclic units. In other cases, transition metals may be able to be
incorporated into cavities formed by the macrocycle as sterically adjusted by
association with phosphorus or silicon. This fundamental research is primarily
designed to test the bonding capabilities of silicon and phosphorus, but may
result in improved understanding of the action of transition metals in shape
selective catalysts or a new approach to catalyst design.
