This project is adding a solid-state photon detector-system to an existing
nuclear laboratory course reguired for senior physics majors. Reasons for
integrating this instrument into the senior course are:(1) It is now a widely
used and often preferred photon detector because of its good energy resolution
and affordable cost. (2) It enables the students to learn the technigue of
"Proton Induced X-ray Emission" (PIXE) for non- destructive trace element
detection. This technique supplements Rutherford backscattering (RBS) and
Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) another two important non-destructive
analytical techniques which are already taught in the course. (3) Together with
the existing Nal(Tl) photon detection system, it allows the students to learn
the technique of determining the absolute activity of a radioactive source by
gamma-gamma coincidence measurement. (4) Students learn to use fast-timing
electronics and coincidence techniques, and to program PC-based multichannel
analyzers. The addition of the proposed equipment makes this course essentially
complete for learning radiation measurement techniques and introductory applied
nuclear technologies. NSF grant funds are being matched with funds from non-
federal sources.
