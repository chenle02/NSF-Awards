Non-technical abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Liquid helium changes from a normal
liquid to a superfluid at low temperatures. It is called a superfluid because it
can flow with zero viscosity with no loss in energy. Once set flowing in a
continuous channel, superfluid will never stop. This fascinating property is
related to the fact that liquid helium enters a quantum state below 2.176
degrees Kelvin. Remarkably, recent experiments at the University of
Massachusetts and Penn State found helium atoms can flow through solid helium
samples like a superfluid. The Penn State team is measuring the flow rate of the
helium atoms through solid helium samples of different densities, thicknesses,
crystal orientations to understand the exact mechanism responsible for this
phenomenon. The proposed experiments provide opportunities for postdocs,
graduate and undergraduate students to receive the most rigorous trainings to be
future scientists. The principal investigator and his students and post-docs are
active participants in the full range of outreach activities sponsored by the
Penn State Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) for K-12
students. These organized and coordinated outreach activities are far more
effective than isolated individual efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical
Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The solid helium samples are sandwiched between
superfluid leads in the form of porous Vycor glass cylinders infused with
superfluid helium. The mass flow is thought to be related to the motion of edge
dislocations and/or the transport of helium atoms through the superfluid screw
dislocations in solid helium samples. Mass flow experiments through the
superfluid/solid helium/superfluid "sandwiches' are in progress to test the
veracity of the dislocation line model. Since dislocation lines are absent in
solid helium grown inside highly porous silica aerogel, measurements in such
solid samples provide a direct test on the necessity of dislocation lines for
the phenomenon. Solid samples of different thicknesses ranging from 8 Âµm (where
dislocation lines do not form a connected network) to a few mm are being studied
to understand the effect of connectivity of the dislocation network. The
dependence of crystal orientation is studied by affixing graphite crystals with
their c-axis (which nucleates epitaxial growth of solid helium crystals)
pointing either along or perpendicular to mass flow direction inside of the
sample space. The mass flow through solid helium is driven by superfluid
fountain pressure imposed across the samples. The flow rate as a function of
temperature and the fountain pressure are measured to search for the boundary
separating the dissipation-free and dissipative regions.
