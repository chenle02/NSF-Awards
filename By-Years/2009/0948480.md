This travel award supports participation in the ACM SIGCOMM 4th International
Conference on emerging Networking Experiments and Technologies (CoNEXT) held
between December 1-4, 2009 at Rome, Italy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This technical
conference addresses a range of important networking issues, including: internet
measurement and modeling, wireless networks, mobile and cellular networks, ad
hoc and sensors networks, economic aspects of the internet, network security
issues, data center networks, peer-to-peer and overlay networks, routing and
traffic engineering, delay and disruption tolerant networks, and new networking
protocols and architectures. The Re-Architecting the Internet workshop which is
co-located with CoNEXT 2009 is of special interest as it addresses the important
area of novel networking technologies that will shape the future of
Internetworking. Thus attendance at CoNEXT provides a valuable research and
career development experience for graduate students from United States academic
institutions. Participants have the opportunity to present their work and
technical sessions, as well as interact with peers engaged in state-of-the-art
research in the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of special significance, the
conference offers a student workshop that will enable students to present and
obtain feedback on their work in progress. Approximately 7 to 10 US-based
graduate students are provided the opportunity to attend CoNEXT. The travel
awards will target graduate students, in particular female and under-represented
minority students, since they often have limited travel funds to attend
conferences; attendance at such events is an important part of their educational
experience.
