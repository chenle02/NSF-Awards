The general objective of this project is to enhance understanding of the
development of precipitation and electrification, as well as the association
between the two, in warm-based clouds where "warm rain" processes, including
coalescence-freezing, are active. The work involves study of the cloud
microphysical, kinematic, and electrical characteristics using data collected
with the armored T-28 meteorological research aircraft, in conjunction with data
gathered by other aircraft, radars, and additional observing systems. The T-28
will probe the interiors of mature convective storms to obtain in situ
information on winds, sub-cloud-scale dynamical structures, temperatures,
microphysical properties, and the electric field structure. Electric field
measurements made by the T-28 will be combined with surface field and lightning
location measurements, as well as measurements from other aircraft and vertical
electrical soundings, to help deduce the charge distribution in the storms, its
evolution with time, and how it may be influenced by microphysical and dynamical
charge separation mechanisms.
