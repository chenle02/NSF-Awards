This research is a "Research Opportunity for Women / Research Planning Grant"
pilot project by a young cultural anthropologist who will study a low-caste
village in Sri Lanka to examine the village-level consequences of radical
changes in the national economy of this developing state. The investigator has
done research in this village before and the pilot study will allow her to apply
macro-level economic theory to this micro-case of development. The specific
issues to be examined are to explain the villages apparent economic development
in an environment of economic hardship. This project is important because it
supports the scientific research of a young woman investigator, and helps her
develop her potential for doing large-scale scientific research. The topic of
explaining variation in the economic development of poor developing-country
villages is an important one, as only by examining and understanding the
successful cases of local-level village development can we help planners develop
policies to stimulate thus development on a broad scale.
