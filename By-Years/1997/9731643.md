9731643 NEREM This award initiates the Engineering Research Center for the
Engineering of Living Tissues. The lead institution is the Georgia Institute of
Technology and the Emory University School of Medicine is a core partner
institution. The award funds the first five years of effort under a new
cooperative agreement, with a potential duration of ten years. This ERC will
address an area of great importance to health and health care at an opportune
time. The tissue engineering industry is at a nascent stage, and many of the
developments in the field are based on empiricism or art. This center will bring
a more fundamental understanding of the underlying biological and engineering
principles to the area of tissue engineering, filling the gap that currently
exists between academic understanding and industrial reduction to practice.
Equally, if not more importantly, this Center will produce well trained
engineers with a strong background in the biological and medical sciences who
have worked closely with clinical practitioners and industry. This ERC focuses
on the design and development of tissue substitutes that replace, enhance or
maintain natural tissue function. The Center's research program is organized
into three thrusts that represent a continuum of the challenges of tissue
engineering: cell technology, cell construct technology (prototype organ or
tissues structures) and integration into living systems. Integrated with
expertise in medical theory and practice, the ERC will carry out research on the
underlying biology and immune response of tissue cells, the application of
fundamental engineering design concepts to the growth and function of cell
structures or constructs, and the incorporation of these constructs into living
systems. This Center promises to produce breakthroughs in both the underlying
understanding of tissue function and the technology required for tissue
replacement. The two institutions will develop a joint program of bioengineering
in support of th e ERC. ERC outreach will involve Spellman College and Morehouse
College, local historically Black institutions, and a special program to involve
local high school teachers and their students. Industry will be actively
involved through a group of firms, representing both emerging start-up and well-
established firms. This award is the outcome of the entry of this ERC's pre-
proposal in the FY 1997-98 Engineering Research Centers Competition under the
ERC Program Announcement, NSF 97-5.
