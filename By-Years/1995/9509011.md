The central theme of this research is the development of a fuller theoretical
description of the behavior of memoryless-error- function (or Bussgang) type
blind equalization algorithms, in particular CMA, as used in practice with
finite-length, fractional spacing, higher-order (non-constant modulus, non-
uniformly distributed) source constellations, (deterministic and stochastic)
correlated source time series, and modest channel noise. The initial target is
the behavior of fractionally-spaced CMA with a correlated (or periodic) source,
which appears capable of causing misbehavior in practice. We plan to use
analytical tools from topologically based, algebraic-geometry (in particular
Bernstein's theorem, relaxation methods, and Morse theory) non typically
associated with the study of adaptive filters in addition to averaging theory
tools popular in adaptive systems analysis. The ultimate intent is to convert an
expanded theory into situation dependent design guidelines for stepsize, length,
fractional- spacing, initialization selection, and failure recovery tricks for
the use of CMA as a start-up scheme (with a subsequent switch to decision-
direction) for high data throughput applications. We plan to translate our
analytical advances on CMA to fractionally-spaced realizations of other blind
equalizer algorithms of the memoryless error function class (including
refinements to CMA), for which actual operating data can be obtained
industrially as for CMA. We also plan to use our behavior insights into CMA to
help provide fair comparisons on actual operating data to competing schemes such
as symbol-spaced decision feedback equalizers and similar complexity algorithms
based on second-order correlation statistics of single-input, multiple- output
models of fractionally-spaced equalization.
