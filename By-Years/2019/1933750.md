The Quantitative Studies of Diversity and Inclusion Center (QSDIC) will convene
the Second Annual Diversity and Inclusion Research Conference at the Graduate
Center of the City College of New York (CCNY). CCNY and QSDI aim to establish
Diversity &amp; Inclusion (D&amp;I) as a field of interdisciplinary academic
rigorous research. In 2018, the first annual conference took place with this aim
in mind as well as to foster academic and industry collaborations. The funding
for this conference will be used to support the planning and implementation of
the 2019 conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
