This is a proposal to carry out an active source EM experiment on the sea floor
on 25-40 my. old lithosphere. A number of receivers will be deployed at a site
off the coast of California and the source will be towed through the array along
various paths. Data will be collected over many ranges and directions of
propagation and over a range of frequencies. Thus the electrical conductivity
structure over a depth range of 2 to 50 km will be determined, and also the
lateral anisotropy and heterogeneity of that structure. The data will complement
that obtained in an earlier experiment on lithosphere of different age, so that
an initial estimate of the electrical conductivity- age dependence of the
lithosphere can be obtained. This is a unique experiment; the information cannot
be obtained by any other electrical methods experiment and should provide
important information about a fundamental physical property of the oceanic
lithosphere.
