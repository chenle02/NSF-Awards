This project partially supports the core support for the work of the Board on
Mathematical Sciences, Commission on Physical Sciences, Mathematics, and
Applications of the National Research Council. The Board activities include the
annual Department Chairs Colloquium for the mathematical sciences, the National
Science and Technology Week Symposium, specific reports, the initiation of
reports, and the continuous oversight of all activities. Other activities of the
Board include providing recommendations on research directions and reports on
education in the mathematical sciences, interaction of the mathematical sciences
with other areas of science, the health of the mathematical sciences, and
emerging research directions in the mathematical sciences. This award contains
support from the National Science Foundation and the Air Force Office of
Scientific Research. Other agencies supporting this project include the Army
Research Office, the Office of Naval Research, the Department of Energy, and the
National Security Agency.
