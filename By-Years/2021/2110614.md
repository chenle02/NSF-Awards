Modern quantum techniques have allowed scientists to prepare molecules in their
ground states and cool these molecules down to a temperature regime of a few
tens of nanokelvin. Such ultracold molecules offer scientists unprecedented
opportunities to explore a vast range of quantum phenomena unattainable before.
Ultracold molecules could form new quantum matter that has no counterparts in
other systems, give rise to a new platform for studying quantum chemistry, and
potentially serve as a new powerful apparatus to implement quantum information
processing. In all of these studies, a fundamental issue is to understand
scatterings between molecules and how such scatterings determine the chemical
reactions and the formation of novel quantum phases. Addressing this issue is
the goal of this project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will explore
scatterings between molecules and study how these scatterings lead to quantum
entanglement between different degrees of freedom and consequently the rise of
novel topological quantum matter. The group will further implement the
scatterings as a unique tool to manipulate two-body decays and will explore new
universal relations for molecules with losses, which are inaccessible in closed
systems. These universal relations will allow the team to trace both the
reaction rate and many-body correlations using contacts, the central quantity in
dilute quantum systems. The outcome of this project will deliver new tools to
control losses of ultracold molecules and provide guidance for experimentalists
to search for novel superfluids and other quantum many-body phases. Furthermore,
it could bring the research of contacts and universal relations to a new domain
of open quantum systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
