This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2002.
The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest
quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to
increase the number of research scientists from underrepresented minority
groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific
enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will
play important roles in training of the future
workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan for this
fellowship is entitled "Role of antagonistic coevolution in the rate of male
accessory gland protein divergence." Within a mating system, males and females
often have divergent reproductive strategies, creating an antagonistic
coevolutionary relationship between the sexes. The objective of this research is
to investigate the covariance between sexual conflict intensity and the
expression of sexually selected traits, life history traits and the rate of
protein divergence in closely related Drosophila species. &lt;br/&gt;
