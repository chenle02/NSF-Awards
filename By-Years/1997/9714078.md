ABSTRACT EEC-9714078 HUDSON, KEITH The University of Arkansas at Little Rock is
planning to become a research sit of the University of Tennessee
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center I/UCRC for Measurement and
Controls. This planning grant funds an industry/university planning meeting at
the University of Arkansas at Little Rock to determine if an industrial research
agenda can be developed that will be supported by sufficient companies to form a
multi-university I/UCRC. Projects proposed for industrial consideration and to
augment the I/UCRC for Measurement and Control are 1.) Multi-Wave Opacity
Monitor; 2.) Study of High Energy Nitrogen Fuels for Hybrid Rockets; 3.)
Investigation of Smokeless Propellants for Air Bag Deployment; 4.) Determination
of Combustion Efficiency of Smokeless Powders; and 5.) An Improved Raman Gas
Analyzer for Smoke Stack Emissions.
