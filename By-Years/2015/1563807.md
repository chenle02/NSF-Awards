The goal of making humanoid robots that assist people in the real world a
reality requires that these robots can walk reliably in many different
environments and terrains. This project leverages strong progress made by the
PIs in the DARPA Robotics Challenge to address new techniques for whole-body
locomotion of humanoid robots, based on the blending of model-based and
parametric control approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A central conundrum in
humanoid robotics is that manually designed, policy-based controllers are often
more robust than model-based optimizing controllers, but model-based controllers
more easily generalize to automated behavior generation with direct control of
foot or hand placements. This project tests the hypothesis that incorporating
policy-based control as either a cost, a constraint, or a replacement within the
model-based online optimal control framework produces controllers that combine
the advantages of both approaches.
