Dipping reflectors within the oceanic crust have been observed in marine
multichannel seismic data from several different areas. These reflectors are
frequently confined to the lower crust and either die out in the mid-crust or
flatten out and merge with strong sub-horizontal upper crustal reflectors. A
small number of obrserved reflectors cut through the entire crustal section. The
geological significance of of these intra-crustal dipping reflectors is still
poorly understood. They have been interpreted as normal faults, primary magmatic
layering in the lower crust, or low-angle thrust faults. This project will do
additional processing and interpretation on data sets from three areas in the
Atlantic Ocean; the Blake-Spur fracture zone, the MARK area south of the Kane
fracture zone, and the Canary basin.
