The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program provides
support to increase the participation of minority faculty and students in
science and engineering by strengthening the research environments and
capabilities of institutions that have significant minority student enrollments.
Researchers at Jackson State University will use support from this planning and
developmental grant to develop integrated theoretical perspectives in sociology
to examine the effects of gender role socialization on familial and occupational
role performance among women. The researchers will also develop strategies to
measure and interpret data on familial and occupational socialization factors.
The principal investigator is an experienced minority sociologist and researcher
who has a commendable publication record. This planning and developmental grant
will further strengthen the capability of sociologists at Jackson State to
perform mainstream research.
