Although the plans for the National Research and Education Network (NREN) have
evolved since 1988, they continue to revolve around a decision for phased
implementation that is embedded in the larger framework of the High Performance
Computing and Communications Program (HPCC). The current phase, now referred to
as the Interagency Interim NREN, involves extending the reach of the Internet
network complex that includes the NSFNET Backbone, midlevels, campus networks
that rely on the backbone for interconnection, and other federally sponsored
networks, all of which serve the research and education community. It also
involves enhancements to the range and quality of network-based services. The
National Academy's Computer Science and Telecommunications Board (CSTB) will
revisit its earlier analysis since 1990 of key policy and management issues. It
will produce a report following 4 to 5 meetings of its 15 member panel which
will take testimony from outside experts and other members of the Internet
networking community.***
