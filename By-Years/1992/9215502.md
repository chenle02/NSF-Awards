This interagency agreement between the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the
Department of State (DOS) supports the NSF/Europe office. Operating funds for
salaries, benefits, housing, educational allowances, etc., are provided by DOS
and subsequently reimbursed to DOS by NSF. The NSF/Europe office serves an
important link between the American and European scientific communities through
the dissemination of technical information, the development of ad hoc reports,
and interaction with international organizations (NATO, OECD, UNESCO, the
European Science Foundation, etc.). This office provides an excellent
opportunity for U.S. scientists to keep abreast of changes and advances in
European science and technology activities and the status of European science.
NSF/Europe facilitates the Foundation's ability to access and maintain liaison
with European centers of excellence and to target the activities conducted under
the bilateral programs of the Division of International Programs.
