This project introduces undergraduate chemical engineering students to a multi-
purpose process control environemnt. Modern process control hardware and
supporting equipment (including a microcomputer-based data acquisition and
control system) significantly improves the undergraduate laboratory experience
by: allowing students to compare conventional control strategies (single analog
loops) with examples of modern computer control; exposing students to modern
process control hardware (self-tuning controllers) and permitting them to
compare equipment provided by several vendors; acquaints students with state-of-
the-art computer control and data logging equipment and techniques. This award
is being matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
