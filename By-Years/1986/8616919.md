Research on membrane-based separation technology is growing rapidly in the U.S.
and in the other industrialized nations. While significant advances in polymeric
materials have been made recently, there is still a gap in application of
polymers in industrial processes, and there is much that needs to be done in
designing polymer blends for membranes for use in separation tehcnology. There
have been very few research efforts in this critical area, and this proposal
offers a much-needed initiative. Specifically, this proposal outlines some
preliminary work designed to investigate systematically the relation between the
physical and chemical properties of polymeric membranes and their permeability
and separation efficiency of those membranes.
