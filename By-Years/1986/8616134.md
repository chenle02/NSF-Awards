This project applies both theoretical and experimental fluid mechanics and
rheology to a fundamental problem in the biology of sperm motion and eventual
fertility. The problem involves the interaction of swimming sperm with
biopolymeric fluid secretions found within the female reproductive tract,
primarily cervical mucus. Spermatozoa must successfully migrate through such
biopolymeric gels in order to reach the egg. At present, relatively little is
known about the fundamental mechanics of the sperm-mucus interaction: i.e. of
the material properties of mucus which sperm experience; and of the
hydrodynamics of sperm swimming in such obviously non-Newtonian fluids. The
proposed project, in order to address an important biomedical question, will
undertake studies that address these two questions.
