Degenerations and singularity formations play important roles in the study of
differential geometry and arise naturally in multiple other areas of
mathematics, including, algebraic geometry, mathematical physics, number theory,
and representation theory. This project concerns the geometry of singularities
and has interesting connections with an array of disciplines including modeling
of electromagnetic systems, gauge theory and string theory. Building on her
track record, the PI plans to use effective techniques to solve a wide variety
of problems and discover new and sharper analytic results. Alongside her
research, the PI will engage in various outreach activities, with a focus on
fostering mentoring networks for undergraduate and graduate students. This
project involves studying singular metrics using geometric microlocal analysis.
The PI will address problems related to metric degenerations, including the
perturbation theory, singular uniformization problems, parametrization of moduli
spaces and related geometric properties on singular metrics. Tools include
geometric resolutions or compactifications which resolve the singularities and
provide more detailed analytic properties, in addition to interactions with
algebraic and differential geometry which in turn suggest which PDE techniques
need to be developed. The PI will use these methods to study problems such as
the stratification and singularities of the moduli space of constant curvature
conical metrics, hyperbolic metrics with cusps and their spectral gaps, and
gauge-theoretic singular metrics such as gravitational instantons and their
degenerations.
