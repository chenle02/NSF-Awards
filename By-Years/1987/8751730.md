87-51730 Enrichment in Modern Physics is a two year program for 24 high school
physics teachers from the Central New York region. This project is designed to
provide concentrated study in modern physics for underprepared teachers from
rural school districts. In addition, teachers will receive training in
pedagogical techniques that will permit them to introduce modern physics topics
in their high school courses. During the first three-week summer workshop
participants will receive training in atomic physics, solid-state theory,
conductivity and semiconductor physics. During the second summer they will cover
topics in gravitational physics, astronomy, nuclear physics, and quantum
phenomena. Both summer workshops include laboratory components aimed at
providing the participants with a number of inexpensive demonstrations and
hands-on activities in modern physics which can be used in high school physics
courses. Participants will become part of the SUNY, Cortland Physics Sharing
Group which provides continuing in-service support for physics teachers in the
central New York region. This project has been designed as a model to address
the urgent need to train teachers to include modern physics in the high school
physics course. The State University of New York at Cortland and several School
Districts of Central New York have contributed an amount equal to 40% of the NSF
award.
