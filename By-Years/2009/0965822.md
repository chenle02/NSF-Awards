Intellectual Merit: The College is providing scholarships of between $6,000 and
$7,200 to 20 qualified STEM majors for each of four years. Disciplines include
Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Engineering Science, Physics, Mathematics,
and Geosciences (Earth Science/ Geology/ Oceanography/ Astronomy/ Meteorology/
Geography). The multi-disciplinary team of faculty is strong, and there are
extensive support structures for the students. The target is 95% graduation
and/or transfer rate among STEM Scholars. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:
The project is implementing a pro-active recruiting program with area high
school STEM faculty and administrators to encourage students toward STEM
careers. Students are recruited from the 22 high schools served by the college,
and from among current students. New and returning STEM Scholars each year form
a cohort/learning community nurtured by faculty mentors, counselors and the PI.
Selection criteria include high grades in high school STEM courses, high overall
GPA, recommendations from faculty and personal essays. STEM scholars have bi-
weekly meetings with faculty mentors, group enrollment in some courses,
participation in group study and field trips, and meetings with visiting
speakers from education and industry. Career/transfer counseling is provided
throughout the program.
