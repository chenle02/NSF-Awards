This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in materials science
involves a research group led by David Seidman at Northwestern University and
the research laboratory of Guy Treglia at the Universite de Mediterranee in
Marseille, France. The award provides travel support and living expenses to Dr.
Seidman, his associates, and a graduate student. The objective of the research
is to investigate, on an atomic scale, the kinetics of the dissolution of
selected thin metallic films and the formation of the surface alloy phase. The
project takes advantage of the French investigators' theoretical model which
demonstrates a concentration profile near a surface that is derived from the
electronic structure. The investigators propose to study this physical
phenomenon through the application of atom-probe field-ion microscopy.
