Researchers have been working for 10 years on various aspects of injection
molding, treated separately: material properties, fluid flow, heat transfer,
machine characteristics, plastic part design, etc. They will integrate these
various aspects to include the computer-aided design of plastic parts, and to
cover computer control of the process. They will extend their activities to
include injection molding of materials other than pure thermoplastics, e.g.,
thermosets and fiber-filled composites. Researchers will test packages
applicable to the design of plastic parts, test and evaluate existing geometric
molding systems in terms of their modeling capability for constructing a part
and the tooling needed to produce the part, formulate techniques for adaptively
controlling the molding process, and develop the software to integrate a
complete CAD/CAM system for plastic parts. They will study flow of molten
plastics through openings of various sizes and shapes in molds; determine how
thermoplastics pack, cool, and shrink in molds; investigate the mechanical
properties of molded parts as they are affected by alternative mold-design
configurations and processing conditions; and simulate and investigate the
injection molding of thermosetting plastics and polymers containing fillers such
as glass fibers.
