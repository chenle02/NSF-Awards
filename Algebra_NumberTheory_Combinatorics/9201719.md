This award supports the research of Professor P. Hanlon to work in
combinatorics. He intends to investigate the Macdonald root system conjecture on
homology of nilpotent Lie algebras. In addition, he will work generalized
library problems. The research is in the general area of combinatorics.
Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how discrete
collections of objects can be organized. And, so it is extremely important to
modern communications, for example the design of large networks as in telephone
systems and the design of algorithms in computer science.
