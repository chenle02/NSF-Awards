This award will support the continuation of a longstanding program to observe
mass-transfer close binary stars. Long-term observations of such systems are
important for determination of the orbital period and for detecting changes in
the period that result from angular momentum loss. These observations can also
yield basic data on the mass ratio and the mass-radius relation of the secondary
stars, which are important tests of stellar evolution theory.

The broader impact of the proposed activity will come from the involvement of
the amateur astronomical community in the monitoring of cataclysmic variables.
The program is also expected to produce valuable information on the space
distribution and lifetimes of cataclysmic variables in the Milky Way, and on how
close binary stars end their lives.
