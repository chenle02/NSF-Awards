The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports
research in the area of potential new catalysts for chemical transformations. In
this project Kenneth J. Takeuchi of The State Universsity of New York at Buffalo
will investigate the synthesis and properties of several new series of ruthenium
coordination compounds which may be potential catalysts for the oxidation of
inorganic and organic substrates as well as possible model compounds for metal
oxide surfaces, which are used as heterogeneous catalysts in many important
industrial processes. Several new families of oxoruthenium(IV) complexes will be
synthesized with various auxiliary ligands such as tertiary phosphines,
cyclopentadienyl, macrocycles (for example, bis?{difluoro}dioximato!) and a
(clathrochelate)cobalt ligand. The kinetics and mechanisms of organic and
inorganic substrate oxidation reactions with these compounds behaving as
stoichiometric or catalytic reagents will be studied. The steric and hydrophobic
effects of the auxiliary ligands on these reactions will be assessed.
