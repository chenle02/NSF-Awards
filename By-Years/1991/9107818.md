This proposal addresses one of the most pressing questions in molecular biology
today - how to predict the folding of globular proteins from their amino acid
sequence. In collaboration with Y.H. Wang of Jilin University in China, Dr.
Crippen will verify, analyze and extend preliminary observations that native
protein conformations can be described very compactly in terms of Fourier and
other such transforms, and that these transforms correlate strongly with the
protein's amino acid sequence. The subsequent goal is to develop an algorithm
for searching for low energy conformations of a protein using Fourier
coefficients as the primary variables. Whether the search method amounts to
molecular dynamics, some kind of local or global energy minimization, or Monte
Carlo procedure, the method would first manipulate the large scale features of
conformation and then later adjust the small scale details. The relation between
this procedure and theories of protein folding mechanisms would be explored.
This project brings together two scientists, one from China, and one from the
US, who share a common interest and a novel approach to an important problem in
molecular biology.
