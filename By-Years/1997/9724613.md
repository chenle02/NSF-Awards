CDA-9724613 Bansil, Arun Northeastern University Acquisition of a High-
Performance Computation/Visualization Laboratory for Scientific Research
Northeastern University is acquiring a symmetric multiprocessor, a network of
workstations, and a cluster of high-performance graphics workstations to support
scientific visualizations, the execution of medium scale science and engineering
computations, and the development of scalable codes using standard programming
languages and tools. Research areas include high-energy physics, materials
science simulations, cosmology, protein dynamics, and large non-linear dynamics
systems simulation. Northeastern University plans to include advanced
computational techniques involving parallel platforms and languages into
existing computational science courses. One of the PIs of the proposal is also a
co-coordinator of Academic Common Experience (ACE) at Northeastern University
whereby non-science majors are introduced to science and technology. The high-
performance facilities will also be available for use by such students. Various
departments represented in this proposal are active in outreach activities for
local high school teachers and students.
