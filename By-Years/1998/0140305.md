The behavior of complex natural systems results from the coupling of causal
dynamical evolution with random events. This work is a coordinated experimental
and theoretical investigation of how nonlinear dynamical processes shape the
statistics of multiple noise sources in moderately complex physical systems. The
nonlinear processes on which this work will focus occur in optical fiber and
consist of multi-order stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS), stimulated Brillouin
scattering (SBS), and four-wave mixing (FWM) of polarization components of
Q-switched laser pulses. These processes are present or actively exploited in a
wide range of applications such as frequency conversion, signal amplification
and processing, and pulse compression. Understanding how these nonlinear
processes shape noise is therefore of both practical and fundamental importance.
