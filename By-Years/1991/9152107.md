This project is expanding the Oberlin College physics department's existing
network of two UNIX work-stations (currently used solely for research) to nine
machines. These computers are being used for student/faculty research and for
assignments and projects in existing courses, but most importantly they are
making possible a new course entitled "Introduction to Computational Physics".
This course takes advantage of the many cases in which the physical question and
its algorithmic solution are intimately linked, so the physics and the algorithm
illuminate each other. Because it exploits this link to the fullest, the course
has only one prerequisite physics course, and thus is taken by students as early
as their freshman year. The course 1) excites and attracts students at an early
stage in their college careers, 2) allows appropriate use of computation
throughout the physics curriculum, and 3) develops the student's physical
insight.NSF grant funds are being matched with funds from non-federal sources.
