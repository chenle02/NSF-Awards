THE DR. FAD SHOW is a daily television series for children ages 6 to 12 that
encourages creativity, inventiveness and problem solving in a lively half-hour
format. Each program is taped before a studio audience and high-lights the
inventions of young participants as well as the fads and inventions of the past,
present and future. Created and hosted by Ken Hakuta, or Dr. Fad as he is known
to millions of young viewers, the series will combine thirty-five brand new
shows with thirty previously produced episodes for a total of sixty-five
programs. The series will be produced and packaged next spring and summer at
WETA-TV in Washington, D.C. and will be ready for national broadcast on the
Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) as early as fall of 1991. THE DR. FAD SHOW
will be accompanied by a significant outreach and promotion effort, as well as
an educational component that will include an activity and teacher's guide. The
programs have already won the endorsement of the National Education Association
and the National Inventive Teaching Association (NITA) among others, as well as
the enthusiastic support of parents, teachers and a legion of dedicated young
viewers and participants.
