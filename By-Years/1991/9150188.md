This project, sponsored by East Tennessee State University, will provide a six-
week summer program for each of three years for 28 teachers and 7 principals.
The participants will be selected in teams of two middle school science
teachers, two high school science teachers and one principal all from the same
school district. The summer program will teach an integrated science curriculum
emphasizing hands-on-science and problem solving as required by the new
Tennessee State curriculum guideline. The participants will return to the
schools to carryout leadership activities in the schools. Altogether it is
expected that 100 teachers will be served by the project each year. The project
will be coordinated with a previous K-6 project and thus a coordinated K-12
science curriculum will be developed in the target schools. The NSF grant is
being matched by local funds in an amount equivalent to about 30%.
