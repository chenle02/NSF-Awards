This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at University of North Carolina
at Chapel Hill to acquire a step-scan FTIR spectrometer. This equipment will
enhance research in a number of areas including the following: (1) the
application of time-resolved infrared spectroscopy (TRIR) to short lived excited
state species and intermediates in the photophysics of transition metal-
polypyridyl systems and (2) the application of TRIR and rotationally-resolved IR
to the processes of aerosol nucleation and combustion. A Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer and a time-resolved IR (TRIR) can provide
important information about molecular and electronic structure of short-lived
transient intermediates. Their use may enable breakthroughs in our understanding
of the properties of reactivity and non-reactivity of molecules..
