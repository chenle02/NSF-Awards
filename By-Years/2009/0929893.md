Intellectual merit

This project will lead to a novel approach for the efficient conversion of sugar
mixtures (pentoses and hexoses) to biochemical products in the presence of
inhibitors such as acetic acid. In the proposed work the challenges this complex
mixture presents are addressed by engineering the microbial system in which the
conversion takes place. The concept relies on the construction of microbial
strains which can only metabolize a single carbon source (such as the sugar
xylose or acetic acid), and designing an efficient process using these
"substrate-selective" strains. In addition to constructing and characterizing a
suite of substrate-selective strains, processes will be developed and optimized
to generate two model biochemicals, ethanol and pyruvate, from lignocellulosic
hydrolysates which contain acetic acid and the five principal sugars.

Broader impacts

Although the focus will be ethanol and pyruvate production, the strategy being
developed can be used for any microbial product and indeed any microorganism,
and therefore the research is broadly applicable to numerous systems. This
approach constitutes a new approach toward engineering a system of microbes for
a complex mixture. The proposed work constitutes an interdisciplinary effort
between molecular biology and process engineering students, educators as well as
high school students toward improving production and processing technologies for
the use of biomass.
