This integrated research and educational CAREER project will apply the "bottom-
up" approach of atomic and molecular manipulation to produce new nanoscale
structures. Three areas of emphasis are involved: (1) probing and manipulating
the intrinsic degrees of freedom of the atom, such as energy levels, charge, and
spin; (2) probing and manipulating the interface between the atom and the
external environment, involving imaging chemical bonds, electronic and
vibrational structure, and electron correlation effects; and ultimately (3) the
nuclear properties of single atoms, for example isotopic mass and nuclear spin.
Synergistically with the laboratory component, the PI and Stanford University
will implement a substantial educational and outreach program. This cross-
cutting effort includes: (1) the introduction of a new co-terminal physics
teaching program, (2) the development of two sets of new courses into which
current research in nanoscale science and technology will be interwoven, (3) an
outreach program to build nanoscience research and education within the
Americas, and (4) the construction of a remote-control station for atom
manipulation in order to promote nanoscience education via visual tools to
visiting students and to the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This integrated
research and educational CAREER project seeks to apply the "bottom-up" approach
of atomic and molecular manipulation to several focused areas in science and
technology. Controlled atom and molecule manipulation and atom-by-atom assembly
of complex structures on the nanometer length scale are capabilities existing
now only at the frontiers of science and technology. The students involved in
this proposed research and education plan will receive a unique and cross-
discipline training in emerging fields now universally identified as critical to
society and our understanding of nature. Synergistically with the laboratory
component of this plan, the PI and Stanford University will implement a
substantial educational and outreach program. This cross-cutting effort includes
the introduction of a new co-terminal physics teaching program, the development
of two sets of new courses into which current research in nanoscale science and
technology will be interwoven, an outreach program to build nanoscience research
and education within the Americas, and finally the construction of a remote-
control station for atom manipulation in order to promote nanoscience education
via visual tools to visiting students and to the public.&lt;br/&gt;
