Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project at LaSalle University awards a total
of thirty (30) scholarships to low income, academically talented students,
including twenty (20) undergraduate students and ten (10) graduate students over
a 4-year period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The target audience includes 30% women,
and 10% minorities. A special effort is made to recruit additional women,
particularly into the undergraduate Computer Science and Information Technology
majors. The PI works with designated staff in the Admissions Office to increase
the number of minority students majoring in MTH/CSC/IT by seeking transfer
students from Community College of Philadelphia and from LaSalle's Bilingual
Undergraduate Studies for Career Advancement Program, an innovative associate
degree program for Latino students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to
scholarship assistance for the student recipients, NSF funds are also used for
project management and for a special Career Exploration series of guest speakers
who are employed in these fields. The University provides funds from its annual
budget to the Mathematics and Computer Science Department for tutorial
assistance for the undergraduate CSEMS recipients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;80% of
the funded students are expected to receive their degrees within four years of
matriculating at La Salle, and 80% are expected to attain new or advanced
professional positions related to their field of study within one year of
graduation. &lt;br/&gt;
