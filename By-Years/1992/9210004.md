This project should make important contributions to theoretical econometrics
and to applied economics. This project addresses problems in two major subfields
of econometric theory: latent variables and quantile regressions. The
theoretical research is accompanied by significant empirical applications. The
results of this project should provide applied economists with more general and
more powerful statistical tools for studying the behavior of financial markets
and the characteristics of labor markets. More specifically, this project
develops new methods for using longitudinal data to allow for latent variables
in nonlinear models. The latent variables are individual effects that vary
across individuals but are constant over time. The project will focus on
relaxing strict exogeneity assumptions, so that covariate values may be partly
determined by previous values of the response variable. Empirical applications
of the techniques will be developed. The project will also examine inference
procedures in cross-section studies using quantile regression. Extensions of
quantile regression for use with longitudinal data will be explores.
