This project will provide an opportunity for 30 middle school teachers to
improve their research, materials-development, and problem-solving skills in the
area of earth science. Each teacher will participate in an intensive 3-week,
field-oriented academic experience in the summer during which time he or she
will be a part of a research team attempting to solve environmentally- related
problems. Under the supervision of a university professor and a Master Teacher,
teams will collect, analyze and present field materials that include rocks,
fossils, soils, water, atmospheric and photographic data. Four weekends during
the academic year will also be devoted to formal program activities. This
project focuses attention on science as a problem-solving activity. Each
participant, through involvement in research projects, will acquire meaningful
problem-solving skills. Much attention will be given to means of using both the
materials acquired and developed and problem- solving skills in the middle
school classroom. Throughout the academic year, teachers will be required to
present evidence that they are integrating their recently acquired knowledge and
skills into their classroom activities.
