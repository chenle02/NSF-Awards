This award is for the continued support of acquisition and dissemination of
seismogram data by Columbia University's Lamont- Doherty Geological Observatory
(LDGO). The type of data covered will include analog film chips of seismic
events as well as digital data from more modern stations of the Global Digital
Seismic Network. The award allows continued operation of the LDGO facility for
rapid and efficient access to seismological data by earth scientists, many of
whom are involved in projects supported by NSF.
