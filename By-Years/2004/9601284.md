This is a collaborative research and education project which has the following
goals: 1) producing and publishing a textbook designed to provide practical
support for secondary school teachers who wish to incorporate topics in ethics
and values in their curricula; 2) exploring state and national science curricula
to identify opportunities for introducing ethics and values the primary and
middle school grades; 3) developing ethics and values in science lessons in the
junior and senior high ; 4) begin exploring and testing the feasibility of
integrating ethics and values in science lessons at the elementary school level;
and 5) developing models for summer institutes and/or in-service instructional
programs designed to provide the education, support and encouragement needed to
promote the teaching of ethics and values at all levels. The textbook for
secondary school teachers will include introductory education sections on
effective means of introducing junior and senior high school students to the
study of moral and value-laden aspects of the practice and uses of science in
society. This material will be based on the experience gained by the principal
investigators during the summer institute program, their prior experience in
teaching ethics and the rapidly growing literature on the teaching of ethics
using case studies, role-playing and other pedagogical techniques. The principal
investigators, a philosopher with considerable successful experience in teaching
ethics to grade school children and an environmental scientist who has taught
ethics and values in science to both college students and high school teachers,
will take advantage of their mutual sabbatical leaves to educate each other and
work together on this project.
