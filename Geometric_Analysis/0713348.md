The PI proposes to establish a correspondence between concepts in FINSLER
GEOMETRY with concepts in ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY. To be more specific we want to
find the algebraic concepts which correspond to the differential geometric
concepts in Complex Finsler Geometry:

(a) Holomorphic bisectional curvature, (b) Ricci curvature, (c) Holomorphic
sectional curvature, (d) Scalar curvature, (e) Bochner tensor (the complex
analogue of the Weyl conformal tensor).

The Finsler approach would work for certain coherent sheaves rather than just
vector bundles as in the classical theory of Hermitian geometry. It also allows
us to extend the theory from complex to varieties defined over other fields such
as the p-adic number fields.

I am motivated in part by the classical theory of intrinsic metrics (such as the
Kobayashi and Caratheodory metrics) which are, in general, Finslerian rather
than Hermitian. Another motiviation comes from the recent development in general
relativity based on Finsler-Einstein-Lorentze metrics. Thus a rigorous Finsler
geometric approach is essential to understand these metrics. In this theory the
time cone is not circular (two cones, one on top of the other) but in the shape
of pyramids (two pyramids, one on top of the other) and the geometry is much
more intricate. The understanding of the Finsler Bochner-Weyl tensor would be
very helpful as it is related to Twistor theory and the Yang-Mill self-duality.
