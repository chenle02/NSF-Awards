The University of California Museum of Paleontology (UCMP) will bring together
an experienced group of evolution educators in order to inform the development
and maintenance of an effective resource for improving evolution education at
the college level. This effort falls under the umbrella of UCMP's highly
successful Understanding Evolution (UE) project (http://evolution.berkeley.edu),
which currently receives over one million page requests per month during the
school year. UE was originally designed around the needs of the K-12 education
community; however, increasingly, the site is being used by the undergraduate
education community. UCMP intends to embark on an effort to enhance the utility
of the UE site for that population, increase awareness of the site at the
college level, and secure the project's future so that it can continue to serve
K-16 teachers and students. To inform and guide these efforts, UCMP proposes to
establish and convene a UE Advisory Board, which will be charged with helping
to: (1) identify the characteristics and needs of college-level target learners
and their instructors with respect to evolution, (2) articulate the recommended
components for expanding the UE site to include an Undergraduate Lounge in which
students and their instructors will be able to access a variety of resources for
increasing understanding of evolution, (3) develop a strategic plan for
increasing awareness of UE within the undergraduate education community, and (4)
develop a strategic plan for maintenance and continued growth of the UE site.
