This project is concerned with several problems in complex variables that are
of interest in their own right and in connection with problems in the geometry
of planar sets. The first set of problems deals with the iteration theory of
meromorphic functions in the plane. The main question proposed for study here
asks if the Julia set of any rational function and of a suitable entire or
meromorphic function is uniformly perfect. This is tantamount to asking if the
Julia set has a uniform lower bound for the local density of its logarithmic
capacity. The second set of problems deals with the question of under what
circumstances a convergence group in the plane is topologically conjugate to a
Moebius group. The third set of problems involves the study of analytic
inequalities that arise in the theory of Markov processes.
