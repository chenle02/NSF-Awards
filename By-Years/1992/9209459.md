The normal formation of the cerebral cortex is a prerequisite for attaining
higher cognitive, motor and sensory function. This study will examine some basic
issues of cortical development: intrinsic and extrinsic factors regulating
either differentiation of neurons or connectivity allowing the development of
functionally distinct areas of cerebral cortex in mammals. In particular, this
proposal will be focusing on the development of one part of the limbic system,
the perirhinal cortex. In recent transplantation studies, results have shown
there is an early specification of neurons to express a limbic molecular
phenotype, the limbic-system-associated membrane protein, LAMP (Barbe and
Levitt, 1991; Appendix I). Earlier experiments showed that this molecule may
play a role in circuit formation in vitro (Keller et al., 1989). Most recently,
results suggested that there is a correlation between the early commitment of
the cortex to this molecular phenotype and the formation of specific
thalamocortical connections (Barbe and Levitt, submitted; Appendix II). These
experiments have led to additional issues for exploration of cortical commitment
and connectivity. Using a tissue transplantation paradigm, I will be testing two
aspects of the development of the cortex into functional areal arrays: 1) The
commitment of cortical neurons to a functional areal phenotype is linked to the
cell cycle. 2) The connections induced between limbic thalamic afferents and
LAMP- positive cortical transplants are maintained permanently. The long term
goals of my laboratory, some of which are addressed in this proposal, are to
better understand the molecular factors that modulate the assembly of functional
neuronal circuits, both during development and after injury of the mammalian
central nervous system.
