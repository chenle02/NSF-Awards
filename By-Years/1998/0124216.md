0124216 an Huef

This award supports a three-year collaborative research project in mathematics
between Dr. Astrid an Huef of the University of Denver, Dr. Dana Williams of
Dartmouth University, and Dr. Iain Raeburn of the University of Newcastle in
Australia. This project will focus on three goals: 1) to prove a symmetric
imprimitivity theorem for commuting proper actions on a non-commutative
C-algebra, 2) to show that this new symmetric imprimitivity theorem applies in a
wide variety of examples, and 3) to extend related results known for reduced
crossed products to full crossed products. The proposed research is central in
operator algebra theory and has applications to representation theory. The
project brings together the efforts of three laboratories (two in the United
States and one in Australia) that have complementary expertise and research
capabilities. An Huef is well versed in the modern theory of integrable and
proper actions, Williams has expertise in vector-valued integration and harmonic
analysis, and Raeburn is an expert on nonabelian duality. This project will
broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and
cooperation.
