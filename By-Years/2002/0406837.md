This Nanotechnology in Undergraduate Education (NUE) award to Dickinson College
supports Professors R. David Crouch and Cindy Samet to incorporate nanoscience
and nanotechnology topics into the existing undergraduate Chemistry curriculum.
The project involves three parts: development of a new laboratory course in
nanoscience for non-science majors; integration of elements of nanoscience into
the first three chemistry courses that science majors take; and implementation
of a workshop on nanoscience for secondary science teachers in central
Pennsylvania. Objectives of the award include the development of new activities
and the adaptation of previously reported experiments to provide science and
non-science majors with hands-on exposure to nanoscience, to illustrate the role
of chemistry in the emerging fields such as nanoscience, and to support science
education in the local school districts.

The proposal for this award was received in response to the Nanoscale Science
and Engineering Education announcement, NSF 03-044, category NUE and was jointly
funded by Divisions of Materials Research and Chemistry in the Directorate for
Mathematical and Physical Sciences and the Directorate for Geociences.
