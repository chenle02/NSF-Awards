This project will investigate a new tool which will assist with risk
identification and risk management in construction projects. The study will
include the affect of many parameters, such as: cost estimating, expected design
changes, prevailing weather conditions, quality of design documents. The project
result will be a risk analysis procedure in which all parameters will be
explicitly represented.
