AST-0307408 Prochaska

This project will create a homogeneous, public data set of echelle spectrograph
observations of about a hundred Lyman limit systems (LLS), which are the most
poorly understood of the major classes of quasar absorption-line systems. This
survey of LLS will take advantage of recent instrumentation advances at the Keck
and Las Campanas Observatories, and will provide new insight into gas accretion
in proto-galactic halos, galactic winds, ionization edges in galactic disks,
chemical enrichment, the interface between proto-galaxies and the intergalactic
medium, radiative transfer, galactic feedback, and all aspects of galaxy
formation in the early Universe. The sample to be observed will be drawn from
several well-defined quasar surveys, but new high-resolution data are needed to
determine accurate characteristics of LLS. This program will synthesize the
talents of observer, experimentalist, and theorist to reach an understanding of
the remarkable physical properties of LLS, but there will be additional
significant scientific impact on studies of other quasar absorption-line
systems, of gas at high redshift, and of structures in the early Universe.

The results will be spread to the community in the usual ways, but in addition,
a dedicated Web site will reach beyond the astronomical population to provide
high school tutorials and lab assignments, undergraduate introductions, and
graduate level examples of the quantitative analysis of LLS.
