Protein kinase C transduces signals that promote phospholipid hydrolysis.
Binding of a wide variety of signals to cell surface receptors results in
phospholipase C-catalyzed hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate,
producing the water soluble head-group, inositol trisphosphate, and the lipid
backbone, diacylglycerol. Both molecules are critical second messengers in the
protein kinase C signalling pathway. Inositol trisphosphate mobilizes
intracellular Ca2+ thus causing protein kinase C, which is present in the
cytosol under resting conditions, to bind to the plasma membrane. Diacylglycerol
activates the kinase; activity also requires the amino phospholipid,
phosphatidylserine. The long-term objective of the proposed research is to
understand the mechanism of action of protein kinase C. Specifically, the role
of diayclglycerol in regulating the enzyme will be addressed. The hypotheses
that 1! diacylglycerol targets protein kinase C to the plasma membrane, and 2!
diacylglycerol is an allosteric activator of the kinase will be tested. %%% The
effect of diacylglycaerol on the protein kinase C membrane interaction, and on
the conformation of protein kinase C, will be addressed with the aim of
understanding how this second messenger regulates the structure and function of
protein kinase C, and in turn, signal transduction.
