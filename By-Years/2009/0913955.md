This project examines the relationships between academic elites, institutions of
higher learning, and the political unrest that occurred in 2007 and 2008 due to
the election in Kenya in 2008. Faculty, scientists, and students were active in
the run-up to the election as well as the post-election period. However, little
is known of how their actions impacted the violence that occured after the 2007
elections. Using qualitative methods and ethnographic techniques, this study
will examine the role of these elites in the violence that occurred after the
election. While providing an indepth view of the actions of elites in Kenya, it
will also provide us with insights into the role of education elites generally
in electoral activites and their aftermath in developing
countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, this project will provide taped
interviews that will be made available to other researchers. The project also
provides a unique opportunities to build partnerships between American and
Kenyan scholars.
