The Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California San Diego
(SIO) requests funds for a needed enhancement to the NSF West Coast Winch Pool.
This is considered important in maintaining safety, risk reduction, improved
quality of service, and protection of the environment. Specifically, SIO
requests funds for a modern magnetometer tow winch for placement in the NSF West
Coast Winch Pool. Their current magnetometer tow winch is ancient and no longer
compliant with Research Vessel Safety Standards (RVSS). It will be prohibited
from use on UNOLS vessels as of the summer of 2016.

1) Magnetometer Winch $118,113 Broader Impacts The principal impact of the
present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines
(NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the
vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded
oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by
the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and
operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any
US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their
research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of
potential researchers.
