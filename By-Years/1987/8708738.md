This is an Engineering Initiation Award proposal the objective of which is to
investigate and implement an accurate and computationally efficient noniterative
method of image reconstruction from incomplete projection data in tomographic
imaging systems. The proposed technique exploits a functional property of the
object projections in conjunction with a priori information available about the
test object to restore the unknown data. In most cases, this approach guarantees
the stability of the solution. It is intended to address the factors that may
cause the instability of the solution in practice. Various interpolation
techniques for the improvement of the solution will be assessed, and
noniterative schemes to surmount the instability problems will be explored.
