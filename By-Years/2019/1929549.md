The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project includes
enabling wide spreading replacement of superconducting materials with materials
with a superconductive coating. Superconductors have the promise of enabling
vastly more efficient power transmission lines, better electric motors, and
high-speed quantum computing, however the expense and lack of scalability in the
fabrication of the materials has thus far proven problematic. This replacement
with superconductive coatings will help overcome obstacles to implementing these
materials in the transportation, energy, and quantum computing fields, thus
accelerating technological development in these areas. The success of this
project will also lower the barriers for advanced medical equipment enabled by
superconducting magnets such as MRI and improve the healthcare
outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project further develops an
electrochemical process for the fabrication of superconducting coatings and
other metal or alloy thin film coatings. The key innovation in this technology
is the use of a new type of aqueous electrolyte to suppress the activity of
water and proton in an aqueous electrolyte, while maintaining the ease of
operation, compatibility of the process with current processes in use, as well
as the environmental friendliness. This suppression directly results in an
energy savings during the process and the morphology of films is significantly
improved as the incorporation of the byproduct of those undesired reactions are
avoided. More importantly, the superconductivity of the film deposited from this
low temperature process was observed at a higher temperature than the material
itself and this increased critical temperature has shown an improved stability
against high temperature processing used in device
fabrication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
