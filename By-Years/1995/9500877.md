The Quebec-Vermont Number Theory Seminar brings together a diverse group of
researchers and students in number theory. Meetings are held every other week
for an entire day, with talks presented both by the members of the seminar and
by distinguished visitors. The seminar centralizes the research activities of
faculty and students from the University of Vermont, Middlebury College, St.
Michael's College, Concordia University, McGill University, Laval University and
the Centre de Research en Mathematique. This research falls into the general
mathematical area of number theory. Number theory has its historical roots in
the study of the whole numbers, addressing such questions as those dealing with
the divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among the oldest branches
of mathematics and was pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons.
However, within the last half century it has become an indispensable tool in
diverse applications in areas such as data transmission and processing, and
communication systems.
