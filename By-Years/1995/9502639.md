9502639 Kurose This award provides support to equip a networked, experimental
testbed to enable research in the development of the operating system, I/O,
networking, object management, and information retrieval components of future
networked multimedia information systems. The testbed will consist of two
shared-memory multiprocessor facilities attached to several parallel mass
storage I/O devices and a high-speed ATM network. The research team will be
developing several key hardware and software technologies needed to support
future networked, multimedia information systems. Specific research areas
include operating systems, I/O, networking, object management and information
retrieval.
