This award provides funding for the conference "International Conference in
Approximation Theory" that will be held from May 8 - 11, 2017 at Georgia
Southern University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on recent
developments in Analysis, especially in the field of approximation theory. A
number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this
conference. This award gives early career researchers, members of
underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF and the like an
opportunity to attend and participate in this conference. The organizing
committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups
