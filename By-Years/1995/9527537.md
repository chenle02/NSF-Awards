9527537 Rappaport This award will allow the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and
State University and the University of Missouri-Rolla to develop and distribute
a trilogy of electrical engineering courses at the senior/graduate level. These
courses include hardware and software components, combined with a change in
teaching emphasis, and they will be offered at both universities, as well as at
the University of Canterbury, in Christchurch, New Zealand. This project
includes plans for the faculty to develop teaching materials, software modules,
educational videotapes, and to provide laboratory/hardware experiences for
students that do not exist today. Using an advisory panel consisting of academic
and industry experts from the communications field, the course trilogy will be
reviewed and perfected during this curriculum development. Materials developed
under this program will be made available to universities throughout the
country, through widely available texts, software modules, experiment study
guides, and world-wide web postings.
