Marine plants and animals live in an environment where chemical signals are
often more important than visual signals. Waterborne chemicals provide marine
organisms with critical information about the quality of their environment and
the location of food, predators, and mates. However, when the tide is out,
intertidal plants and animals spend large amounts of time exposed to air, where
waterborne chemical signals are unavailable but airborne chemical signals may be
important. Preliminary data has shown that when they are being consumed by
grazers, some intertidal plants release dimethyl sulfide, an airborne chemical
that can cause nearby plants to produce additional defenses against grazers.
This use of airborne signaling chemicals by marine plants is a new and
potentially important mechanism of communication among marine intertidal
organisms. Because dimethyl sulfide can be detected by animals, it may serve as
a signal to other grazers and to their predators about the presence of food or
enemies. Thus, the release of dimethyl sulfide has the potential to affect
interactions throughout marine food webs. This project will use biochemical
methods to measure the release of dimethyl sulfide by marine plants under a
variety of environmental conditions and its subsequent movement throughout the
environment. A variety of behavioral, physiological, and ecological assays will
then be used to determine the effects of airborne dimethyl sulfide on defensive
responses and growth rates of nearby plants as well as the responses and feeding
rates of herbivores and predators. The results of this study will provide
fundamental information about how marine food webs function. Because dimethyl
sulfide is important in the global cycling of sulfur, this study will also
contribute to knowledge of sulfur movement from the oceans to the atmosphere. At
least eight undergraduate students will help conduct this work; therefore, the
project will contribute to the training of the next generation of marine
scientists.
