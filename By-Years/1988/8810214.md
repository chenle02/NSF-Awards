This is a fundamental study of crystallization of biological compounds by the
addition of organic non-solvents. The reserch encompasses a study of
solubilities of eight model amino acids and two model antibiotics under
different environmental conditions, and the data will be used to formulate a
theoretical model based on UNIFAC. A second study is on the kinetics of
nucleation and crystal growth by a micro interferometric technique. The
development of a model describing the solubilities of complex molecules, of the
type to be studied in the proposed research, would lead to significant advances
in understanding the behavior of such systems, and it should be of great value
in understanding key factors influencing the production of certain
pharmaceutical and specialty chemicals in general.
