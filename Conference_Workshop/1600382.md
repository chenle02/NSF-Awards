This award supports participation in the third Lake Michigan Workshop on
Combinatorics and Graph Theory, held at Purdue University in West Lafayette,
Indiana, on March 5-6, 2016. The workshop series focuses on combinatorics and
graph theory, which are two very active areas of research in modern mathematics.
The geographical location of the workshop is intended as a focal point for the
large number of researchers and students in the Midwest and provides
opportunities to strengthen research collaborations on a variety of graph
theoretical and combinatorial problems. The workshop, which will be advertised
to universities throughout the Midwest, will train students and beginning
researchers in important classical and emerging techniques of combinatorics and
graph theory.

The workshop features two sets of three tutorial lectures, focusing on classical
techniques and results in combinatorics that are not always presented in typical
graduate sequences, and on emerging techniques on which the speakers are
particularly qualified to expound. Tutorial lectures by Professor Edray Goins
from Purdue University concern "q-series, Partitions, Generating Functions,"
"Modular Forms," and "Applications." Tutorial lectures by Professor Margaret
Readdy from the University of Kentucky concern "Quantum Combinatorics,"
"Coalgebraic Combinatorics," and "Whitney Stratifications and Combinatorics." In
addition, the workshop features short talks by students and early-career faculty
members. More details may be found at the workshop website
