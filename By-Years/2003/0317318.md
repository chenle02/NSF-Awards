With National Science Foundation support, Drs. Theodore B. Fernald and Ellvina
Tsosie Perkins will conduct three years of linguistic research on Navajo, an
endangered Athabaskan language spoken in northeastern Arizona and neighboring
regions. They will create a reference grammar drawing on previous studies of
Navajo sentence structure and supplementing these materials with original
analyses of its syntax and semantics to fill in gaps in the earlier research.
While high quality reference materials are available for the internal structure
of Navajo verbs, a systematic description of Navajo sentence structure is absent
in the literature. The proposed reference grammar will cover the structure,
meaning, and use of all known Navajo sentence types. Among these will be the
inverse construction, direct and indirect discourse constructions, existential
and equative sentences, questions, commands, and conditionals. Entries in the
grammar will be streamlined, with generalizations stated early and with
complications and exceptions added later. A wide range of examples and
additional notes that can be ignored by readers seeking a quick overview will
appear at the end of each section.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With roughly 80,000 to
100,000 native speakers, Navajo is the largest native speech community in North
America. But the language is generally not being passed on to the youngest
generation. The reference grammar to be produced by this project will be
accessible to educators and curriculum planners, in addition to linguists
interested in the language. It will thus aid community efforts to strengthen the
use of Navajo and maintain its rich linguistic and literary tradition. The
reference grammar will also be a resource for linguists to test analyses of
grammatical phenomena and to further describe how Navajo fits into the spectrum
of human languages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
