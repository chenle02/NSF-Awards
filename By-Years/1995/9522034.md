9522034 Magill Mosses, although conspicuous in tropical forests, are among the
more neglected groups of organisms, especially for tropical parts of the world.
There are few institutions in North America with significant resources for their
study, but one such is the Missouri Botanical Garden, St. Louis, where Drs.
Robert Magill and Bruce Allen have pulled together a team of colleagues for a
five-year enterprise studying mosses of the family Meteoriaceae. Traditional
morphological investigations, supplemented when possible with gametophyte
culturing studies, will be enhanced with additional data from molecular
analyses, including DNA sequencing with assistance from colleagues at Washington
University. Field collecting in Central and South America and in Africa will
target both taxa and regions needing better samples, and will make possible
biogeographical studies of current and historical distribution patterns.
Improved taxonomic understanding of species diversity in these mosses and
plausible hypotheses of their evolutionary and phylogenetic relationships will
result from the work. In particular, tests can be made of the idea that the
pendent, epiphytic habit of many of the Meteoriaceae has evolved convergently or
independently a number of times, in various parts of the New and Old World
tropics. Training of new graduate and postdoctoral students is a significant
component of the project, through associations with three universities in the
area, Washington University, the University of Missouri-St. Louis, and St. Louis
University. Formal course work as well as laboratory and museum study comprise
the training program, along with field work and apprenticeship in taxonomic
monographic research. Computerization of many aspects of the enterprise,
including specimen databasing, character analyses, and phylogenetic inference,
enhances the timely dissemination of results through the Missouri Botanical
Garden's World Wide Web service.
