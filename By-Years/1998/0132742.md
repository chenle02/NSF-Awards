This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop
technologies to generate meshes over general three-dimensional domains that are
appropriate for high-order finite element analysis. A current stumbling block to
the wide adoption of high-order finite element techniques is the lack of
automatic means to generate appropriate curved meshes. This project will develop
a new and innovative procedure for the effective generation of these types of
meshes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application of this research is the
integration of CAD technologies with advanced automated simulation techniques to
be used within engineering design processes. These tools will reduce the time
and costs associated with performing engineering analysis during design and
increase the accuracy of the predictions obtained.
