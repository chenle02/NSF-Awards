Dr. Casetti and her team will continue work on the Yale/San Juan Southern Proper
Motion (SPM) survey, which measures the tiny motions of stars across the sky
over multiple decades, to test models for the Milky Way's formation. In the
present project they will measure absolute proper motions for stars torn off the
Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, for stars in an over-dense region of the sky in the
constellation of Canis Major, and for 15 globular star clusters, to determine
their orbits around the Galactic center. To improve accuracy, photographic
plates taken early in the survey (the first epoch) will be re-measured using the
Yale PDS microdensitometer, to improve the precision. Second-epoch CCD
observations will be made to cover the Canis Major overdensity and both the
leading and trailing tails of the Sagittarius dwarf, and to enlarge the sample
of globular clusters. The new observations amount to about 8000 pointings, or
2.5 years observing at El Leoncito observatory with the Cesco double astrograph.

The team will also probe the Milky Way's thick disk by combining their measured
proper motions with radial velocities to find all 3 components of a star's
motion through space. They will do this for a sample of 1160 red giants near the
South Galactic Pole surveyed by a PhD student at the University of Chile, and
with measurements of stars at intermediate Galactic latitudes from RAVE, a
survey of stellar radial velocities using a telescope in Australia. Comparing
these motions to what is predicted by dynamical models, the group will explore
the force on these stars perpendicular to the mid-plane of the Milky Way, and
hence the degree of flattening in the gravitational potential.

The measured proper motions, positions and photographic photometry for the
SPM3.3 catalog with 11 million stars is now available by ftp from Yale's
website, and the fourth catalog SPM4 will be released shortly. Undergraduates at
the Universities of San Juan, Cordoba and La Plata in Argentina will be trained
as they obtain observations for the project. The group provides materials for
the very active visitor center at El Leoncito observatory.
