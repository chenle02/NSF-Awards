Douglas Doren is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to study the dynamics and interactions of molecules on
surfaces. This research has a direct bearing on our understanding of the role
which catalytic surfaces play in promoting chemical reactions. Doren will use
theoretical molecular dynamics to determine the underlying interactions and
mechanisms involved in surface diffusion rates of molecular adsorbates. He will
explore the ways in which molecules differ from atoms in their modes of
interaction with surfaces including the qualitative topology of the potential
energy surface, the adsorbate mass distribution, and possible modes of coupling
between diffusion and adsorbate bending or vibrational modes. The result of this
research will be a model of interacting, coadsorbed molecules which will be the
foundation for general studies of coverage effects on surface dynamcis and
catalysis.
