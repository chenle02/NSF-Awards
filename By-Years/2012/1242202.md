Understanding disease transmission dynamics requires grappling with the
inherently spatial and temporal nature of the process. A workshop designed to
engage researchers from the GIScience (geographic information science) and
geography communities with disease ecology research will be held in conjunction
with the GIScience 2012 conference on 18 September 2012. The outcome of the
workshop will be greater interactions between these research communities.
Infectious diseases affect human health, food security, and ecosystem structure.
This workshop will improve the quality of research in this area.
