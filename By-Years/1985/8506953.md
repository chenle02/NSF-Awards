Uniaxial drawing by solid state coextrusion (SSCE) has been shown to impart
unusual properties to polymers. These include increased melting point,
birefringence and tensile modulus, and negative coefficients of thermal
expansion, among others. In one of the most remarkable examples, mats of single
crystals of high density polyethylene were drawn to draw ratios of over 200,
producing a tensile modulus close to the theoretical maximum. The goal of this
research is to extend the fundamental knowledge of a process which can
impressively alter the morphology and structure of a polymer to give unusual
properties and materials which initially have unusual morphology and properties.
Solid state coextrusion will be attempted on nascent polyethylene. The drawing
of polymer single crystal mats by the coextrusion process will be undertaken.
