Professor Xia proposes to continue his investigation of dynamics of Hamiltonian
systems, Newtonian N-body problems and partially hyperbolic dynamical systems.
Conservative mechanical systems, such as our planetary system, are examples of
Hamiltonian systems. Hamiltonian systems typically exhibit some of the most
complicated and chaotic behavior. These chaotic behaviors not only are important
in applications, but also have interesting mathematical structures. The proposed
research focuses on these chaotic structures, including distribution of periodic
trajectories, homoclinic phenomenon and instabilities or Arnold diffusion in
higher dimensional system. Professor Xia will also continue his study on
partially hyperbolic systems by establishing connections between the geometric,
topological and analytic properties of the invariant foliations.

The proposed research addresses problems with a long history and wide
applications to classical mechanics, celestial mechanics, as well as areas of
engineering. Professor Xia's research in Hamiltonian systems and celestial
mechanics has been featured in many popular science magazines, books and even
some elementary undergraduate textbooks. As he has learned, Professor Xia's work
on escaping and capture trajectories in the three-body problem may have
potential applications in NASA orbit design. Professor Xia will continue to be
actively involved in student training at both graduate and undergraduate level.
In the last three years, Professor Xia has graduated five Ph.D students.
