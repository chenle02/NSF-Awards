Peer-to-peer networks are distributed systems without any
central&lt;br/&gt;authority that are used for efficient management and location
of&lt;br/&gt;shared resources. Unlike traditional client-server
architectures,&lt;br/&gt;which concentrate load on a small number of server
machines,&lt;br/&gt;peer-to-peer systems provide inherent scalability by
distributing the&lt;br/&gt;cost of maintaining the system across its
participants. At the same&lt;br/&gt;time, peer-to-peer systems create new
challenges for efficient and&lt;br/&gt;robust implementation, as they are built
from untrusted and unreliable&lt;br/&gt;components and can provide survivability
only as an emergent property&lt;br/&gt;of the system as a
whole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project studies applications of large-scale
distributed data&lt;br/&gt;structures to peer-to-peer systems, with an emphasis
on efficiency,&lt;br/&gt;scalability, fault-tolerance, and recovery. Major goals
of the&lt;br/&gt;project include (a) design and implementation of mechanisms
for&lt;br/&gt;optimal trade-offs between use of the network and use of
local&lt;br/&gt;storage; (b) design and implementation of mechanisms for very
fast&lt;br/&gt;construction of large-scale distributed data structures; and (c)
use&lt;br/&gt;of data structures providing ``range queries,'' in which the
data&lt;br/&gt;structure finds nearest matches to a desired object instead of
just&lt;br/&gt;exact matches, to support versioning, replication, and
approximate&lt;br/&gt;matching.&lt;br/&gt;
