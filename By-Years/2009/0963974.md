The current Internet architecture is built around layers of different functions,
where the Network Layer provides a technology-independent abstraction on top of
a large set of autonomous, heterogeneous networks. The Internet Protocol (IP) is
one mechanism for achieving such an abstraction. By making the choice for a
rudimentary "best-effort" service, the Internet has not been able to effectively
respond to new requirements (security, manageability, wireless, mobility, and so
forth.) The rigid structure of the current IP model has led to numerous ad hoc
solutions that are either inefficient or incomplete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project is aimed at developing a clean-slate Recursive Internet
Architecture(RINA) that is based on the fundamental principle that networking is
inter-process communication (IPC). In this model, application processes(APes)
communicate via a distributed IPC facility. The IPC processes that make up this
facility provide a protocol that implements an IPC mechanism, and a protocol for
managing distributed IPC (routing, security and other management tasks). RINA
views each IPC facility as a "private" network, thus it offers intrinsic
security features. And it is recursive in that the IPC processes can themselves
be APes requesting services from lower IPC facilities. This project will design
and develop the repeating structures of RINA, along with various policies seen
useful in support of security, multihoming, mobility, and manageability. The
developed IPC mechanisms build upon recursive naming and addressing of IPC
processes, separation of mechanism and policy, and isolating data transfer,
control and management. The developed prototype will be tested on small and
larger-scale testbeds.
