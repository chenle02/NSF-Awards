Apex predators such as killer whales (Orcinus orca) and sperm whales (Physeter
macrocephalus) directly compete with humans for ecosystem services such as
fishery resources. One example of this type of competition is whale depredation
on longline fisheries in Alaska. Sperm whale and killer whale depredation occurs
when whales remove fish from longline gear, damage fish and/or fishing gear.
This interaction has negative consequences for the longline fishery and for the
whales. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary dissertation project
explores how whale depredation is impacting longline fishing practices and
fishery resource use in Alaska. This research will synthesize social research
interview and written questionnaire results with quantitative NMFS fishery data
to construct a detailed economic analysis of the costs associated with
depredation. Results from this study will establish baseline information on the
socio-ecological and socio-economic impacts of cetacean depredation and how
depredation impacts the long-term sustainability of longline fisheries in
Alaska.
