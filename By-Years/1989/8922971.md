A three year program of research to study the global cycling of sulfur species
in the troposphere, using a 3-d chemical tracer model (CTM) based on
meteorological information from a general circulation model (GCM) will be
undertaken. The main objective is to simulate the atmospheric distributions of
sulfate and its precursors in regions remote from anthropogenic sources. Five
species will be transported as independent tracers in the CTM, and detailed
descriptions of sources and sinks will be given for each tracer. Model results
will be evaluated with extensive field data from many parts of the world
including the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, the Amazon Basin, and polar regions.
Interpretation of the data in light of model results will make it possible to
quantify the relative contributions from various anthropogenic and natural
sources to regional and global sulfur budgets. Long-range transport mechanisms
regulation the sulfur cycle will be identified. Perturbations to the sulfur
cycle induced by human activity will be assessed.
