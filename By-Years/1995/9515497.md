INT 9515497 Porod This U.S.-Hungary cooperative research project between Dr.
Wolfgang Porod of the University of Notre Dame and Dr. Arpad Csurgay of the
Technical University of Budapest will examine systems of microelectronic
information processing that employ locally-interconnected architectures and
cellular neural networks. Efforts will focus on use of weakly-coupled quantum
dot systems, with the intent of identifying system applications of novel
nanoelectronic devices. The researchers expect that their results will lead to
matches in nanoelectronic device implementations with appropriate system
architectures and computational tasks. If successful, this research should yield
new knowledge that will contribute to our ability to match compatible
architectures for enhanced functionality. This joint research project fulfills
the program objective of advancing basic scientific knowledge by enabling
leading experts in the Untied States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary
talents and pool research resources in areas of mutual interest and competence.
