This project will support a postdoctoral fellow who will work with scholars in
political science and law to understand the legal significance of the
intersection of race and gender. Projects to which the postdoctoral fellow will
contribute all address questions of effective democratic institutions, including
courts, that include all people, and are attentive to the significance of both
courts and institutions that are to attend to democratic preferences. One site
for analysis is New Orleans, a city particularly ripe for analysis of the
significance of race and gender for governance because of its demographic and
socioeconomic diversity, and changes in the city. The postdoc will be able to
contribute to cross-national comparisons, as scholars work on issues in both the
United States and Brazil. The significance to governing institutions of
intersecting ascriptive identities has only recently been a matter for
systematic empirical investigation, making this a particularly innovative
project.

The project will support a postdoctoral fellow and an undergraduate student,
training them in empirical social sciences across multiple disciplines. The
project will also have substantial broader impacts because of the importance of
democratic institutions to governance, and one project's analysis of how judges
are selected.
