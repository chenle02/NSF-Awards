A workshop will be held on June 1-2 in San Jose, California, focussing on a
broad discussion of the role of ODA ( Office Document Architecture) in the
interchange of compound documents. This has been a major component of NSF's
EXPRES project. The participants and discussants in this workshop will all have
been involved in either ODA or compound document interchange. The workshop will
be planned and administered jointly by J. Rosenberg of Carnegie Mellon
University and S. Zilles of IBM- Almaden Research Center. The goal of the
Workshop will be a list of work items for future development and use of the ODA
standard.***//
