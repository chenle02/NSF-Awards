To make intelligent, cost effective decisions on ways of reducing industrial
water-polluting emissions, for water remediation, and for estimating the fate,
transport and bioaccumulation of chemicals, pure component thermodynamic
properties and aqueous solution phase equilibrium data are needed. The
measurement of necessary experimental data and, more importantly, the
development of methods to make accurate predictions of phase behavior in the
absence to experimental data for such systems are the subjects of this program.
In particular, this program will attempt the measurement of phase equilibria
(solubility and infinite dilution activity coefficients) of aqueous solutions of
actual and model priority water pollutant chemicals, and the development of a
new generation of group contribution prediction methods for such compounds. An
important characteristic of these chemicals is their complex, multifunctional
nature. The behavior of such molecules is not accurately predicted by current
molecular thermodynamic models and, even worse, one must concerned above their
appearance in water, a hydrogen- bonding solvent. As an important part of this
research, the investigators will use experimental data (to be measured in the
project and obtained from the literature) and modern computational chemistry
(molecular orbital) methods and molecular thermodynamic models to develop a new
group contribution prediction procedure for multifunctional chemicals in aqueous
solution.
