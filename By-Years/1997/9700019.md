This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of South
Carolina acquire a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)
magnetometer. This equipment will enhance research on materials ranging from new
superconducting fullerides, to novel transition metal nitrides, to low-
dimensional oxides, and to magnetically dilute semiconductor systems. The
superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer measures very
small currents or voltages and permits precise magnetic measurements of
materials.
