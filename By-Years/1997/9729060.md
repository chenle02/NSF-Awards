The work supported by this NSF grant will concentrate on maximizing the
knowledge which can be gained from a new and highly important collection of
early hominid fossils from the Afar region of Ethiopia (Aramis). These human
ancestors are the most ancient ever recovered (4.4 million years old) and are so
unlike any other known human ancestors that they have been assigned to the new
genus and species Ardipithecus ramidus. In addition to having extremely
primitive teeth and jaws, this new species is also ecologically unusual, because
it represents the first human ancestors which lived in environments dominated by
closed woodland and forest species. Their cranial and dental anatomy make them
the most similar to living apes of any human ancestral species, and their study
promises to shed important new light on the age and causes of the separation of
human and ape ancestors, an event which essentially initiated the rise of
humans. Our research has two primary goals: 1) A definitive descriptive analysis
of the limb bones of these new hominid fossils; 2) Functional and comparative
analysis of these remains to ourselves and to other living and fossil primates.
