Graduate student Yu Huang, advised by Dr. Celia Lowe, will undertake research on
the local effects of government promotion of new, small-scale economic
enterprises. The researcher will trace how expert and lay knowledge connect and
what effects this has on how people perceive decision making and
risk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be carried out in China, using the
promotion of scientific aquaculture as a case study. The investigator will use a
mixed methods approach, including archival research, participant observation
with extension workers and shrimp farmers, and semi-structured interviews.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will contribute to understanding how rural
development strategies intersect with scientific knowledge, politics, ecology,
and culture. This is critical in the current context of increased
industrialization of food production worldwide. Funding this research also
contributes to the education of a graduate student.
