Center for Autonomic Computing (CAC)&lt;br/&gt;Proposal
#1127965&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks funding for the Center for
Autonomic Computing (CAC) sites at the University of Florida (lead), Rutgers
University, the University of Arizona, and Mississippi State University. Funding
Requests for Fundamental Research are authorized by an NSF approved
solicitation, NSF 10-601. The solicitation invites I/UCRCs to submit proposals
for support of industry-defined fundamental research. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;A
unified cloud computing environment enabling anytime, anyplace access to
limitless computing resources still represents an ideal given the current
environment of heterogeneous resources distributed geographically and offered by
vastly different service providers. The proposed effort spans the expertise and
capabilities of the four center sites. The work aims to apply autonomic
computing principles to address elements such as security, inter-cloud
networking, and resource provisioning via thermal sensing and model-based
adaptive performance control in order to create a framework for realization and
management of trustworthy unified cloud computing environments. Results will be
derived from the implementation of the proposed approaches on a planned
distributed cloud testbed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advancement of the cloud
computing paradigm has the potential to enable transformative change to user
access to information technology enabling major advances in economic
productivity and access to a broad range of new services. The proposed center
effort works with a small member company and large systems integrator member.
Industry will further benefit via dissemination of the results through the
center membership and the extension of the center?s project portfolio into this
area. Efficiency gains potentially realized at cloud computer centers from the
proposed efforts has the potential to reduce energy costs system wide. The work
plans to bring together a distributed cloud environment deployed across CAC
sites to establish an open testbed for research and development of inter-cloud
interoperability that has the potential to serve as a resource for the work of
the broader community in this important area.
