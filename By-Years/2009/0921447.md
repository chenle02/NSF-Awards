This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institutes (PASI) award, jointly supported by
the NSF and the Department of Energy (DOE), will take place August 17-20, 2010
near Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Organized by Dr. Carlos A. Bertulani of Texas
A&amp;M University and Dr. Hendrik Schatz of Michigan State University, the PASI
will address the physics of rare nuclear isotopes. It will foster interactions
between nuclear physicists within the Americas to address the major intellectual
challenges posed by many open questions concerning the physics of nuclei, the
evolution of stars and stellar explosions, and the origin of the elements. It
will also serve to stimulate future collaborative efforts in this important
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expected outcomes in this PASI will include a mutual
beneficial exchange of technological knowledge and ideas between astronomers,
astrophysicists dealing with stellar evolution, and cosmologists dealing with
the Big-Bang theory. The meeting is also expected to lead to applications to
nuclear medicine and energy. Results from the PASI will be made available
through a website developed for the activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
