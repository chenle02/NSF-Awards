AST-0307531&lt;br/&gt;Roberts&lt;br/&gt;This project will study the physics of
active galactic nuclei (AGN) as close as possible to their centers, using radio
interferometry at centimeter wavelengths. Polarization observations reveal the
order and orientation of the magnetic field, as well as the thermal particle
environment in and around the AGN, creating "magnetic movies" of the time
evolution of the jets and of critical physical parameters. Observing at two or
more wavelengths will map the thermal gas in both space and time, and
interpreting the combined dynamical and polarimetric data in the framework of
models where shock waves propagate through jets of relativistic plasma, will
constrain the physical properties of the jet and its shocks. Using space-based
data to extend the observed electromagnetic spectrum, the project will measure
fluid and shock velocities in a wide range of AGN, including X-ray emitting
jets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work provides an excellent environment for
training students and building their research skills. The research will also
create large, electronically available databases of astronomical observations,
of use to other researchers in the
community.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
