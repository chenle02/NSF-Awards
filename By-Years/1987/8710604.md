According to the polyphyletic hypothesis of chloroplast evolution, present day
plant cells evolved from the engulfment of photosynthetic bacteria by colorless
animal-like cells. Subsequently, the engulfed bacteria and host cell developed a
symbiotic relationship, so that neither could survive alone. Part of this
process involved the loss of hereditary information from the two cells' gene
libraries and a transfer of genes from the bacterial chromosome to the host cell
chromosome. This proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms involved in determining
which genes are to be maintained in the chloroplast, which are to be
transferred, and which are to be eliminated from the host cell/symbiont complex.
Initial experiments will identify the nature and location of individual genes in
the chloroplast chromosome. Subsequent studies will identify genes that have
been transferred from chloroplast to host. The overall goal is to test the
endosymbiont hypothesis by examining the validity of its predictions.
