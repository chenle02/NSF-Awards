This grant provides funding for the development and implementation of formal
mathematical constructs to model tradeoff issues in the design of turbine
engines in a collaborative effort with Allison Engine Company. These
developments will focus on measuring and investigating the relationship between
the effectiveness of an engine and the efficiency of the processes required to
design an engine. The developments will be based on game theoretical principles
where the various design and production teams are players in the game. By
modeling the relationships among these teams, their decisions, and their
functional subsystems, various engine configurations can be found and tradeoff
scenarios can be investigated in order to meet the strategic objectives of the
individual design groups and the company as a whole. Notions from game theory,
nonlinear optimization, robust design, and decision-based design will be
integrated to model and describe existing products and processes at the company
and then to prescribe potential improvements in product design and/or process
communication and collaboration. If successful, the research will lead to more
effective turbine engines and more efficient design and production processes by
providing the capability to strategically determine the communication and
interface protocols among various groups. The research will provide the
foundation for computer-based decision support tools to rapidly explore tradeoff
scenarios in the design of new turbine engines. Companies must communicate and
collaborate with many different organizations located throughout the world.
Providing the foundations for making and coordinating a number of decisions
would allow a company to perform their design/make activities more efficiently.
Providing the mathematical foundations for organizational cooperation could
increase the efficacy of engine designs.
