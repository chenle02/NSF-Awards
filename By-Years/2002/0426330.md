This project provides 96 scholarships over four years to low-income computer
science undergraduates and targets recruitment of traditionally underrepresented
groups (primarily women, Native American, and Hispanic) into computer science.
The primary objectives of the scholarship program are to provide funding for
qualified, but financially needy students, leading to their degree in Computer
Science; to increase the overall number of graduates in computer science; to
provide additional recruitment efforts to underrepresented groups and first-
generation college students; and to provide student support services to increase
the likelihood of student success.
