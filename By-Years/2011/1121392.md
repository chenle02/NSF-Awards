Insects and other animals are frequently infected with maternally inherited
symbiotic bacteria, which can benefit their animal hosts by providing nutrition
or host protection. Many beneficial symbionts are themselves infected with
viruses called bacteriophages, which have the capacity to impact host biology in
critical ways, yet their roles in animal-bacterial symbioses are poorly
understood. In the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, the bacterial symbiont
Hamiltonella confers protection from attack by parasitic wasps, but only when
bacteriophages called APSEs are also present. Outside of being required for
aphid protection, however, little is known about the influence of APSEs on H.
defensa and aphid biology, including specifically how APSEs contribute to the
demise of parasites and its potential role in the regulation of symbiont
abundance. This project will use a combination of approaches, including genomics
and molecular biology, to characterize the roles of APSEs in the regulation and
maintenance of the protective symbiosis and to identify specific factors
responsible for wasp mortality. Deciphering phage-symbiont interactions is
important to the study of animal-microbial interactions generally and to
understanding the biology of many economically important insects like aphids.
The proposed work will yield information of practical importance for the
management of pest insect populations and on the role of phages in the
establishment and maintenance of bacterial-arthropod associations, which are
widespread in the natural world. The interdisciplinary nature of this research
is also well suited as a platform to train young scientists at the interface of
symbiosis, cell biology, parasitology, and molecular processes. This project
will train high school students, undergraduate and graduate students, and post-
doctoral researchers.
