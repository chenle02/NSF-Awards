The research will develop new effective statistical methods for improving
product quality, manufacturability, and reliability. Specific research topics
include: (1) robust design/Taguchi methods for improving product and
manufacturing process design, (2) experimental design methods for optimizing job
shop or manufacturing systems configurations or policies, and (3) statistical
process control methods for monitoring manufacturing processes with multiple
correlated quality characteristics. The research will involve academic
researchers, engineers from industry, and students to develop new statistical
methods to solve industrial problems. Practical strategies, techniques, and
tools will be developed and implemented.
