Faculty Enhancement and Curriculum Development Activities to Improve Advanced
Technology Education - Phase II Rapid advances in technology have made it
difficult for faculty in disciplines driven by advanced technologies to remain
current. At the same time manufacturers recognize the importance of modernizing
their processes to remain competitive in the global marketplace. The highly
skilled workers that are needed to meet the changing demands of industries will
have to be trained by community colleges or by industry itself. In response to
this need, the proposed project seeks to improve the quality of advanced
technological education provided by a consortium of five community colleges in
southwestern Virginia The primary goal of the project is to enhance skills and
knowledge of the faculty. The project consists of four primary activities
including "Back to Practice" experiences for community college faculty, a "Back
to Practice" regional study and dissemination conference, Conference/Workshop
participation, and faculty development summer workshops focused on enhancing the
curriculum development and student assessment skills of technical college
faculty. The project will demonstrate that the individual strategies described
in this proposal can be welded into a fully integrated process which assesses
industry needs, relates these needs to required employee skills, defines the
curricular material which establishes those skills, and provides quality
training for students and industrial technicians in a timely fashion.
