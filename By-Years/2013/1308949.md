The PI has begun the development of an intriguing amplification alternative to
PCR that could potentially be much simpler and more cost-effective. The PI's
previous work on a free-radical "amplification?by-polymerization" approach
demonstrated that it was possible to detect fewer than 2000 copies of DNA, with
false positive and false negative rates comparable to PCR. This proposal seeks
to extend this novel approach by using Ring-Opening Metathesis Polymerization
(ROMP), as a way to avoid the problems oxygen plays with free-radical
polymerization and to combine ROMP with lateral flow assay as the basis of a new
fieldable biosensor. The proposed research is transformative and has the
potential and has the potential to become the basis of a field assay and have an
impact in several biomedical sensing areas. These results will be used to
improve the efficiency of using ROMP for amplifying the presence of target
analytes and could serve as a first-line screening for, e.g., cytomegalovirus
(CMV). The PI has an excellent record for training underrepresented minorities
at all levels and this proposed work will add to that outreach effort. Her
productivity under the previous CAREER is quite good with 16 publications and 21
conference talks.
