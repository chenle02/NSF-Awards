Abstract&lt;br/&gt; This project is a study of the lithospheric dynamics
associated with hotspot-ridge interactions. The objective is to quantify the
effects of plume-induced forces on stresses in the lithosphere. This part of the
study will address the origin of the volcanic lineaments associated with
hotspot-ridge interactions and the possible connections with rift zone
relocations. The second objective is to predict a ridge relocation. Preliminary
analyses suggest plume uplift and shear probably are insufficient to break the
lithosphere alone, therefore it is anticipated that critical factors include
lithospheric weakness and mass flux associated with mantle plume magmatism. The
third objective will be to address questions related to the geometric evolution
of segmented ridges. Predictions will be compared with a variety of geophysical
data sets to test and constrain various aspects of the models.&lt;br/&gt;
