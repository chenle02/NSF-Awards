This work will extend and complete the precise radial velocity (RV) survey at
McDonald Observatory of 500 nearby stars. The ladditional years of data
collection will make it possible for the investigators to identify many
extrasolar planets with long (12-15 years) orbital periods. Their main research
goal is to determine the fraction of planetary systems that have undergone
significant migration, including planets that are more than 5 AU from their host
star, to constrain models of planetary system
formation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include the participation of
several graduate students in the research, production of 12 StarDate radio
broadcasts, and public outreach programs through the McDonald Observatory.
