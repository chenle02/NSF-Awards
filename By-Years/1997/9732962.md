In this project we investigate the design and performance of advanced digital
receivers for use in multiple access communications networks, where a
potentially large number of simultaneous users share a common transmission
environment. The receivers we study apply iterative soft information processing,
which has proven very effective and efficient in the decoding of so-called
"turbo" codes. Our receivers integrate error control decoding and multiple
access interference resolution to achieve maximum performance. We study the
fundamental theoretical limits of various multiple access strategies, including
code-division multiple access (CDMA), and design receivers aimed at approaching
these limits as closely as possible under a given computational complexity
constraint. The theoretical as well as the implementation complexity of these
receivers is studied carefully, and hardware implementations are proposed and
evaluated. The goal is to design and verify efficient joint receivers for
multiple access systems. We also study the interaction of the proposed receivers
with higher level communication protocol layers, particularly the operation of
these receivers in packet oriented networks with their unique requirements
