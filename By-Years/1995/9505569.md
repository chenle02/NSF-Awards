Plutons represent addition of magma to the crust, at least at the level of
intrusion, and as many plutons are quite large, space must be provided in the
crust to accommodate the increased volume. The space problem has been identified
for a long time, but its resolution has become increasingly important as pluton
emplacement mechanisms are studied. This project will examine the idea that
volume loss of the host rocks surrounding a pluton may accommodate some of the
required space. The approach is a chemical mass-balance study of wall rocks
around the Cretaceous aged La Posta pluton in southern California. Results
should test this hypothesis for how space is provided for intruded plutons.
