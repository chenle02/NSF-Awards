This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of organic electrochemistry. The broad thrust of this innovative
experimental program includes the synthesis and characterization of new
macromolecules, molecular arrays, oligomers, and polymers. These new materials
hold exciting promise for potential use in molecular electronics devices, as new
electrocatalytic surfaces, and as models for understanding membrane
electrochemical processes. The properties of these new molecular systems that
will be focussed upon include: (a) the single molecule electronic conductivity
of "molecular wires" of polyacenequinones and thiophene oligomers; (b) the bulk
electrical conductivity of appropriately reduced polyacenequinones and of
molecular arrays and conducting polymers; (c) the electronic structures of
polyacenequinones and thiophene oligomers in solution and in organized arrays;
(d) the near-infrared and infrared electronic excitations of polyacenequinone
anions; and (e) the mechanical properties of conducting polymer films used as
electrodes in solution. Voltammertic, surface force microbalance, Langmuir-
Blodgett, and four-point probe techniques will be used to characterize electron
transfer and conductivity in these systems. Electronic and magnetic resonance
spectroscopies will be used as probes of molecular and electronic structure.
Professor Miller will collaborate with chemistry and chemical engineering
colleagues at the University of Minnesota, the University of Nebraska, and the
University of California at Riverside as needed to provide expertise for this
broad, multidisciplinary activity that offers exciting possibilities for the
development of new materials with tailored electronic, structural, and
mechanical properties.
