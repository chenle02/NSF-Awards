Representation theory is, roughly speaking, the study of groups of symmetries.
For example, a mirror on a wall can help to visualize a reflection of
3-dimensional space, a symmetry which sends each point in our world to the
corresponding point on the other side of the mirror. Coxeter groups are special
kinds of groups of symmetries that consist of sequences of reflections through
mirrors placed at precise angles to one another. The so-called
"crystallographic" Coxeter groups occur frequently in physics and mathematics
because they preserve lattice points, for example the locations of atoms in a
crystal. Crystallographic Coxeter groups also arise when analyzing important
geometric spaces; this imbues them with a great deal of interesting structure.
Mysteriously, Coxeter groups which are not crystallographic still possess this
beautiful structure, despite having no geometric explanation. For example, each
Coxeter group has an associated Hecke algebra, and by multiplying elements in
this algebra one can produce numbers called structure coefficients. For
crystallographic Coxeter groups, these coefficients are always non-negative
because they are counting something. However, the non-negativity result holds in
general. An underlying goal of this project is to find combinatorial and
algebraic descriptions of the structures apparent in Coxeter groups, to help
explain these mysterious phenomena. The main objects of study are categorical
representations of Hecke algebras, where usual reflections are replaced by
"reflection functors" that act as symmetries not on some n-dimensional space,
but on spaces attached to representations of other important algebras in
mathematics.

In this research project the categorical representation theory of Hecke algebras
will be investigated along three lines of attack. The first approach is to lift
the notion of diagonalization from linear algebra to categorical representation
theory. For example, the full twist in the braid group, and its image in the
Hecke algebra, is diagonalizable in any finite dimensional representation. In
joint work with Hogancamp, I aim to prove that the categorified full twist is
"categorically diagonalizable." This allows one to lift much of the structure
theory of Hecke algebra representations to the categorical level. In the second
approach, together with Williamson and Juteau, I will study certain categorical
representations of affine Weyl groups which are significant for modular
representation theory, and their quantum deformations. The goal is to compute
local intersection forms, which will explain how the category degenerates in
finite characteristic. This computation will give character formulas for modular
representations of algebraic groups which were previously unknown. In the third
approach, together with Young, I will find an algebraic description of the
quantum deformation mentioned above, when the quantum parameter is a root of
unity. This is related to the categorification of complex reflection groups,
which is an open problem.
