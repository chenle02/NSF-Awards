Intellectual Merit: The SciGirls en la Familia outreach project builds on the
SciGirls national diffusion effort that puts girl-focused resources from the
award-winning PBS Kids science series DragonflyTV into the hands of afterschool
program leaders, informal science educators, and outreach professionals at PBS
stations. SciGirls stresses current research into what strategies most
effectively engage girls in STEM activities: extended communication and
collaboration; finding real-life contexts for science; promoting open-ended
investigations; and placing value on diverse ways of knowing, viewing and
describing the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: In the past three
years of SciGirls programming, over 100 educators and community leaders have
been trained reaching over 5,000 girls in grades 3 through 8. For SciGirls en
Español, a prior diffusion effort, Twin Cities Public TV partnered with the Self
Reliance Foundation (SRF), one of the leading supporters of informal science
education in Hispanic communities. SciGirls en Español provides Spanish-language
print and video resources, leader training, and grants to existing Latina-
serving organizations to help encourage a greater engagement in STEM. As the
SciGirls en Español project developed, one theme was repeatedly emphasized: the
importance of family and parental guidance in Latino culture. As a result, this
project is a new diffusion initiative: SciGirls en la Familia. This project will
provide community educators with resources and training in best practices to
engage not only Hispanic girls in STEM, but their families as
well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SciGirls en la Familia materials will be delivered to
grantees (after-school programs across the country), as well as SRF?s diverse
partner network, including Community Science Workshops, National Council of La
Raza, and Aspira. Materials will also be distributed to other organizations
(NSTA, ASTC, and PBS stations) and made available on DragonflyTV's Web site at
www.pbskids.org/dragonflytv.
