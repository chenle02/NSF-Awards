The primary goal of this project is to address three transition points critical
to increasing the number of CSEMS students qualified and prepared to enter the
high technology workforce. These three transition points present barriers that
impact the recruitment and retention of incoming freshmen, rising juniors, and
community college transfers. The project plan strengthens existing efforts and
renews collaborations among the Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied
Science faculty, the Center for Excellence in Engineering and Diversity,
industry, and alumni in an effort to effectively develop, graduate, and place
CSEM students into career positions or graduate school. At the end of this
multi- phased, four-year project the governance team expects to positively
impact 80 economically disadvantaged and underrepresented engineering, computer
science and mathematics students.

Along with new recruitment programs, the CSEMS Project team includes faculty in
key retention and student support components and institutionalizes promising
pilot programs. The UCLA CSEMS Project team includes four faculty members and
the Director for the Center for Excellence in Engineering and Diversity.
