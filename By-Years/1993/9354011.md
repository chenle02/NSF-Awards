environmental engineering courses to undergraduate students in the U.S. A
particular effort will be made to identify women and minority faculty.
Participants will interact with experts and among themselves to learn the
various aspects of AIWPS. The workshop will include illustrated lectures by
experts, discussions, field trips, and practical problem-sovling sessions. The
prospects for establishing undergradute reserach projects in regular curricula,
how to sustain communication and program development, and how to integrate this
