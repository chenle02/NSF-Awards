The funding will support early-stage researchers (students, post docs and junior
faculty) to attend the Fluidization XVII conference (May 21-25, 2023, Edinburgh,
Scotland). Attendance at the conference will ensure continued U.S.
competitiveness in the fundamental research and emerging applications of
fluidization for novel fluidization technologies field. Over the past few
decades, notable advances in the fundamental understanding of fluidized systems
have been possible via a combination of careful experiments, simulations, and
theory. Nonetheless, the understanding and accurate prediction of fluidized
system is nowhere near its single-phase counterparts, in which software like
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers provide a reliable tool for design
and scale-up.

The objectives of this proposed effort include: (i) bringing together members of
industry, academia and national laboratories to showcase different perspectives
and approaches, as well as to encourage potential collaborations; (ii)
encouraging active participation by graduate researchers and post docs who
represent the future of the field; (iii) bringing scientists and engineers
together to provide an inviting and inclusive atmosphere to openly discuss their
disciplines and approaches, thereby motivating new collaborations and new lines
of inquiry;, (iv) going beyond the technical content associated with new
research, and bringing to the foreground content related to education,
professional development, and diversity and inclusion; and (v) particular
outreach to underrepresented groups in STEM at all levels â€“ conference
organizing committees, invited speakers, and participants. The NSF support will
be provided to emerging scientists (students, postdocs, and junior faculty) and
underrepresented groups to ensure a diverse audience.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
