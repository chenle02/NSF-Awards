CTS-9412747 J. Peddieson, Tennessee Technological Institute This is an
Engineering Faculty Internship (EFI), proposed in response to the initiative
Grant Opportunities for Academic Research with Industry (GOALI). The P. I. will
visit Fleetguard, Inc. (Tennessee), and collaborate with that company to a
research project on depth/cake filtration. Filter cake formation on a clogging
filter medium and the depth filtration within the filter medium due to particle
penetration will be modeled using the industrial site. The interaction with the
industrial partner will help to identify the critical technical issues, improve
the method and it verification. It is expected that the resulted approach to
predict depth/cake filtration will be applied in the areas of chemical
manufacturing, petroleum refining and water purification. The awareness of the
P. I. and his student to industrial needs may lead to are direction of the
research. ***
