This research involves the study of nested row and column designs. The
investigator will study optimal design using spatial correlation models rather
than the classical model formulation. The spatial processes to be employed will
be members of the autonormal family, a two-dimensional generalization of the
one-dimensional autoregressive processes. Experimental design has long been used
in agriculture to improve crop production. It is now being used in manufacturing
to improve product quality. This research will study optimality of certain types
of designs.
