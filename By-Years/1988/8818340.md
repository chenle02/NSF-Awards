The purpose of this investigation is to develop, test, and analyze iterative
methods for computing the solutions of large, sparse linear systems arising from
the discretization of elliptic partial differential equations. The focus of the
research is on partial elimination techniques for two-cycle problems, iteration
schemes for nonsymmetric systems derived from non-self-adjoint problems,
preconditioners, and parallel computations. An analytic study on benchmark
problems, including systems from three-dimensional models, will be combined with
numerical experimentation using both serial and parallel computers.
