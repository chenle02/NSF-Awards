*** 9710491 Cogan This Small Business Innovation Phase II project will develop
thin-film electrochromic materials that provide enhanced color control.
Electrochromic materials change their optical properties reversibly when
electrochemically cycled between oxidized and reduced forms. A new concept in
electrochromic materials design based on bilayer or multilayer contiguous thin
films of electrochromic inorganic oxides was investigated in Phase I.
Electrochromic coatings that modulate over a range of colors, e.g., yellow-
neutral-blue or gray-neutral, were identified. A model was developed to predict
the color and spectral properties of multilayer electrochromic coatings and
devices based on the spectroelectrochemical properties of the individual layers.
Model predictions for bilayer coatings were confirmed by comparison with
experimental data. In Phase II, the multilayer coatings would be incorporated
into thin film electrochromic devices designed for modulating solar
transmittance through building windows. Spectroelectrochemical measurements of
individual and multilayer coatings would be used with the model to design
devices with near-neutral optical modulation and wide luminous and solar
transmittance range. In addition, two and three-color electrochromic displays
would be developed using the model and the accumulated database of
spectroelectrochemical properties of the oxides investigated to guide the
display design. Commercial applications sought in Phase II are architectural
solar control coatings exhibiting near-neutral visible modulation and multicolor
electrochromic displays. ***
