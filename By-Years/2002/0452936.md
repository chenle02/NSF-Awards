EAR-0452936&lt;br/&gt;Caffee&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the application of
cosmic-ray-produced (cosmogenic) nuclides in earth surface processes is
relatively new, the impact of these studies is astonishing. Ten years ago it was
difficult to measure the erosion rate of a landscape over a timescale relevant
to geomorphology; few measurements existed, and these were often unreliable.
Today, basin-wide erosion rates can be measured with cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al,
almost routinely, by measuring their concentrations in stream sediment. The
initial success of these studies portends an immense growth in the application
of cosmogenic nuclides. The measurement of cosmogenic radionuclides is
accomplished using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). AMS is an increasingly
important tool that is applied to a variety of research problems spanning
numerous earth science disciplines. The unique strength of AMS is its ability to
measure isotopes of an element in which the abundance ratios range from 10-12 to
&lt;10-15. The nuclides most commonly measured by AMS include 10Be, 14C, 26Al,
36Cl, and 129I. These and other radionuclides are produced in a variety of
geologic settings; their concentrations can serve as chronometers or tracers of
naturally-occurring processes. As demand in the NSF scientific community for AMS
measurements increases PRIME Lab must be able to meet this demand and assume
leadership in both measurement capabilities and scientific applications. PRIME
Lab's ultimate goal is to be the focus point for the measurement and application
of AMS radionuclides in Earth sciences in the U.S. During the last several years
numerous upgrades have been completed. These enhancements are enabling higher
precision and faster measurements. During the next four years we anticipate both
improvements in existing measurement capabilities and the development of new
capabilities. These developments in AMS technology will proceed in parallel with
new application of cosmogenic nuclides in the Earth
sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
