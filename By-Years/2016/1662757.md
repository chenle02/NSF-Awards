The design and analysis of networks constitute one of the most important classes
of problems in the field of optimization. In practice, network models are used
to address such diverse applications as wireless communication, energy
distribution, and conservation planning. A network consists essentially of a set
of "nodes", linked in some fashion by "arcs". Connectedness is often a critical
feature of a functioning network. However, enforcing connectivity in standard
network optimization formulations remains a significant computational challenge.
This project considers new formulations that address node-connectivity
constraints directly. Results from this project are expected to allow for the
solution of large-scale instances of these problems to optimality in a
reasonable amount of time. The PI will mentor graduate and undergraduate
students, and through collaboration with the Oklahoma Louis Stokes Alliance for
Minority Participation (OK-LSAMP), students from underrepresented populations
will be provided the opportunity to participate in the research activities.
Results from the project will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate
courses.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project aims to develop fundamental
theoretical and algorithmic advances for effectively imposing connectivity
constraints in mixed integer programming (MIP) models in which the key decisions
are at the vertex (i.e., node) level. Previous MIP-based approaches to solve
vertex-centric connectivity problems use additional edge (and possibly flow)
variables, which overburden commercial solvers, or rely on simple, weak
inequalities, leading to the exploration of a large number of branch-and-bound
nodes. This research is expected to overcome these limitations through two broad
research tasks: (1) developing a rich body of knowledge about connectivity
polyhedra in the space of vertex variables, and (2) designing efficient
algorithms for solving related problems by exploiting this polyhedral
information. It is expected that the research will also allow for significant
improvements in solving hop-constrained and survivable network design problems.
