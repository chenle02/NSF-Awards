This grant supports the National Research Experiences for Undergraduates Program
(NREUP), administered by the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) and held
at various locations throughout the United States. The program is designed to
provide undergraduates from underrepresented groups majoring in mathematics, or
a closely related field, with challenging research opportunities. This award
funds these experiences during the summers of 2017, 2018, and 2019. The length
of the experiences can vary from location to location but will be a minimum of
seven weeks. The program aims to reach minority students at a critical point in
their careers, midway through the undergraduate program, through an
undergraduate faculty member with whom they have a strong
connection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NREUP will continue its past achievements in
increasing minority students' interest in obtaining advanced degrees in
mathematics. NREUP will invite mathematical sciences faculty to host student
research programs on their own campuses. The MAA will select the best from
competing proposals. NREUP provides key components to encourage students to
pursue graduate studies and careers in mathematics: enriching and rewarding
mathematical experiences, mentoring by active researchers, and intellectual
networking with peers. Moreover, by supporting faculty at a diverse group of
institutions to direct summer research experiences, this project supports not
only undergraduate students but also the development of a community of skilled
faculty mentors who are expected to provide ever-increasing opportunities for
undergraduate research.
