C-RUI: Forever Wild, the Adirondack Uplands and Watershed
Integrity&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this study is to determine how
underlying physical factors (such as geology) and&lt;br/&gt;forest land
management practices interact to influence"watershed integrity" in the
Adirondack&lt;br/&gt;Uplands of nothern New York State. We will address the
central question: Does long-term forest preservation enhance watershed structure
and function in Adirondack uplands? The proposed activity will involve a
multidisciplinary approach to study patterns in multiple variables in reference
catchments (subjected to forest removal durning the past 15 years) in the
Adirondack Uplands.&lt;br/&gt;Within reference and managed categories catchments
will be selected along a gradient of surficial soil conditions from shallow/till
soils to deep/outwash soils. Comparison across watersheds will include
hydrogeology, surficial geology, biogeochemistry, forest community, and aquatic
community response variables. Data analysis will include multivariate
statistical methods to extract patterns across the landscape in response
variables.
