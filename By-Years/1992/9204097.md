The principal investigator will continue his study of C-R geometry and
holomorphic maps. He will use methods from analysis such as estimates for the
d"-operator as well as geometric techniques including folliations determined by
the Monge-Ampere operator. In another direction, the principal investigator will
study iterations of polynomial maps in several complex variables. He will
continue his investigation of properties of Julia sets and the ergodic
properties of the maps. This award will support research in the general area of
differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry is the study of
the relationship between the geometry of a space and analytic concepts defined
on the space. Global analysis is the study of the overall geometric and
topological properties of a space by piecing together local information.
Applications of these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the
structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and the large scale
structure of the universe.
