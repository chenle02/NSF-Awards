9627909 Davis The Yinshan fold and thrust belt of northern China lies within the
Mesozoic North China plate and is not clearly related to any of the three
convergent margins of that plate that were active in Mesozoic time. This
research is aimed at understanding the causes of this belt forming so far away
from these margins, and whether the voluminous magmatism can be related to such
distant subduction processes. Results may help understand other enigmatic
orogenic belts that occur within plates but lie at considerable distances from
the plate margin.
