This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to develop a
highly-multiplexed high-temperature sensor system to enable distributed
temperature and pressure measurements for reservoir management in geothermal
wells. The proposed system synergistically leverages recent advances in laser
fabrication of in-line fiber interferometers with state-of-the-art high-
resolution optical time domain reflectometers. The resulting system will
withstand temperatures up to 800 degrees C and will be insensitive to hydrogen-
induced spectral attenuation shifts that render Raman spectroscopy methods
inaccurate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application of this project is
in the management of energy producing geothermal wells. Electricity generated
from these wells has the potential to fill a significant portion of the
country's demand for energy. However, costs must be lowered to make geothermal
energy economically competitive with fossil fuel energy. Improved geothermal
reservoir management is expected to lead to lower energy cost, but requires
down-hole instrumentation that can survive the harsh environment.&lt;br/&gt;
