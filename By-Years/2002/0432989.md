Texas A&amp;M University-Texarkana, in partnership with Texarkana College and
Northeast Texas Community College, is providing scholarships and support to
encourage highly talented mathematics and science majors and professionals to
become certified K-12 teachers in nine high-need rural school districts in
northeast Texas and southwest Arkansas. The project is producing thirty-two new
math or science teachers in four years in nine partner high-need rural school
districts. Upon graduation and certification, novice teachers receive support
through an effective induction program that assists them in the transition from
resident teacher to professional educator and ensures their retention in the
teaching profession well beyond their teaching service obligation. Goals of the
project are to increase the quantity of K-12 teachers who have high quality
mathematics or science content knowledge in partnership high-need rural school
districts, to increase the number of underrepresented minority math and science
teachers in partnership school districts, to provide minority students with more
role models from whom they can obtain inspiration for their own careers in math,
science, or other fields, and to study the recruitment, preparation, and
retention of highly qualified math or science teachers in high-need rural school
districts. The Robert Noyce Scholarship Program at A&amp;M Texarkana includes
the following objectives: (1) extensive recruitment from a large and diverse
group of well qualified mathematics or science students who are committed to
teaching in high-need rural school districts, (2) exemplary preparation of the
students to become superior math and science teachers, (3) consistent and
innovative support of the novice teachers to transition and retain them in the
profession, and (4) utilization of program evaluation data to study and advance
knowledge in the areas of teacher recruitment, development, and retention in
high-need rural school districts.
