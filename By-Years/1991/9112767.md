This grant is co-funded between the Materials Theory and the Biophysics programs
at NSF. Several topics in condensed matter physics will be investigated. The
primary emphasis will be on gel electrophoresis, a topic of great importance in
biology and materials processing. The electrophoresis of very long chain
polymers such as megabase length DNA is still not well understood. There are
still many unexplained experimental effects that greatly reduce the efficacy of
this technique. These effects will be explored theoretically in consultation
with experimentalists. A newly developed long range Monte Carlo algorithm will
be used and will include the effects of gel heterogeneity and intra-chain
repulsion. Work will also be undertaken on the effect of polymers on turbulent
flow by extending an analytical treatment developed by the principal
investigator to more realistic descriptions of the velocity field. Research will
also be conducted on novel random matrix ensembles and their connection with the
quantum statistical properties of isolated systems. %%% Pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis is an experimental technique used to separate DNA molecules
containing up to two million base pairs. This discovery was a critical factor in
making the human genome project possible. DNA can be viewed as a polymer and the
methodology of polymer science can be applied to studies of the behavior of DNA
in an electric field. The present grant will continue fundamental and critical
studies on theoretical and computational aspects of pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis. Such studies help in interpreting the experimental results and
in predicting useful behavior of this important technique.
