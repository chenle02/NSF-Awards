Graduate student Bryan Ness, under the supervision of faculty adviser Dr.
Douglas Soltis of Washington State University, will study several species groups
in the mariposa lily genus, Calochortus. Morphological, biochemical and
chromosomal diversity in the genus pose challenging problems for the recognition
of species and the determination of evolutionary relationships among them. Mr.
Ness will employ modern molecular methods for analysis of isozymes and of
ribosomal and chloroplast DNA in order to measure genomic differences between
species, and to determine progenitor species for the high-chromosome
number(polyploid) taxa. Biochemical data will be integrated with morphological
and chromosomal information in an updated taxonomic treatment of these western
North American plants. The combination of several analytical approaches in the
study of evolutionary diversity constitutes a model program of systematic
research.
