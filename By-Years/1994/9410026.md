This project explores techniques for automatic storage reclamation, especially
for real-time and distributed systems. It compares techniques for incremental
garbage collection in terms of efficiency, real-time guarantees, and performance
for distributed data. The focus is on techniques that support high-performance
on standard hardware, and standard compiler optimizations. The three major
phases of the project are; (1) implementation and evaluation of a new real-time
uniprocessor garbage collection algorithm which provides better real-time
guarantees than incremental copying due to weaker coupling between the
application and the garbage collector, (2) extensions of the algorithm for near
real-time systems where some real-time guarantees can be sacrificed for higher
performance, and (3) application of these incremental techniques as local
garbage collectors in a distributed garbage collection system, where they will
enable higher performance garbage collection of poorly distributed data.
