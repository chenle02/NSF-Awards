David Stone will work on geometric problems whose motivation comes from
computational physics. The techniques to be used come from geometry and
topology. He will be applying combinatorial methods where numerical integration
has been used in the past. Stone's research concerns the general problem of
extracting global topological information about a space from local geometric
data. In classical differential geometry the data are presented in infinitesimal
form, and the Chern-Weil theory constructs from them further infinitesimals
which, when integrated, yield the desired characteristic classes. Stone will
develop a systematic analogue of the entire Chern-Weil theory that does not use
infinitesimals but employs techniques of algebraic topology. This work promises
to have physical applications in the theory of lattice gauge fields.
