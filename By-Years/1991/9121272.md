This project is a university-industry investigation of energy dissipation
processes in solids which are bombarded by keV to MeV ions or 10 eV to keV
electrons. After the diffusion of the deposited excited state energy and the
emission of electrons, those excitations that have not been quenched decay by
the emission of photons or by non-radiative processes such as the breaking of
chemical bonds in a molecular solid and the production of significant atomic
motions. Experiments that detect ejected atoms, molecules, electrons, ions and
photons as well as IR studies of the bombarded solids, will be used to develop
models for the energy deposition. Theory and modeling are also part of the
project. The results have applications in the deposition of metals on surfaces
and on processes in the microelectronics industry depending on ion beam
lithographic methods.
