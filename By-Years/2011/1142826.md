The Acoustic-Articulator Modeling EArly Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER)
investigates the use of three-dimensional Electromagnetic Articulograph (EMA)
technology to create improved pronunciation error analysis and corrective
articulatory feedback. This improved EMA technology is a recent development, and
there are no speech or language data sets currently available that include such
high resolution three dimensional position/orientation information. This EAGER
investigates the potential of this type of data. A matched acoustic-kinematic
corpus with five degree of freedom EMA data is being collected, across both
native and nonnative (Mandarin Chinese) speakers of English. The project
investigates methods for normalizing speakers' articulatory data into a common
reference frame and disseminating the data to the broader research community to
promote continued work in this area.

Current tools for pronunciation assessment are very limited in the specificity
of the corrective pronunciation feedback that can be provided, due to
limitations of our ability to accurately map acoustic inputs to corresponding
articulator patterns and obtain detailed analysis of the manner and degree of
pronunciation errors. The development of effective tools for Computer Aided
Language Learning (CALL) is an essential component of enabling nonnative
speakers of English to quickly integrate into America's 21st century global
workforce. Better tools for pronunciation assessment and accent modification can
have tremendous impact on workforce effectiveness, especially within key sectors
related to medicine, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, where it
is important to continue to attract and support top talent from across the
globe.
