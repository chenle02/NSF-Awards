This project is concerned with the structure of division rings, central simple
algebras, and the ways in which they combine to form Brauer groups. Using finite
groups, it is possible to describe division rings as crossed products. An
ultimate goal is to relate the structure of the group with the arithmetic
properties of the center of the ring. The research supported is in the general
area of ring theory. A ring is an algebraic object having an addition and a
multiplication defined on it. Rings occur naturally in many areas of
mathematics. This principal investigator will study how one ring can contain
another. The work draws on some deep results in group theory and will shed light
on various questions in algebra and number theory.
