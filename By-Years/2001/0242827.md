The investigators will develop a model of the distribution of current flow in
the return path of the global electric circuit. The model will incorporate
effects of stratospheric clouds and aerosols, energetic electron precipitation,
tropospheric clouds, and atmospheric electricity. The goal is to improve
understanding of the global circuit including approximations and influences not
treated in existing models. Tropospheric clouds create a high resistance that
impedes downward current flow and increases ionospheric potential that increases
the current flow in fair weather regions. Stratospheric aerosols reduce ion
mobility and increase recombination and resistivity. These similarly increase
ionospheric potential and redistribute the current flow into latitude bands
where there is a lower concentration of stratospheric aerosols. Polar
stratospheric clouds may have the same effect in the locations and at the times
they are present. Energetic electron precipitation also modulates the
stratospheric resistivity variations. The investigators will model the
latitudinal variations of these effects and compare the model output with
observations. The work will be valuable for understanding the observations of
changes in current flow in response to solar activity. This is important for
understanding the role of solar variability in global climate change.
