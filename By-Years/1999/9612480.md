9612480 Jang The effects of tool wear on surface texture generation in diamond
ultra-precision turning will be studied in order to establish the relationships
between tool wear progression and the 3-D shape changes of the surface texture.
This will be used as basis for development of control algorithms for on-line
evaluation and display of the surface texture and development of an index for
determining optimal tool changes as well as for development of tools to be
implemented in the computer numeric controlled machining center. ***
