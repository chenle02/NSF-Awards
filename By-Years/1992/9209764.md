Interneuronal communication, in the form of synaptic transmission, may be a
process that is fundamental to memory. Persistent modifications of synaptic
transmission that are induced by neuronal activation are emphasized in certain
neurobiological models of memory. It is very likely that such use-induced, long-
lasting modifications involve both an enhancement (potentiation) or reduction
(depression) of synaptic transmission. Dr. Dahl will investigate a possible
physiological basis for the induction of synaptic potentiation or depression. He
will be testing two specific hypotheses in the CA1 region of the hippocampus: 1)
postsynaptic depolarization coupled with neuronal activation may be a necessary
condition for potentiation of synaptic transmission, and 2) postsynaptic
hyperpolarization couple with neuronal activation may be necessary for the
induction of depression. The results of this work may provide a basis for study
of intraneuronal processes that are voltage-dependent, and may underlie synaptic
potentiation and/or depression. Furthermore, the results may be generally
applicable to cortical information processing.***//
