ABSTRACT HUMPHREY CTS-9504390 UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA The flow through a helical
coil has long been the principal paradigm for investigating laminarization
phenomena. Placing a straight pipe downstream of a helical coil wherein the flow
has been laminarized allows a well-posed investigation of retransition
phenomena. This proposal seeks to investigate such a flow using laser-Doppler
velocimery, to obtain the velocity data necessary for developing and testing, in
parallel with the experiment, a direct numerical simulation approach aimed at
predicting laminarization and retransition phenomena in general, and in coiled
and straight pipes in particular. In many industrial chemical applications, the
formation of hot spots inside reactors, and of polluting byproducts with their
attendant negative environmental impact, is the outcome of non-uniform mixing.
It is especially important to maintain good mixing, and to avoid the tendency
towards laminarization which invariably arises in regions of reduced fluid
motion. Hence, this study has the potential to aid in our understanding of
mixing processes and ultimately in the control of such processes which would
permit the reduction of unwanted side products.
