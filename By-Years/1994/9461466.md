This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is for development of a
compact, rugged, fiber-optic Raman spectrometer system suitable for performing
real-time, in vivo, tissue analysis in a clinical setting. Tissue
characterization by laser-based spectroscopic methods, such as fluorescence and
Raman spectroscopy is showing significant promise for identification of tissues
on the basis of chemical composition and for evaluating the health status of
tissues. Coupled with fiber-optics, these methods offer the extraordinary
potential of performing tissue chemical analysis in vivo. Before these powerful
new diagnostic methodologies can be implemented as practical tools in a clinical
setting, a number of instrumentation problems need to be resolved. In
particular, current laboratory research instruments must be converted into
rugged, low-cost, easy-to-use, compact units suitable for deployment in a
clinical setting and reliable operation by clinical personnel. This proposal
offers an innovative approach to solving this problem.
