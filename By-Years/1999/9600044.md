9600044 Lo This award supports the collaboration of Professor Jien- Chung Lo of
the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Rhode
Island with Professor Eiji Fujiwara of the Department of Computer Science, Tokyo
Institute of Technology. Dr. Lo is to spend three months at Tokyo Institute of
Technology, with the project funding, to perform collaborated research in
reliable design of logic circuits and VLSI systems. The ever decreasing circuit
size, the increasing packaging density and the massive commercial demands that
have been observed in the past decade call for innovative design methods to
provide reliable computer usages more efficiently and more effectively. Lo and
Fujiwara have both previously studied the efficient design of reliable logic
circuits and VLSI systems. They have collaborated in a breakthrough work of
defining the quantitative measurements of reliable designs. This work has opened
several new research opportunities to be explored during this proposed visit.
This proposed research visit will enhance the research in both U.S. and Japan by
bringing together researchers from both countries in the area of reliable design
of logic circuits and VLSI systems. Recent result and information exchange
between the researchers from both countries on this subject can be expected.
Furthermore, this project fulfills the objectives of transfer of scientific
knowledge through international collaboration between U.S. and Japan. ***
