The year for ATLANTIS II begins with an ALVIN cruise on the MId- Atlantic
Ridge. ATLANTIS II then enters a shipyard for biannual overhaul before
proceeding to a cruise on the West Florida Escarpment and one in the Gulf of
Mexico. The vessel then transits the Panama Canal and begins a series of ALVIN
programs in the Galapaos Islands, the East Pacific RIse and the Guaymas Basin.
An eighteen day non-ALVIN leg coring in the Sea of Cortez is scheduled before
the vessel transits to the Juan de Fuca and Oregon Margin areas for and ALVIN
dive series. Four legs in the San Diego area complete the year for ATLANTIS and
ALVIN. R/V KNORR will return to Woods Hole after a fifteen month shipyard period
during which the vessel was repowered and "stretched" thirty-four feet. After
re-outfitting with science deck gear, the ship will be ready for service about
June 15, the first cruise scheduled in a test of the newly reinstalled dynamic
positioning system. The Marine-Light-Mixed Layer Program cruise south of
Iceleand precedes a program on the Blake Plateau before KNORR transits the
Panama Canal to begin the extended cruise scheduled in the South Pacific for the
World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE). The year ends with KNORR at sea in
tech SOuth Pacific on a leg to Tahiti. The year for OCEANUS is comprised of
nineteen voyages for a variety of disciplines, most of which are in and out of
Woods Hole. The vessel makes an extended trip to the Madeira Islands for the
deployment of sensors for the subduction program in the spring. The final cruise
series of the year is in the southern tropical Atlantic for recovery and
redeployment of gear placed by OCEANUS early in 1989. The year ends with the
Vessel dockside in Woods Hole.
