This project focuses on the study of the interactions of photons with negative
ions in two series of experiments. The first studies will use the crossed
kilovolt ion beam/tunable laser method to measure high precision photodetachment
cross sections near threshold in a static electric field. Both I- and Bi- will
be studied in electric fields up to several kV/cm to characterize rescattering
effects in which the emerging electron's wavefunction is reflected by the
electric field potential and scattered by the now neutral atomic core.
Subsequently, the faculty and student researchers will investigate static
electric effects on the newly discovered unique excited states in Os-. The
second series of complementary experiments will proceed in parallel. Using the
Advanced Light Source (ALS) as a source of high energy photons, inner-shell
photodetachment from C- and B- will be investigated.
