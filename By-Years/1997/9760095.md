*** 9760095 Baker This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
proposes to develop an integrated software-hardware system, based on high end
microprocessors working in parallel, and running a state-of-the-art, fully
parallel quantum chemistry program. It will offer supercomputer performance at a
fraction of the cost. There is demand for a system, which would allow the
accurate modeling of complex materials and chemical reactions, and would be
affordable by a workgroup or a small department. None of the currently available
hardware-software combinations satisfy this requirement. The system will run
parallel implementations of the most important methods of ab initio quantum
chemistry (including density functional methods), in particular geometry
optimization. It will be coupled to a commercial modeling/visualization program
running on the same machine. The proposed personal computer based software-
hardware system should be of interest to chemical and pharmaceutical companies
involved in drug and material design, university research departments and
modeling groups, and will be affordable even by individual researchers and bench
chemists. ***
