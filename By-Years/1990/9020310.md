Catalysis plays an essential role in many commercially important chemical
reactions and is also an important element in most biochemical reactions. The
focus of this grant is on models for heterogeneous catalysis under flow
conditions, as they provide a paradigm of a nonequilibrium system which can
exhibit phase transitions between steady states, macroscopic oscillations and
even chaotic behavior. An objective is to understand the effects of spatial
correlations and fluctuations on the dynamic and static properties of a system
in a nonequilibrium steady state, particularly near a nonequilibrium phase
transition. Research will be conducted on models for heterogeneous catalysis
which exhibit both continuous and discontinuous transitions between steady
states. These studies will be done using numerical simulation and by finite size
scaling analysis. A numerical renormalization group analysis of the master
equation will also be developed. These methods will be applied to study the
effects of correlations and noise in systems that show transitions to time-
dependent periodic and chaotic behavior.
