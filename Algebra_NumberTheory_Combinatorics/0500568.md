The PI intends to study Golod-Shafarevich groups and algebras and their
interactions with amenability and tau-property. The PI will also continue his
work on linearity of free pro-p groups and Jordan superalgebras.

The expected results of the project will affect several branches of Algebra,
Topology and Theoretical Computer Science. The new areas of algebra that will
hopefully evolve from the work on the project will create good research
opportunities for young mathematicians and provide excellent material for
graduate courses.
