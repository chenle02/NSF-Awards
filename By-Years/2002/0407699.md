This proposal has three goals. The first goal is to stimulate interest in STEM
degrees and &lt;br/&gt;careers by offering a BS degree program in Environmental
Science using culturally &lt;br/&gt;sensitive courses, laboratory experiments
and other activities. The second goal is to &lt;br/&gt;continue and expand
innovative programs of recruitment and retention of students in &lt;br/&gt;STEM
degree programs. These include experimential learning programs for SBC students
&lt;br/&gt;and local high school students and outreach programs for K-12
students on the SRSR. &lt;br/&gt;The third goal is to expand and improve
research opportunities for students in STEM &lt;br/&gt;related degree programs.
Students in the BS degree program in Environmental Science &lt;br/&gt;will be
required to complete a research project. The development of the Research
&lt;br/&gt;Laboratory will greatly enhance the learning and research
opportunities for students to &lt;br/&gt;complete research projects. SBC will
apply for a loan to begin commercial analysis of &lt;br/&gt;environmental
samples on SRSR. Ultimately, SBC hopes this laboratory can become an
&lt;br/&gt;independent commercial laboratory for environmental analyses.
