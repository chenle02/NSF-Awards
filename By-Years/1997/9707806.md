This study proposes to conduct a preliminary survey of arctic sea stars in the
family Asteriidae located in the Bering Sea. The PIs are proposing an
exploratory molecular phylogenetic study that addresses a fundamental question
about the evolution of echinoderm larval forms and adaptation to polar
conditions. The study will investigate the evolutionary history of brooding and
non-brooding sea stars the central and southern Bering Sea by taking advantage
of an extensive database on reproductive mode in Arctic sea stars and a unique
opportunity to collect critically needed sea star species. The work will involve
the use of an already planned cruise in the Bering Sea by the USFWS vessel
Tiglax in the summer of 1997 to the Pribilof Islands and central Aleutian
Islands. Because these opportunities are time sensitive and likely not to occur
again for a decade, the PIs have chosen to submit a proposal of limited scope
under the guidelines of the Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER)
program.
