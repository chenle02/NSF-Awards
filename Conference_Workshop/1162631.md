The Hawaii Conference on Algebraic Number Theory, Arithmetic Geometry, and
Modular Forms (HCANTAGMF) will be held on March 6-8, 2012 at the East-West
Center in Honolulu, adjacent to the University of Hawaii campus. As it is
occurring on the heels of the AMS Western Section meeting (Honolulu) and just
before a memorial conference for Alf van der Poorten (Newcastle, Australia), a
critical mass of prominent number theorists will be in attendance. Talks will
occur in three parallel sessions on the topics in the conference title, with
breaks for plenary lectures by five distinguished speakers. There will also be
opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to present their
results. Further details and a list of participants can be found at the
conference URL http://www.math.hawaii.edu/numbertheory2012/

The HCANTAGMF will be a major vehicle for discussing the latest advances in our
subject and laying the ground work for future ones. It will be an unparalleled
opportunity for the graduate students at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, for
the faculty at the nearby community colleges in the UH system, and for the
faculty and students of the universities on the West Coast with smaller number
theory programs. Approximately 100 number theorists will be in attendance,
representing a diverse collection of sub-disciplines, and ample time will be
allotted for conversation with and among them. The organizers also hope to
improve the visibility of the number theory group at the University of Hawaii.
By introducing so many researchers to our local number theory group, the
organizers hope to increase the visibility of our activities and the profile of
the graduate program at the University of Hawaii.
