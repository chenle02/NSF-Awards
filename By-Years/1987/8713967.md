This project asks a question central to the current concern of population
biologists with the adaptive significance of life history traits: does selection
operate on specific life history traits or on suites of traits? Campanula
americana, the tall bell flower, within its broad area of distribution presents
a useful array of life history characters, occurring as annual, winter annual,
biennial and perennial populations. This qualitative study will be executed at
the Kellogg Biological Station where three populations close to the station can
be compared with populations established in the greenhouse from seed taken
throughout the species range from Florida to Michigan. This should be the
beginning of a long-term study of these problems.
