Objective:

This proposal is to conduct the NSF Workshop on Nanotechnology Infrastructure to
identify nanotechnology infrastructure needs in universities related to the NNIN
(National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Initiative). Columbia University and the
SRC will co-organize the workshop which will be held in Arlington, Virginia on
April 3-4, 2012.

Intellectual Merit:

The NNIN has been very successful in establishing facilities and infrastructure
for universities to perform basic research in all areas of nanotechnology. This
Workshop attempts to identify the needs for the next phase of NNIN which will
continue and expand the research capabilities in US Universities and educate the
next generations of scientists and educators in an area of National importance.
The proposal?s goals are clearly articulated and the participants who are
prominent in their scientific fields are appropriate for achieving the stated
workshop goals.

Broader Impact:

The NNIN has had a fundamental impact on US nanotechnology R&D and education
over the past 10 years and is expected to continue to do so. Additionally, more
emphasis will be placed on the societal and ethical implications of
nanotechnology which will broaden the benefits to society.
