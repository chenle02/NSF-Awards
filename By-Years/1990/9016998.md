This award will support joint research between US and French researchers on the
topic of multinational econometric policy analysis. The US investigators are:
Dr. Robert F. Engle, Dr. Clive W. Granger, and Dr. Halbert L. White, University
of California at San Diego. The collaborators in France are: Dr. Michel Lubrano,
Dr. Luc Bauwens and Dr. Russell Davidson, University of Aix-Marseille II and
III. The objective of the project is to develop and apply statistical techniques
to evaluate policy models. Potentially one of the most important activities by
econometricians and applied economists is the production of models to be used by
policy makers to help them determine an appropriate policy. However, these
models have to pass not only standard specification tests and evaluation
procedures, but they also have to show that they are relevant for policy
purposes. Testing procedures for these models are very preliminary and are in
need of both further theoretical and empirical development. In this project, the
investigators will examine and apply econometric methods to study existing
models. Theoretical developments will be coupled with empirical studies, which
examine the co-movements of output and asset prices across countries. Both the
US and French groups have extensive experience in both the theory and practice
of econometrics, as well as in the development and application of tests and
testing procedures. In particular, the French investigators bring to the project
experience of testing procedures based on methods associated with the use of
artificial regressions, as well as Bayesian specification testing.
