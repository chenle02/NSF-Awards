Researchers are developing a human-machine synergism in which the machine
complements human weaknesses to being innovative while the human returns the
favor for the machine. This method called Innovation Assistance (IA) represents
a fundamental new way of thinking about innovation and replaces the minimally
successful Artificial Intelligence techniques from the 1980's that were unable
to get machines to be innovative by themselves. This is accomplished by
carefully understanding the fundamental axis upon which all innovation turns:
every innovative solution is based upon at least one overlooked (i.e., obscure)
feature of the problem. Humans and machines have different reasons for
overlooking obscure features. Each partner in the human-machine interaction will
help counter the other?s weaknesses. Researchers have thus far devised nearly
two dozen innovation techniques that counteract the many cognitive reasons why
humans overlook obscure features.

This technology has applications for STEM education, lawyers, the military and
engineers. The problem-solving model used in this method has the potential to be
used to alter innovative education in STEM fields. Techniques developed through
IA will be able to more efficiently search databases for similar solutions to an
entered problem. There is potential for this technology to be used in a military
setting for training forces to be more innovative problem solvers in the field.
Engineering applications of this technology could assist in moving projects more
rapidly through research and development phases. This technology addresses a
growing need to improve the innovation capabilities of individuals and
organizations.
