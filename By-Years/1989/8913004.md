The Fourth Engineering Foundation Conference on Risk-Based Decisionmaking will
take place in Santa Barbara, California on October 15-20, 1989. The major goal
of this series of conferences is to integrate what is known about technological
risk assessment with social risk acceptance within a common set of
multiobjective water resources planning problems, among them, coping with floods
and droughts. Another goal is to determine what the topics are which need
further investigation. The main themes to be addressed during this conference
are: 1) the difference between risk analysis conducted as part of planning and
that of engineering reliability analysis during design; 2) the issues facing the
engineering profession related to risk analysis and legal liability, the use of
engineering design standards, and the overall usefulness of risk analysis to
decisionmaking; and 3) the usefulness of case studies and practical examples of
risk analysis application to water resources engineering problems.
