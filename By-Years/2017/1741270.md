The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project entails
increasing the ability of commercial users of mass spectrometry to bring better
products to market through the use of technology that better molecular
identification and quantification. Commercial users of mass spectrometry include
pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology firms, and other companies that have a
direct impact on public health and wellbeing and are currently limited in social
impact and revenue, in part, due to the inability to accurately identify and
quantify molecules in mass spectrometry samples. Specific applications for the
technology includes research and development on a variety of products, including
diagnostic tests, novel drugs, and personalized
medicine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will investigate the
commercial delivery of mass spectrometry data processing services. The
underlying technology advances current capabilities by combining advanced
statistical methods, additional information present in mass spectrometry signals
but not used by current approaches, and novel methods for interpretation to
identify more molecules than current mass spectrometry approaches with more
quantitative accuracy than current approaches. The research is particularly
capable of detecting low abundance molecules, which are exceptionally difficult
to detect with current methods, and are more likely to have biological
significance than high abundance molecules. Corporate mass spectrometry users
can use accurate identifications and quantifications of low abundance molecules
to shorten time-to-market, reduce development costs, and increase the production
throughput and significance of innovations across a broad spectrum of
pharmaceutical and biotechnology products.
