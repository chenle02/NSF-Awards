Objective of this research is to develop an easy to apply and high quality
asynchronous design flow for modern VLSI chips based on the NULL Convention
Logic (NCL) asynchronization approach with proper Computer Aided Design tool
support. The design flow will focus on simultaneously optimizing power,
performance and area of the circuit at the logic, circuit and layout levels. New
optimization techniques targeting asynchronous design will be derived and
implemented into the tools. The proposed work will address an important aspect
(power) in attempts to overcome Moore's law slowdown in semiconductor circuit
design, manufacturing with potentially large impact to
industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results will be integrated into graduate
courses and/or senior electives in university curricula. The proposal is from an
EPSCoR state, and PI will in addition recruit students from the University of
Puerto Rico, which is yet another EPSCoR state. The tools developed as part of
this project will be made available in the public domain. The PI has a very
strong past record of developing CAD tools and making them available to the
community. Overall the project exemplifies NSF commitment to the integration of
research and education.
