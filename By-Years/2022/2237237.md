Number theory is the branch of mathematics that studies patterns in the
arithmetic of whole numbers. A fundamental question, for example, is how many
whole number solutions does a particular system of equations have? This is often
a very difficult question and engages with techniques from a wide variety of
different areas of mathematics. Galois theory, introduced in the 19th century,
studies groups of symmetries of polynomial equations and is central to modern
number theory. In the 1970s, Langlands introduced a far-reaching web of
conjectures which connects Galois symmetries with other symmetric structures
appearing in analysis (modular forms). Building bridges between the arithmetic
world (Galois theory) and the complex analytic world following Langlands
conjectural framework has been a formidable task and a driving force in modern
number theory. This project aims to prove new instances of Langlands’
conjectures. This project will open up and engage a number of new questions and
concrete problems that will provide research opportunities for graduate students
and postdocs. The project will also provide mentoring and online training
opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In
more detail, a major breakthrough in the Langlands program was the proof of
Fermat’s Last Theorem which was accomplished by proving a two-dimensional
conjecture connecting arithmetic objects (elliptic curves) to analytic objects
(modular forms). A key idea in the proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem and in many
other important results is the study of congruences modulo a prime p between
modular forms. This proposal will systematically construct congruences in higher
dimensions by connecting them to new geometric structures in Galois theory. This
circle of ideas led to the resolution of Serre’s conjecture for modular forms in
the early 2000s, another major achievement in the progression of the Langlands
program. The weight part of Serre’s conjecture, which classifies congruences
between modular forms, has been generalized in a number of directions as part of
the growing field of the p-adic Langlands program. This project will resolve
major gaps in progress on these generalizations including the lack of a
conjecture for wildly ramified representations and the branching problem for
potentially crystalline deformation rings in dimension greater than three. The
project will also prove new modularity lifting theorems by studying the geometry
of moduli spaces of Galois representations in intermediate
weight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
