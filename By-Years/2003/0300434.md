The principal investigator and his collaborators propose to &lt;br/&gt;work on
aspects of Langlands' program and related topics.&lt;br/&gt;A conjecture of
Serre predicts that certain 2-dimensional mod p&lt;br/&gt;representations of
Galois groups over Q arise from modular forms,&lt;br/&gt;and it further predicts
the level and weight of the form.&lt;br/&gt;Serre's conjecture can be viewed as
a mod p version of Langlands'&lt;br/&gt;correspondence, and the weight part as a
manifestation of its&lt;br/&gt;local behavior at p. A main focus of the proposed
research concerns&lt;br/&gt;a generalization of the weight part of Serre's
conjecture to the &lt;br/&gt;context of Hilbert modular forms and totally real
fields,&lt;br/&gt;where the developing formulation reveals new phenomena.
&lt;br/&gt;The research also addresses topics to which this has
connections&lt;br/&gt;and applications, including congruences between modular
forms, &lt;br/&gt;deformations of Galois representations, the global
Langlands'&lt;br/&gt;correspondence and special values of
L-functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Langlands' program predicts a deep
correspondence between objects from&lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry (solution sets
of polynomial equations, such as elliptic &lt;br/&gt;curves) and objects from
representation theory (functions with symmetry &lt;br/&gt;properties, such as
modular forms). While there has been significant recent &lt;br/&gt;progress (for
example, the advances of Wiles and of Lafforgue), Langlands'&lt;br/&gt; program
remains largely conjectural. The links it provides between two
&lt;br/&gt;seemingly different branches of mathematics reveal properties of the
integers, &lt;br/&gt;which can, in turn, have applications to
cryptography.&lt;br/&gt;
