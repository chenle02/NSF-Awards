Gravity waves with periods ranging from minutes to hours are believed to affect
the atmospheric circulation, temperature, and mixing processes at levels
extending from the troposphere through the mesosphere and above. However, they
are too small to be resolved in general circulation models (GCMs) and must be
treated via parameterization. That is, their effects must be described
approximately for inclusion in large-scale models. This research program aims to
quantify the properties of gravity waves and determine their sources, their
geographic and seasonal variations, and their effects on the atmosphere.
Emphasis is on the waves generated by hurricanes and other convective storm
systems. The goal is to improve the ways of parameterizing their effects in
GCMs. The approach focuses on analysis of aircraft and balloon observations from
previous field experiments to derive information on the momentum flux and the
temperature perturbations associated with gravity waves, which information is
then employed for developing parameterizations. Collaboration on including the
parameterizations in GCMs is planned with researchers at the NOAA Geophysical
Fluid Dynamics Laboratory and other organizations. These studies will provide a
means of both studying the global-scale effects of gravity waves and refining
the parameterizations. The goal of the work is to improve large-scale
atmospheric simulations by approximating more accurately the effects of the
waves.
