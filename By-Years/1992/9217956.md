This project will explore the feasibility of using supercritical wetting to
introduce binary mixtures into highly porous silica gels. A two-step process
will be employed: supercritical drying (removing the solvent at temperatures and
pressures above its gas- liquid critical point where it evaporates without
surface tension, and then reversing the procedure to add the new solvent via
supercritical wetting. This new approach should preserve the fine structure of
the gel and allow us to study the effects of randomness, confinement, and
wetting on the structure, dynamics and phase transitions of a variety of non-
water based fluid mixtures in an important class of porous media. %%% The
confinement of fluids within porous media can lead to dramatic and complex
changes in their physical behavior due to finite size effects, wetting, and
geometrical and chemical randomness in pore size and structure. This
investigation will employ non-water-based solutions. Besides their fundamental
scientific, such studies are also of great practical-importance in areas such as
secondary oil recovery techniques and containment of societal wastes in
landfills and nuclear waste in underground storage sites.
