The approaches in computational geometry to date have been largely theoretical
and deal with discrete and combinatorial structures such as point sets, lines,
polygons, polyhedra and at most general arrangement of hyperplanes. This project
considers the design and implementation of efficient algorithms for an arbitrary
arrangement of algebraic curves and surfaces and specifically compact solids
bounded by curved algebraic surface patches. The class of algebraic surfaces, a
subset of arbitrary analytic surfaces, provides enough generality to accurately
model almost all complex rigid objects. Additionally, algebraic curves and
surfaces have compact storage representation and form a class which is complete
under all common operations required by a geometric modeling system. Finally,
representing physical objects with algebraic surfaces encompasses all prior
modeling approaches. The main research thrusts of this project are: (1) the
design of efficient algorithms for basic operations on algebraic surfaces (these
manipulations include intersection, parameterization, Ck-interpolation, and
approximation), and (2) the design of efficient algorithms for basic
manipulations on solids bounded by algebraic surface patches (these
manipulations include: boolean set operations, convex hull, decomposition,
convolution, offset, blending, and smoothing operations).
