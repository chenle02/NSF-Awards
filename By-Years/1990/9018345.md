One of the most fundamental processes inherent in animal cells is the capacity
to transport ions and water. These processes are very important in the
functioning of the human body, for example, in the production of saliva, sweat,
urine, stomach secretions etc. Dr. Bradley is studying insects that live in a
very saline lake, Mono Lake, in east central California. This lake is 2.5 times
as salty as the ocean and contains very high levels of sulfate. Despite these
unusual conditions, brine flies live by the billions in Mono Lake. He is
investigating the mechanisms of salt transport in the midgut (the site of salt
entry) and hindgut (the site of salt exit) in these flies. The flies may well
contain the most active sulfate pumps known in biology. He anticipates that the
information he will gather will be of broad use in understanding the mechanisms
of salt transport in other biological systems and in man, for example in the
kidney. It is a well established practice to examine physiological processes in
non-human model systems where the process is highly exaggerated. Electrical
generation has been very successfully studied in electric eels, nervous function
in the giant axons of squid and processes of genetic selection in the fruit fly
which has very short generation times. He intends to use the same principle in
examining sulfate transport in the most active sulfate system known.
