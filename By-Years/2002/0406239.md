The Summer Institute (SI) will assist professors at liberal arts colleges in
introducing materials science and engineering to their undergraduate curricula.
SI will bring together MIT faculty, faculty from undergraduate liberal arts
colleges, and some MIT Department of Materials Science and Engineering graduate
students to present interdisciplinary material in a modular, case study format
and introduce the materials science and engineering concepts to professors who
normally do not have background in the field of materials research or
engineering.

The PI will attempt deliberately to broaden the education base for materials
research, bringing the perspectives and methodologies of materials science and
engineering to a much broader and diverse public audience that is usually
present at engineering institutions.
