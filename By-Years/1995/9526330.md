9526330 Li, Y-G This research is to investigate the fine structure and physical
properties of the fault zone ruptured in the January 17, 1995, M=6.9 Kobe,
Japan, earthquake in 3-D using fault zone trapped waves. A similar successful
fault zone study was done for the 1992 M=7.6 Landers, California, earthquake
rupture. Sixty portable seismic instruments from the IRIS PASSCAL pool will be
deployed across the Kobe rupture zone. Japan colleagues will deploy their own
instruments in a cooperative effort. The data will be interpreted using 3-D
finite-difference and 3-D boundary-element simulations with comparison between
the Kobe and Landers earthquake results. This research is a component of the
National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. *** ??
