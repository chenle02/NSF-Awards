This project will involve nonlinear strictly hyperbolic differential equations.
We will consider the following problems: estimates for linear equations, decay
of solutions, and extension to nonconstant coefficients of results known for the
D'Alambertian operator. The studies will include the analysis of the interaction
of singularities across nonsmooth surfaces. Further construction of examples
exhibiting nonlinear singularities will be attempted. Precise regularity
theorems will be developed in order to show that certain explicit approximate
solutions differ from the actual ones. Technological developments such as better
radars, X-ray devices, and scanners ultimately rely on the understanding of the
hyperbolic equations considered in this project.
