Abstract Clemens CTS-9553124 The proposed effort centers on the fundamental
studies of turbulence/flame and turbulence/diffusion interactions using planar
laser diagnostics. Turbulence/reaction zone interactions, stabilization
mechanisms in planar lifted flames, and differential diffusion in turbulent
flows will be targeted for investigation. The studies will make use of laser
imaging of flow field variables such as velocity, OH and CH radical
concentrations, and fuel jet concentrations. Velocities will be measured using
particle image velicometry (PIV) and species concentration using planar laser-
induced fluorescence (PLIV). An emphasis will be placed on the simultaneous
imaging of multiple flow variables such as velocity and OH (or CH), or two
scalars with different mass diffusivities. Information will be forthcoming which
will be important for the development and validation of turbulent reacting flow
models which seek to predict combustion efficiency and atmospheric pollutant
levels.
