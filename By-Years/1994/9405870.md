9405870 Edwards This research, which is a collaboration between the California
Institute of Technology, the University of Minnesota and the University of
Texas, is a study of the two great plate-boundary faults of Sumatra. Preliminary
studies funded by the NSF demonstrate the high potential of these projects. The
work addresses fundamental questions concerning both the repeatability of great
earthquakes and the kinematics of obliquely convergent plate boundaries; results
would apply to earthquake hazard at plate-boundary faults in the U.S. in
California, the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. The goals are 1) to use submerged
and emergent late Holocene corals to map and to date vertical deformations
associated with great historical, ancient and future earthquakes of the Sumatran
subduction zone and 2) to complete a neotectonic map of the right-lateral
strike-slip Great Sumatran fault and to determine its late Quaternary rates of
slip. This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction
Program. ***
