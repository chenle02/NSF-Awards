With support from the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce), this
Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project at San Francisco State University
aims to serve the national need of preparing high-quality STEM teachers for
high-need school districts. Noyce STAJES (STEM Teaching toward a Just and
Equitable Society) will provide financial and programmatic support to attract,
train and retain academically talented STEM majors and professionals committed
to creating access and empowerment for students through teaching in high-need
secondary schools. STAJES scholars will engage in coursework and action research
projects to learn effective social justice pedagogy and deepen STEM content
knowledge. Scholars will also participate in field placements and mentorship
with high-need schools and STEM education programs which integrate social
justice with rigorous STEM teaching. Other project components include post-
credential professional support through partnerships with Trellis Education and
the Western Regional Noyce Alliance. Scholars will also complete a Noyce seminar
and mini-courses, taught by SFSU faculty, to help scholars understand effective
teaching, integration of STEM content, and pedagogical practices for promoting
social justice through STEM teaching.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;STAJES will develop
STEM scholars into teachers committed to promoting a justice and equity through
STEM education. Over the five-year grant period, the project will support 26
undergraduate STEM majors or STEM post-baccalaureate credential students to
become STAJES scholars and future mathematics or science teachers in high-need
schools. Project partnerships include collaborations with two large local school
districts (San Francisco Unified and Berkeley Unified), with a focus on
leveraging the partnerships to include field-placements and internships which
will further the equity agendas of the project while supporting preservice
teacher education efforts. The leadership team will examine how participation in
project activities affects scholars' understanding of and ability to enact STEM
teaching that promotes equity in student outcomes. The Noyce program supports
talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12
STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM
master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the
persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need
school districts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
