The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at the University
of Nebraska supports an interdisciplinary research program on Quantum and Spin
Phenomena in Nanomagnetic Structures. The MRSEC includes faculty participants
representing the departments of physics, mechanical engineering, chemistry, and
the school of biological sciences The Center's research is organized into two
interdisciplinary research groups (IRGs). IRG1, Nanomagnetism: Fundamental
Interactions and Applications, is concerned with the study of exchange and
magnetostatic interactions between particles or grains in nanostructures. IRG 2,
Spin Polarization and Transmission at Nanocontacts and Interfaces, investigates
spin polarization and transport through nanoscale magnetic contacts and at
ferromagnetic/ferroelectric structures. The Center's research is aided by
extensive collaborations with other universities, government and industrial
laboratories that bring in over fifteen additional participants. The Center also
maintains shared experimental facilities in support of its research efforts.
Education outreach efforts include research experiences for teachers and for
faculty-student teams from predominantly undergraduate
institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants in the Center currently include
16 senior investigators, 2 postdoctoral associates, 14 graduate students, 10
undergraduate students, and 2 support personnel. Professor David J. Sellmyer
directs the MRSEC. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br
