Direct observation and assessment of family members' interactions with one
another is being increasingly recognized as an important method for empirically
investigating the social context of individual development. Longitudinal
analyses of observational data and its relation to individual development,
however, are rare. As a result, there are few models for analytic techniques
that can assess changing patterns of interaction using multivariate, categorical
data over several time points. The majority of statistical analyses of
observational data are ill-fitted to the task of describing the complexity of
behavioral relationships among family members. This research will include the
development of an application of log-linear techniques to the analysis of
longitudinal data on the family interaction patterns of adolescents. The
relationship of these changing patterns to adolescents social and personality
development and adaptive functioning will be assessed. In addition, a
collaborative study using two longitudinal data sets will be initiated to
examine how the context of family interaction alters throughout the life-span
and how families at different stages of the life-span adjust to and facilitate
the development of their members. This research will both clarify the causal
links among behaviors, attitudes, and competencies within the family as a child
moves from early to late adolescence and aid in the development of new analytic
strategies for examining longitudional observational data.
