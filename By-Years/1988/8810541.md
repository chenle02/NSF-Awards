There is much recent interest in the condensed matter physics of low dimensional
magnetic and electronic systems. Sheets and/or chains of magnetic ions may play
a key role in high temperature superconductivity, as may quasi-one-dimensional
systems described by the Hubbard model. Models of single magnetic impurities,
such as the Kondo and Anderson models, form the basis for understanding heavy
electron systems. On the other hand, there have been significant recent advances
in understanding and applying Bethe Ansatz techniques to one-dimensional
integrable systems. Some of these models are excellent representations of the
quasi-one-dimensional systems mentioned above. This research will apply Bethe
Ansatz techniques to one-dimensional magnetic and electronic systems, as well as
to understanding the sine- Gordon model.
