9625319 Murphy This CAREER project emphasizes research on the behavior of
systems that utilize axially moving materials in a manufacturing environment,
and educational aspects in the field of vibrations and stability. A wire
electro-discharge machining process, and high speed band saw systems, are chosen
as two examples of research projects. For the former, a full vibration and
stability analysis is carried out in a multi-mode, three dimensional traveling
wire model; the effects of non-uniform thermal loads, caused by sparks, are
examined; the effects of multi-span coupling and span guide- wheel coupling are
considered; and the wire whirling problem is studied in addition to a
characterization of chaotic response of the wire using fractal dimensions and
Lyapunov exponents. Similarly, in the case of high speed band saws, the use of
shape memory alloys embedded into the blade is investigated to increase
structural stiffness at high temperatures. In the educational area,
undergraduate and graduate courses are developed in vibrations, acoustics,
aeroelasticity, and nonlinear dynamics; and undergraduate students are
encouraged to get involved in the PI's research program.***
