The research is a collaborative project among researchers at six universities.
The researchers will extend their previous study of the record of atmospheric
chemistry concentrations recorded I the glacial ice at Summit, Greenland form a
summer-only study to a full year by adding a winter sampling program. The ice
core record from the Greenland Ice Sheet Project (GISP2) has been analyzed for
traces of atmospheric chemistry but the results cannot be fully assessed until a
complete annual record of present chemistry is available because the largest
signal in the ice core results form snow that accumulates during the winter
months. A winter sampling program has been logistically impossible until this
year. A complete annual cycle of the record of how modern atmospheric record
from GISP2 ice cores for the past 110,000 years.
