This project will construct and use a large historical data to study how land
allocation policy affects economic outcomes for people and places. The research
will study how two dominant paths to land title â€“ homesteading and cash purchase
in the US affected land use and other outcomes later on. This project will
document who sought land under each alternative and where they came from. In
addition, it explores how securing free land affected upward mobility by
comparing descendants of successful homesteaders to those of the forty percent
of homesteaders that tried but did not secure title. This research bridges the
gap between theoretical notions of secure property rights and the actual process
by which they are attained. Land reform processes throughout the world combined
with the prospect of virgin lands attracting new settlement amid climate change
and population growth make these insights critically important. The results of
this research will help to guide land allocation policies and in the process
improve economic performance. The results of this research will establish the
U.S. as the global leader in land allocation theory and
policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will evaluate the process of title
allocation, inclusive of how it influences who seeks what land, and its effects
on economic outcomes for people and places. Central to these efforts is the
advancement and implementation of data matching techniques to link volumes of
handwritten land entry records, digitized land patents, and individual records
from sources such as the federal decennial censuses. The project will draw on
this data and econometric techniques to provide new insights into how land
titling (1) affects migration by altering incentives for diverse types of
individuals to claim certain types of land, (2) contributes to upward income
mobility for individuals and families, and (3) affects the spatial distribution
of labor and capital and subsequent pattern of regional economic growth. The
project will also study how land allocation policy influences the distribution
of wealth both for individual actors and subsequently the region. This project
will enhance understanding of how the process of title allocation affects who
attains land rights and economic development. The results of this research will
help to guide land allocation policies and in the process improve economic
performance. The results of this research will establish the U.S. as the global
leader in land allocation theory and policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
