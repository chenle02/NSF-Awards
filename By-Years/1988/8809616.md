This proposal from the University of California, Berkeley, in cooperation with
the University of California, Santa Barbara; the University of California,
Irvine; San Francisco State University; Stanford University; and Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratory (LBL) requests funds to establish a Science and Technology
Center in Particle Astrophysics. The Director of the Center will be Professor
Bernard Sadoulet of the University of California, Berkeley. Astronomical
evidence indicates that 90% or more of the universe is made of dark matter.
Elucidating the nature of this matter has the highest priority in astrophysics
and forms the intellectual focus of the research in the Center. The most
intriguing possibility is that this matter may be in the form of particle relics
from the beginning of the universe. Concentrations of these particles could
surround us today in the form of dark matter in galaxy halos, and their
signature may exist in the diffuse cosmic background radiation which itself
originates from the early universe. Dark matter and the diffuse background
radiation provide unique laboratories for studying both the origin of the
universe and the fundamental nature of matter. Central to the research program
is the development of a new generation of cryogenic detectors which can be used
to measure more accurately the diffuse background radiation and to verify
directly the particle origin hypothesis of dark matter. Another clue to the
origin of dark matter may lie in the details of the large scale structure of the
universe. Research at the Center will include the development of advanced
optical methods for this study including the development of an adaptive optics
system for the new Keck Telescope. If successful, the importance of this high-
resolution system for all of astronomy cannot be overemphasized, while the
impact on the optical industry will be quite direct.
