This project examines the transformation of water rights in Hawaii from
1820-1905 through in-depth interviews with local elders and systematic analysis
of archival records and data (e.g., Water Commissioner Reports; Hawaiian and
English language newspapers; District Court Records and Minute Books; Journals,
Reports, and Letters of American Missionaries). The purpose of the study is to
illuminate how state law affects indigenous legal systems and customary
practices regarding the allocation of natural resources. Hawaii between 1820 and
1905 is an apt context for this research because customary practices of local
people, imbedded within a world view of sharing and trusteeship over resources,
clashed with a western view of resources and a western legal system of
allocation based on ownership and contract enforcement. Also, Hawaii is a very
interesting case since Hawaiians were in control of the government and
themselves made many of the critical decisions to abandon local knowledge and
embrace Anglo-American notions of the economy and law. This research should
expand our understanding of the relationship between law and social change. In
particular, it should add to knowledge of how the legal system affects culture
in non-legal ways and how law silences certain voices and releases and
encourages others in ways that go beyond a particular case or piece of
legislation. Further, the study should contribute to our understanding of how
major changes in the rules of resource allocation transform the social context
and how vastly different belief systems as those of pre-contact Hawaiians and
the Anglo- American common law merge to create new systems for resource use.
Given the scarcity of environmental resources and the depletion of resources
like water, it is especially important to learn more about how groups,
communities, and nations arrive at arrangements and resolve disputes about
ownership and usage rights.
