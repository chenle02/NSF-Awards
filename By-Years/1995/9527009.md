9527009 Barton This collaborative project (NSF and industry) will yield a novel
comparison of igneous-related mineralization across regions of contrasting
characteristics. It provides an integrated approach to sorting our some of the
major controls on igneous-related metallogenesis. These studies build on earlier
NSF-sponsored research by the PIs. Industry funding/collaboration is in place
for student and field support; NSF funds will be used primarily for geochemical,
petrological, and geochronometric studies. Comparative studies will be conducted
in three regions which have contrasting crustal compositions, igneous and
tectonic histories, and metallogenic characteristics. These contrasts, when
considered together, will provide tests of hypotheses that can not be evaluated
in any local area. Overall, the PIs will develop the following topics: (1)
characteristics of key districts, (2) magmatic compositional controls on
mineralization, (3) crustal-scale controls on magmatism and metallogeny, and (4)
secular variations reflecting preservation, exposure, and contrasting
petrogenetic regimes. The goal of the coupled geochemical and field studies is
to better understand the geology, geochemistry, and timing of representative
magmatic-hydrothermal centers.
