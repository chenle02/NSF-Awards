This Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site project is in the field
of chemistry. For a three-year period beginning April 1989, eight (8)
undergraduate students will spend ten (10) weeks engaged in basic research in
chemistry and, in one case, in a joint chemistry-physics project under the
direction of nine faculty members from the chemistry department and one from
physics. The program has two main objectives: (a) to develop basic research
skills, and (b) to strengthen interest in research and graduate studies. Each
student will be supervised by a faculty mentor and will work on an appropriate
research project in that faculty member's laboratory, under the direct
supervision of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. In order to encourage
student-student interactions, students will be housed together in University
dormitories and will be offered formal and informal group activities. All
students will take an "Introduction to Research" course, and will present the
results of their research at a meeting held at the end of each annual 10-week
session.
