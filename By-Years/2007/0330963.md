0330963&lt;br/&gt;Kurabayashi&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research program
investigates the multi-physics phenomena at MEMS-scale contacts to permit
reliable design of RF MEMS switches for a wide variety of applications taking
advantage of RF MEMS technology. This project aims to develop models for the
MEMS-scale contact asperity heating at varying contact force, contact area
geometry, surface conditions, and asperity mechanics. Such models will allow the
development of design rules and new RF MEMS geometries which extend their
lifecycle and power-handling capability.&lt;br/&gt;
