A high-resolution, digital single channel seismic reflection survey of the
Hawaiian flexural moat is planned. The major objectives of this survey are to:
1) define the major stratigraphic units within the moat, 2) establish the
relative importance of island erosion rates, lithospheric rheology, and the
thermal structure of the underlying plate on the development of the moat and its
internal stratigraphy, and 3) identify sites where the age relationships of the
stratigraphic units in the moat and their subsidence history can be determined
by drilling. The investigators believe that these data will significantly
advance our understanding of the mechanics of flexure, not only in the vicinity
of large volcanic loads, but also in other tectonic settings such as sedimentary
basins along passive continental margins and in front of orogenic fold/thrust
belts.
