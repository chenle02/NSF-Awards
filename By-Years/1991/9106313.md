The principal investigator will study the solubility of silicate minerals in
various aqueous solutions at elevated temperatures and pressures. Measurements
to 5 kilobars will provide data in a pressure range for which no data currently
exist. These data are important to understanding the interaction between fluids
and rocks during metamorphism of the Earth's crust.
