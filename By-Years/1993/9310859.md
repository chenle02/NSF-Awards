Engineering at Purdue University will purchase optical spectrum analyzer and
optical fiber fusion splicer equipment which will be dedicated to supp ort
research in engineering. The equipment will be used for several research
projects, including in particular: (1) Research on High Speed Local Area
Networks Using Ultrashort Light Pulses. This project seeks to demonstrate the
viability of a novel technique for multiplexing together data and other
information over high speed local area (and metropolitan area) networks based on
a new method for manipulation of ultrashort light pulses. This technique could
reduce electronic processing requirements and simplify procedures for network
control for application such as interconnections between supercomputers and
multimedia networking. (2) Research on Holographic Information Storage and
Access Using Ultrashort Light Pulses. This project aims at using specially
encoded, ultrafast light signals for parallel information storage in volume
holographic memories. This project could contribute tot improved utilization and
simplified operation of holographic data storage systems with tremendous
potential storage capacities. ************
