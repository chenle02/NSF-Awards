Cryptography often fails to impact practice because it is insensitive to the
requirements and reality of the systems that implement and underlie it. This
research aims to change this. Issues considered include legacy (changing the
complex computer systems that make up today's world is expensive and error-
prone, so assessing the security of existing methods can be more important than
providing new ones), malware (system penetration is widespread, exposing the
keys that cryptography relies on for security) and the realities of randomness
(it lacks in practice the quality expected in theory, dooming many cryptographic
schemes). Work to be done includes assessment of the security of SSL encryption
in the face of widespread system compromise, technically known as selective
opening; analysis of the PKCS#1 standard for password-based key derivation;
design of hedged encryption schemes that retain as much security as possible
when the randomness they are fed is of poor quality; and the study and design of
cryptography secure against related-key attacks. The impact of this work is
higher assurance for existing, deployed cryptography currently used by millions,
and new cryptography that is well-placed to transition into real systems.
