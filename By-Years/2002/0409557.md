Proposal ID: 0409557&lt;br/&gt;PI: Boedo, Stephen&lt;br/&gt;Organization:
Rochester Institute of Technology&lt;br/&gt;Title: Wear investigation of
compliant microbearing systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
pertains to the fabrication and testing of novel compliant microbearing systems
as a means of alleviating stiction, seizure, and high wear observed in current
rotating micromachinery components. The primary focus of the project is to
exploit structural compliance to enhance microbearing system performance, with
surface coatings being a secondary concern. This project is expected to form a
framework to lead researchers into combining more complex bearing structures
with particular surface coatings. The proposed test bearing is comprised of a
free rotor with compliant surfaces that rotates about a fixed, rigid hub through
the action of an external air jet. Computational studies have indicated that a
rotor comprised of a compliant bearing surface has substantially higher load
capacity than that obtained with a conventional rigid rotor. Particular emphasis
of the project is to develop a reliable and repeatable fabrication method and
test protocol to understand the effects of elasticity, surface roughness, load,
and speed on microbearing surface wear. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual
merit of the project will lead to the development of reliable MEMS-based
microturbine, micropump, and microactuator components that can be readily
integrated into larger micropower and lab-on-chip systems. The broader impact of
the project will be accomplished through tribology-based laboratory sessions
aimed at under-represented groups in the Rochester area, along with integration
of research results into a multidisciplinary and graduate microsystems
curriculum being developed at RIT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
