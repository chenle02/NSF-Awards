Chemistry (12) We are integrating early undergraduate, interdisciplinary student
research into our first semester general chemistry lab and introductory geology
courses. This research centers on the study of environmental problems/concerns
in our area. We are using ion chromatography and inductively coupled plasma mass
spectrometry (ICP-MS) to study both general drinking water quality and lead
contamination of soil, the latter being a documented and serious problem in the
city of Omaha. The project is vertically integrated into the department so that
students in the upper division chemistry courses have an ongoing role in
developing new research questions and projects for use in the introductory
courses. In addition to improving the quality of the upper division laboratory
experience, this serves to promote significant student mentoring interactions
within the department.

The goals of the project are to: 1) improve the crucial first impressions that
students form about science at this level; 2) increase the number of chemistry
and geology majors; 3) increase student independence, responsibility, and self-
motivation; 4) increase retention of students in introductory chemistry and
geology courses; and 5) increase the quantity and curricular relevance of
science studied by pre-service teachers.
