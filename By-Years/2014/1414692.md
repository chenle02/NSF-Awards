This project is to create a specialty symposium titled Weather Radar and
Hydrology (WRaH). This symposium will discuss the rapid advances in radar-based
estimation of precipitation contributing to the improvement of understanding the
state-of-the-art precipitation processing tools and products. It is expected to
shed light on several issues of radar-based precipitation products which
include: 1) Enhancements in radar-based precipitation processing algorithms
resulting in improved precipitation products; 2) Bias correction methods for
radar-based precipitation; 3) emerging tools to incorporate precipitation
products in distributed hydrologic modeling efforts, 4) precipitation products
that can be made available for real-time applications, 5) new approaches to
rainfall-based hydrologic design standards utilizing historical radar rainfall
data and 6) lessons learned from national and international experiences of use
of radar data for variety of applications. The economic drivers of radar-
rainfall technology are important to the US and, eventually, the world economy.
This symposium activity will lead to improved hydrologic design standards
derived from radar rainfall data and create economic development opportunities
for many agencies.
