PI: Machedon DMS-9501096 Machedon will study questions of well-posedness of
various nonlinear wave equations. In particular, the question of existence,
uniqueness and regularity under minimal assumptions of regularity of the data is
addressed. These questions are approached using the new kind of smoothing
estimates developed by the investigator and S. Klainerman. Partial differential
equations form a basis for mathematical modeling of the physical world. The role
of mathematical analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is to
provide qualitative and quantitative information about the solutions. This may
include answers to questions about uniqueness, smoothness and growth. In
addition, analysis often develops methods for approximation of solutions and
estimates on the accuracy of these approximations.
