9403458 Zweifel The Wigner Poisson System of equations describes electron
plasmas in a regime where quantum effects are important, for example semi-
conductor devices including field-effect transistors, Josephson junctions,
hetero-junctions, quantum "dots" and the like. A self- consistent field approach
is employed leading to pseudo-differential equations which in the classical
limit tend to the ordinary Vlasov- Poisson system. The problem we propose to
study includes existence and uniqueness of solutions, their regularity and
asymptotic properties and developement of numerical methods appropriate to the
treatment of practical devices, as well as studies of the classical limiting
procedure. The studies to be carried out under this proposal are intended to
lead to an understanding of methods applicable to many practical systems of
interest in physics and engineering, especially systems of small size, because
that is where quantum effects become important. Another important facet of our
work will be to develop methods for obtaining quantum corrections to systems
which are quasi-classical in nature, since such calculations will provide great
economy in computer time and cost, vis-a-vis a full quantum description. Such
calculations have been carried out by some researchers, but without any proof or
even reasonable grounds to believe that such a procedure is mathematically
valid.
