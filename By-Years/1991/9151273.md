A Laboratory/Classroom for Computational MathematicsA laboratory/classroom is
being equipped with 20 IBM-55SX computers for use in a range of upper division
mathematics courses serving the needs of engineering, science, and mathematics
students. The laboratory, together with an additional classroom equipped with
computer and projection panel, is providing an environment in which computing
becomes a natural part of the instructional process. Students are learning to
use the computer not only as a numerical engine to solve problems, but as a
mathematical resource which they can exploit to enhance their own understanding.
