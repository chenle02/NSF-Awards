/&gt;The Princeton-CEFRC Summer School on Combustion is part of the outreach
program of the Combustion Energy Frontier Research Center (CEFRC), established
by DOE in 2009. The week-long school, scheduled for June 23-28, 2013 on
Princeton University Campus, offers courses on Combustion Theory, Combustion
Chemistry, Quantitative Diagnostics for Combustion Chemistry and Propulsion, and
Computational Turbulent Combustion. After-class sessions are also scheduled to
enhance the experience of the students. The proposed funding is to provide
partial support to students who will be participating in the Summer School.
