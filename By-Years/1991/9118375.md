This research is designed to document a high-precision record of terrestrial
responses to the widespread and rapid ocean/atmosphere reorganization in and
around the North Atlantic Ocean during the Younger Dryas Chronozone of the last
deglaciation (11,000-10,000 years ago). The chronology and rates of change in
vegetation and association climate during the Younger Dryas will be documented
for land areas adjacent to the late-glacial Loch Lomond ice sheet over the
Scottish Highlands. An AMS 14C chronology of changing paleo-vegetation will be
used to document the timing of terrestrial biotic responses as a kind of
bioassay for the rapid reorganization of the North Atlantic. In turn, lags in
growth and dissipation of the ice sheet will be determined and cross- calibrated
with the climate record from Scotland, Ireland and the North Atlantic. Results
of this work will define the boundary conditions needed to develop and test
several numerical models of growth and response of ice-sheet to major, abrupt,
and transient climate shifts of the past and future. One such model of ice-sheet
dynamics will be developed and tested as part of the project.
