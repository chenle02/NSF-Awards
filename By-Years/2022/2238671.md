The recent revolution in advanced analytics and machine learning gave rise to a
growing demand among organizations for high-value data. However, obtaining
sufficient volumes of such data is challenging in many areas because most high-
value data is sensitive, and is owned by and split across multiple
organizations. Organizations often cannot share the data they own due to privacy
concerns, regulatory policies, and/or business competition. A promising solution
is secure multiparty computation (MPC), a cryptographic technique that allows
organizations to run complex computations on their joint dataset without
revealing sensitive inputs to other parties. Unfortunately, developing efficient
protocols remains a labor-intensive process that requires cryptographic
expertise and is out of reach for most users and developers. The project's
broader significance and importance are to accelerate and democratize the
adoption of MPC by designing and building an end-to-end, integrated compiler-
runtime framework that automatically generates and executes optimized, workload-
specific MPC protocols. The projectâ€™s novelties are to build such a framework by
developing and combining new insights from compilers, cryptography, and
distributed systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team of researchers
plan to address the research question in three broad thrusts. The first thrust
develops the foundation of the platform by supporting a basic compilation
infrastructure that is extensible to a wide variety of MPC primitives. The
second thrust designs novel techniques for the compiler to generate workload-
specific MPC protocols for user-provided high-level programs. The third thrust
creates a new distributed runtime for efficiently executing and scheduling MPC
protocols that are generated using techniques from Thrust 2. The team is
planning to open source the framework for other researchers and educators, and
is working to create new graduate courses and outreach programs to make research
more accessible to undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
