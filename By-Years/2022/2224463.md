Computational approaches have sparked several advancements in healthcare. The
promise of precision medicine hinges on the ability to perform a vast amount of
computations at very high performance. Many research efforts have explored
hardware/software innovations customized for genomic analysis. However, novel
custom hardware (aka accelerators) for genomic analysis has not had much if any
commercial success. A key factor in this limited commercial success is the high
cost of a large custom chip that is produced at relatively low volume. On the
other hand, the popularity and success of artificial intelligence (AI) has
resulted in a much larger market for AI chips, and a range of commercially
available chips for AI. The key research question being answered in this project
is: can the success of AI and AI hardware be leveraged to advance performance
and efficiency for small-market domains? This project attempts to answer this
question for the healthcare domain with a focus on two emerging workloads -
Computational Pathology and Genomic Analysis. It will also develop software
infrastructure for the community, augment educational curricula, and help grow a
diverse, well-trained workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will pursue
the following novel approach: bootstrap accelerators for emerging domains on
existing hardware accelerators for AI. In particular, it explores an AI+X
approach, where the hardware is designed to handle AI workloads and another
small-market workload X (in this project, X will be either Computational
Pathology or Genomic Analysis). The project aspires to design accelerator chips
that can be produced at high volume for both AI and healthcare domains, while
nearly matching the efficiency of accelerators dedicated exclusively for AI or
exclusively for healthcare. The project will design a configurable architecture
that provides high flexibility, high efficiency, and low cost. It will explore
algorithm re-structuring to fully exploit the capabilities of AI+X hardware.
This includes techniques to alleviate the memory bottleneck, identify optimal
mapping of software to hardware, and transform compute kernels into easily-
accelerated tensor operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
