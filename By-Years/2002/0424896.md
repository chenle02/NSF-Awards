The Visualization Center at Scripps Institute of Oceanography will be used as a
visualization laboratory for the creation, collection and distribution of a
library of visual objects which can be thought of as building blocks that will
form the foundation for virtual 3-D models. These models will be archived and
made available via a high-bandwidth, web-based ftp site, along with the required
freeware. &lt;br/&gt;
