Formal verification covers a wide range of technologies that are widely studied
in academia and routinely used in industry. Any acceleration in the diffusion of
knowledge about these techniques will lead to superior technology, better users,
and exciting and far-reaching applications. This grant will organize the Summer
School on Formal Techniques for students to learn about cutting-edge techniques
in formal modeling and verification. The lectures are rigorous and will cover
the spectrum of formal techniques including static analysis, model checking,
theorem proving, invariant generation, compositional verification, security and
systems biology. The lectures will be supported by hands-on laboratories.
Attendees at the school discuss their own research ideas and interact closely
with both the lecturers and other students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The previous
summer schools have had a significant broad impact in terms of imparting
theoretical knowledge as well as practical skills to the students from many
different research areas. These summer schools have been received
enthusiastically by the participants, and helped develop a well-knit community
of young researchers. The lectures, software tools, and other course material
are available from the previous summer school web sites.
