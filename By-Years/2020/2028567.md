As policy makers work to avert catastrophic health and economic outcomes due to
COVID 19, they are struggling with a difficult question: What makes expert
knowledge credible, legitimate, and reliable for use in public policy? That
question is especially urgent since national and regional authorities are facing
scientific uncertainty and fast-moving events that cross geopolitical borders,
and the need for quick action stands in tension with the need to ground policy
in robust expert knowledge and convincing analysis. Ways of identifying
trustworthy sources of expertise is essential, but they remain largely vested in
governments with their differing institutions, research traditions, cultural
commitments, and civic beliefs. The PIs will conduct a multi-sited investigation
in ten regions that will capture detailed information about the COVID 19 crisis
as it unfolds, and then conduct a rigorous comparative analysis to provide a
better understanding of the relationship between expertise and trust, a
critically important nexus for policy makers in an era of decentralized
information and polarized politics. Effective dissemination of results to
critical policy analysts and policy communities is key to the success of this
project. To achieve this goal, the PIs will utilize the extensive connections
that they and their collaborative partners have to science policymakers and
national and international organizations.

The PIs have assembled a team of research partners, well established STS
scholars in ten regions, who have agreed to participate in the project. This
team will collect and analyze publications and public documents pertaining to
COVID-19 policy making in each region. These materials will provide the basis
for STS-based accounts of knowledge and policymaking in each region for the
comparisons that are central to this project. To provide that account, they will
build a basic policy timeline tracking key events and decisions in each regionâ€™s
response to the pandemic. Tracking these moves will enable them to document
change and analyze variations in how issues are framed and evidence is gathered.
They will also collect information on uncertainties (such as scope and
limitations of scientific knowledge) and controversies, with a focus on the most
contentious aspect of coronavirus policy in each region. In addition, they will
track carefully chosen objects as they are incorporated into policy discussions.
Such objects include particularly influential epidemiological and epistemic
models, widely circulated visual representations, key policy concepts, and
knowledge claims about the availability, effectiveness, and future prospects of
medical interventions.
