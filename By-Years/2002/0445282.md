Photosynthesis causes small increases in atmospheric O2 and concomitant small
decreases in atmospheric CO2, and decomposition reverses this process. Because
the terrestrial biosphere leaves an atmospheric imprint of its activities,
fluctuations in atmospheric gases can be used to infer the behavior of the
biosphere. Key to interpreting this behavior is the oxidative ratio (OR) of the
organic carbon that is created by photosynthesis: that is, the ratio of O2
released to CO2 consumed during photosynthesis. This value is commonly assumed
to be about 1.07, but early results show that natural variability in oxidative
ratio can be large. Small changes in the terrestrial biosphere's oxidative
ratio, on the order of 0.02 units, would cause a major change in our
understanding of carbon and oxygen fluxes between the atmosphere, biosphere, and
ocean. The goal of this grant is to make the first detailed measurements of an
ecosystem's oxidative ratio. Our field site, Kellogg Biological Station in
southwest Michigan, contains a series of sites which will allow us to compare
ecosystem oxidative ratio over a range of land uses typical of much of the U.S.
