This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry with an
emphasis on bioelectrochemistry. During the tenure of this three-year grant,
Professor Chambers will investigate the possibility of electrochemical
communication with polynucleotides or, more specifically, the purine and
pyrimidine groups buried within polynucleotides. The experimental techniques
will include the use of modified electrodes and laser-induced fluorescence
spectroelectro- chemistry. Dr Chambers will design an organic salt electrode
that responds to DNA through intercalation or hydrogen-bonding interactions. He
will also develop electrochemical tags for DNA and other polynucleotides similar
to fluorescent tags currently used for spectroscopic investigations. %%%
Professor Chambers and his students will investigate the possibility of
electrochemical communication with DNA and other polynucleotides by developing
novel, modified electrodes and electrochemical tags similar to spectroscopic
tags in common use today. The proposed method for the analysis of DNA and
polynucleotides may give rise to bioanalytical techniques with broad
applications in clinical chemistry and biotechnology.
