9421888 Laughlin A theoretical study will be made of the microscopic quantum
mechanics of high temperature superconductors using a strategy that emphasizes
experimental phenomenology over first principles computation. The goals of the
work are to reconcile the enormous number of experimental facts in this field
with one another, to prioritize these facts, to distinguish genuinely new
physical behavior from that due to sample imperfection, and to motivate
significant new experiments. This approach reflects the view that the important
new physical ideas in this field have already been articulated, and that the
task is now to distinguish among them in the laboratory. Theory must be involved
in this process because the evidence of new physics is subtle and is often found
in the inconsistencies between one experiment and another. Also, it has now
become evident that experimental confusion tends not to clear up by itself in
this field. Some specific computations for magnetic Hamiltonians are also
proposed as is some further investigation into the properties of superconducting
states that violate time-reversal symmmetry. This is a natural extension of work
on anyon superconductivity performed on the previous grant. %%% A program of
theoretical research on high temperature superconductivity will be undertaken
which emphasizes interpreting existing experimental results and building on
these to create new models and suggesting new experiments. ***
