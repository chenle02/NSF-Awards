9317673 Grunow This award supports a paleomagnetic study of lower Paleozoic
rocks in the central Transantarctic Mountains. The objective is to obtain
paleomagnetic poles from Cambrian and Ordovician-Silurian rocks ( 540 to 410 Ma)
to establish an early Paleozoic apparent polar wander path (APWP) for East
Antarctica. This APWP will be used for 1) constraining the position East
Antarctica in Gondwana and thereby testing the possibility of a loop in the
existing APWP for Gondwana, 2) providing a baseline for testing the possibility
of allochthonous terranes in the Transantarctic Mountains, 3) evaluating the
possibility of movement between different parts of East Antarctica, and 4)
testing tectonic models of the amalgamation and fragmentation of Gondwana. ***
