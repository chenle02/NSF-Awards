Respiration in insects is characterized by prolonged periods (in some cases up
to several hours) in which no exchange of gases occurs and this pattern differs
strongly from respiratory patterns in most mammals in which breath-holding is
restricted to seconds or, at most, a few minutes. This research project will
examine the relationship between metabolic rate and respiratory pattern in three
representative insect species. Temperature, feeding, and atmospheric oxygen will
be systematically varied as a means of producing varying ratios of metabolic
output to oxygen availability. Under these controlled conditions, the pattern of
respiration will be examined using flow-through respirometry. Release of carbon
dioxide and water will be measured on a second-to-second basis. Specifically,
this research will test the hypothesis that the critical factor in insect
respiratory control is the regulation of internal oxygen levels as opposed to
the reduction of water loss. The research will be conducted in conjunction with
a graduate student engaged in her doctoral research, and with undergraduate
students participating in the University of California, Irvine Excellence in
Research program. Insects have major negative impacts on human society as
vectors of disease and as destroyers of our food crops. The respiratory system
of insects is both anatomically and physiologically distinct from that of
mammals. As such, it is an excellent target for improved and safer insect
control mechanisms. The proposed research will investigate how environmental
factors impact the regulation and control of breathing in insects. The results
should be of use in our ongoing attempts to disrupt insect breathing and
metabolism as a means of controlling insect pests.
