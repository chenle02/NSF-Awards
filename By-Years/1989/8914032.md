This fundamental engineering research should produce a new technology for
cognitive rehabilitation. An intelligently controlled device will be fabricated
for persons with cognitive impairments. This instrument will be able to analyze
a patient's arm movements, distinguish between good and poor performance, then
guide the person in making a more appropriate response. This device will be able
to guide the person through unlearned and strongly guided motions to well-
learned and non-guided motions. This new technology should be a valuable aid to
persons who have had stroke, head trauma or other cognitive disabilities.
