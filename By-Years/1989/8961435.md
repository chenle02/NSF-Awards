This award will develop a family of novel optical devices based on optically
addressed spatial light modulators employing polarization selective reflectors.
These devices can exhibit optical bistability at very low light levels, hence
should be useful for a wide variety of optical processing applications,
including memory. The proposed devices will combine our already demonstrated
high performance spatial light modulators with reflectors made from circularly
dichroic thin films of cholesteric liquid crystal polymer. The cholesteric
liquid crystal polymer is intensely circularly dichroic, potentially cheap, and
durable enough to make readily formed free-standing films. Furthermore its
optical properties are virtually temperature insensitive. In phase I of our
proposed SBIR work, we will synthesize a previously demonstrated cholesteric
liquid crystal polymer and form a circularly dichroic thin film reflector. In
phase II our proposed work, we will modify a Displaytech optically addressed
spatial light modulator by sandwiching the circular dichroic reflector between
photosensing layer and the refractive layer. We will also develop the
cholesteric liquid crystal polymer into a useful optical material for optical
material for optical isolators, durable laser blocking filters, and dichroic
mirror coatings.
