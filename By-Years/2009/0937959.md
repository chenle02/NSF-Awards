The Wisconsin Hierarchically-Redundant, Decoupled storage project (HaRD)
investigates the next generation of storage software for hybrid Flash/disk
storage clusters. The main objective of the project is to improve the
performance of storage in a variety of diverse scenarios, including new
application environments such as photo storage as found in Facebook and Flickr,
high-end scientific processing as found in government labs, and large-scale data
processing such as that found in Google and Microsoft. The HaRD project focuses
on three key issues in order to improve performance of these important
applications: client-side Flash-based RAID and file-system integration, server-
side memory reduction and multicore scheduling of file-system tasks, and
scheduled network transfers. HaRD pulls together these technologies into a
synthesized whole through three targeted storage systems: a scalable photo
server, a high-performance checkpoint subsystem, and an improved file system for
MapReduce workloads. The impact of this project is significant, as HaRD helps to
shape the storage software architecture of the next generation of cloud
computing services, which are of increasing relevance to both industry and
society at large.
