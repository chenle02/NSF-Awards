With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Bacic plans to develop methodologies for the accurate
quantum mechanical treatment of rotating, vibrating molecules. Accurate quantum
descriptions of various static and dynamic properties of highly rovibrationally
excited floppy molecules will be developed, with emphasis on strong coupling
between the high-J rotation and anharmonic large amplitude vibrations for three-
and four-atom molecules. Also to be performed are quantum studies of laser-
induced isomerization in realistic multi-mode systems, by following the time
evolution of the initial state, and a quantum 3D treatment of the
photodissociation of highly vibrationally excited triatomic molecules.
