This project is a conference sponsored by the Society for Industrial and
Applied Mathematics on mathematics applicable to the automation of design,
manufacturing, and assembly. The conference will focus on mathematical
developments in geometric modeling and the design and programming of robots, two
areas where the progress being made is leading to substantial improvements in
productivity. To advance the interaction of experts in these areas, the
conference will focus on: (1) Computer-based representations and manipulation of
surfaces and solids. (2) Robotics. (3) Computational geometry. (4) Mathematics
of computer vision, e.g. identification of objects by shape, orientation, etc.
(5) Tiling problems. The conference will provide an opportunity for engineering
designers, robotics researchers, computational geometers, and other
mathematicians to become aware of common research problems.
