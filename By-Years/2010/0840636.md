The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN is the world?s energy frontier
accelerator and together with the associated largest detectors ever constructed,
will allow for the probing of the seminal questions in high energy physics. This
proposal will provide a unique opportunity for early career graduate students
involved in the ATLAS experiment at the LHC to be involved at CERN for the start
of data taking. About ten high qualified students per year (a new set of
approximately ten for each of three years) will be selected to receive travel
awards affording them the opportunity to be present at CERN during the early
running of the LHC, which is expected to start operations in the Fall of 2008.
It is necessary for a complete education for graduate students that they be able
to have hands-on experience in the operation of the experiment, and these
prestigious travel awards will assure that the very best students from NSF core
program funded institutions are able to have this once in a lifetime
experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With regard to broader impact, the recipients
of these awards will also further the goals of recognizing and attracting
underrepresented groups to the sciences, fostering international exchange, and
bringing the excitement of cutting edge scientific research to a younger
generation as they bring back their experiences to their campuses, interact with
undergraduates in REU programs and with high school students and teachers in
QuarkNet and other programs. &lt;br/&gt;
