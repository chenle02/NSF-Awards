9725887 McLean PROJECT: Seeing: The Interaction of Physiology, Culture, and The
Exploratorium will develop a 6000 sq. f.t exhibit Seeing: The Interaction of
Physiology, Culture, and Technology . As the first exhibit and program
development project of their multiyear initiative "Refocusing on the Floor,"
this permanent exhibit will consist of approximately 60 new and redesigned
exhibits organized into six sections: Seeing Central, Light and Images, Process
of Seeing, Seeing Things Differently, Extending Our Vision, and Deconstructing
What We See. Visitors will develop their skills at seeing, noticing, and visual
thinking, will become more conscious of visual information in daily life, be
exposed to current research on vision and visual cognition, be given
opportunities to investigate the social and cultural influences on seeing, and
be lead to the realization that seeing, interpreting, and understanding visual
information are basic to the conduct of science. New partnerships will be
developed with community-based organizations that will promote new audiences for
the Exploratorium as well as enhance the viewpoints of the participating staff
members. The activities will address the National Science Standards in terms of
the process skills that are identified and will reintroduce visual thinking
skills into the activities linking the exhibit with the formal education's
curriculum. Additional workshops and professional dissemination activities will
be included in the overall project.
