On Election Day, poll workers must operate a complex system composed of people,
processes, and technology. Even minor mistakes in the operation of the system
can lead to security failures, which could in turn lead to the wrong candidates
being selected. However, pollworkers are generally not technically astute,
receive minimal training, are not attuned to systems and security issues, and
are prone to making security mistakes that endanger elections, especially
towards the end of the day due to worker fatigue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project studies how poll workers manage voting technology at the opening and
closing of polls on Election Day in an effort to understand the impact poll
workers have on voting system security. In particular, it will examine what
kinds of common security problems do poll workers encounter in opening/closing
the polls; why do these problems seem to occur and their likely causes; and if
there are particular points in poll/opening/closing where poll workers are more
likely to encounter security issues or make mistakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project reveals opportunities for deeper investigation of security gaps in poll
workers? setting up and shutting down the polls that may be remedied by better
design of procedures, job aids, training and content available in the polling
place.
