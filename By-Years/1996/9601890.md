*** 9601890 Rudolph This grant will provide partial support for the development
of a short pulse (2 psec), high power (10 TW) laser facility at the University
of New Mexico. This facility will be at the edge of current technology, and will
support a broad experimental program in atomic and optical physics, condensed
matter physics, and biological imaging. ***
