&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Swedish
icebreaker Oden provides an unprecedented opportunity to sample the sea ice
microbial community in a region of the Antarctic ice pack that has received very
little attention to date. The research will examine the microbial community
throughout the large expanse of sea ice that is located between the
Bellingshausen Sea and the Ross Sea, Antarctica. The project will 1)
characterize the spatial variability in the sea ice microbial community
composition and, where possible, relate it to the community composition observed
in the water column, 2) measure the biomass, photophysiology and metabolic rates
of the ice algal community and relate these to physicochemical conditions within
the pack ice, 3) use underway sampling to make continuous measurements of
climatically important gases such as carbon dioxide and dimethyl sulfide to
identify and discretely sample "hot spots" within the pack ice where microbial
processes have altered the ambient concentrations of these gases, and 4) use
molecular tools to determine phytoplankton responsible for carbon dioxide uptake
and dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) production and to what extent physical and
chemical factors control these processes by examining expression of target genes
in the carbon dioxide uptake and DMSP production pathways. Scientists will work
with Stanford's Summer Program for Professional Development for Science Teachers
(http://pangea.stanford.edu/outreach/about/index.html) and participate in
Stanford's School of Earth Sciences high school internship program. The project
also will be used as a teaching tool to inform the public, in part by publishing
a teaching module about primary producers and the Antarctic ecosystem.
