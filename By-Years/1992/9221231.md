Preliminary excavations in Southeastern China by this productive young
principal investigator and his colleagues have yielded very exciting fossil
remains of a number of heretofore unknown primate (and other mammalian) species
from the Eocene. This is an entirely new biogeographic region, and the project
holds out the promise of providing a critical piece of the story of early
primate evolution. This project will now be expanded in scope and intensity.
