Targeted acceleration of functionality in hardware has shown great promise to
bring in orders of magnitude improvement in computational capability for a broad
range of applications such as artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, web
search, and virtual reality. However, it is incredibly time consuming and costly
to manually design a hardware accelerator that is both high performance and
easily programmable for software. This project aims to develop new design
automation framework that can automatically generate a high-quality programmable
accelerator from architecture specifications defined in a software program.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project builds on the recent advances in high-level
synthesis, which is capable of compiling un-timed behavioral specifications into
cycle-accurate register-transfer-level circuits. In contrast to conventional
high-level synthesis approaches, the proposed framework generates domain-
specific instruction-programmable accelerators as opposed to application-
specific fixed-function hardware. This research provides a new class of hardware
synthesis infrastructure that integrates domain-specific languages,
combinatorial optimization algorithms, and data-driven machine learning
capabilities to achieve high quality of results on par with those produced by
human experts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
