9523528 Wang US-PRC Earthquake Protocol Research Exchange: Delegation Visit
International cooperative research with other countries has produced cost-
effective and fruitful results to mitigate earthquake hazards. In the spirit and
in consideration of past involvement of the US-China Earthquake Engineering
Program, meetings and coordinated visits are organized for an official Chinese
Earthquake Engineering Research Delegation in August 1995. The Chinese
delegation is assembled by the Chinese Ministry of Construction, NSF's
counterpart in Annex III of the US-PRC Earthquake Protocol, which was just
officially extended for five more years until January 23, 2000. This project is
supported as a part of the Agreement of Annex III to the U.S./P.R.C. Protocol
for Scientific and Technical Cooperative Research Earthquake Studies on
earthquake engineering and hazards mitigation for the purpose of international
cooperative exchange. ***
