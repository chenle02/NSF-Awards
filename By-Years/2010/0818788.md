Animal behavior is driven by interconnected circuits of nerve cells in the brain
and the spinal cord. Although diversification of these networks through
evolutionary history has led to the incredible range of behaviors we observe in
animals today, little work has been done to address the fundamental question:
How do neural circuits evolve? One way in which neural circuits may change is
through the addition of new nerve cells to the brain and their subsequent
incorporation into functional networks. This research uses the startle neural
circuit of fish to explore the effects of adding new nerve cells to circuits.
The startle circuit is advantageous to use as a case study for examining
mechanisms for changing circuits because it includes relatively few and easily
identified nerve cells and controls a discrete and well-described behavior. New
startle neurons will be genetically introduced into the hindbrain. Physiological
recordings and laser ablation techniques will be used to examine the role
specific cells play in the animal?s behavior. It is hypothesized that while new
nerve cells make some connections into preexisting circuits other connections
will be restricted and that redundancy of function within circuits may act to
mask aberrant nerve cell activity, preventing it from disrupting behaviors. By
investigating how new nerve cells integrate into simple neural circuits in the
brain, this research will provide a case study for understanding principles by
which circuits may be modified through evolution and insight into the
flexibility for and constraints on such changes. The broader impact of this
proposal includes outreach to middle school girls in disadvantaged areas of the
south side of Chicago through activities in schools and in the research
laboratory. In addition, this proposed research will involve undergraduates and
graduate students, providing opportunities for training in a diverse array of
scientific approaches and methodologies.
