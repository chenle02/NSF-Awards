The American Association for Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) Fall Series
Symposium (FSS) is the first international gathering in North America in the
field of computational aspects of affective narrative, bringing together
participants from a long list of contributing disciplines. One of the aims of
the Symposium is to attract students to a new and exciting multidisciplinary
area, where it is still easier to attract the experts' attention and mentoring.
The goal of this grant is to subsidize travel, registration fees, and housing
expenses of students selected to participate in the Symposium which will be
held, along with several other AAAI Fall Symposia, on November 2-4, 2012, in
Arlington, VA. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Symposium calls for long and short
papers both from leaders in the field of computational aspects of affective
narrative and pertinent areas and from graduate students as well as poster
presentations from the undergraduate students interested in the subject. Papers
from undergraduates, attracted through Research Experience for Undergraduates
(REU) and Senior Research Opportunity Program (SROP) networks as well as solo
graduate contributions will be carefully mentored to the level of poster or
short paper eligibility. The multi-format program of the Symposium will also
accommodate special student sessions, especially for promising but not fully
developed ideas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The AAAI FSS Symposium on computational
aspects of affective narrative provides a valuable opportunity for the next
generation of multidisciplinary researchers in a variety of pertinent
disciplines to enter the computational affective narrative research community.
It is expected that the Symposium will attract underrepresented populations as
well as provide benefit to future development of computational systems from
better understanding of affective narrative as the inherently human phenomenon.
