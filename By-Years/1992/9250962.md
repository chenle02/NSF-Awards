The goal of the project is to introduce more hands-on laboratory activity in the
areas of ecology and plant science. The study of the causes for variation in
organisms is a fundamental aspect of ecology and an essential step for
understanding the process of natural selection. Students will conduct
experiments in which they evaluate the causes for biological variation. These
causes are either environmental or genetic variation, or a combination of each.
Biochemical traits, such as enzyme activity, vary much like other aspects of
organisms but can be measured accurately and quantitatively. Students will raise
given strains of bacteria, plants and insects in two different set of
environmental conditions, and different strains or subpopulations in a given
environmental condition using water baths, plant growth chambers and biological
incubators. Spectrophometry is used to assay the activity of specific
biochemical systems from each organism. When students find that enzyme variation
has a significant genetic component, an additional evaluation of protein
polymorphism is conducted by means of protein electrophoresis.
