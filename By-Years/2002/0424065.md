Title: Forward and Inverse Modeling of Rupture Dynamics in Three Dimensions

PI: Kim Olsen, Institute for Crustal Studies, University of California at Santa

The proposed research is an integrated approach to significantly advance our
knowledge in the field of earthquake rupture dynamics. The work consists of
three parts. The first part is the development of a method for flexible and
efficient modeling of dynamic rupture propagation on curved or multi-segmented
fault geometries with radiation in a laterally and vertically heterogeneous
three-dimensional medium and accurate boundary conditions. This method will
allow fully large-scale dynamic modeling of the statistics of recurrent ruptures
on systems of arbitrarily-shaped faults. Here, we will combine the most flexible
and efficient features of several numerical methods. The second part is a
continuation of ongoing efforts on defining the critical parameters and
conditions describing when dynamic rupture start, propagate, and stop. This
involves an analysis of the variation of dynamic rupture velocity in a
heterogeneous stress field and in particular, deriving expressions for and
numerically estimating the parameters generating rupture propagation in
agreement with observations. The third part will examine the feasibility of
inverting for the friction, stress, or fracture energy, parameters containing
key information about the rupture history, for large earthquakes. We will
describe the limitations and accuracy of the inversion, and attempt to apply the
method to selected large, well-recorded earthquakes. The three parts of the
proposed research all lead towards the ultimate goal of the project, namely to
better our understanding of why do earthquakes start, propagate and arrest. Such
understanding may lead to successful prediction of earthquakes in the future,
thereby mitigating the loss of life and property.
