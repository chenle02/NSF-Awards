This research concerns the development and application of ultra-small
voltammetric electrodes for intracellular determination of easily oxidized
neurotransmitters. One goal of this research is to construct voltammetric
electrodes smaller than those presently used (1-2 um tip diameters). Electrodes
with tip diameters less than 100 nm should be possible to fabricate and can be
used for impaling very small neurons. Electrodes fabricated by hydrocarbon
pyrolysis inside quartz microcapillaries will be used for voltammetry inside the
cell body of the Giant dopamine neuron of Planorbis corneus (pond snail). The
rate of transport into the cell, metabolism and vesicularization of dopamine
will be evaluated on the level of a single cell. In addition, a novel tool for
study of pharmacological effects on total dopamine stores will be developed and
the possibility of dopamine uptake into post-synaptic cell bodies will be
investigated. Primary cultures of rat substantia nigra, locus coeruleus,
hypothalamus and striatum will be carried out. Dissociated neurons in culture
will serve as a model system to investigate the function of neurotransmitter in
the cell body. In addition, the combination of ultra-small voltammetric
electrodes and visible neuronal processes will permit placement of a sensor near
a bundle of terminal fibers with local stimulation of a single axon. Hence,
release of neurotransmitter might be observed from a single neuron. Although
most of the experiments planned concern dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin
will also be examined with respect to their roles in influencing dopamine
neurochemistry. Since the functions of neurotransmitters in neuronal cell bodies
have not been heavily investigated, the experiments here represent a novel
approach to the study of this dimension of neuronal communication.
