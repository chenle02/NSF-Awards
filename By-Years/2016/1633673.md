The efficiency of patent systems has direct effects on the transformation of
innovation from licensing, investment and industrial collaboration. This project
conducts a longitudinal comparison of patent uncertainties (i.e. patenting
delays and granting) and the role that foreign applicants play between the US
and China, the top two patent filing nations in the world. The project compares
and contrasts the treatment toward different types of patent applicants, and
recognizes the relative strengths and weaknesses of patent practices between the
two nations. The findings fill an intellectual void on the theoretical and
empirical understanding of patent internationalization and are relevant for
innovation policy makers and industrial practitioners. Policy recommendations
are provided for resolving international tension and enhancing bilateral
collaboration. Multiple patent data sources are consulted for data triangulation
and to avoid mono-method bias. The research conducts lagged regression modeling,
and multiple equality test comparisons using invention patent data. The
longitudinal investigation of patents, patent offices, and technologies between
the U.S. and China also reveals the changing nature of patent
internationalization over the past 20 years. The new datasets generated from the
statistical modeling are to be made available to relevant stakeholders to
enhance future research.
