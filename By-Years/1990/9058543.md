To develop a deeper understanding of how cracks grow in brittle materials this
research examines the role of microstructural constituents in affecting crack
instability. Fracture toughness, crack velocity, and high strain rate
measurements are combined with systematic variations in the size, shape and
distribution of microstructural constituents. Model materials and commercial
materials are employed in the study with emphasis on metal-matrix materials with
a controlled size distribution of brittle, second- phase precipitates or
dispersoids. A predictive model for fracture toughness as a function of particle
strength, size and distribution should result.
