In this project the principal investigator will study several problems in the
geometry of functions of a complex variable. One of his major goals is to find
simple geometric conditions that can be used to determine if a domain in
Euclidean space supports the Poincare inequality. This work has applications to
the study of boundary value problems for partial differential equations, and it
would provide information on the geometry of univalent mappings of a disk. The
principal investigator will also study the influence of differentiation on the
distribution of zeros of entire functions and problems involving the
integrability of harmonic functions. Many problems involving the properties of
functions of a complex variable can be studied from a geometric point of view,
since such functions are, after all, mappings of the Euclidean plane into
itself. In this project the principal investigator will use various geometric
ideas to study problems in complex variables that relate to the solvability of
boundary value problems, the properties of univalent mappings of a disk and the
integrability of harmonic functions.
