This project is a series of Interdisciplinary Conferences in Applied Mathematics
conducted by the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) over
three years. The conferences are designed to bring together mathematical
scientists, computational scientists, engineers, and applications scientists who
are developing and applying new mathematical concepts, methods, and algorithms.
A successful feature of this series is the inclusion of focused,
interdisciplinary, academic/industry workshops. A new feature is a focus on
workshops to encourage diversity in the mathematical and computational science
workforce. The primary objective of the conferences is to initiate new
interaction among the creators and users of the mathematical and computational
science and thereby contribute to the understanding of mathematics and encourage
its application to problems of society.
