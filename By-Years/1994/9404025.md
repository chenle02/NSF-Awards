9404025 Fowler This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Plant Biology. The applicant received his Ph.D. from University of
California at Berkeley. His Ph.D. research was in developmental genetics in
maize. He now plans to change his field of research and carry out his
postdoctoral fellowship research in the laboratory of Dr. Ralph Quatrano at
University of North Carolina. The proposed research entitled "Mechanism of
establishment of cellular polarity in the brown alga, Fucus" will expand the
scientific experience of this Fellow into basic cell biology.
