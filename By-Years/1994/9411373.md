9411373 Williams This is an award to support International Travel by the
applicant to attend and participate in the 12th CIGR World Congress and AgEng
'94 Conference on Agricultural Engineering to be held in Milano, Italy from
August 29 to September 1, 1994. Conference topics include sessions that deal
with environmentally significant issues in agricultural waste management. The
applicant will present a paper on his work with pollution control and energy
recovery using an anaerobic process for treatment of dairy wastes. Agricultural
wastes are a significant source of pollution to environmental resources of land,
water and air. These wastes are typically a diffuse, non-point source, control
over which is becoming of increasingly greater importance as point sources
become controlled by regulation, minimization and/or treatment systems. Results
of the applicant's participation in this conference are expected to assist in
determining the nature of research that could be applied to addressing pollution
problems posed by agricultural wastes. ***
