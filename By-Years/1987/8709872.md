Ice nucleators, which initiate ice formation at temperatures above those at
which ice formation would normally occur, have become important research topics
in a wide range of scientific disciplines ranging from atmospheric science to
agriculture (crop damage resulting from ice nucleating bacteria) to
cryopreservation. We have studied the biology and biochemistry of blood proteins
with ice nucleator activity that are important components of the ability of
certain insects to survive the freezing of their body fluids. It has been
postulated that the nucleators cause ice formation in the blood prior to ice
formation in the tissue thereby facilitating formation of a supercooled state
within the cells and a prevention of ice crystal formation in the cells. This
project continues those studies and is particularly concerned with blood
lipoproteins produced by freeze tolerant larvae of the cranefly Tipula
trivittata. The major research effort focuses on what makes this lipoprotein an
ice nucleator. The lipoprotein is quite interesting because of certain
similarities in composition with the bacterial ice nucleator which is involved
in serious freeze related damage to certain agricultural crops. Overall, the
results should increase our understanding of the regulation of cold-hardiness
and freeze tolerance in insects.
