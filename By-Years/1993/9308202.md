This award provides 50% funding for the purchase of five Global Positioning
System (GPS) receivers whose use in the field will be shared between the
Principal Investigator and colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and members of the University UNAVSTAR Consortium (UNAVCO). MIT is
committed to providing the remaining funds necessary for this acquisition, and
the UNAVCO consortium is committed to providing maintenance and repair for the
GPS receivers. Since its introduction in the mid-1980s, GPS surveying has become
an indispensable tool for the study of present-day regional tectonics. The
ability to measure directly, with accuracy of a few millimeters per year,
motions of the earth's crust over large distances allows direct observation of
lithosphere plate motions, mountain building, and local deformations due to
earthquakes and volcanos. The MIT group and the UNAVCO consortium will use the
new receivers in a program of field campaigns aimed at a better understanding of
present-day crustal deformation processes.
