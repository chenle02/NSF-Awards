This project investigates three distinct areas. (1) Average case complexity. The
major goal is to enable one to prove the average case hardness of real-life
decision and search problems. The research involves reexaming the basic
definition of average-case reduction and average-case polynomial-time. (2)
Finite model theory. The most challenging question is whether there exists a
logic that captures the notion of polynomial-time on arbitrary (not necessarily
ordered) structures. The PI has conjecture a few year ago that the answer is
negative. The thrust of the research is the question what parts of polynomial
time can be captured by logics. Another direction is extension of the methods of
finite model theory to the study of finite structures with weights in infinite
domains. (3) Abstract state machines. Abstract state machines is a new model of
computation which has been successfully used to specify and verify real-life
algorithms. Here this model is applied to complexity theory and finite model
theory.
