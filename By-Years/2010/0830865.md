Information Science and Systems (33)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project builds
and supports a national community of faculty members to integrate usability and
accessibility in Information Assurance (IA) education. It involves the following
key activities: (1) Development of a set of learning and teaching materials that
allow instructors to effectively integrate usability and accessibility concepts
and strategies in IA courses; (2) Development of an online web portal through
which faculty and community members can access the educational materials,
communicate with each other, and share knowledge and experiences; (3)
Dissemination of the educational materials and the online portal through
conferences and seminars; (4) Development of a faculty team at the partner
institution who can teach usability, accessibility, and IA courses and conduct
research in the related fields; and (5) Development of a research mentorship
program, including community college and junior faculty.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project structure ensures that faculty with different
level of skills and background work in an integrated team and benefit mutually
from the collaboration. The unique distribution method of the online web portal
enables a large body of faculty nationwide to access the lecture materials and
improve their IA courses. &lt;br/&gt;
