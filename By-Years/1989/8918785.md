Two stage stochastic programming problems with recourse have applications in a
wide variety of areas. The principal investigator and his collaborators have
developed a parallel scheme that can take advantage of novel computer
architecture to compute both exact and approximate values and subgradients of
the necessary functions associated with two-stage stochastic programs. Based on
that work the focus of this project is on overall algorithms for two stage
stochastic programs with recourse. Specifically, they propose to develop
decomposition algorithms suited for parallel processing and to integrate the
above schemes for parallel computation of values and subgradients of necessary
functions into implementations of such decomposition algorithms. Progress from
this proposal will result in better algorithms which will provide faster more
accurate results in linear programming appearing in industry and government.
Real life uncertainties will be taken into account by the stochasticity of the
method.
