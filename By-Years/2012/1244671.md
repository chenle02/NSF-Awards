The aim of this project is to convene experts in the social and behavioral
sciences to assess the need for a new nationally representative household
longitudinal study in the United States for better understanding social and
behavioral outcomes and processes. This will be accomplished by convening a
Steering Committee composed of experts from various social and behavioral
science disciplines and specialty areas, who will identify key topical areas of
evaluation and commission scholarly papers on each topical area.  The papers
will be presented and discussed at a commissioned workshop.  A final document
will be produced by the Steering Committee, summarizing themes and lessons from
the workshop and, if deemed appropriate, proposing major design features and
content areas of a new nationally representative household longitudinal study. 
A by-product of the project that will be important for moving forward will be
the development of a community of scholars interested in, and willing to devote
effort to, a new data collection effort of this type.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
significance of this activity is to identify the information content and data
collection methodologies that are needed to understand the dynamic nature of the
economic and social lives of American families.
