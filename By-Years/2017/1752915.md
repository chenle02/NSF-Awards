Bone grafts are commonly used to treat bone defects and enhance fracture repair.
Bone tissue grafts taken from the patient -- autografts -- are the gold
standard, but require a second surgery and are limited in volume. Allografts,
taken from a cadaver, have a fairly high failure rate after 10 years. Tissue
engineered bone grafts hold promise, but have seen limited success due to the
need of bone cells to see mechanical loading during the development and healing
process in order to grow properly. This research project investigates the
combination of hydrogels to encapsulate bone cells with low intensity pulsed
ultrasound to provide controlled mechanical stimulation in order to enhance bone
tissue development. The optimum combination of hydrogel stiffness and acoustic
radiation force level is being determined first, and then the system is being
tested in mice to determine whether or not it is effective for treating a bony
defect when the ultrasound is applied through the skin. The project integrates
students from high school through graduate and medical school into the research
effort and introduces new course content into a biomaterials class.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this research project are to evaluate
the impact in vitro of RGD-modified alginate hydrogel stiffness and low-
intensity pulsed ultrasound derived acoustic radiation force on encapsulated
osteoblast behavior and to assess the efficacy, in vivo, of transdermally
applied acoustic radiation force on osteoblasts encapsulated in an RGD-modified
alginate hydrogel and implanted into a mouse cranial defect. Combinations of
hydrogel stiffness and acoustic radiation force levels are being investigated to
determine the optimum levels for upregulating phenotypic markers and
mineralization of the encapsulated osteoblasts. The optimum system is then being
utilized in a mouse cranial defect model, with ultrasound force applied daily
for 20 minutes a four-week period. The healing of the construct is being
evaluated through histology and histomorphometry.
