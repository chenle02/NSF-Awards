This research group proposes to develop, distribute and support computer-based
instrumentation for the bioacoustics research community. This includes further
development of CANARY (the software package produced during the previous funding
period), analog to digital acquisition hardware, and digital signal processing
hardware designed and produced at Cornell. These components will be integrated
into a fully functional, user-friendly bioacoustics signal analysis workstation
on a Macintosh computer. This system provides a powerful environment for
advanced research in bioacoustics conducted by an active, interdisciplinary
group of scientists with a broad spectrum of expertise in animal communication,
human speech, and signal processing, with particular emphasis on vocal
communication and perception.
