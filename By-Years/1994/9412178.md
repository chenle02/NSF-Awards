This proposal is for funds to purchase additional equipment to augment a present
Ti: Sapphire laser system for applications in a pump/probe and degenerate four
wave mixing (DFWM) configurations. The requested equipment will allow the
development of a picosecond, mode locked laser based diagnostic which would make
it possible to obtain high frequency turbulence statistics, to observe rapid
transient events, and to analyze stability behavior of turbulent combustors
through the measurement of species concentration and temperature on a very short
time scale. The effects of collisions should be minimized.
