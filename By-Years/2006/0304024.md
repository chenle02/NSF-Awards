This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) program entitled, "The Drexel
Nano Engineering Track (DNET)," at Drexel University, under the direction of Dr.
Christopher Li, is jointly funded by the Division of Engineering Education and
Centers, Directorate for Engineering and the Division of Materials Research,
Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences. The primary objective of the
DNET program is to expose freshmen and sophomores in Drexel's College of
Engineering and School of Biomedical Engineering, Science and Health System to
basic concepts in Nanoscale Science, Engineering and Technology (NSET). The DNET
program, together with the existing Nanotechnology Institute, and the
Drexel/UPenn IGERT program, will offer a stream of NSET education from college
through graduate school at Drexel University. The activities will include
updating and revising several freshmen/sophomore courses and introductory
engineering laboratories to infuse NSET into early undergraduate curriculum;
organizing a Nano-frontier Lecture series on scientific and societal impacts of
NSET geared towards undergraduate, senior high school students and teachers for
information dissemination and undergraduate recruitment; and launching a DNET
web resource for information dissemination, performance assessment and outreach
activities.
