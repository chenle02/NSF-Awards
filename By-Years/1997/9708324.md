ABSTRACT EEC-9708324 Ringo The performance of submicron CMOS components like
transistors, resistors and capacitors are usually limited by the parasitic
substrate elements. Past processing micromachining techniques can be employed to
physically remove the cause of some of these parasites. This three-year
continuing award will study the development of micromachining techniques to
enhance the performance of mixed-signal circuits in a submicron CMOS technology.
During the first two years, a set of primitive devices will be developed using
an advanced micromachining process to be performed at the Washington Technology
Center. The devices will be characterized to determine design rules and device
models suitable for mixed-signal circuit simulation. In the second and third
year, primitive circuit blocks will be built to determine reliability and
characterize the improvement in the circuit operation. Research results will
include the design rules and the specification necessary for the two past
processing micromachining techniques developed to eliminate parasitic substrate
elements.
