9634281 Swift In this project, the principal investigators will operate the
International Data Assembly Center (DAC) for hydrographic data collected by the
World Ocean Circulation Experiment. The functions of the DAC are to: 1. Acquire
WOCE Hydrographic Program (WHP) data and related documentation in any readable,
unambiguous format; 2. Carry out data quality control procedures on the data,
and provide usable data to authorized users as quickly as possible; 3. Provide
access to data held by the DAC to authorized users, and to provide publicly
av/ailable data sets to the Special Analysis Center with minimum delay; 4.
Produce final WHP Data Reports for each WHP expedition; 5. Facilitate the
exchange of data among both producers and users; 6. Maintain a complete record
of the status of the WHP measure-ment programs; and, 7. Report to the WOCE and
funding agency oversight structures as recommended.
