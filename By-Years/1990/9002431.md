This project supports mathematical research on problems arising in the study of
dynamical systems and differential equations. The equations are functional
differential equations of retarded type. In certain equations occurring in
biological models, the retardation of memory effect is a natural feature. Work
will focus on four main topics. The first concerns monotone flows on monotone
dynamical systems. Efforts to modify standard systems theory to present a
unified treatment of differential equations for which the set of equilibrium
points contains all (phase space) constant functions will be made. The second
topic relates to instability of physical systems. Applications of invariance
principles of finite delay equations will be made to obtain instability results
for finite and infinite delay functional differential equations. Instability is
characterized by the property that all solutions passing near an unstable point
must leave every neighborhood of the point. Neutral functional differential
equations make up the third element of this project. Work will be done in
establishing comparison-convergence techniques for approximating solutions. The
final goal of the research is that of using monotone iteration techniques to
study periodic boundary value problems for functional differential equations.
Both the existence of periodic solutions and techniques for constructing them
will be considered.
