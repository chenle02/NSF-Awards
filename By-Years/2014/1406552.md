Particles settling to the deep ocean remove carbon and essential trace elements
for biological processes from the surface ocean and contact with the atmosphere
over short time scales. Currently available technology is only able to resolve
this flux at timescales of 24 hours to a few days and the methods are both
labor- and time-intensive. Given the limited spatial and temporal scale of these
flux measurements, it has been difficult to determine the processes that control
the fate of particulate organic carbon (POC). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientists
from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will use an optical, transmissometer-
based method to obtain particle flux observations from autonomous,
biogeochemical profiling floats. Initially, a laboratory-based sensor
calibration experiment will be carried out to determine the detection limit of
the system and evaluate its sensitivity to particle size. This will be followed
by a field effort wherein data obtained from the floats will be compared against
direct sampling from sediment traps. Lastly, the system will be deployed for
about a year in the North Atlantic during which data will be returned via
satellite from the biogeochemical float. This year long deployment will be the
first of its kind to collect nearly-continuous, hourly-resolution proxy
measurements of particle flux. The data is expected to yield new insights into
the factors that influence variability in POC export. A potentially
transformative aspect of this proposal will be the broad application of a newly
developed method that cuts labor and ship costs while generating high resolution
data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Given the components for this system
are readily commercially available means others in the science community have
the opportunity to use this technology to make similar measurements. One postdoc
would be supported and trained as part of this project. In addition,
undergraduate students will be involved in the research via the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution Summer Student Fellow and Minority Fellow program.
