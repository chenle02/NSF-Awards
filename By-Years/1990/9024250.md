To develop a comprehensive theory of microscopic quantum tunneling in magnetic
systems. The study will be linked to ongoing experiments and will include the
calculation of tunneling rates for typical forms of magnetic anisotropy and
typical geometries of experiment, effect of magnetic interactions in an ensemble
of small ferromagnetic particles, tunneling in presence of time dependent
magnetic field, dissipation due to the interaction of the magnetization with
microscopic degrees of freedom,. Also magnetic quantum tunneling in
antiferromagnets and spin glasses and extension of the theory for finite
temperature. Also, the PI will continue research on the correlated spin glass
theory of amorphous magnet. The PI plans to extend the theory for amorphous
systems with several magnetic sub-networks and fluctuating exchange interaction,
to consider a system of densely packed amorphous ferromagnetic particles, and to
study long wavelength spin excitations in the correlated spin glass - reentrant
phase transition.
