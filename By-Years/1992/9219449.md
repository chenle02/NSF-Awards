This research project is a description and analysis of two experimental studies
in visual ethnography: a portrayal of Koyukon Indians (Alaskan Athabascans), and
a comparative study of the reindeer-herding Khanty (Ostyaks) of Western Siberia.
The project addresses issues of cultural representation and the incorporation of
Native perspectives in ethnography, two major themes in anthropology today, and
of great interest to Native Americans. This project also contributes to the
development of Native American education, a national concern and priority.
