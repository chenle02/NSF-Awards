*** 9503117 Liu Multiple scale methods, which are based on reproducing kernel
and wavelet analysis, will be developed. These permit the response of a system
to be separated into different scales. These scales can either be the wave
numbers corresponding to spatial variables or the frequencies corresponding to
temporal variables; and each scale response can be examined separately. This
complete characterization of the unknown response will be performed through the
integral window transform; and a space-scale and time-frequency localization
process is achieved by dilating the flexible multiple scale window function.
These developed methods will be applied to nonlinear dynamics of structures in
particular emphasize on fluid-structure interaction.***
