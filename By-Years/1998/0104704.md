The Cornell Lab of Ornithology (CLO) will develop "Understanding Birds", a suite
of exhibits and related programming in the new environmental science center to
be opened in Sapsucker Woods in 2002. The new building will house the Lab's
research, education, and outreach operations, including the Library of Natural
Sounds, a new Library of Nature Videos, and Cornell's systematic collection of
vertebrates. The building also will include a multi-media-based interactive
Visitors Center providing both real and virtual learning activities for visitors
of all ages, backgrounds and skill levels. Plans for replication of the exhibits
will be made available broadly to museums, nature centers and other
organizations.
