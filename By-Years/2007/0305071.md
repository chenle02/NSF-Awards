This award provides some funding to support a group of junior and senior
undergraduate students during an inter-session course in Oceanography aboard a
UNOLS research vessel making a deadhead transit. This is an experimental program
that will test the feasibility of using UNOLS vessels for such a course. The PI
plans to bring five to ten students aboard the ship during a deadhead transit
from Woods Hole, MA to Fortaleza, Brazil. The students will conduct a sampling
program under the direction of the PI and take intensive coursework in
oceanography. If they are able to successfully complete a course of this type,
the PI anticipates teaching such classes on a regular basis by attempting to
identify appropriate deadhead cruises or working with chief scientists who would
be willing to accommodate a small number of students from other
institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
