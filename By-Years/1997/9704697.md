This work is a two-year effort to develop and apply techniques based on formal
methods to the writing of reliable programs for solving scientific problems on
high-performance parallel computers. Previous work has demonstrated the
practical value of an approach to parallel application development based on (1)
a formally-specified programming model and a development methodology based on
semantics-preserving transformations, and (2) abstractions ("archetypes") that
capture the commonality of classes of programs with similar structure and
encapsulate the details of the parallel code. An important aspect of this work
is that, while it provides a sound theoretical framework for developing and
reasoning about parallel programs, it need not require application developers to
develop formal proofs; once a transformation rule is stated and proved, its
application during program development can be carried out informally. Previous
work by the PI has provided a simple and flexible theoretical framework for
addressing questions of modularity and program composition in parallel programs.
Building on these two areas of work, a theoretical framework is proposed for
reasoning about modularity and composition in parallel programs. The PI will use
this framework to develop techniques that will assist application developers in
writing reliable parallel programs, and will validate the usefulness of these
techniques by applying them to selected real-world applications in computational
science and engineering.
