9708653 Stickney This project, supported by the DMR Electronic Materials and
CHE Analytical and Surface Chemistry programs, addresses electrochemical atomic
layer epitaxy(ECALE) of semiconductor films, as well as the inverse process of
electrochemical digital etching, removal of material a monolayer at a time
through control of electrochemical potential. The approach employs UHV surface
analysis techniques to identify and investigate surface limited reactions. The
structure and composition of surfaces resulting from electrochemical surface
limited processes will be investigated as a function of relevant conditions such
as the potential and solution composition. One of the important thrusts of the
research is to follow the evolution of defects, atomic layer by atomic layer.
%%% This project represents innovative, forefront research in a unique topical
area of materials science having high potential for technological relevance. The
research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental
level to important aspects of electrochemistry and to the control of new
deposition and etching processes with advantages of reduced temperature
operation, and processing of electronic/photonic materials at reduced costs. An
important feature of the program is the integration of research and education
through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically
significant area. ***
