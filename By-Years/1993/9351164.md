The goal of the proposed project is to enrich the research experiences of
beginning, intermediate, and advanced psychology undergraduates by providing
access to a networked microcomputer laboratory. A networked laboratory, rather
than a set of individual PCs, centralizes and expands laboratory resources with
a curriculum-wide exposure in psychology. This encourages students to
communicate with each other and the instructor on- line as they are working,
provides a detailed record of student use, and runs software that would be
impossible on existing stand-alone equipment. Undergraduates also design and
conduct three independent study projects each year and a senior thesis project
their fourth. It is expected that this project will provide a setting where
students can concentrate on hypothesis testing and conceptual analysis through
data collection and analyses.
