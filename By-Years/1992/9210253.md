This project will determine if bonding characteristics between bone minerals and
organic phases play a role in the mechanical properties of aged or osteoporotic
bones, in addition to changes in bone mass. The bonding between the bone mineral
and the organic constituents will be altered by treating the bone tissue with
special buffer solutions which contain potential determining and specifically
adsorbed ions of bone mineral. The mechanical properties including the elastic
moduli, yield and ultimate stress will be examined. This project is important
since it is thought that osteoporosis not only involves changes in bone mass but
also changes in bone quality. The quality of the bone is a function of the
mineral-organic bonding characteristics that these investigators will study.
