ABSTRACT CTS-9624615 The proposed research focuses on the microphysics and flow
of viscous multiphase fluids under conditions where the dispersed-phase volume
fraction is moderately high (up to 50% and drop deformation is significant).
This project is an attempt to work towards a theory that directly relates to the
rheology, drop size distribution, and spatial correlations between drops in a
concentrated emulsion to a micro-physical description. The goal of the proposed
education plan is to promote creativity and interest in science and technology.
The educational plan is designed to provide an enriching, accessible environment
for graduate and undergraduate research; fully integrate research and
educational activities; enhance general scientific and technical literacy; and
promote a wider involvement of women and people of color in science and
technology.
