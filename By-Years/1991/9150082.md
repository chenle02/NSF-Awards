The purpose of this project is to produce professional quality tapes on
mathematical topics for high school students. The tapes are to use computer
generated animation and are to be structured so that there will be interaction
between the tapes, and the teacher and the students. This is done by references
in the workbook that accompanies the tape. The tapes are disseminated by a
consortium of state organizations as well as NCTM and MAA. Further distributions
occur by the efforts and with the financial support of various foundations. All
material is made available on a nonprofit basis.//
