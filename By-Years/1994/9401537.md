9401537 THUNELL This investigation will be a component of a times-series study
of carbon cycling in the Cariaco Basin, a natural depression on the continental
shelf of Venezuela. Because of restricted lateral water exchange with the open
sea to the north, this Basin with its oxygenated surface waters overlying
extensive anoxic waters offers an ideal opportunity to study organic
decomposition near a oxidation-reduction boundary. The contribution of this
study to the overall objectives of the Cariaco Basin study will be a sediment
trap project designed to quantify seasonal variability in the organic carbon
flux and to estimate degradation rates of organic carbon in the water column.
Seasonal sediment trap data will be used to refine a model for varve formation
in the Basin. This will have important implications for ongoing studies that use
varves to reconstruct past climate changes in this region.
