Paul Segall 95-26910 The PIs propose to continue ongoing GPS studies in northern
California aimed at understanding the kinematics of crustal deformation across
the Pacific-North America plate boundary, and at investigating the accumulation
of interseismic strain and the time-dependent variations in strain along the San
Andreas Fault system. The PIs will combine (new and existing) GPS data with
measurements using VLBI and EDM techniques to obtain a self-consistent velocity
field for the region. Ultimately the PIs will incorporate their results into
deformation models that can be useful in assessing seismic hazards in this
important region.
