9221312 Westberg Isoprene and monoterpenes naturally emitted from vegetation are
known to play a significant role in the atmospheric cycles of trace gases such
as ozone, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. However, uncertainties related to
the emission rates of these biogenic hydrocarbons from forests and to the
dilution rate of gases within and above a forest canopy prohibit a quantitative
understanding of the role these hydrocarbons play in the atmospheric carbon
cycle. In this project biogenic emission-fate studies with emphasis on a boreal
forest will be studied. This work will be integrated into the Boreal Ecosystem-
Atmosphere Study (BOREAS). The PIs will address three tasks set forth in the
BOREAS Science Plan: 1) determination of biogenic hydrocarbon fluxes, 2)
examination of physical exchange processes, and 3) ambient measurement of trace
gases that are important contributors to atmosheric chemistry in the region. The
experimental measurement phase of each initiative will involve collaborative
efforts between the PIs research group and science teams from other agencies.
The biogenic hydrocarbon emission studies will consist of a joint effort between
Washington State University (WSU) and the research team headed by Pat Zimmerman
at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). ***
