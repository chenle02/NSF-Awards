This award funds a Research Fellowship in Plant Biology for two years. The
project is entitled "Analysis of the Auxin Signalling Pathway in Arabidopsis
thaliana." The Research Fellowships in Plant Biology are granted to applicants
trained in traditional areas of plant biology who wish to extend their training
in new techniques and to those trained in molecular or cellular techniques who
wish to gain experience working with plants. These fellowships are designed to
increase the number of outstanding young scientists in plant biology.
