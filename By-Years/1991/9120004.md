This Science and Technology Center undertakes multidisciplinary, interactive
research, as well as broadly based education and knowledge transfer activities.
The research focuses on understanding the factors and underlying mechanisms that
control the properties of high performance polymeric adhesives and composites,
and on exploiting knowledge gained to design innovative advanced materials
systems with superior properties. These goals require extensive collaboration
and integration of results from a research team with expertise in synthetic
polymer chemistry, surface science, mechanics, chemical engineering, and
materials science and engineering. The educational and outreach activities
include summer undergraduate research programs, a continuing education program
for college faculty, and a very extensive continuing education program primarily
designed for industrial researchers. Knowledge transfer is effected through
research symposia, workshops, academic and industrial personnel exchange
programs, strong collaborative interactions with personnel in government
laboratories and industry, and publications in appropriate technical journals.
This Center is directed by Professor James E. McGrath.
