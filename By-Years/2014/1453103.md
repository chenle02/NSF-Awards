This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program grant will advance the
understanding of landslide mobility. Rapid flow-like landslides such as mud
flows, debris flows, and rock avalanches are capable of mobilizing large volumes
of soil and rock and impacting large areas, often far from their source because
of their high mobility. Globally, rapid flow-like landslides cause billions of
dollars in damage and thousands of deaths and injuries each year. As evidenced
by the recent Oso Landslide (March 22, 2014) in Snohomish County, Washington,
landslide mobility remains poorly understood. This award supports fundamental
research to provide the knowledge needed for advancing the understanding of
landslide mobility, and reliably predicting landslide runout. Results from this
research will improve current landslide hazard assessment and ultimately help
reduce future losses to society from these devastating geohazards. The
international component of this project will foster international collaborations
that contribute to the training of globally-engaged engineering students.

The objective of this research is to advance the understanding of the effects of
solid-like behaviors of landslide mass and fluid-solid interaction on landslide
mobility, which play important roles but have been overlooked in the past. To
achieve this objective, integrated experimental, numerical and case studies that
span laboratory and field scales will be conducted. Laboratory-scale flume tests
will be conducted to investigate the impact forces generated by a sliding mass
on a rigid obstruction. The slide mass will have varied porosity, mass, and
release height and pattern. In the numerical investigation, a three dimensional
smoothed particle hydrodynamics model will be developed, which will incorporate
the latest advancements in contact algorithms, formulations of landslide
mobility, two-phase debris flow models, and parallel computing. The developed
numerical model will be calibrated and validated against the laboratory-scale
flume tests conducted in this research, well-documented field-scale flume tests
conducted by others, and case histories of long-runout landslides. The fully
validated numerical model will then be utilized to gain insights into the
effects of internal stress field, fluid-solid interaction, and evolution of
porosity, stiffness, and bulk density of the sliding mass on landslide mobility.
