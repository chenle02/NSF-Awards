This low temperature physics project will study the properties of electrons in
liquid helium. Previous work has shown that when an electron is introduced into
liquid helium, it forces open a small cavity in the liquid. This "electron
bubble" has a radius of approximately 20 Angstroms. Application of a negative
pressure to the liquid causes this bubble to grow, and at a critical pressure,
the bubble becomes unstable and explodes. This provides a convenient way to
detect the electron bubbles. It is planned to study in detail what happens to
the bubbles when they are illuminated by light and the electron is excited to a
higher energy state. This causes the size and shape of the bubble to undergo a
sudden change. In addition to the ultrasonic experiments, measurements of ion
mobility will be performed. Students involved in this project are trained in a
range of experimental techniques that prepares them for careers in academe,
industry, or government.

Bubbles form in liquids as a result of a number of different processes. They can
be produced when the pressure on a liquid that contains gas is reduced: For
example, when a cola can is opened. They also occur when a fluid passes rapidly
by a solid surface, such as a propeller blade, a sometimes-damaging process
known as cavitation. In this research project, bubbles are produced in liquid
helium, a cryogenic fluid with a boiling point of -268.93 C. Liquid helium is
chosen in part because it is ultra-pure, so effects that might arise from
impurities can be controlled or eliminated. It is also chosen because it is
possible to create bubbles in liquid helium via a highly controllable, though
rather esoteric, process. It has been found that when an electron is introduced
into liquid helium, it forces open a small cavity in the liquid. This unusual
phenomenon and the high purity of cryogenic liquid helium combine to provide a
model system for the study of bubbles. The goal is to understand and control
bubble initiation and growth, and, where possible, apply the knowledge to
practical situations such as cavitation. Students involved in this project are
trained in a range of experimental techniques and are well prepared for careers
in academe, industry, or government.
