This conference grant funded by programs in the Engineering, Biological
Sciences, and Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorates provides partial
support for the 1994 Gordon Research Conference on Bio/Analytical Sensors. This
conference, which brings together scientists from diverse scientific fields and
geographical locations, will promote new developments in this technologically
important field. Support is provided to allow the participation of young
faculty, post-doctorals, and graduate students, who might not otherwise be able
to attend this conference. This grant will enable the participation of young
researchers in the 1994 Gordon Research Conference on Bio/Analytical Sensors.
Developments in this area could have wide-ranging impacts in environmental,
biological, and health-related sciences.
