The proposed research is aimed at constructing an image representation that
improves performances of current image compression algorithms and organizes the
information in a form suitable for fast patter discrimination and search
algorithms. The approach relies on recently discovered bandlelet orthogonal
bases, which can be adapted to curves and efficiently represent image profiles.
The work will also build on and incorporate previous work in such areas as
graphs matching. Developing new techniques in this area can greatly improve the
efficiency of future image search engines.
