This research will be supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
Program. The work will lead to the development of new routes to heterocyclic
compounds containing three oxygen atoms. These are important constituent
substructures in some important enviromental processes as well as having been
discovered in a new antimalarial from mainland China, artemisin. This will
establish methods for the preparation of novel functional ozonides
(1,2,4-trioxolanes) and to develop new reactions of these species which can be
applied to compounds of chemical significance. Although a great deal has been
learned about the mechanism of alkene ozonolysis, very little is known of the
chemistry of the product ozonides. Likewise, substituent effects on the oxonide
ring have not been well-studied. The intramolecular carbonyloxide-ester
cycloaddition will be further developed as a route to alkoxy oxonides, where the
substituent exerts a strong electronic bias on the trioxolane system. Two
approaches will be explored--first, ozonolysis of alkene esters where a rigid
carbon framework holds the reactive groups in close proximity, and the ozonation
of cyclic vinyl ethers, where the reactive groups are generated together. The
alkoxy ozonides are selective oxygen transfer agents toward nucleophiles. This
process will be studied both on mechanistic grounds, including labelling
experiments to determine the regioselectivity of 0-transfer, and for synthetic
utility--the oxidation of carbon nucleophiles is a problem of long standing. The
ozonation of allylic halides will be investigated to elucidate the
stereoelectronic effects for ozonide formation. The resulting beta-halo ozonides
should be susceptible to ionization-ring expansion, thereby opening a new
synthetic route to 5-alkoxy-1,2,4-trioxanes, the pharmacophore of the
antimalarial artemisinin.
