It is known that there is a range of recovery to different kinds of brain
damage. In the visual system of humans, damage to only the visual cortex of the
brain often leaves residual functional vision, called "blindsight", that
presumably depends on pathways from the eye to areas other than primary visual
cortex. There is evidence that sparing or recovery of visual function is greater
when cortical damage occurs during infancy rather than in an adult. This project
investigates some of the mechanisms by which such visual recovery in very young
animals may be more effective than recovery of older animals. Visual detection,
localization and discrimination will be assessed for the field of vision
normally represented in the excised tissue (the "field defect"), and recovery
will be tracked as a function of time and of practice. Behavioral responses
later will be compared to responses of single nerve cells in the visual regions
of the brain outside the lesioned areas, and anatomical studies will explore the
development of changes in connectivity. Results are likely to clarify how
recovery in infants occurs better than in adults, and so will be very important
to our understanding of the organization and development of the primate and
human visual system.
