The ultimate goals of this research award are to enhance the mechanistic
understanding, establish theoretical foundations or meaningful measurements, and
provide a rational basis for selectively modulating cell motility for optimizing
celfunction. Directed cell movements in response to chemical and physical cues
are crucial to many problems in biomedicine and biotechnology as are the
deformation and restructuring of the surrounding fibrous matrix due to
underlying cell tractional forces. Characterization of these properties in vitro
and understanding their consequences in vivo are unifying themes approached
using cell behavior assays in conjunction with mathematical models at both the
single cell and cell population/continuum levels.
