This award provides support for the NSF-CBMS Conference on Parallel Time
Integration to be held on June 1-5, 2020, at Michigan Technological University.
The primary focus of the conference is to educate and inspire researchers and
students in new and innovative numerical techniques for the parallel-in-time
solution of large-scale evolution problems on modern supercomputing
architectures, and to stimulate further studies in their analysis and
applications. It aligns with the National Strategic Computing Initiative (NSCI)
objective: "increase coherence between technology for modeling/simulation and
data analytics". Computational simulations are a key part of scientific research
for government, industry, and academia, complementing laboratory experimentation
and theory. Changes in computer architectures are leading to future
supercomputers that will have billions of processors, as opposed to millions
today. However, each individual processor will be no faster than individual
processors today. Thus, these next generation machines will no longer
automatically provide a speedup to existing computational simulations, and new
mathematical algorithms must be developed and deployed that can utilize this
unprecedented number of processors. Parallel-in-time methods provide one such
class of mathematical algorithms. They add a new dimension (time) of parallelism
and thus allow existing computer models to be extended to next generation
supercomputers. The range of potential applications is vast: computational
molecular dynamics such as protein and DNA folding, computational biology (e.g.,
heart modeling), computational fluid dynamics (e.g., combustion, climate, and
weather), and machine learning.

The conference will feature ten lectures by Professor Gander, an expert in
parallel time integration. Using appropriate mathematical methodologies from the
theory of partial differential equations in a functional analytic setting,
numerical discretizations, integration techniques, and convergence analyses of
these iterative methods, conference participants will be exposed to the
numerical analysis of parallel-in-time methodologies and their implementations.
The proposed topics include multiple shooting type methods, waveform relaxation
methods, time-multigrid methods, and direct time-parallel methods. These
lectures will be accessible to a wide audience from a broad range of
disciplines, including mathematics, computer science and engineering. The

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
