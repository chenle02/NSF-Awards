This CPATH Community Building project creates a framework for incorporating
computational thinking principles and learning environments across the Liberal
Studies curriculum at DePaul University. It includes outreach to other
institutions in the greater Chicago region to build a computational thinking
community. The project includes activities to investigate and formalize the use
of computational thinking, to evaluate the learning of computational thinking,
to disseminate results and resources, and to build an external computational
thinking community.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project
lies in the importance and currency of the topic and clear need for such changes
in computing education to prepare the upcoming generation of computing
professionals. The strong interdisciplinary project team has significant
experience in educational innovation. The project has the potential to produce a
much needed computational thinking framework that can be used for transforming
general education content and courses across the
nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project lie in the
potential to prepare a diverse student population for computational intense
courses and curricula where they learn computational thinking methodologies that
transfer directly to their professional lives. The project includes
dissemination to a broad community and opportunities for sharing of resources.
There is potential for national models that can help to develop a computing-
savvy workforce which is vital to the nation's continued prosperity and
security.
