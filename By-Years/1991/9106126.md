Etter A stochastic filter consists of a bank of fixed filters with a set of
corresponding probabilities. The fixed filters from a basis set of filters for
the stochastic filter, and the probabilities determine the specific realization
represented by the stochastic filter. This research is investigating the use of
a stochastic filter to adaptively model an Infinite Impulse Response (IIR)
system. Guidelines for selecting the basic set of filters are being developed in
order to represent an adaptive IIR filter and to meet both accuracy and
convergence speed constraints.
