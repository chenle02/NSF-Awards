A workshop will be held in Washington DC to identify and widely distribute best
practices for recruiting and retaining a diverse community of scientists in the
fields of evolutionary biology, ecology and systematics. Doing so is important
because the representation of individuals in these disciplines does not reflect
that of the general public, and this discrepancy is projected to increase. A
diverse workforce is essential to attract the best talent and to foster
innovation. The workshop will be built on a foundation provided by an extensive
online community that the organizers will create beforehand. Participants will
include a wide spectrum of stakeholders: students, professors, university
administrators, professional societies, and federal agencies. All materials will
be made publically available through a "wiki" that focuses on the theme of "What
works?"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the organization of the workshop is
unique for three reasons. First, it will rest on the collective input of virtual
communities, established and facilitated by the workshop organizers to discuss
and document best practices, challenges, needs, and opportunities. Because this
will occur before the workshop, participants will arrive at the workshop
thoroughly prepared and highly committed. Second, it will be designed around the
principles and practices of Appreciative Inquiry, which focuses on the simple
and positive question: What works? Appreciative Inquiry has not been used
previously in the Biological Sciences to help broaden participation. Third, it
takes a proximate and practical approach by focusing on what individuals can do;
institutional change, which is ultimately necessary, will presumably follow from
successes at the individual level. Dissemination is provided by extensive online
resources that will be created and made publically available. Scalability is
fostered through establishment of networks of individuals with common interests
and involvement in broadening participation.
