This award is for 4 students to participate in an Research Experiences For
Undergraduates site at the California Institute of Technology. The site will be
managed through the ongoing undergraduate research program at Cal Tech called
the SURF program. The 4 students will be additional mathematics students who
will work with Dr. Wilson and his colleagues. The main focus of the research
will be in finite algebra and combinatorics. The SURF program has a well
established program for these undergraduate students and has been operating
successfully for years. Adding some more mathematics students to this program
will give these students access to a research activity well within the spirit of
the Research Experiences For Undergraduates program.
