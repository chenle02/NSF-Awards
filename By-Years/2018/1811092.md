A central theme in probability theory is to understand large discrete models and
their scaling limits. The limiting objects, which are usually characterized by
certain symmetries and spatial independence, capture the universal large-scale
behavior of many models. In the last few decades, there have been great advances
in random planar geometry, especially in the understanding of some fundamental
two-dimensional discrete models and their scaling limits. These developments
hugely expand our knowledge on the randomness of basic objects such as curves,
functions, trees, and surfaces. They also revolutionize the mathematical
understanding of some central pieces of physics, including conformal field
theory, critical phenomena, and quantum gravity. This project aims to broaden
understanding of the fundamental mathematical underpinnings in this subject.

The project will explore two research directions in random planar geometry. In
the first direction, the project aims at linking two ways of constructing random
surfaces: (1) through the scaling limits of random planar maps; (2) through a
continuous theory called the Liouville quantum gravity (LQG). The investigator
plans to prove a conjecture asserting that LQG is the scaling limit of random
planar maps in a strong sense. As a tool for proving this conjecture, the
project considers a statistical mechanical model called the critical percolation
and aims to establish that the scaling limit of the critical percolation on the
uniform random triangulation and on a regular triangular lattice are the same.
The ingredients in both investigations include: (a) combinatorial bijections for
planar maps that encode their geometric information; (b) a relation between
fractals in quantum and Euclidean geometry called the Knizhnik-Polyakov-
Zamolodchikov relation; (c) the Fourier analysis of Boolean functions. In the
second direction, the investigator aims to resolve questions in the geometry of
random planar maps, computational geometry, and fractal geometry. The common
theme in the approaches is the application of two recently-developed machineries
in continuous random planar geometry called imaginary geometry and mating of
trees.
