New Mexico State University proposes to explore the potential for an
intervention that would increase the numbers of physically disabled persons,
specifically those with spinal cord injuries (SCI), who participate in
computing-related degree programs and careers. They propose to implement an
introductory computer course that is integrated into the context of a
rehabilitation (rehab) hospital. By choosing this venue, disabled persons will
be introduced to computing rather than leaving the introduction to chance.
Further, by focusing on the spinal cord injured population, a large percentage
of the target group will be of college and/or working age. The program will be
coordinated with hospital staff and integrated into patient education received
during rehabilitation. The course will cover the basic computer use and the use
of assistive technology, web development and programming using the Alice
programming language. This award will pilot the course three times and will
develop a plan to seek further funding in order to improve and scale the program
to reach a wider community, including military rehabilitation facilities.
