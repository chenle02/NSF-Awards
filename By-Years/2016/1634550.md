Dark social networks consist of illegal and covert networks of people. Given the
nature of being "dark", it is vital to disrupt the network through capture
(interdiction) or intelligence gathering (monitoring). In contrast, information
on these networks is often incomplete, inaccurate or not available. Gathering
information on dark networks dates back to World War II and has become more
prevalent today given the current climate of "The War on Terror"; the increased
access to information; and the usage of social network analysis to analyze these
networks. This award supports fundamental research using innovative mathematical
techniques to interdict or monitor cohesiveness within dark social networks.
This award also supports a concerted effort to engage underrepresented groups
within the research and positively impact engineering
education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In particular, the research team will utilize
new techniques within branch decomposition methods and integer programming to
investigate the clique-interdiction problem, the minimum clique-transversal
problem and the variations of the problems where "clique" is replaced with
k-plex, k-clique or k-club. This research will advance the knowledge base of
combinatorial optimization and integer programming while also contributing to
the increased scalability and efficiency for solving computationally hard
problems related to homeland security, criminal justice, and marketing.
