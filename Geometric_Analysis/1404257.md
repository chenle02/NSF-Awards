Expander graphs have been a focus of study in mathematics and computer science
during the last four decades. These sparse and yet highly connected graphs are
of fundamental importance in building communication networks, in computer
algorithms, and in the theory of error-correcting codes. The study of expander
graphs has been drawing tools from deep mathematics, such as number theory,
representation theory, and topology. In recent years the study of expanders also
provided new problems for pure mathematicians. This interplay of mathematics and
computer science has been very productive. The current proposal aims at taking
the theory of expanders one step further by initiating a systematic study of
high-dimensional expanders, which are simplical complexes of high dimensions
having similar properties of expanders. The problems in the high-dimensional
case are more difficult, but the theory we hope to develop can be expected to be
powerful in applications.

Specifically, the PIs plan to consider various ways to extend the definition of
expanders, e.g., via spectrum, cohomology or topology. Of particular interest
are the Ramanujan complexes, which generalize the Ramanujan graphs. Their
extremal properties (proved by methods of representation theory and number
theory) together with their remarkable symmetry are expected to be useful in
solving several problems. Of special importance is Gromov's topological
overlapping property. It is hoped that the extremal properties of Ramanujan
complexes will help resolve some problems of basic importance in the theory of
error-correcting codes, as well as in other areas of computer science.
