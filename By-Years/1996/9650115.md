This project supports the use of an atomic force microscope to strengthen and
extend an already vigorous program of undergraduate participation in physics
research. The microscope does not function as an isolated technological
curiosity; instead, it is an essential component of the ongoing physics
laboratory research program, and is intellectually and operationally accessible
to undergraduates. The research program addresses topics of current interest in
condensed matter physics while exposing students to a broad spectrum of modern
experimental techniques critical to basic research as well as to fields of
direct economic importance such as electrical engineering, nanofabrication, and
materials science. These techniques include cryogenics, high vacuum, thin-film
deposition, photolithography, electronic design and construction, machine shop
practice, and electrical measurements. The new apparatus introduces fresh
research opportunities for undergraduates and enhances the quality and
significance of their work. The program may also be a useful and appealing model
for other physicists interested in pursuing publishable research with
undergraduate assistance.
