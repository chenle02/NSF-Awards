Previous research conducted under NSF support (DMR-9871450) resulted in well-
defined organic/inorganic hybrid materials such as block and graft copolymers
with poly(dimethylsiloxane), POSS containing homopolymers and block copolymers,
and well-defined organic polymers tethered to curved and flat surfaces. These
materials were prepared by controlled radical polymerization (CRP) processes,
primarily using atom transfer radical polymerization
(ATRP).&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;While various methods to incorporate organic
polymers to inorganic substrates have been reported, robust methods to
universally incorporate well-defined (co)polymers are highly desirable. The
versatility of ATRP is a significant advantage to prepare hybrids, as facile
functionalization of inorganic substrates can be performed to enable
introduction of well-defined (co)polymers to these materials. The potential of
such an approach is far reaching to researchers involved in synthesis of
polymers, colloids, nanocomposites and modification of flat surfaces. The
primary strategy is to covalently bond well-defined organic homopolymer and
block copolymers to inorganic substrates (i.e., polymers, particles, surfaces)
enabling precise interfacial control between organic and inorganic components.
In particular, block copolymers of varying composition and molar mass will be
combined with inorganic substrates using CRP techniques. Hybrid nanocomposites
of increasing structural complexity will be prepared by utilizing the self-
assembly properties of incompatible block copolymers attached to inorganic
materials.&lt;br/&gt;
