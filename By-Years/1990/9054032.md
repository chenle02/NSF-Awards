The proposal received five panel ratings, all Excellent. We concur this is a
highly meritorious proposal that will serve Hispanic students. This project will
provide accelearted mathematics instruction to approximately 35 Hispanic
students per year through an instructional/counseling/mentoring model. The
program's goal is to select Hispanic students who show promise and strong
interest in mathematics, but lack prerequisite skills in mathematics and prepare
them for calculus and courses in the physical and engineering sciences. Students
will also be assigned to a Hispanic mentor who is a professional engineer
scientist or mathematician, and whose professional area is related to the career
interests of the student. There are some minor concerns that should be
addressed, e.g. Who will be the consultants? What will be the rate of
compensation for the tutors? What are the plans for follow up, i.e. post award?
