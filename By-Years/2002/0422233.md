The mechanisms underlying the generation of tropical diversity have eluded
biologists for centuries. This project tests the hypothesis that variation in
mobility across taxa will promote or retard long-distance gene flow and thereby
drive differences in population subdivision, divergence, and ultimately
speciation. This SGER will generate preliminary estimates of gene flow across a
sampling transect and demonstrate the degree of spatial pattern in genetic
structure within our target taxa.

This study will be the first to quantify experimentally the potential mobility
of Neotropical birds and similarly will be the first to compare estimates of
mobility with long-term patterns of gene flow. The resulting clarification of
the links between behavior and population subdivision have far-reaching
implications for our understanding of the historical processes of population
differentiation, lineage divergence, and speciation. The results will have
important and direct conservation applications for the many taxa (avian and
otherwise) that occur in rapidly fragmenting tropical forests and will provide
insight into the consequences of population (dis)connectivity in tropical
landscapes.
