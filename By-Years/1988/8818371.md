The lamellar transition metal phosphorus trichalcogenides form an important
family of two-dimensional semiconducting materials. These compounds are of
interest to researchers because of their highly two-dimensional physical
properties and their unusual solid-state chemistry. The layered lattices exhibit
solid-state "intercalation" reactions in which molecules insert between lattice
planes. The process of intercalation often results in dramatic and unpredictable
modification of the chemical and physical properties of the host lattice.
Although the intercalation reactions have been studied for more than two
decades, many interesting questions of mechanism and structure in the solid-
state intercalation chemistry of these materials remain unresolved. The research
described in this proposal is directed toward an improved understanding of the
mechanism of intercalation in these materials. Charge balance is an important
constraint to the intercalation of cationic species and may be achieved by
elimination of lattice cations. It is proposed to utilize electron spin
resonance (ESR) spectroscopy to study the complex equilibrium between inter-
lamellar and intra-lamellar cations. In many reactions a mechanism is involved
in which an electron is transferred to an unidentified site in the host lattice.
They propose to utilize photoluminescence and optically detected magnetic
resonance (ODMR) spectroscopy to determine the lattice reduction site.
