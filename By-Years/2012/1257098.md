People with perceptual expertise are skilled at making rapid identifications of
specialized objects at a glance, often in poor light and camouflage. Forensic
experts can accurately match exemplars to latent fingerprints that may be small,
distorted, or smudged. Expert radiologists can quickly categorize medical images
as normal or cancerous. This project examines perception, categorization, and
identification along the continuum from novice to expert performance in two
real-world perceptual domains. The overall aim is to understand how fundamental
perceptual and cognitive mechanisms are tuned and modified by experience and
expertise. The models arising from this project will enable us to understand the
development of real-world perceptual expertise and to validate theoretically-
grounded measures of expert performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why study
perceptual expertise? Just as gifted athletes push the limits of their bodies,
or prize-winning mathematicians push the limits of their minds, perceptual
experts push the limits of their perceptual systems. Perhaps with better markers
of perceptual expertise and a better understanding of how people become
perceptual experts, we could identify potential perceptual experts more
effectively, train new perceptual experts more efficiently, and evaluate
existing perceptual experts more thoroughly. Studying perceptual expertise can
also help inform our understanding of the kinds of everyday expertise that we
all have, such as recognizing faces or reading words. This can yield new
insights into education and workforce training along with new insights into how
the ravages of brain damage or disease might lead to perceptual and learning
deficits and potentially inform future breakthroughs in evaluation,
intervention, or treatment.
