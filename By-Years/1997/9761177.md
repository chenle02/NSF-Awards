*** 9761177 Shdarshan This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
will attempt to model, design and fabricate Carbon-Carbon composite engine
valves. Carbon-Carbon (C-C)composites are materials which are lightweight and
exhibit high strengths at elevated temperatures. The density of C-C (1.7g/cc)
versus 7.7g/cc for stainless steel and its inherent lubricity are attractive
features that render this material as a candidate for engine valves. A
significant proportion of engine efficiency is lost in the combustion chamber.
If all parts can be redesigned with lightweight materials, the energy efficiency
can be improved and the release of pollutants from combustion products
decreased. Extensive testing of the valves and redesign, if necessary, of the
shapes are planned for the Phase II effort. This process involves extensive
dynamometer studies along with long lead times for testing. Potential
applications for C-C materials are in all components of the combustion chamber
that include pistons, valves, valve guides, rocker arms and connecting rods. ***
