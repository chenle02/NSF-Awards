ABSTRACT This project will demonstrate the capabilities of the Poisson Maximum a
Posteriori Probability (MAP) super-resolution algorithm as applied to ground-
based astronomical image processing. Its performance will be compared with the
Richardson-Lucy and Maximum Entropy algorithms, which are in general use in the
astronomical community. The MAP algorithm will be exercised over a range of SNR
and image dynamic range.
