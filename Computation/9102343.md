The objective of this research is to develop fast algorithms for the optimal
feedback control of general continuous time stochastic dynamical systems. These
stochastic dynamical systems include perturbations by both Gaussian and Poisson
white noise. The computational treatment of the optimal feedback control of
general, nonlinear, stochastic differential equations with Markov noise in
continuous time, including Poisson noise, is a particularly unique feature of
this project. The algorithms are being tested on multi-state resource models,
but are applicable to a wide variety of applications. The numerical approach
directly treats the partial differential equation of stochastic dynamic
programming. New data structures and algorithms, such as finite element and
multigrid methods, will be developed to alleviate both memory and computation
intensive demands from the "curse of dimensionality". Purely parallel methods
are being developed for scalable, massively parallel processors and massive
memory supercomputers. Results give the optimal feedback control variables and
the expected optimal performance index in terms of state variables and time.
Large scale scientific computing is essential for managing the computational and
memory demands in the optimal control of large applications, such as aerospace
dynamics, flexible structures, resources, economics and robotics. The
implementation of advanced computational techniques, such as parallelization,
vectorization and optimal data structures, make it possible to solve problems of
larger dimension.
