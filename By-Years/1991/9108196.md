This project supports a cultural anthropologist in a research project in Sri
Lanka. The project will restudy a rural community of pottery producers who have
experienced significant economic growth and relative prosperity since the 1970s.
The project will conduct ethnographic research in producer households and
surveys of local markets, with the goal of relating current economic activity to
development policy of the past 20 years. This project is important because Sri
Lanka has undergone "structural adjustment" in response to pressures from
international development lending agencies. These policies have been associated
with reports of declining living standards of the rural poor. This study of a
case of improving conditions of life will provide ideas and descriptive examples
to refine and improve the theory of economic development under structural
adjustment.
