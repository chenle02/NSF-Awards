9358268 Martin This is a National Science Foundation Young Investigator award to
support research to be performed by the Principal Investigator who was selected
through procedures contained in NSF 92-116, Young Investigator Awards FY93
Program. The PI will perform research to develop a simplified method of
predicting lateral movements in liquefied sands using laboratory and in-situ
test data and case histories. The case histories will involve sites where
lateral movements in liquefied sands were measured following earthquake shaking.
This research will help in a more accurate estimation of the damage potential of
sites and built facilities due to liquefaction caused by earthquakes for a
better land use planning. ***
