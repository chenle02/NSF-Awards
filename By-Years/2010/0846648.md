*** NONTECHNICAL ABSTRACT ***&lt;br/&gt;This Faculty Early Career Award funds a
project that will investigate novel light-matter interactions in low-dimensional
graphitic materials. Such graphitic structures, including two-dimensional
graphene and one-dimensional carbon nanotubes, have remarkable electrical,
mechanical, and optical properties. This research project will advance our
fundamental understanding of these novel carbon materials, the knowledge of
which could enable new type of electronic and photonic devices. It also provides
an active learning environment to train students with interdisciplinary skills.
This CAREER project will take advantage of the diverse student body and
education activities in UC Berkeley, including the Berkeley Edge program and the
Cal-Teach platform, to enhance broad participation in science and technology.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***TECHNICAL ABSTRACT***&lt;br/&gt;This Faculty Early
Career Award funds a project that will investigate novel light-matter
interactions in graphene and carbon nanotubes. The remarkable physical
properties of these low-dimensional graphitic systems have spurred a worldwide
effort in their transport studies. The proposed research will advance our
understanding of their photophysics using individual nanostructure spectroscopy.
The CAREER project will focus on exploring Dirac fermion physics in gated
graphene bilayers, which is expected to exhibit fascinating pseudo-spin
phenomena and non-trivial Berry?s phases, and on probing ultrafast dynamics and
quantum coherence in individual chirality-defined carbon nanotubes. This
research will shed light on a range of important dynamical behavior of graphitic
materials, including electron coherence and dephasing mechanisms and energy
transfer processes. Situated at the interface of nanoscience and optical physics
frontiers, the proposed research provides a truly interdisciplinary learning
environment for graduate students as well as undergraduate students. Such
education and outreach effort will be an integral part of this research project.
