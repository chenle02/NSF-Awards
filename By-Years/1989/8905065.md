This project is aimed at elucidating the biochemical composition of the
Photosystem I reaction center complex in cyanobacteria and green plants. Dr.
Golbeck's recently demonstrated ability to resolve the Photosystem I complex
into the core protein (containing P700 and the iron sulfur center FX) and the
low molecular mass polypeptides containing the iron sulfur centers FA and FB,
and the ability to reconstitute the Photosystem I complex from its purified
components, has provided new and important research opportunities in Photosystem
I. The reaction center of a photosynthetic system is where light energy is
transformed into chemical energy. The Photosystem I reaction center consists of
a membrane-bound, multiprotein complex that functions as a light-driven
plastocyanin: ferredoxin oxidoreductase. The electron transfer components
include a chlorophyll primary electron donor, a chlorophyll primary electron
acceptor, a quinone intermediate electron acceptor and three iron-sulfur
clusters.
