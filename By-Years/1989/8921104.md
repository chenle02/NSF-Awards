This award supports a conference entitled "Future Prospects for UV and VUV
Laser." This conference is being sponsored by the Engineering Foundation and
will be held February 25-March 2, 1990, in Santa Barbara, California. This is
the second conference of this title, the first, held in February 1987. The
purpose of this second conference is to ascertain where laser development
efforts in the UV and VUV should be directed; to identify fundamental
photochemical, spectroscopic kinetic issues; and to reexamine industrial and
commercial efforts and research needs in light of recent progress in VUV source.
This will be accomplished by assembling approximately 100 of the leading
researchers in the area, and interspersing overview talks of current and
potential applications of VUV and UV lasers with invited papers highlighting
crucial issues in laser development. Support from NSF is sought specifically to
enable the attendance of young investigators whose research program has not yet
been built to the point of affording this conference.
