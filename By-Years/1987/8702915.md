The research team intends to study the management of the memory hierarchy in
MIMD multiprocessors. The recent technological explosion has allowed the
inclusion of large and fast memories in many levels of the memory hierarchy. The
management of this hierarchy is quite well understood in a uniprocessor
environment but newer challenges present themselves in a multiprocessor system.
One of these challenges is the cache coherence problem. They will continue
previous studies on cache coherence in shared-bus systems (enhancement of
existing solutions with software hints, evaluation on specific applications) and
in interconnected systems (they will model a wide spectrum of solutions). They
will extend these studies with those pertaining to the design and management of
the memory hierarchy in high-performance systems. This will include multilevel
caches (architectural choices, design and evaluation of protocols) and systems
where not all levels are managed under the virtual memory concept (use of
planned transfers of data between memory levels with compiler and programmer
assists). Finally, they will try to evaluate qualitatively and quantitatively
the numerous possibilities for the location of the translation buffer from the
conventional real caches to those architectures using virtual address caches.
