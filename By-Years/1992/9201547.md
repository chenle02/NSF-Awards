This research proposal is an attempt to quantify the effect of the many factors
affecting the coefficient of hydraulic conductivity of compacted clays located
in an environment subjected to repeated freezing and thawing. Two types of tests
will be employed in this study: one-dimensional freezing and three-dimensional
freezing. The one-dimensional freezing laboratory test is complicated but better
simulate field conditions. The three-dimensional freezing is simpler and more
economical to perform. Therefore, a comparison of the changes in the coefficient
of hydraulic conductivity in these tests is an essential step in the development
of practical, economical, and reliable testing procedure. Thin sections of clay
used in the test program will be prepared and studied in order to obtain basic
knowledge and how freeze/thaw process influence the hydraulic conductivity of
compacted clays.
