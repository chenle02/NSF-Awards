Non-Technical Abstract &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the 2017 Gordon
Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar on "Rational Design of Multi-
Scale Materials and Their Emerging Applications" with support provided by the
Condensed Matter Physics, Condensed Matter and Materials Physics, and Solid
State and Materials Chemistry Programs in the Division of Materials Research.
This conference has grown to be the premier US conference on Liquid Crystals and
attracts a broad group of engineers (including chemical engineers), chemists,
physicists, life scientists, materials scientists, and mathematicians. Liquid
crystal science is truly interdisciplinary and spans research frontiers in
transport and interfacial phenomena in soft matter systems, supramolecular
chemistry, condensed matter physics and materials, colloidal phenomena and
microfluidics, biomaterials, as well as computational methods and theories of
anisotropic soft matter. This breadth of topics and interdisciplinary flavor
generates novel, creative solutions to applied problems as well as bringing
deeper insight into fundamental science. A conference of this type breeds inter-
and multi-disciplinary ideas and approaches to complex and relevant problems. In
addition, this conference will be preceded by a Gordon Research Seminar that
provides a unique opportunity for young researchers to share in the GRC
experience and build informal networks with their peers.
