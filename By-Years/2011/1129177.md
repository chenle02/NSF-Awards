The 2011 AAAI Robotics Exhibition and Workshop (San Francisco, CA August 7-11,
2011) continues a focus on key research problems in manipulation and learning
through challenges in: (1) humanoid robotics, (2) learning by demonstration, and
(3) samll-scale manipulation (robot chess). The teams selected for each
challenge define research problems and repeatable experiments in areas that
drive autonomous assistance in both military and domestic needs. The workshop
enhances the challenge goals by (1) creating awareness in the larger AI
community of available software tools, and (2) crafts a roadmap for development
platforms that are more accessible to the general computer science research
community.

A significant number of hands-on exhibits complement the workshop discussions
and panel. Here, research teams showcase working demonstrations that support the
challenge themes of learning, teaming and manipulation. Exhibits are on display
for 2 full days during the AAAI Conference, providing an excellent opportunity
to engage a broad technical audience. The exhibits are open to the general
public to raise awareness of the state-of-the-art in robotics. Students from
local schools and summer camps visit. Access to the exhibits provides an
opportunity for students and leaders to learn how robotics and AI play important
roles in society.
