Professor Macadam studies the dynamics of collisions between highly excited
atomic states and charged (both positive and negative) ions. Manipulation of the
collisions environment by applying time varying electric fields, alters
dramatically the outcome of the collision. Inelastic processes such as electron
capture and detachment reveal important evidence in a continuing attempt to
understand 3- body collision dynamics.
