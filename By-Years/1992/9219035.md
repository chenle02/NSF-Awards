Eggs, embryos, and ontogenetic stages of particular dinosaur species allow for
the determination of life history strategies. Characteristics such as egg size,
egg clutch size, hatchling size, maximum size of nestling, growth rates during
life, and size of individuals at sexual maturity can presently be determined for
at least four dinosaur species from Montana and Alberta. PI will exploration and
collection of eggs and young of additional taxa from the Lower Cretaceous
Cloverly Formation and Upper Cretaceous Judith River Foundation, well as other
Cretaceous formations. Compilation and comparison of these data will allow
hypotheses to be made concerning the evolutionary dynamics of dinosaurs. More
life history information will be known for these dinosaurs than for any other
extinct vertebrate.
