Research is conducted on the characterization of the contamination of
groundwater by fluids that are immiscible in water. Current efforts toward
modeling groundwater contamination by an immiscible fluid are severely hindered
by the paucity of available data on the relevant saturation-pressure-
permeability relationships. They are similarly restricted by the lack of
experimental data for model validation. Two alternative methods are examined
using specially designed laboratory equipment for simultaneous determination of
saturation pressure and permeability.
