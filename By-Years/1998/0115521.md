The legal practice world is undergoing significant change: the changing
demographics of American society and of law school applicants, combined with
escalating student loan debt, the proliferation of "alternative" forms of
practice in multinational and multidisciplinary organizations, and widening gaps
between private sector and public sector salaries and between corporate and
public interest law firms. The proposed research is a longitudinal study that
will follow a national cohort of law school graduates, all of whom joined or
passed the bar in calendar year 2000, for ten years following graduation. The
researchers will rely on mailed surveys to track the careers of over 5000
lawyers, and will conduct in-depth interviews with 500 lawyers. The study draws
on a capital assets approach, which is a multidimensional concept integrating
work that examines legal careers though the concepts of human and social
capital. This approach suggests that law graduates with particular capital
assets may be able to maximize their career opportunities and determine their
career trajectories more easily than graduates with lesser capital
accumulations. By examining individual choices and how they are rewarded, this
project will provide crucial information about the forms of capital that are
valued and rewarded within the legal profession, any geographic variation in
this professional valuation, and how these processes of opportunity and reward
may be changing over time. This emphasis on the career trajectories of lawyers
will provide a research base that is critical to understanding the future of the
legal profession, while also providing data to explore how, in different legal
markets across the US, lawyers build their careers in different ways.
