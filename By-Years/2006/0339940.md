This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
new materials technology to help drive a revolution in infrared microscopy,
using a newly developed technique to grow pure germanium on silicon without
crystalline defects. Silicon imagers are widely used, from supermarket scanners
to the ultra-sensitive CCDs used in astronomy. Germanium is photosensitive over
a much wider spectrum, from visible to well into the infrared. Combining this
new spectral ability with fine-line silicon manufacturing could turn infrared
dusk into broad daylight Characterization and understanding of material grown by
this new technique is limited. Controlling leakage is essential to maximize
sensitivity. Pixel geometries to best trade off resolution for noise performance
must be identified. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad impacts from this work would
be the near infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectral range from
800 to 1600 nm, which holds considerable scientific and applied interest.
Initial applications could be in medical imaging and pharmaceutical inspection
leading into a much broader application field including night and fog vision for
security, monitoring of crops, pollution and climate, and range-finding for
defense and construction applications. &lt;br/&gt;
