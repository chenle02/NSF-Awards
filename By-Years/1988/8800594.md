The proposed research program in experimental intermediate energy nuclear
physics has two components: one, utilization of the IUCF Cooler Ring to make
kinematically complete measurements of NN pion production near threshold; and
two, measurement of eta meson photoproduction at the Bates electron linac. The
first of these will provide stringent tests of the inelastic, or non- static,
aspects of the NN interaction. The second will explore the electromagnetic
structure of those nucleon resonances which decay primarily by eta emission, and
the difficulties associated with planned coincidence experiments at the next
generation facilities. Design and construction of new detectors are major
elements of the IUCF experiment, to a lesser extent with the Bates work. Both
are important and fundamental measurements.
