9312596 Chakrabarti This proposal involves the analysis, by simulation methods,
of phase transitions within random porous media. In particular, the phase
separation of binary liquid mixtures and the isotropic to nematic liquid crystal
phase transition will be studied. Comparison will be made to experimental
results and to simple theoretical models. The porous medium will be modelled so
that it has an interconnected and tortuous structure resembling Vycor glass (a
common experimental medium). The 3D simulation methods to be used are a) Monte
Carlo to study the equilibrium conditions and b) Numerical solution of the time
dependent field equations to study the kinetics of the ordering processes. These
are lattice models and their solutions will be implemented on the parallel
architecture of the Connection Machine. %%% Porous media have a profound effect
upon the phase transitions of systems contained within them. In this proposal,
the phase separation of two component liquids and the isotropic (molecular axes
randomly oriented) to nematic (melecular axes aligned) transition of liquid
crystals will be studied by computer simulation. Although significant
experimental and pure-theory work have been performed here, little simulational
work has been done. The present proposal seeks to ask (and answer) specific
questions which neither experiment nor theory can hope to answer alone. The work
will involve the numerical solution of model liquids and liquid crystals trapped
within a model porous medium designed to represent the tortous and
interconnected structure of Vycor glass- the principal experimental medium. The
simulations will be performed on a parallel architecture computer. This work has
significant relevance to our undertsanding of processes occuring within rocks or
within catalysts. ***
