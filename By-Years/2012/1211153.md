This project studies framing, a central concept in political communication that
refers to portraying an issue from one perspective with corresponding de-
emphasis of competing perspectives. Framing is known to significantly influence
public attitudes toward policy issues and policy outcomes. As social media allow
greater citizen engagement in political discourse, scientific study of the
political world requires reliable analysis of how issues are framed, not only by
traditional media and elites but by citizens participating in public discourse.
Yet conventional content analysis for frame discovery and classification is
complex and labor-intensive. Additionally, existing methods are ill-equipped to
capture those many instances when one frame evolves into another frame over
time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project therefore develops new computational
modeling methods, grounded in data-driven computational linguistics, aimed at
improving the scientific understanding of how issues are framed by political
elites, the media, and the public. This collaboration between political
scientists and computer scientists has four goals: (a) developing novel methods
for semi-automated frame discovery, whereby computational models guided by
political scientists? expert knowledge speed up and augment their analytical
process; (b) developing novel algorithms based on natural language processing
for automatic frame analysis, producing measurably accurate results comparable
with reliable human coders; (c) establishing the validity of these processes on
well-understood cases; and (d) applying these methods to several current policy
issues, using data across years and across traditional and social media streams.
The resulting evolutionary framing data will help unpack the mechanisms of
framing and help predict trends in public opinion and policy.
