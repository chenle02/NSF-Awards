Abstract NSF Proposal: DMS 9870162 Principal Investigator: Leslie D. Saper This
project deals with the cohomology of noncompact locally symmetric spaces. In
previous work, the investigator developed a micro-local analogue of purity on
compactifications of locally symmetric spaces and used this to prove Rapoport's
conjecture. In the current project, the investigator will apply this purity
theory to study the relation between the cohomology of a locally symmetric space
and the cohomology of its boundary strata. One tool will be a weight spectral
sequence developed by the investigator which is based on the Langlands's
partition. The objective is to understand from a more geometric viewpoint the
construction of cohomology using Eisenstein series and the relation with
L-functions. Locally symmetric spaces occur naturally in many areas of
mathematics and theoretical physics, in particular, geometry and number theory.
In their most basic forms, geometry and number theory are considered in high
school: the study of plane figures and the study of the whole numbers. These are
two of the oldest fields in mathematics. In the modern perspective, geometry and
number theory become intertwined as part of the Langlands's program, the scene
of some of the most exciting current research of the past quarter-century.
Applications of geometry and number theory abound, in particular in coding
theory, computing, and the study of symmetry of crystals, materials, and
biological structures.
