The modern chemist relies on a number of instruments to characterize molecules
and to handle and interpret vast quantities of data. Mass Spectrometry (MS) and
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy are crucial to the former and
modern computers are essential to the latter. State-of-the art MS, NMR and
computer instrumentation is indespensible for the execution of frontier research
in chemistry. The Department of Chemistry at Columbia University will use this
multi-instrument award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program to help
acquire a Mass Spectrometer, computer equipment, and components to improve
departmental NMR spectrometers. Included among the areas of chemical research
that will be enhanced by these acquisitions are the following: 1) Quantum
solvation and dynamics 2) Chemical model systems relevant to enzymatic processes
3) Novel antiaromatic compounds and their solid state properties 4) Synthesis of
polymeric metallocenes 5) Structural bioorganic studies of bioactive compounds
6) Synthesis of natural and unnatural ionophores 7) Structure and dynamics of
starburst polymers.
