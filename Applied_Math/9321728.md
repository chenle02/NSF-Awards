9321728 de Pillis The Navier-Stokes equations are central to the modeling of
ocean currents, weather patterns, jet engine noise, waves generated by the
movement of an object through a fluid, and many other physical phenomena. The
Navier-Stokes equations can be used to model compressible, slightly
compressible, and incompressible fluid flow. The equations are complicated
enough that numerical as opposed to analytical solution methods must be
employed. The numerical calculation of each type of flow (e.g., compressible
versus incompressible) presents its own particular difficulties. In this
project, the focus is on the efficient determination of the solutions to the
slightly compressible Navier-Stokes equations in an infinite domain. These
solutions represent low Mach number flow, and are pivotal to the modeling of
sound propagation. In the case of slightly compressible flow, at least two time
scales are present in the solutions. The presence of the two or more time scales
generally makes efficient numerical calculations difficult to achieve. In this
project, however, the presence of multiple time scales is actually used
advantageously. Recent research has shown how certain solutions containing
multiple time scales can be expanded into a sum of simpler solutions (i.e.,
solutions containing essentially one time scale). In the analytic portion of
this project, the general behavior of this sum of solutions is examined. The
goal of this project is to develop, implement and analyze a numerical solver
which makes use of this understanding of the behavior of these solutions. The
efficiency and accuracy of this new implementation will be compared with that of
existing numerical schemes. This solver is expected to be an improvement over
existing solvers in efficiency, accuracy and ease of use.
