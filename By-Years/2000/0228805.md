With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program and the Office
of Multidisciplinary Activities are supporting the research and educational
efforts of Dr. Jeffrey Willemsen of the Department of Chemistry at Willamette
University and Dr. Ronald G. Brisbois of the Department of Chemistry at
Macalaster College. The collaborative research of the two principal
investigators will be merged into their collaborative efforts regarding the
Willamette University Native American Summer Science Camp. The science camp
participants, grade 8-10 students, will be introduced to the synthesis of
organic compounds by taking part in an ongoing project to prepare and study the
properties of CpCoCb-bridged cyclophanes. Fundamental aspects of laboratory
technique and structural characterization will be stressed in this pilot
program.
