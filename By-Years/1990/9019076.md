The purpose of this research is to develop a methodology combining the use of
artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms in order to solve the power
network transaction problem. The reason for doing this is that the current
analysis methods do not accurately model load flow constraints on the system.
Successful completion of this research will advance the operational capabilities
of electric utilities.
