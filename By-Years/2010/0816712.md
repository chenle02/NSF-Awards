The East Coast Computer Algebra Day (ECCAD) 2008 is a one-day session held at
Shepherd University on May 10, 2008. The conference is endorsed by ACM SIGSAM
and SIAM and includes four invited speakers, more than one dozen poster
presentations and software demonstrations. There are more than 80 participants,
from a region roughly bounded by New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia,
West Virginia, North Carolina, Florida, Texas and Ohio. A moderated panel
discussion on hybrid numeric-symbolic computing is included. A pre-conference
tutorial workshop on using computer algebra systems in K-12 classroom is held on
May 9, 2008, which is aimed at high school teachers seeking to bring technology
into their classrooms.

The conference aims at dissemination and discussion of research in the area of
Computer Algebra systems. Modern day problems require sophisticated computer
algebra systems that can efficiently emulate numerical and symbolic calculations
with a high accuracy and speed. The need for such systems is motivated by the
desire to solve mathematical models which provide an accurate representation of
real life systems, the solution of which predicts their behavior in a simulated
environment. The conference stimulates interest in the technical aspects of
computer algebra, including Algebraic Algorithms, Hybrid Symbolic-Numeric
Computation, and Computer Algebra Applications in Engineering, Economics and
Education area.
