This project entails the developement of a unified mixed layer model which
includes all of the subinertial processes in the mixed layer. This is a
subinertial mixed layer (SML) model aiming towards the improvement of current
three-dimensional mixed layer models. The project has two major components: (1)
to further the theoretical development of the SML approximation to include
diabatic forcing, mechanical forcing and interaction with deeper interior layer
through both entrainment and pressure forcing; and (2) to apply the SML
approximation to specific problems.
