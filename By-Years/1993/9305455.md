9305455 Yu The overall objective of this research is to elucidate the role of
supernumeral subunit IV (Mr = 14,384), in the cytochrome bc1 complex of a
photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Although previous studies
indicate that subunit IV is an integral part of this bacterial bc1 complex and
is involved in Q-binding, the structure and other function(s) of this subunit
are yet to be established. The PI intends to investigate the role and structure-
function relationship of this protein through gene deletion, complementation,
and site-directed and/or random in vitro mutagenesis in concert with physical,
chemical, and biological characterizations. %%% The success of this project will
increase understanding of the structure-function and mechanism of this
photosynthetic bacterial bc1 complex. The knowledge gained from this research
will provide a better understanding of energy transduction mechanisms in the
photosynthetic apparatus, and thus improvement in photosynthetic efficiency and
herbicide design, and will enhance understanding of mitochondrial bioenergetics.
Such an understanding could lead to increasing the efficiency of photosynthesis
and thus increase the renewable energy sources. ***
