The objective of this proposal is to develop a commerically available
instrument capable of obtaining remote measurements of ocean wave directional
spectra. A variety of remote acoustic methods will be evaluated. The proposed
instrument would be moored subsurface rather than on stable, fixed platform as
is the present technology.
