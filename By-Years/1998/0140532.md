This award supports the purchase of eight plant growth chambers and related
equipment to be used for studies of major crop plants including maize, rice and
tomato, as well as studies of other plants whose genetics and physiology are of
general interest. These chambers are suited for high-throughput and large-scale
projects that often require well-defined plant growth conditions, including
light, temperature and humidity, or experimental treatments that are not
possible without modern growth chambers. Planned uses include studies of plant-
pathogen interactions, nuclear-plastid signaling, and light signal transduction
in several major crop plants and in Arabidopsis. Use of such chambers allows
investigators to standardize plant growth conditions that often vary widely from
one research group to another. Such standardization facilitates verification of
results by other investigators, as well as new investigations that build on the
results of previous work.
