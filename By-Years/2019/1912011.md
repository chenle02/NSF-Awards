The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program
provides support to design, implement, study and assess efforts to increase the
numbers of students and the quality of their preparation by strengthening
science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and research.
This project at Cheyney University of Pennsylvania provides a strategic approach
to recruiting and retaining computer science undergraduates by involving them in
research projects that lead to curriculum enhancements in undergraduate courses.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This one-year pilot project seeks to create a set of
research tools and projects to involve undergraduate students in computer
science related research, expose them to learning activities outside of the
classroom, and subsequently capture learning objectives and develop learning
modules to be incorporated into undergraduate computer science courses. The
students will conduct research at the home campus, as well as on the campus of
Drexel University. The project is guided by formative and summative
evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
