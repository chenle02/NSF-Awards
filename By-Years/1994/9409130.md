ABSTRACT 9409130 KAY, Laura In 'unified models' of Active Galactic Nuclei,
orientation effects play a large role in determining what we see and thus how we
classify a given object. One of the missing pieces in these models is the
identification of Narrow-Line (Type 2) QSO's. Optical spectropolarimetry has
been used successfully to show that some Type 2 AGN are in fact obscured Type 1
(Broad and Narrow-Line)AGN. For this project, the principal investigator will
use spectropolarimetry to study 'superluminous' and ultraluminous' Type 2 AGN
identified by IRAS to see if some of them harbor a Type I QSO nucleus
identifiable only in scattered, and thus polarized, light. If a collection of
such obscured quasars is identified, then complementary observations in infrared
and possibly with HST will be planned. Undergraduate students from Barnard
College will participate in this project through independent study during the
academic year or as summer students.
