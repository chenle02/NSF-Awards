There has been extensive academic and industry research, especially over the
last decade on&lt;br/&gt;developing spectrum using concepts and architectures.
These include research on dynamic spectrum&lt;br/&gt;access, spectrum sharing,
co-existence, spectrum databases, new protocols, wireless security&lt;br/&gt;and
others. However, deployable dynamic spectrum sharing technologies do not exist.
The fundamental&lt;br/&gt;issues of spectrum sharing trust and security remain.
It is critical that the research that&lt;br/&gt;has been done and proven in
indoor environments is well understood, collaborated and
transformed&lt;br/&gt;into deployable technologies by industry and government,
even as new research is being initiated.&lt;br/&gt;This calls for open
collaboration between the research communities along with integrated
outdoor&lt;br/&gt;test facilities for performing realistic research
experimentation (augmenting smaller indoor&lt;br/&gt;wireless testbeds across
the nation), across various bands and applications. The
proposed&lt;br/&gt;annual research symposium is needed to create the national
collaboration between the research&lt;br/&gt;and other ecosystem stakeholders.
