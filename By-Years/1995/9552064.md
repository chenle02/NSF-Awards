A Geographic Information System (GIS) laboratory is being developed to
demonstrate ecological principles and processes on large spatial scales and
promote interdisciplinary research by undergraduate students. GIS technology
provides the means for users to input, edit, overlay, analyze, and display any
information that has a spatial component (e.g., streams, roads, vegetative cover
types, animal movements and locations, elevations). As such, GIS is a powerful
tool for studying spatial patterns and relationships. The new laboratory
complements existing laboratory and field studies in environmental biology, but
provides the technology to investigate the influence of landscape and regional
environments on local biotic communities and functions. The laboratory is being
equipped with eight Pentium-PC workstations, digitizing tablets, scanner, color
printer, digitized data sets, and requisite software packages. Multiple
workstations provide access to GIS technology for students enrolled in upper-
division ecology and natural resources management classes and for student
research teams testing hypotheses in landscape ecology. The laboratory is also
being equipped with a mobile Global Positioning System receiver and antenna, so
that students can accurately record and store the locations of study plots and
boundaries for subsequent entry into the GIS system.
