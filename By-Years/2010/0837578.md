Interdisciplinary(99) Flame atomic absorption is being introduced into five
chemistry courses and five biology courses including courses for non-science
majors and into undergraduate research courses. Environmental concerns provide a
common theme whereby students investigate; 1) environmental arsenic occurrence,
2) copper and iron in plant nutrition, and 3) assessment of local watersheds.
Each spring students from all ten courses make presentations at a joint poster
session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project incorporates three prominent trends in
science education: 1) the promotion of undergraduate involvement in authentic
and relevant research science, 2) calls to situate traditional science content
within "real-world" contexts and problems, and 3) a movement towards
interdisciplinary teaching and learning. The project is serving as a national
model for the simultaneous promotion of interdisciplinary research experience
and context-based learning across several courses and curricula.
