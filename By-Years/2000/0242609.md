This project designs, produces and tests two professional development modules on
the big ideas of early algebra. The modules, on themes of generalization and
functions, are part of the "Developing Mathematical Ideas (DMI)," a series
designed for K-8 teachers of mathematics. DMI seminars support teacher learning
of mathematics and of children's mathematical thinking. Five modules have
already been produced on themes of arithmetic, geometry and data. The modules on
early algebra would complete the series. The materials include print and video
cases, mathematics activities for adults, investigations into the mathematical
thinking of participants' own students, analyses of lessons drawn from a variety
of curricula, homework assignments, assessment items and an essay on highlights
of related research. The materials are packaged in three pieces: the
Facilitator's Guide, the Casebook and the Video. Each module is designed for 8
three-hour sessions. In addition to the development of the professional
development materials, the project includes the pilot and field testing of
professional development seminars
