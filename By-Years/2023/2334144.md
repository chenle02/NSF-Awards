The United States is experiencing new rapid population shifts. High housing
prices, the lingering impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, and the pending
retirement of many individuals within the Baby Boomer generation are underlying
factors to population migratory patterns. The impact of such population shifts
is of concern given that many of the areas that are and have experienced rapid
growth are those with historically lower costs of living, are identified as or
near Justice40 disadvantaged areas, and are perceived to have more desirable
climates. Communities experiencing rapid population growth must reconcile the
numerous challenges of development associated with growth and establish
appropriate and timely environmental, economic, and social policy responses. The
proposed planning activities will explore, identify, and establish
interdisciplinary mechanisms for understanding resiliency in rapidly developing
complex systems. Planning participants for the proposed Center for Resiliency in
Rapidly Developing Communities (CCRDC) come from a diverse range methodological
perspectives and disciplines.

Population growth is a contemporary and system level concern for appropriately
and adequately addressing climate change. Rapid population growth, whereby a
region or community experiences a drastic increase in positive net migration, is
particularly concerning given the potential to create or exacerbate climate
change challenges. While the wicked problems concept and the work of Limits to
Growth (e.g., socio-ecological systems or socio engineered-ecological systems)
guides the initial planning efforts, the planning activities establish a basis
for structuring sound basic-science research protocols and plans that can bridge
across various theories and potentially lead to novel contributions to existing
theoretical bases or lead to the creation of new theoretical constructs for
understanding resiliency responses to rapid population growth's effects on
impacted and surrounding communities. The planning activities for the CCRDC
platform provide an opportunity for participant researchers to help define the
scope and approach of the Centerâ€™s future research and outreach activities. This
helps to strengthen the ability to achieve the long-term goal for the CCRDC,
which is to provide timely and appropriate resiliency-based recommendations and
support to communities undergoing current or anticipated future growth. The
project will engage an interdisciplinary set of researchers with the intent to
later engage in transdisciplinary and co-produced research.
