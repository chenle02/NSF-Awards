9514193 Kieda This grant supports cosmic-ray research by a faculty member and a
graduate student. They use a newly developed technique that makes use of two
imaging air-Cerenkov detectors recently put into operation in coincidence with
the existing CASA and MIA air-shower detector arrays at Dugway, Utah. They study
the elemental composition of cosmic-rays at energies in the range. The data are
necessary to distinguish among models for accelerating mechanisms. ***
