Oak Ridge Associated Universities, Inc. (ORAU) requests National Science
Foundation (NSF) support for selection and attendance of US graduate students
and postdoctoral researchers to attend the Heidelberg Laureate Forum (HLF) in
2016. The Heidelberg Laureate Forum takes place annually in Heidelberg, Germany,
and brings 200 young researchers in the computer and mathematical sciences
together from all over the world with a group of typically 30 laureates of the
Abel Prize, Fields Medal, Turing Award, and Nevanlinna Prize, and is patterned
after the Lindau Meeting of Nobel Laureates in the physical sciences. The ORAU
has formalized a partnership with the HLF to organize a U.S. delegation for
participation in the meetings. This proposal requests support for a total of 9
graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in computer
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ORAU proposes to support this program by
promoting and advertising the opportunity; recruiting from and selecting a
diverse pool of applicants; developing and maintaining a program Web site for
recruiting, selecting, information and dissemination; coordinating travel and
orientation activities for participants, and conducting a follow-up survey to
document the program's impact.
