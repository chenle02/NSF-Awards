This project involves the production of single crystals of Fe-Ti oxices. The
necessary apparatus has been constructed for the production of such crystals by
the flux growth method and some magnetite and hematite crystals have produced.
While not yet satisfactory for research pupose, production of such crystals will
be a straightforward mater of working with the various parameters that control
the growth environment until good quality crystals are produced. The crustals
will be used to measure the magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant using ferro-
magnetic resonance spectroscopy (FMR). Initial experiments will be with
magnetite at room temperature and to eventually extend these experiments to the
vicinity of the Curie pont for a variety of compositions.
