National Public Radio is seeking to expand its coverage of scientific issues in
two ways: through the creation of a new Environmental Reporting Unit, and
through the introduction of SCIENCE FRIDAY, a two hour call-in talk show
dedicated to scientific issues. Each of these projects will be supported by an
extensive outreach effort targeted at local schools, community groups, science
museums, and nature centers. Through the Environmental Reporting Unit, NPR plans
to produce eight to ten half hour documentary reports per year on critical
environmental issues. Each of these reports will be available to listeners on
cassette and will be accompanied by supporting documentation. The SCIENCE FRIDAY
team will engage NPR's audience in a lively debate on questions ranging from
nuclear physics to archaeology. In addition, SCIENCE FRIDAY will travel to high
schools and museums across the country and engage in question and answer
sessions with students, teachers, parents and school administrators. These "on
the road" segments will be supplemented by live broadcasts from annual meetings
of the National Association for Science (NAS) and the American Association for
the Advancement of Science (AAAS). Through these efforts, NPR will be able to
draw listener attention to the need for improved science and mathematics
education, while helping listeners make informed evaluations of current public
policy in these areas.
