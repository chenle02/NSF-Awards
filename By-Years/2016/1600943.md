One of the central themes in modern algebraic number theory is that local
information about a mathematical structure can often be pieced together in
surprising ways to yield global information about the structure. The passage
from local to global in number theory is deep, mysterious, and not well-
understood. This general philosophy can be made concrete through precise
conjectures on values of L-series, which are certain functions defined in terms
of the local behavior of mathematical structures. These conjectures assert that
the values of L-series at integers reveal global arithmetic invariants of the
structures. While there are plentiful and very general conjectures regarding
special values of L-series, only special cases of the conjectures have been
proven. This research project aims to generalize these results and deepen
understanding in this important area of number theory.

Some of the most important and well-known conjectures in number theory concern
the special values of L-series, including the conjectures of Birch and
Swinnerton-Dyer, Stark, Beilinson, and Bloch and Kato. For example, the Birch
and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture predicts that the value at s=1 of the L-series
defined in terms of the number of points on an elliptic curve over the integers
modulo p for all primes p carries information on the size of the set of points
of the elliptic curve over the rational numbers. In many cases, the L-series in
question have alternate manifestations known as p-adic L-series, which are
defined by applying a different notion of analysis from that encountered in
standard Euclidean geometry. Special-value formulae for classical and p-adic
L-series hold an important place at the center of modern number theory research.
In this project, the investigator will continue to study conjectures on the
special values of p-adic L-functions. The methods involve studying certain
explicit families of Eisenstein series and build on work on the Iwasawa Main
Conjecture. The project aims to develop new techniques to prove p-adic special-
value conjectures, as well as various generalizations and refinements.
