The Research Experience for Undergraduates program was formed by the National
Science Foundation to provide opportunities for undergraduates to perform
research under the guidance of established researchers. It is hoped that they
will find the experience rewarding, and will be attracted to careers in
research. Two types of awards are supported: site grants, and supplements to
existing research awards. This is a site grant, in which GTE Laboratories, Inc.
will add ten students to the seven students in its existing in-house training
program. While the total seventeen student program will be interdisciplinary,
the ten student NSF-supported portion will consist entirely of computer and
information science projects, with emphasis on networking subjects.
