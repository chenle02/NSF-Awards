This is an SGER proposal to develop and evaluate a new method of bonding strain
gauges to bone; current methods of bonding do not last for a sufficiently long
time to allow an engineering analysis of bone healing. The proposed approach is
to coat the transducer with synthetic hydroxyapatite (closely related to
compounds found in natural bone) to facilitate the development of a strong bond.
Very preliminary experiments have been promising, and the purpose of this
proposal is to optimize and evaluate this technique using in-vivo preparations.
Reliable transducers will contribute significantly to basic engineering studies
into the mechanisms of bone healing.
