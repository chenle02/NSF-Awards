This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is for development of a
passive multispectral imaging system for remote assessment of pelagic fish and
marine mammal stocks. The conservation, management, and rational utilization of
fisheries is becoming an urgent and increasingly challenging problem. Currently,
assessment of pelagic fish stocks are conducted through human visual
observations from aircraft to locate schools of fish, determine their species
and estimate their biomass. These methods are too imprecise and inadequate due
to variability in observer's bias, perceptions and interpretations, and lack an
objective permanent record that can be subjected to quantitative analysis. This
proposal addresses the need for novel instrumentation and methods to acquire
accurate quantitative data on pelagic fish stocks and habitat resources. The
objective of the Phase I project is to build a breadboard prototype of the
remote imaging spectrometer and to evaluate it for its ability to remotely
detect and identify selected species in the laboratory (marine seaquarium).
