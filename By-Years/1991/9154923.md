Chowan College will initiate a three-week, residential, multidisciplinary Young
Scholars project offering science enrichment activities for 20 precollege
students entering grade 10. In this program participants are exposed to a series
of intense hands-on laboratory activities in biology, chemistry, physics and
computer usage. Students attend a lecture/laboratory for approximately three
days in which they learn skills designed to be used in carrying out research
projects. Three days are spent visiting industry and surrounding sights of
ecological interest. The remainder of the time is spent on their research
project. Summaries are written in journal style and the findings presented at a
mock symposium.
