The aim of the Experimental Health Psychology Laboratory project is to provide
undergraduates with the opportunity to investigate interactions among various
factors implicated in the etiology and progression of disease and in the
promotion of health. The laboratory equipment includes a carbon monoxide
analyzer, a breath alcohol analyzer, an accelerometer-based physical activity
monitor, an ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate monitor, and a personal
computer for data retrieval. Behavioral risk factors including cigarette
smoking, alcohol intake, and sedentary lifestyle are known to contribute to the
development of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the United
States. This laboratory will give students the chance to design and implement
experiments that will explore interactions among psychological, behavioral, and
physiological factors that may contribute to the development of disease.
Undergraduate training in Health Psychology is becoming increasingly common, but
the incorporation of extensive laboratory experience in this training has not
been previously reported.
