The objective of this project is to improve the process by which results of
environmental engineering research become available to and acceptable by
engineers for potential application in the engineering design process used to
formulate solutions to environmental problems. To accomplish this objective, the
plan is to analyze experiences that have resulted in both successful and as yet
unsuccessful applications to determine whether there are consistent patterns for
the current status regarding adoption or application. This project is part of
the educational program conducted by the Worcester Polytechnic Institute through
its Washington, D.C. Project Center. Results of this project are expected to be
applied to improving the process by which results of research are made available
to practicing environmental engineers.
