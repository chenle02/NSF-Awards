New and innovative techniques for software development are needed to improve
productivity and enhance reliability. Object-Oriented development offers the
greatest potential for achieving these goals. However, Object-Oriented
techniques have not been widely applied across all stages of the development
lifecycle and Object-Oriented CASE tools are not widely available. A simple
methodology, based upon Object- Oriented techniques and supporting development
through evolution is needed. In this research a series of building blocks will
be developed that can be used to incrementally construct a prototype environment
which supports Object-Oriented, iterative development. To develop these building
blocks, existing Object-Oriented tools and a spiral lifecycle in which several
prototype environments are developed will be used. Thus, this project aims to
evolve Object-Oriented technology and spiral development so that a production
quality, high productivity environment can ultimately be produced.
