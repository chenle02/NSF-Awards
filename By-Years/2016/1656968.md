There are no Point of Care sensing platforms that are available to monitor a
patient's biological response to disease triggers such as airborne irritants and
toxins by direct and rapid profiling of critical biomarkers. There are also no
platforms for monitoring the recurrence of an infectious disease or cancer that
may be present in biofluid samples. Such biomarker-based diagnostics could have
numerous applications in precision medicine. These devices could lead to
personalized treatment strategies for individual patients. This project will
develop such a system that will also be useful for the diagnosis of cancers in
early stages by identifying rare aberrant cells in biological samples taken
during annual physical examinations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will develop a
microfluidic device for single cell analysis that incorporates an out-of-plane
multimode optical fiber to generate three excitation and three detection points
using only one source and one detector. Light will be propagated through the
fiber in a tunneling mode so that two excitation and detection spots can be
generated at the end of the fiber. The efficiency of loading and substrate
specificity will be evaluated, and peptide sequences modified to optimize
loading efficiency.
