This award of $390,000, to the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, is for the
development of an integrated research program on the real-time control of
semiconductor manufacturing processes and for the integration of such research
into new curricula. The effort will improve the capabilities of semiconductor
manufacturing tools to produce consistent, uniform high-yield wafers through the
application of real-time and run-to-run feedback and feedforward control. It
will also create a new academic program for the training of advanced
undergraduate and graduate students in this important area.
