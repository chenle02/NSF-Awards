In recent years, issues of access to scientific data have sparked intense
controversy and public policy debate. Little has been written, however, on how
scientists decide who gets access to which data and under what terms and
conditions. Little has been written about how laws, regulations and policies
shape and are shaped by data access practices. This project provides empirical
study and analysis of this process. Drawing on insights and procedures from
ethnographic studies of scientific laboratories, this project will examine
actual practices of scientists regarding access to data. Using interviewing
methods, the principal investigators will examine access practices in one
scientific specialty: research on molecular structures (e.g., x-ray
crystallography and NMR). They will interview four categories of respondents:
scientists who have been involved in public debate about access to data,
scientists who are "gatekeepers," such as journal editors; other scientists
doing molecular structures research; and attorneys who have been involved in
data access negotiations. The interviews will examine how scientists and others
construct and erase boundaries to access, the relationship between circumstances
and methods of control, and the terms in which scientists and lawyers frame
arguments concerning data access and justify their practices and decisions.
Comparisons will be made with results from a study of practices in molecular
genetics. This proposal comes from a uniquely qualified pair of investigators
who have found appropriate advisors with which to undertake the project. The
topic is a central one in Ethics and Values Studies. Institutional auspices are
very good. The framework and approach to the subject is suitable, and the
research plan good. The project is likely to improve our understanding of how
laws and other social sanctions affect data sharing and acknowledgement. I
recommend support.
