This research will further develop Markov random field (MRF) models for image
processing, pattern analysis, and engineering or scientific data analysis for
decision making. The mathematical models are domain-dependent: discrete MRFs for
image lattices, spatial point processes for patterns in a feature space, and
Markov graphs for proximity data. The researchers will study fundamental
problems of model definition, sampling, parameter estimation, and goodness of
fit, with specific applications in image segmentation and restoration, texture
analysis and synthesis, cluster validation, and multisensor fusion.
