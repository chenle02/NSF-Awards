tract&lt;br/&gt;EEC-021971&lt;br/&gt;Silevitch&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
is in partnership between the ERC for Subsurface Sensing and Imaging Systems
(CenSSIS) at the Northeastern University and the ERC for Computer-Integrates
Surgical Systems and Technology (CISST) at the Johns Hopkins University. The
common objective of the two collaborating groups is to develop core imaging and
computer technologies to assist the physician in the treatment of diseases of
the eye. The two teams will address the problem of integrating a variety of
medical images into a common description in the form of a quantitative
anatomical atlas of the human eye. The research is expected to deliver an
interventional tool to the correct area on the retina, in a manner that
maximizes the dosage to the region of interest and minimizes the dosage to
healthy areas. The ERC at Northeastern University will bring its expertise in
subsurface sensing, and the ERC at the Johns Hopkins University will contribute
its expertise in steady hand robotics. &lt;br/&gt;
