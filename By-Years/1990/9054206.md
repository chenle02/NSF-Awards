The constantly developing field of biotechnology is widely regarded as one of
the most vital scientific areas of potentially great importance. It is essential
that students at institutions of higher education, including community colleges,
four-year colleges and universities, be made aware of the principles and
techniques of this rapidly developing field. The workshop offers to participants
direct exposure to a distinguished research faculty in biotechnology and
provides them with hands-on experiences in the current techniques in both
applied molecular biology and cell culture using state-of-the-art equipment in
an effectively designed teaching laboratory. Participants prepare reagents and
demonstration materials that can readily be used at their home institutions and
design exercises that will be feasible to perform in laboratory courses at their
home institutions. Following the intensive summer program, participants are kept
informed of the newest developments in biotechnology through a specially
designed biotechnology seminar program held on the Rutgers-Newark campus during
the academic year. Invited speakers include prominent research scientists from
academia, from research institutes and from industry.
