Computing on personal data is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it enables
revolutionary new applications such as personalized medicine and disease
prediction. On the other hand, it runs the risk of revealing said personal data
to unwanted parties. For example, using personal data on todayâ€™s processor chips
can reveal that data through traces that the processor leaves behind. To make
matters worse, different processors leave behind different traces, revealing
different information, depending on how they were designed. This project will
develop techniques to prevent data leakage through processors, for existing and
future processor chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical approach is to design
a Distinguishability Set Architecture (DSA) for existing and future processors.
DSAs are peers to existing Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs). Whereas the ISA
specifies the functionality of each instruction, the DSA specifies under what
conditions each instruction reveals secret information. With a DSA, programmers
or compilers can tune sensitive programs to avoid leaking secrets. The first
project thrust will develop DSA foundations, answering questions such as what
should a DSA look like and how to capture leakage through various processor
optimizations. The second thrust will develop compilers and hardware that use
DSAs to improve program security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By precisely describing
when and how processors reveal secrets, DSAs will unlock innovation on both
software and hardware fronts. On the software side, programmers can focus on
applications while DSA-aware compilers translate those applications to secure
variants fit to run on different processors. On the hardware side, architects
can use DSAs to reason about the privacy implications of hardware optimizations.
The project will train a new class of students and researchers who can work
across formal specifications, micro-architecture and compilers to build secure
systems and, in the future, apply the lessons learned to other privacy-related
problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The DSA project will store all publications,
code, and data-sets on public-facing websites, hosted at the University of
Illinois for at least 3 years after the end of the project. This information
will be made available via commercial websites. Links to these websites will be
mirrored at http://cwfletcher.net/dsa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
