EAR-9515216 Lieberman, Bruce S. The proposed research addresses the fundamental
problem of the role that ecological communities play in governing the evolution
of life on earth. The Cambrian radiation is ideally suited as a paleontological
system for studying this process because of the rapid pace of diversification,
and because it marks the first appearance of marine communities and complex
ecosystems containing diverse animals. To explore the relationship between
paleoecological and evolutionary patterns and processes during the Cambrian, the
Fellow will compare those patterns with those documented from later time periods
while considering the environmental changes that accompanied the radiation.
Specifically, did the evolutionary rules governing the rapid Cambrian radiation
when complex communities were absent differ fundamentally from rules that
operated later when communities were well established? The Fellow will draw upon
his own expertise from the study of Devonian fossil lineages; he will apply
paleoenvironmental analyses and multivariate statistical analyses of data on
species distributions to identify paleocommunities and recurrent assemblages,
and determine if they are stable or fluctuating with time. The study will
increase understanding of the unique event in Earth history when animals began
to diversify, and it will elucidate the role communities play in diversification
and extinction.
