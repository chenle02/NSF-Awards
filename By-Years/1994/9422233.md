Technological developments enable science to gather or produce massively complex
data sets which cannot be analyzed or understood via traditional methods.
Instead, computer-intensive modeling techniques are used to gain control of the
data by producing models of data. Data are reduced, refined, and manipulated by
further modeling. The end-products of scientific observation and experiment
increasingly are in the form of models not theories. Models are essential to
experimental design, underlying the design and control of detectors and
experimental conditions. Models developed in one area are used as probes to
investigate other phenomena. simulation models provide an alternative source of
experimental data. Philosophy of science has paid relatively little attention to
such a contemporary modeling practices. Dr. Suppe's first objective in this
research is to provide a detailed understanding of contemporary scientific
modeling practices. Second, he is exploring the implications of contemporary
modeling practices for understanding scientific knowledge. Third he is providing
a formal structural analysis of scientific modeling in terms of mapping and
embedding relations between set-theoretic structures, extend that analysis to a
general analysis that encompasses scientific models, scientific theories, and
metamathematical models, and detail relations between scientific models and
theories. Fourth, he is going to provide the field of Science and Technology
Studies with suitable descriptions and illustrations of contemporary modeling
techniques--which scientists typically do not publish.
