McSwiney TRANSITION: Initiating Change in Mathematics Teaching and Learning
TRANSITION is a 40-month project designed to extend the knowledge and
instruction strategies of 306 grades 3-8 teachers so they can more effectively
support active student learning of mathematics concepts and skills. The project
is a collaboration between local school district members of The Education
Collaborative for Greater Boston, Inc. (EDCO), Education Development Center
(EDC), and TERC research and development firms located in the greater Boston
area. Participants will learn the mathematics and instructional strategies
embedded in exemplary EDC and TERC curriculum units. They will teach four new
units in their classrooms over a period of two years. After one year of the
enhancement, 36 members of the group will be recruited to serve as teacher
leaders. They will receive additional preparation for that building and district
role. The project will foster the professional development of teachers, enhance
the school district's capacity to pilot and adopt new standards-based
curriculum, and support systemic change. The project is supported at $897,093
with a 13% cost-sharing.
