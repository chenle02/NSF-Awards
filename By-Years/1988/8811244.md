Americans have become increasingly concerned with the radiation they are
exposed to in their daily lives. In the 1940's and 50's, x-rays were routinely
used in dentistry, medical exams, even for the purchase of shoes| Routine x-rays
are now greatly restricted and at considerably less dose than previously
accepted standards. The construction of homes over uranium mine tailings in the
West has enriched lawyers in the ongoing litigation. Radon seeping into the
basements of homes, schools and offices from naturally occurring granite
deposits in the East has caused a whole new industry for testing of radiation
levels. Charges of release of radiation from government facilities has brought
congressional investigations. This increased awareness of the hazards of
exposure to radiation has come, in great part, because of the changing standards
of exposure which scientists have established over the years. Dr.Whittemore,
under this grant, will complete his study, started under an NSF dissertation
support award, of the American response from the 1920's to 1970 to radiation
hazards, particularly the establishment and later alterations of radiation
exposure standards. This study is not an attempt to impose contemporary policy
analysis but instead learn how, in actual practice, the scientific, political
and ethical issues interacted. This history of radiation standards in the United
States from the founding of the Advisory Committee on X-ray and Radiation
Protection in 1928 to the disbanding of the Federal Radiation Council in 1970,
when its functions were transferred to the Environmental Protection Agency. The
history focuses on the establishment and revision of the most basic standards
for allowable exposure: "tolerance dose," "maximum permissible exposure" and
"radiation protection guidelines." Research is based primarily on the archives
of the scientific committees which established and revised these standards: the
National Council on Radiation Protection (the modern name of the ACXRP) and the
Federal Radiation Council. In addition to examining the interaction of
scientific, political and ethical issues within each committee, the project will
also provide the opportunity to compare the workings of an independent
scientific institution (the NCRP) with a federal agency (FRC).
