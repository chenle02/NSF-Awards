9508635 Ashman The objectives of this research are to comprehensively evaluate
several hypotheses that stem from theories of the evolution of dioecy (separate
male and female flowering plants) from gynodioecy (hermaphrodites). The wild
strawberry will be used as a model system. The PI will obtain preliminary data
on selection gradients in natural populations by examining plant size, sexual
and attractive (eg. nectar production) characters. She will determine the best
breeding design for quantitative genetic analysis, and evaluate characters
targeted by selection. %%% The research should ultimately offer new insights for
plant population biology and evolution. ***
