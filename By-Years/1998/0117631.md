Sociological theories and studies of the welfare state did much to explain its
unprecedented growth after World War II, but now face another challenge. They
need to account for the current period of crisis, retrenchment, and limits to
growth as well as for previous periods of increasing state capacity. This
project addresses this challenge using the methods of comparative historical
sociology. Concentrating on the tax revolt in the U.S. during the 1970s that led
to a series of dramatic legislative victories, it considers why the movement
emerged when it did, what it did to gain initial policy success, and how it
affected later political debates about taxes and welfare policy. The methods
used involve analysis of both qualitative and quantitative data. First, the
project compares the grassroots protests in the United States with those in
Denmark, and compares both to the lack of such protests in Sweden and Britain.
Second, it compares the varied movement success in California, New York, and
Massachusetts. Third, it uses quantitative event history analyses to explore the
adoption of anti-tax legislation in 27 of 50 states. The results show how the
initial policy success of the tax revolt changed the direction of American
politics and the effectiveness of later challenges to tax policy.
