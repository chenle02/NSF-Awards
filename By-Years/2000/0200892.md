The investigator studies diophantine approximation from the point of view of the
analogy with value distribution of holomorphic curves (Nevanlinna theory), and
vice versa. Specifically, this work includes: (i) work on relating Faltings'
1983 theorem on the Shafarevich conjecture to Thue's method, (ii) work on
finding further applications of the geometric logarithmic derivative lemma,
(iii) a search for a number-theoretic counterpart to the lemma on the
logarithmic derivative, and (iv) technical improvements in proofs using Thue's
method (Dyson's lemma).

This project involves number theory (specifically, solutions of polynomial
equations in integers or rational numbers, as well as related inequalities) and
value distribution theory (inequalities satisfied by power series functions of
one or several complex variables). These two seemingly disparate areas of
mathematics have many phenomena in common. This has been partly explained by a
formal analogy between the two fields, which has led to new conjectures, shorter
proofs of existing theorems, and new theorems. The present project uses this
analogy to further elucidate the underlying structure of number theory, value
distribution theory, and the analogy between the two fields.
