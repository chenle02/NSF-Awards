This project is to hold a conference on December 15-16 in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, to reconcile the diverse results concerning the effect of school
quality on student achievement and employment earnings. This literature forms a
major component of the work on Human Capital, which SBER has launched a major
research initiative. The conference will invite papers which attempt to
replicate prior results using the same data set, but different investigators;
which estimate the same model on different data sets; which estimate previous
used models on new data sets not used heretofor; and which generally aim to
reconcile the past collection of conflicting results. The sharing of data sets
will be an important feature of the papers presented at this conference. The
leading empirical journal in economics, The Review of Economics and Statistics,
has agreed to devote an issue on the conference papers. This project has the
potential of encouraging other journals to publish replications of previously
published studies and of encouraging economists to share their data and
replicate each other's work.
