The Ninth International Conference on Vacuum Ultraviolet Physics (VUV9) will be
held on the Manoa Campus of the University of Hawaii, July 17-21, 1989. This
proposal requests support for that conference. This conference continues a
series of international conferences that have for the past 20 years been held at
three-year intervals. A satellite conference, the Fourth International
Conference on Electron Spectroscopy (ICES4) will be held July 10-14, 1989, at
the same location. The organizers of the two conferences will work together
closely to promote synergism in scientific interchange and resource utilization,
in anticipation of substantial overlap among participants.
