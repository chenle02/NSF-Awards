The scope of contemporary homotopy theory ? the mathematics of shape and
deformation ? has expanded dramatically in recent years, and new tools and
perspectives are needed to understand its features and potential. The PIs will
explore homotopy theory through the lenses of combinatorics (enumerating
structures), operads (parametrizing operations), and algebraic geometry (shapes
described by polynomial equations). The PIs will also support the participation
of a diverse group of undergraduate students in their research by organizing the
Collaborative Mathematics Research Group (CMRG). CMRG participants will produce
novel research results and also engage their local community in mathematics
outreach efforts.

The PIs will investigate operadic, combinatorial, and motivic aspects of
homotopy theory with the aim of producing structural, enumerative, and
computational results. Their projects include the following: (1) Further explore
the combinatorics of model structures on finite categories, especially with an
eye towards Catalan combinatorics of arbitrary type (in the sense of cluster
algebras). (2) Uncover additional structure in the Balmer spectrum of the stable
motivic homotopy category by leveraging a recollement with its Ã©tale variant.
(3) Extend our computational understanding of stable motivic homotopy theory by
computing the slice spectral sequence for the Bachmann-Hopkins connective
Hermitian image-of-J spectrum. (4) Construct a rigid model for E_n-spaces as
commutative monoids in a certain diagram category.
