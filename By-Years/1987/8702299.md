Together with another hormone, gibberellin (GA), abscisic acid (ABA) is known
to regulate the synthesis and secretion of several hydrolytic enzymes, such as
alpha-amylase and protease, that are essential to the post-germination growth of
many cereal grains. As a continuation of Dr. Ho's long term effort to elucidate
the mode of action of plant hormones, he plans an analysis of molecular
mechanisms underlying ABA action in barely aleurone layers--a tissue responsible
for the synthesis of germination specific enzymes. Previous research has
revealed two modes of action of ABA in this system: a postitive regulation to
induce several new proteins, and a negative regulation to inhibit the GA-
induced alpha-amylase. Among the ABA-induced proteins are an alpha- amylase
inhibitor, a lectin like protein, and an abundant 29kD protein. The ABA
inhibition of alpha-amylase synthesis appears to be at both the level of
transcription and the level of mRNA stability. To follow up on these inital
observations, Dr. Ho has proposed three major sets of experiments in this
project to investigate the regulatory processes in ABA induction of new
proteins. He will use recombinant DNA techniques to prepare DNA probes, and use
them 1) to analyze the structures and expression of genes encoding the ABA
induced proteins and 2) to measure the stability of alpha-amylase mRNA and
determine the effect of ABA on the turnover rate of the mRNA. Finally he will
study the molecular processes underlying the ABA-induced degradation of alpha-
amylase mRNA. The plant hormone ABA exerts regulatory roles in several important
physiological and developmental processes such as seed development and
germination, stomatal function, and the response of plants to drought. This
project is aimed at obtaining insights into not only the action of ABA itself
but also its interactions with gibberellin.
