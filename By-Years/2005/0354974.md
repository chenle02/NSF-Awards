Support for the Workshop-"Matching Light Quarks to Hadrons"

This proposal is a request for support to help cover the costs of organizing the
workshop "Matching Light Quarks to Hadrons". It will take place at the Benasque
Center for Science in Spain from July 25-August 13,2004. The funds will be used
entirely to support graduate students, Post-docs and junior faculty who
otherwise could not afford to attend the workshop. The conference will cover
recent progress made in effective field theory in making contact between lattice
QCD and experiment. The workshop will involve scientists in both the particle
theory and nuclear theory communities and is a spin off of a three-month program
held at the Institute for Nuclear Theory. There will be a mix of 50 participants
from the Lattice QCD, chiral dynamics, hadron phenomenology and nuclear theory
communities. The main purpose is to stimulate interactions between experts in
different subfields and to help junior participants to form a 'big picture'
understanding of the issues involved in connecting lattice QCD calculations to
experimental data. The broader issue is to get a better understanding of both
the particle and nuclear physics aspects of QCD.
