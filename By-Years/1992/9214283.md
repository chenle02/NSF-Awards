This award will provide funding for the renovation of a portion of the research
space of the Department of Geology of the University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign. Funding of this renovation will provide substantially improved
facilities for an active group of faculty who have shown the capacity to
effectively use available resources. The space is located in the Natural History
Building, which was built in 1892. Most of the space has not been significantly
renovated since the 1950's or early 1960's and is presently unsuited for modern
research purposes. The space to be renovated is devoted almost entirely to
research and associated research training. It includes laboratories for
sedimentary petrology, paleontology, stable isotope geochemistry, radiogenic
isotope and trace element geochemistry, engineering geology, experimental
mineralogy and petrology, and rock sample preparation. Renovation of this space
will provide 10 of the 19 faculty members of the Department with new or
substantially improved research facilities and will significantly increase their
research capacity.
