This proposal is concerned with the issue of robustness in feedback control. It
has two primary goals: To develop efficient numerical procedures for certain
robust feedback system design problems, and to explore the merits of nonlinear
feedback in robust control. Regarding the first goal, preliminary work indicates
that certain control system design problems can be reduced to simpler
optimization problems involving nonlinear programming with only a finite number
of parameters. This would represent a dramatic improvement over currently
available techniques. This possibility and also the important numerical details
will be investigated. The second goal is aimed at understanding the types of
control system design problems for which nonlinear feedback is substantially
superior to linear feedback. In this context it has recently been demonstrated
that for some design problems in which the plant model has unknown parameters,
nonlinear control offers enormous advantage. However, for situations where the
plant model has substantial unmodeled dynamics, nonlinear feedback is no better
than linear feedback. These results indicate that for many control systems
design problems, the precision to which the plant model is known determines the
type of feedback best suited to control that plant. This principle will be
investigated to determine its validity in specific control design problems.
