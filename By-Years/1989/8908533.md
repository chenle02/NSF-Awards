The PI will prepare high-transition temperature superconductive films by
deposition onto cooled substrates. Reactive sputtering and hot oxygen jet
sputter fabrication techniques will be employed to produce as-deposited high-
quality YBa2Cu3O7-x thin-films. After the initial investigation of the
composition, microstructure and the DC electrical properties, these films will
be patterned into variable thickness microbridges for millimeter-wave detection
and mixing applications. Special emphasis will be given to the repeatability of
the fabrication process as it applies to the transition temperature, critical
current, and properties under radiation. In the second stage of the
investigation, the microbridges will be used as heterodyne detectors in the
millimeter-wave range. We have in our laboratories a good collection of active
devices (sources, oscillators, detectors, mixers, isolators) and passive
components in the 94 GHz range. The first goal will be to investigate the
microwave properties of the microbridges by pumping with an rf source at this
frequency. Then the microbridge will be operated as a mixer. The conversion
efficiency, and mixer noise will be measured.
