This grant provides travel support for students and early-career scientists to
attend a special Symposium focusing on biological aerosols, to be held in
conjunction with the 2011 IUGG (International Union of Geodesy &amp;
Geophysics), to be held 28 June-7 July 2011 in Melbourne, Australia. Motivation
for the symposium comes from a growing recognition of the importance of primary
biological particles (bacteria, spores and pollen) in atmospheric processes,
including processes involved in the formation of clouds and precipitation. This
symposium will explore the current state of knowledge and relevant
challenges/perspectives of future research. In particular, interdisciplinary
connections will be facilitated and emphasized as part of the broad IUGG
forum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of this activity derives from
efforts to increase qualitative and quantitative understanding of processes
regulating Earth's weather and climate, and from growing interface between
traditionally separate scientific disciplines (viz. biology and geophysics).
Broader Impacts of this award will arise through enabling participation of
students and early career scientists in the conference, thereby providing for
the enhanced education and training of the next generation of scientists.
