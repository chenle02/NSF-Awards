This exploratory project will test FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable,
and Reusable) data principles for Open Science purposes in a comprehensive
manner for field station data gathering on the Pacific atoll of Tetiaroa. This
project is a timely opportunity to leverage the new field station on the atoll
of Tetiaroa which has close ties to U.S. institutions through the University of
California, including a nearby NSF Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) site, as
well as international research programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Place-based data
have a unique quality in that they span the sciences and humanities with time
and space (geolocation) acting as foundational metadata used to assign data to
“place” (or nested “places”). The FAIR Island Project will build
interoperability between pieces of critical research infrastructure -- Data
Management Plans (DMPs), research practice, DOIs, and publications contributing
to the advancement and adoption of Open Science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
