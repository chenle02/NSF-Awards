9524050 Nepstad Modeling the effects of seasonal and interannual drought on the
flow of water, carbon and nitrogen through Amazonian forests. Do trees of the
Amazon forest experience significant drought stress? It seems that the answer to
such a basic question should already be known, but, as is the case for many
subjects in tropical ecology, our ignorance is vast. Drought stress in Amazonian
forests is important because it determines how much water passes through the
trees and enters the atmosphere. Knowing how much water the trees use will help
us determine how cutting the forests and creating cattle pastures will affect
flows of water in rivers and transfer of water vapor to the atmosphere. Water
use is also important because it affects how well the trees grow and how much
heat-trapping carbon dioxide the trees remove from the atmosphere. Amazonian
droughts could become more frequent in the future if deforestation leads to a
reduction in rainfall, as some climate models predict. If trees utilize water
stored only in the top one or two meters of soil, as most ecologists and
hydrologists currently assume, it is easy to calculate that water stress must
develop during the 3-5 month dry periods that characterize most of Amazonia.
However, most of Amazonia is covered by very deep soils that can store large
quantities of water to several meters depth, and so the soils may protect the
forest against dry seasons and against unusually dry years. If this is a general
phenomenon, then Amazonian forests may experience significant drought stress
only if a long-term decrease in rainfall occurs as the result of a general
change in climate. In the proposed research, the hypothesis that Amazonian
forests experience drought only during years of very low rainfall will be tested
through field measurements of forests at three places where drought is more or
less severe. The relationship between drought and the activity of microbes in
the soil will also be examined at these sites. In order to integr ate the
effects of drought on plants, microbes, and flows of water, and to make
predictions about other locations in Amazonia and the tropics generally, these
field measurements will be used to adapt a computer model to Amazon ecosystems.
Through comparison of field measurements with model predictions, the effect of
rooting depth, soil properties, and plant type on estimates of tropical forest
water use and forest growth will be determined, laying the basis for an improved
generation of climate and ecosystem models for the tropics. ??
