Proposal Number: 0435130&lt;br/&gt;PI: Nancy Griffeth &lt;br/&gt;Institution:
CUNY &lt;br/&gt;Title: Experimentation Research to Investigate Principles of
Network Interoperability Testing &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's hard to build a computer network that works as
required. A network contains many components, many layers, many protocols, many
kinds of equipment, and many technologies. Despite the difficulty of building
networks, businesses and individuals rely on networks for commerce, information,
and entertainment, requiring them to be correct, efficient, reliable, and
secure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project asks how to test networks for correct
interoperation of their components. The first goal of the project is to develop
the fundamental principles of network testing. The second goal is to use these
principles to develop cost-effective testing methodology and
tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principles of network interoperability testing
must help a tester answers the questions: What test cases are most cost-
effective? How many test cases must be run? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
seeks the answers to these two questions in the context of two approaches to
testing, formal modeling and genetic algorithms. The approaches are being
studied experimentally in the Lehman College networking laboratory, using
equipment typical of enterprise networks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results will
include evaluation of network modeling techniques and tools. They will provide
methodology, algorithms, and tools for generating and executing test cases. The
results will be disseminated through presentations at conferences, papers in
academic journals, and making tools available to industry test
labs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of the project will be to reduce the cost
and improve the quality of network testing. It will also improve understanding
of how to build testable networks. It will help to build future networks that
are more efficient, reliable, and secure.&lt;br/&gt;
