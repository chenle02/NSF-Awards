Disturbance regimes - cycles of fire, flood, drought, and other phenomena - can
reduce animal and plant populations through direct mortality and destruction of
habitat. Evolutionary theory suggests that organisms can evolve strategies for
surviving disturbances, but only if disturbances occur with sufficient
predictability (i.e., regularly in time or in tandem with an environmental cue).
The Southwestern aquatic insect Abedus herberti is ideal for testing this
hypothesis, because at least 36 disjunct populations inhabit streams with flood
regimes ranging from highly predictable (severe flash floods occur in tandem
with rainfall events) to highly unpredictable (floods occur without antecedent
rainfall). Previous research has shown that in streams with predictable flood
regimes, Abedus has evolved the ability detect rainfall and reliably escape
flash floods. This project will use behavioral experiments, mathematical theory,
and molecular techniques to answer the following: How does flash flood
predictability affect the rate and degree of trait evolution? Does gene flow
between populations adapted to different flood regimes interfere with evolution?
How rapidly can populations evolve in response to altered flood regimes?

The project has conservation implications for organisms in flow-regulated
rivers, fire-managed forests, and other ecosystems where disturbance regimes are
being altered by humans. The project will take place in Oregon, Arizona, and
Sonora, and will foster collaborations between US and Mexican biologists and
students.
