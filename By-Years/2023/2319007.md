Urban streams are full of garbage: from plastic wrappers to car tires, from
shopping carts to construction debris. This garbage degrades the local
environment, poses risks to human health, requires repeated volunteer clean up
efforts, and may be a significant source of the plastics and microplastics found
in lakes, oceans, and coastlines. Yet currently, we have a poor understanding of
how garbage moves through and is stored within urban streams, and how it
interacts with sediment, wood, and engineered structures along the way. This
project seeks to address two fundamental questions: (1) what controls where
garbage is found in streams? and (2) what controls what garbage does to channel
form and function? With its wide variety of shapes and material properties,
garbage is likely to behave in ways that are not predicted or explained by
existing models of sediment transport. By measuring how garbage actually behaves
in urban streams, this research will improve these models and advance science
about the physical behavior of materials in streams and rivers. The results of
this research will be useful for guiding litter management in cities and
environmental clean-up and restoration efforts. The project will also provide
educational opportunities for the public at community festivals and
environmental events, as well as undergraduate and graduate students.

This project aims to quantify the geomorphic effects of garbage, or
anthropogenic debris, in urban streams, by investigating the controls on its
distribution and the changes that it produces. Geomorphic assessments, including
quantification of anthropogenic macro-debris (>5 cm), conducted in an extensive,
multi-city set of stream reaches will quantify its distribution within and
across urban stream reaches and its interaction with other stream elements. Time
lapse photography and repeat surveys of large debris, streambed topography, and
sediment size will quantify debris mobility and geomorphic change as a function
of geomorphology and hydrology. Flume experiments will identify the effects of
debris properties and interactions among objects on the transport mechanics and
geomorphic effects of anthropogenic debris. The field and laboratory work in
this project will inform generalizable understanding of how material properties
influence the geomorphic function of objects in fluvial systems.
