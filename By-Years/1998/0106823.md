Abstract for proposal EAR0106823 (PH #5x)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Dynamic-
Stochastic Modeling of Earthquake Rupture and Strong Ground Motion
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Greg Beroza Stanford
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this study we will develop an earthquake
source model that simultaneously satisfies: (1) a previously derived stochastic
model of the distribution and variability of slip on the fault consistent with
observations of past earthquakes and (2) a simple physical model of the
earthquake source that characterizes dynamic rupture by the distribution of
stress drop and fracture energy. The result will be a model for earthquakes that
is consistent with both observations of the earthquake source and rupture
dynamics. This will provide a complete description of the earthquake source that
includes variability in the slip distribution, rupture velocity, rise time, and
shape of the slip velocity function in a self-consistent way. We will use this
stochastic-dynamic source model to predict the level and variability of strong
ground motion for scenario earthquakes. The use of a stochastic source
description and output that consists of a suite of possible ground motion time
histories, will merge naturally with the probabilistic approach that is usually
adopted for seismic hazard analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
