The focus of this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry Program is the preparation of new organometallic compounds which
contain unpaired electrons. The new compounds are expected to include some which
are useful as catalysts for the oxidation of organic molecules. Chromium(III)
alkylidenes will be prepared by deprotonation of cationic alkyl precursors. Full
characterization and elucidation of their reactivity will be pursued in parallel
to their application in ring opening metathesis polymerization of functionalized
olefins. The preparation of alkyls of chromium(II) and chromium(IV), and of
paramagnetic chromium hydrides, will be attempted also, and the reactivities of
these new compounds toward insertion of small unsaturated molecules into the
carbon-chromium bond will be explored. Previous work in the area of cobalt(IV)
and cobalt(V) alkyls will be extended to new alkyl groups and new coordination
geometries. For example, stabilization of these high oxidation states by
coordination to the pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligand will be explored. Another
extension will aim at the preparation of tetrahedral cobalt oxo complexes, which
would be used in oxidations of organic substrates. Tris(pyrazolyl)borate ligands
will be utilized to stabilize high-valent cobalt in an attempt to develop
oxygenation catalysts which utilize dioxygen.
