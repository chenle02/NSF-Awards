In the work proposed here, four researchers at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
work in teams with postdocs and graduate students to solve inverse problems. The
goal is to identify material properties or surface features from indirectly
related data sets. Each problem is modeled as an elastic, electromagnetic, or
acoustic medium and the mathematical model is strongly taken into account to
develop solution techniques. Two of the four problems to be considered are: (1)
find variations in stiffness in biological tissue so that regions that are
abnormal (usually with 7 to 17 times stiffer than normal tissue) can be
identified. The model is the equations of elasticity and measurement of low
frequency propagating shear waves using Doppler ultrasound provide the data.
Noise reduction, use of models with random media, determination of the minimum
size of abnormal regions that can be identified, reconstruction algorithms and
images are all targets of this investigation; and (2) create radar images from
satellite or airborne radar equipment by developing solutions that correct for
deviations from ideal flight paths, that correctly identify object positions
(break left-right symmetry problems) and that can image objects that are moving.
The problems involve establishing mathematical results, utilizing engineering
expertise and development and implementation of numerical algorithms.

In this work, four principal investigators, together with postdocs and graduate
students, solve problems where noninvasive sensing is followed by the creation
of images. To solve these problems, the researchers work in teams to combine
mathematical analysis, engineering and numerical computation to achieve results.
Two of the problems that will be addressed are: (a) elastography with ultrasound
measurements of tissue movement created by a second low level propagated signal
yields data that can distinguish the stiffer tissue of cancerous tumors from
normal tissue. The goal, then, is to determine algorithms for computing the
location of the stiff and normal regions, to find the minimum size of regions
that can be identified, and to create images in 'real time'; (b) airborne and
satellite topographic and object sensing where signals reflected from the
earth's surface are used to locate positions of objects and topographic
features. The goal is to improve resolution and accuracy, to reduce the size of
objects and features that can be identified and to correctly represent features
that are partially hidden from view.
