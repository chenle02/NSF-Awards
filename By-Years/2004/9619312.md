ECS-9619312 Wollenberg There Is a looming crisis in power engineering education,
which if not addressed, will leave the nation with far too few engineers with
adequate training to run the nation's power systems. This crisis is fueled by
revolutionary changes in the power industry, declining student enrollments, and
the lack of resources for curricular reform at universities. The future
employment picture for engineering graduates in power-related areas is very
promising and encouraging. A carefully crafted partnership between universities
and the electric power industry, with a small investment of funds from the
government can meet the unique technical human resource needs of the electric
power industry that is vital to national well being. At the University of
Minnesota, we have been studying the restructuring of our power engineering
curriculum. In response, a nine-point initiative is proposed whose components
are listed below. 1. Early (high school - college freshman) elicitation of
student interest. 2. Broad-Based Power Engineering Education. 3. A major
revision of undergraduate core courses in power engineering. 4. Innovative
Hardware and Simulation Laboratories. 5. New Graduate-Level Courses. 6.
Industrial Participation. 7. Continuing Education (Life-Long Learning) for
Practicing Professionals. 8. Development of Educational Material and Plans for
Dissemination. 9. Periodic Evaluation of our Program by Outside Experts.
