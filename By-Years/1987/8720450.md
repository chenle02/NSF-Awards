This award to Professors Loh, Cassiday and Sokolsky of the University of Utah
is for the continued operation and upgrade development of the "Fly's Eye"
facility. This unique apparatus measures the nitrogen fluorescence light
produced in cascades in the atmosphere initiated by ultra-high energy cosmic
rays. The experiment studies the energy spectra and chemical composition of
these cosmic rays. The award also supports the initial design and prototype
development stages of a upgrade of the facility to make a ten-fold increase in
its sensitivity. This facility has already produced exciting new results which
bear on the interaction of the cosmic rays with the three degree photons left
from the "big bang" and on the mechanism of accelerating particles to energies
much higher than ever achieved with a man-made device. In the future, it will
achieve greater sensitivity and may detect the presence of cosmic strings.
