Knowledge of the localization of subcellular, diffusible substances at the
electron microscope level is very important for understanding of cellular
physiology. The technical approaches required to obtain this information, have
thus far been applied chiefly to animal cell systems. The lack of such studies
of plant tissues is due primarily to difficulties in specimen preparation
related to the presence in plant cells and tissues of features such as cell
walls, intercellular air spaces, and large vacuoles. For microanalysis it is
critical that subcellular elements of interest not be altered in any way
(addition, subtraction, movement, masking) by the specimen preparation
procedures. Thus, a substantial investment of time and effort is required to
develop the necessary technology for application to plant systems. The proposed
research will adapt existing animal cell methods and, as necessary, develop
additional techniques for the cryofixation, ultrathin sectioning, and analysis
of frozen- hydrated plant specimens. If successful, the development of these
techniques will permit analysis of elemental composition and localization of
elements of physiological importance in plant cells. This fundamental
information will be of great importance to the understanding of plant cell
biology.
