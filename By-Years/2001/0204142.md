Culler and Shalen are continuing to investigate consequences of
their&lt;br/&gt;work on the character variety of a knot group. This involves
studying&lt;br/&gt;the relationship between the boundary slopes of a knot and
the&lt;br/&gt;topological properties of essential surfaces that realize
the&lt;br/&gt;slopes. It also includes their ongoing project with Dunfield and
Jaco&lt;br/&gt;about smallish knots in non-Haken manifolds, which is part of
a&lt;br/&gt;program to prove the Poincare Conjecture. A joint project by
Agol,&lt;br/&gt;Culler and Shalen, concerning the construction of covering
spaces of a&lt;br/&gt;triangulated 3-manifold by an inductive process, is also
relevant to&lt;br/&gt;this program. Agol is also continuing his work on
geometric finiteness&lt;br/&gt;of geometrically defined subgroups of knot
groups, volume estimates&lt;br/&gt;for non-fibered Haken manifolds and
hyperbolic orbifolds, and the&lt;br/&gt;complexity of algorithms in 3-manifold
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fundamental problem in many areas of mathematics
is to classify all&lt;br/&gt;examples of a certain type of mathematical object.
The objects of&lt;br/&gt;study in this proposal are 3-manifolds, which are
mathematical models&lt;br/&gt;of 3-dimensional spaces. Since our universe is a
3-dimensional space,&lt;br/&gt;the classification of 3-manifolds is directly
related to our&lt;br/&gt;understanding of nature itself. The classification
problem for&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds is far from solved, but the work of many
mathematicians&lt;br/&gt;over the last 25 years has at least produced a
conjectural&lt;br/&gt;answer. Remarkably, the conjectures, if true, will provide
a&lt;br/&gt;unification of the most classical, rigid kind of geometry---both
the&lt;br/&gt;Euclidean version first studied by the ancient Greeks and
the&lt;br/&gt;non-Euclidean kind that constituted an exciting discovery in the
19th&lt;br/&gt;century---and topology, a subject devoted to studying much
more&lt;br/&gt;flexible geometric structures, which until recently had
developed&lt;br/&gt;quite independently of the more classical theories. The
work&lt;br/&gt;supported by this grant forms part of the effort to verify
the&lt;br/&gt;conjectured geometric classification of 3-manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;
