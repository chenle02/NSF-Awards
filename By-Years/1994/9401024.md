9401024 Grosz This award provides support for the development of a new
generation computing facility to support experimental research in ubiquitous
information systems. The equipment infrastructure includes Asynchronous Transfer
Mode (ATM) networks, file servers capable of handling video, and graphics
workstations with advanced human interface capabilities. The research topics to
be explored span the development of new technologies that support rapid
transmission of large amounts of data between computer systems to the
development of more flexible and adaptable systems for humsn-computer
communication.
