It is proposed to continue a program of research on quantum liquids at ultralow
temperatures. Using a rotating submillikelvin refrigerator, experiments will be
carried out on the dynamics of liquid 3He. In addition, one will study
superfluidity in very thin films of the liquid, and conduct a search for exotic
superconductors in the mK region.
