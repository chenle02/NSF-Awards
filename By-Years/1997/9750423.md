A cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometer for trace level (> 10 ppb) mercury
determinations and a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer for
determination of other heavy metals (> sub ppb) are providing information on the
concentrations of metals in water, waste water, and sediments to collaborative
geoscience, chemistry, and environmental science projects. The instrumentation
is used in the Departments of geology, Chemistry/Biochemistry, and in the
Environmental Studies program to enhance the laboratory curricula. This
instrumentation facilities collaboration between the college and outside
organizations. The identifying theme of the project is the determination of
trace metals in the waters and sediments of Lake Champlain. The location of the
college near the lake, makes it a natural laboratory for course work and
undergraduate research. Access to this unique opportunity is enhanced by a 32
foot research vessel owned by the college. Samples include sewage sludge, lake
sediments, lake and river water, zebra mussels, and game fish. These samples are
providing information necessary to determine the origin, transport, and ultimate
fate of metals in this ecosystem. *
