The bacterial histone-like protein HU has been primarily characterized in
Escherichia coli. In addition to its role in genomic DNA compaction, E. coli HU
has also been shown to participate in processes such as DNA repair and
recombination. However, the range of DNA-binding properties ascribed to HU
orthologs in vitro suggest that they serve distinct roles in vivo. A comparative
approach to identifying molecular determinants of substrate specificity is
implemented. The hypothesis is that the two kinks imposed by HU proteins are
'hinges' that must be secured, and that preference for distorted DNA occurs only
if stabilizing contacts are insufficient to secure the hinges in perfect duplex
DNA. Site-directed mutagenesis and electrophoretic techniques will be used to
measure binding affinity, substrate specificity and site size. Proteins will
include HU from Bacillus subtilis and from the hyperthermophile Thermotoga
maritima. The hypothesis will also be considered that wrapping of DNA about the
surface of HU proteins requires disruption of surface salt bridges. This
hypothesis will be evaluated experimentally using the HU homolog TF1, a
sequence-specific homolog encoded by a Bacillus bacteriophage, and HU from T.
maritima by systematically modifying charged surface residues and measuring
binding constants and their salt-dependence. This program focuses on integrating
research and teaching by offering the opportunity for both graduate and
undergraduate students to acquire research experience and proficiency in
techniques associated with analysis of protein-nucleic acid interactions.
Graduate students will be integral to developing these research projects, and
minority undergraduate students will continue to contribute to related projects.
