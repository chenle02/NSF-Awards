9403812 WILLIAMSON This proposal seeks Phase II funding to complete the
feasibility assessment for the remote control deepsea core sampling tool
initiated in Phase I. The design presented utilizes proven land drilling tools
and techniques to obtain cores 50 to 100m into hard rock and sedimented
seafloors at locations as deep as 4000m. The proposed drill can be deployed from
ships-of-opportunity utilizing conventional deck handling equipment currently
available on most UNOLS vessels. The Phase II effort will construct and test and
field trials. The prototype device will be used to obtain multiple, full-scale
samples from soft clays to hard rock substrate. The successful completion of the
Phase II program will lead to the commercialization (Phase III) and full
implementation of a seafloor coring tool capable of obtaining samples previously
available only through use of a drill ship. The proposal drill will provide a
cost effective seafloor sampling technology to the research community and
offshore industry.
