0427483&lt;br/&gt;Szivek&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop and utilize an
integrated sub-miniature implantable strain measurement and transmission system,
which can easily be placed into a scaffold as a part of a joint resurfacing
procedure. This will be done by developing, fabricating, and testing a
subminiature telemetry unit with integrated sensors, which will be calibrated to
provide load and pressure measurements.
