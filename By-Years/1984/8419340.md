The goal of this research is to develop a three-dimensional model of the
extrusion cooking process for soy flour and other food doughs. This model will
predict extrudate temperature, mass flow rate, residence time distribution, and
thermal history in the extruder, all of which are factors affecting extrudate
texture as a function of screw and die design, screw RPM's, and barrel
temperature profile. The model to be created by this research will be helpful
for extrusion process optimization and extruder scale-up.
