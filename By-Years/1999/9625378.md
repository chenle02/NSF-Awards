Dr. Peter K. Dorhout, Department of Chemistry, Colorado State University, is
supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of the
Chemistry Division under a Faculty Early Career Development Award for studies of
the use of Zintl ion building blocks in material synthesis. Lanthanide Zintl ion
materials will be synthesized using a building block concept whereby known Zintl
phase structures are examined as precursors to and reactants for new materials.
New lanthanide selenodiphosphate and selenoantimonate compounds will be prepared
from molten salt reactions at moderate temperatures. These materials are
expected to show thermoelectric and/or antiferromagnetic behavior, and these
properties and their theoretical basis will be examined. The educational plan is
aimed at developing new laboratory experiments in X-ray diffraction and thermal
analysis, a new course in solid state chemistry, and an undergraduate research
program. Unique combinations of elements from various portions of the periodic
table can result in solid state materials with new and useful properties. The
synthesis of these types of materials is frequently approached in an empirical,
trial-and-error fashion by combining the elements at high temperature. This
proposal combines Zintl ions, negatively charged clusters of main group
elements, with lanthanide metals in a systematic and rational building block
approach. This approach is aimed at developing low temperature synthetic routes
to these materials, and a fundamental understanding of the basis for the
observed physical properties of these materials. These materials may posess
unique conducting and magnetic properties, and the advances in synthetic
methodology and in the theoretical understanding of these systems will allow for
the design of new materials with predictable physical properties. The
educational plan focuses on curriculum development, student mentoring, and
research.
