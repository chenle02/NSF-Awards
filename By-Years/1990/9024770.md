This is a 3-year major portion of the inventory of all caterpillars, their host
plant relationships, and their parasitoids in the tropical dry forest of the
Guanacaste Conservation Area in northwestern Costa Rica. The inventory results
are designed to make caterpillars and their trophic relationships with food
plants and parasitoids available to basic studies in ecology, systematics,
behavior, physiology and evolution, and to applied users in natural products
chemistry, education, and pest management. The overall goal is to establish this
biological system as an integral part of the non-destructive sustainable use of
a complex tropical wildland by science and by Costa Rican society. Specifically,
this project will accomplish the following. Locate, rear and characterize the
caterpillars of a minimum of another 500 species of macromoths (and some
butterflies), and a minimum of another 335 species of microlepidoptera, so as to
yield a total of approximately 1450 species characterized for this forest. This
is approximately half of its caterpillar fauna. All information will be stored
in computerized data bases; Maintain and enlarge the current collecting of
voucher material for all rearings, and increase the number of duplicates so as
to be able to easily donate specimens to studies of taxonomy and morphology of
caterpillars and pupae; Publish field guides in Spanish and English to the
caterpillars of this forest, family by family, as the rearing for each family is
complete or nearly so; Publish survey papers listing the host plant records for
all of the species reared, papers listing the parasitoids reared from the
caterpillars collected in the field and papers on caterpillars and parasitoid
natural history.
