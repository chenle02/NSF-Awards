A grant has been awarded to the University of Minnesota Duluth under the
supervision of Drs. Stephanie Guildford, Randall Hicks and Julie Etterson for
the purchase of a flow cytometer to be used for scientific research in both
aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem ecology. Flow cytometry is a process that
enables scientists to count, sort and characterize microscopic size particles.
Dr. Guildford will employ the new instrument in projects that quantify the
contribution of photosynthetic bacteria to the overall productivity of Lake
Superior and in projects to examine environmental factors that determine whether
the genes for toxin production are expressed in toxic photosynthetic bacteria
such as Microcystis, a toxic cyanobacteria that has reached nuisance proportions
in parts of the North American Great Lakes since the invasion of the zebra and
quagga mussels. Dr. Hicks will use the instrument in his great lakes research
which addresses the pivotal role of bacteria in the cycling of nitrogen in the
world?s largest lake and to further his investigation into the ecology of
aquatic Archaea that have become an important paleoclimatic tool for
interpreting past climate conditions. Dr. Etterson will use this instrument to
characterize the abundance and distribution of plants with different genome
sizes in a polyploid goldenrod and other native species. She will use this
information to further our understanding of the relationship between genome size
and adaptation to climate change.

The broader impacts of this award include the the advancement of knowledge
across the biological sciences and the training of new scientific investigators.
These efforts will enable new collaborations at the University of Minnesota.
Students will receive training on the instrumentation through coursework and
research activities providing them with access to cutting-edge research tools.
