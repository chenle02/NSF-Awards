&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Capacitively actuated and sensed microcantilever arrays
have great promise as a basic micro-electro-mechanical device. We investigate
novel dynamics and controls inspired schemes for overcoming two major problems
inherent in such devices. We propose to use current measurements in an indirect
sensing sensing scheme by using a dynamical model of the cantilever to build a
state estimator for measuring cantilever displacement, thus avoiding the
potentially corrupting secondary sensing signal now commonly used. We also
propose to build and control tightly coupled arrays of such cantilevers where
the significant inter-cantilever coupling is compensated for (rather than
avoided) by using distributed feedback loops.&lt;br/&gt;
