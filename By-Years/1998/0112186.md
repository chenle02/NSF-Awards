The investigators will produce a comprehensive picture of the coronal mass
ejection (CME) phenomenon as viewed at radio wavelengths from lift-off at the
sun through the response of the terrestrial magnetosphere to its passage. The
main effort is to continue to synthesize radio data from the Wind and Ulysses
spacecraft, SOHO coronagraph data, ground-based data, and corollary measurements
from instruments monitoring the solar wind and energetic particle environment.
The work builds on several significant advances made in a previous award from
NSF. The investigators developed triangulation methods that permit investigators
to track the sources of radio waves (CMEs and finite regions along their
boundaries) as they move out from the sun long after they cease to be visible to
SOHO instruments. With this technique, regions where the radio waves originate
are identified to allow detailed study, using the multiple supporting datasets,
of the physical processes that produce the waves.
