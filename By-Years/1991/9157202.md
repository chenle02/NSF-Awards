This PYI award is to improve thebasic understanding and the application of
optical spectroscopy to biomedical problems. Fluorescence and reflectance
spectroscopy are powerful techniques for analyzing the chemical composition of
tissues noninvasively. As a first step, the PI will analyze the information
contained in a fluorescence spectrum from a multi-component, scattering tissue.
Using imaging techniques, methods will be developed for characterizing the
tissue as a function of position within the sample. It is expected that the
proposed research will significantly enhance the treatment of diseases (such as
atherosclerosis and neoplasia) where a quantitative understanding of tissue
composition is essential.
