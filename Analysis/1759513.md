This award provides partial funding for the international conference "Nonlinear
Waves" to be held at Brown University, May 14-18, 2018. Nonlinear wave equations
provide a mathematical description for a broad range of natural phenomena. The
purpose of the conference is to bring together leading experts in a wide variety
of areas connected to nonlinear waves, from kinetic equations, to water wave
theory, to classical nonlinear dispersive waves. This conference will be
especially beneficial for junior researchers who will be able to interact with
the world leaders in the field. The conference will provide an opportunity for
students and junior researchers, including those from underrepresented in
mathematics groups (women, minorities), to get abreast with the latest
achievements

This conference has two goals: (i) to survey recent exciting new developments in
various domains pertaining to conservative evolution partial differential
equations, with a particular emphasis on communicating the results and methods
from one domain to other mathematical domains which are closely related but
different, (ii) to identify and highlight promising future research directions
in nonlinear waves. A wide array of mathematicians at different levels of their
career are expected to attend this conference.  The conference website is:
