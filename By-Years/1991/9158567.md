This award provides support under the National Science Foundation's Presidential
Young Investigator Awards Program. The objectives of this program is to provide
research support to the Nation's most outstanding and promising young science
and engineering faculty. The awards are intended to improve the capability of
U.S. academic institutions to respond to the demand for highly qualified science
and engineering personnel for academic and industrial research and teaching.
This award will allow the investigator to pursue her research in the area of
financial economics. She will continue and extend her work focusing share-holder
behavior, risk taking, and stock value. She will examine the inception and
disagreement, the strategic manipulation of disagreement, and the effect of
stock holder disagreement on firm decision making and the design of securities
and corporations. This general line of research will provide a new understanding
of the role of the firm, of investor decision making and of securities and their
markets. It will also improve our ability to organize and regulate markets, to
create financial innovation, and to understand the effects of tax policy on
investor and corporate behavior.
