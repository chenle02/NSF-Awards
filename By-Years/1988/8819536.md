This award will provide funds for three faculty, one senior research associate,
one research assistant and three graduate students to continue their research in
elementary particle physics. 1. The group has been the originator and major
contributor of a Positron Electron Project Time Projection Chamber (TPC) two
gamma experiment at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). The
experiment has already provided unique results on charm production in gamma
collisions but due to lack of integrated luminosity many aspects of two photon
physics have been left untouched so far. With the modified TPC vertex detector
and with the higher luminosity expected at SLAC this experiment is well suited
for resolving some of the remaining problems (annihilation - B physics). 2. The
efforts of the group include also a monopole search using large arrays of
proportional chambers with a He gas mixture. The experiment has set nice limits
at low beta but will run for another year to improve statistics. 3. A
calorimeter R&amp;D has also been started by the group in collaboration with
CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research in Switzerland) and NIKHEF (the
Netherlands Institute for High energy Physics in Amsterdam). A new
configuration, the "spaghetti" calorimeter, has been well received by the high
energy physics community since it appears that radiation damage problems are
under control. Results will be important for future detectors at SSC, LEP 200,
etc.
