This project will continue the operation of the all sky camera at South Pole
Station. The grant also provides for the processing, analysis, and
interpretation of the data. The images are used in conjunction with other
instruments on site to study the aurora and other atmospheric and ionospheric
phenomena. It is expected that the investigator will actively collaborate with
other investigators as well as make use of data from other instruments at the
site and spacecraft data.
