The efficient processing of spatial data plays an important role in solving
problems in computer vision, robotics, and computer graphics. The acquisition of
spatial data as well as its processing will be investigated. The acquisition
will be concerned with data useful for cartographic applications (e.g.,
terrains) and maps in general. In the case of maps, the interest is in the
acquisition of relative spatial information (e.g., based on a map's legend)
rather than precise information (e.g., locations of cities, roads, etc.). An
investigation into the concept of a hypermap and the related representation
issues will be conducted. Other problems include the investigation of
hierachical surface representations, large spatial databases (especially those
including line segments). Attempts will be made to parallize any algorithms that
are developed and they will be tested on the Connection Machine.
