Professor Farrar is supported by a grant from The Physical Chemistry Program to
develop new methods for the determination of molecular structure in solution
using NMR spectroscopy. The structures of several small molecules of chemical
interest will be studied as a function of solvent, pH and temperature. Professor
Farrar has shown for the first time that it is possible to measure chemical
shift tensors in solution. Previously this was only possible for molecules in
the solid state. Furthermore, he has developed techniques for simultaneously
obtaining bond lengths, chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) values, and molecular
correlation times for two spin systems in solution. Data of this type provide an
important data base with which to test various ab initio theories for the
calculation of chemical shift tensors.
