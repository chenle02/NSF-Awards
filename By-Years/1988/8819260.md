The major objective of this project is to study certain aspects of the
development and biochemical genetics of a small marsupial (the gray short-tailed
opossum) which has recently been adapted as a laboratory animal. The only fully
pedigreed colony of marsupials in the United States has been established, and
this provides the resource for genetic studies not otherwise possible. Because
the newborn marsupial is still in a fetal stage, it is an excellent animal model
for developmental studies. This research program will study the development of
the immune system and the genetic control of various enzyme systems. Since
marsupial and placental mammals had a common ancestor more than a million years
ago, these studies should shed light on the origin and specialization of these
biological systems. This research at an undergraduate institution will also
involve bright undergraduate students in basic research with a view toward
interesting them in careers in science.
