The proposed project will be held on February 25-28, 1990 at the Banbury Center
to review the present state and future prospects for Mapping the Genomes of
Domestic Animals and for determining linkages to traits of importance in
livestock production. The meeting will consider three major topics: 1) to
determine the state of the art for analyzing large genomes, with reference to
the techniques and strategies being pursued in other organisms; 2) to identify
possible associations with gene mapping programs in other species and countries,
as well as the various human genome projects in the U.S.A. and abroad; and 3) to
assess the national resources and needs in the area and to lay the foundations
for a collaborative national program for Mapping the Genome of Domestic Animals.
