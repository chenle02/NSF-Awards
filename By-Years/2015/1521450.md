The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I is the development of a disruptive manufacturing
technology that will enable a new class of nanomembrane-based electronic devices
to be assembled and integrated on flexible substrates. This innovative
technology promises to provide flexible electronics developers and manufacturers
a new option for fabricating a wide range of flexible devices that require the
integration of high-performance semiconductors. It is anticipated that printing
tools and processes based on this core technology will significantly lower the
technological barriers that are hindering the widespread manufacture of next-
generation flexible devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a direct printing tool that
surpasses the available technologies in terms of both precision and scalability.
Current flexible device manufacturing processes do not have the capabilities
needed to realize high-performance flexible devices through the integration of
high-quality semiconductor materials. Therefore, new strategies are required for
fabricating and printing the thin device layers that are essential in emerging
high-performance flexible electronics. This project will involve mechanics
simulations,tool design and fabrication, process experiments to meet resolution
and yield metrics, and establishment of design constraints and operating
conditions for a manufacturing process.
