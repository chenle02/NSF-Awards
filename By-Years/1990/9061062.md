Exfluor Research Corporation has recently developed a technology for preparing
mono- and di-basic perfluorocarboxylic acids in very high yields. The carboxylic
acid functionality can be converted to various other functionalities such as
alcohols, amines, halides, sulfonates, etc. which can then be used as
fluorocarbon intermediates for the synthesis of high-performance
fluorelastomers. This approach offers many advantages over the more classical
routes to fluorocarbon elastomers. Namely, polymers made in this manner should
be considerably less expensive. Efforts will be made to synthesize medium-
molecular-weight (800-5000) perfluoropolyether dibasic carboxylic acids using
newly developed direct fluorination technology. The research will focus on
optimizing the fluorination conditions so that well defined products can be
obtained in high yields. In order to accomplish this, side reactions leading to
cross-linking, chain degradation, and loss of acid functionality must be
avoided.
