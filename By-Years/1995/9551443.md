This project develops robotic vision and thermal spray industrial systems at the
university's Robotics and Automation Laboratory. This enhances both the teaching
and training activity level to incorporate actual industrial applications. In
order to manufacture products competitively, engineering and engineering
technology students must have the technical skills and appropriate methodology
in order to design products and applications in the modern automated industrial
environment. The new equipment directly affects robotics and automation,
computer-integrated manufacturing, system integration, control systems, senior
projects and thermal spray interdisciplinary courses offered on these three
campuses. In addition, this equipment is part of the university's center for
technical education and distant learning to disseminate interactive educational
robotics courses to local universities, community colleges, and nationwide
audiences.
