This award supports a fission-track study of basement rocks of central and west
Spitsbergen. The study will test ideas about the uplift history of Spitsbergen
with respect to three tectonic provinces identified in the central and western
part of the island complex. The goal of this research is to understand the
uplift and exhumation history of Spitsbergen in terms of regional plate
kinematics in the North Atlantic region.
