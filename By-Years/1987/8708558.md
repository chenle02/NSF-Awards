Relative motion between plates has been detected and quantified in a number of
ways, particularly for the Cenozoic and Mesozoic. This project will extend this
work with special attention to the accumulated errors involved in past plate
position reconstructions. The use of covariance matrices to describe the errors
in plate rotations appears useful and will be applied to all reconstructions
performed. Plate reconstructions will be extended back to the Mesozoic Era, the
earliest time for which significant seafloor remains. This longer time history
of plate motions, and analysis of these, will provide a better opportunity to
study the evolution of these motions and will improve our understanding of which
features are characteristic of plate tectonics and which are transitory and
accidents of a single geometry or time interval.
