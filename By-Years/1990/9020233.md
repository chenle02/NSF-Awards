The project examines the formation of precritical molecular clusters in
metastable supersaturated aqueous solutions of glycine, NaCl, KCl, and NH4Cl.
These molecular clusters affect solution properties such as viscosity and
diffusivity and plays an important role in nucleation and crystal growth. A
Spherical Void Electrodynamic Levitator is used to obtain highly supersaturated
droplets. The size distribution of clusters in these droplets is measured
directly by quasielastic light scattering. The data are used to resolve certain
important outstanding problem in nucleation theory, involving cluster size and
evolution. The results of this interdisciplinary project, by one chemical
engineer and one physicist, are important for better understanding and designing
crystallization process for separation and purification of many industrial and
pharmaceutical products.
