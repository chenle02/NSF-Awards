This project is a study of Code-Division Multiple-Access communication over
fading multipath channels. The overall objective of the research is to design
and analyze practically implementable adaptive receivers for reliable,
bandwidth-efficient, and near-far resistant communications. The feasibility of
the project is established via new results in receiver design and analysis that
achieve these objectives for the nonselective fading, synchronous CDMA channel
with memory. Receiver complexity is of fundamental importance in CDMA
communication and the new idea of group detection is proposed to address that
issue. It is shown that the adaptive receiver designed for the fading channel
with memory far outperforms the conventional spread spectrum receiver. This
research will consider the development of schemes that will realize the
practically achievable limits of bandwidth-efficient CDMA communication over
general fading multipath channels. Analytical tools from the theories of
detection, estimation, minimax robustness, optimal filtering, dynamic
programming, digital filtering, large deviations and error probability bounding
techniques for optimum sequence detection problems will be applied, and new
analytical tools sought.
