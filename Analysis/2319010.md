In the design of systems such as aircraft or industrial facilities, it is
essential to know that the design is optimal and safe; oftentimes such stability
is encoded in terms of the "positivity" of a certain matrix equation. More
generally, matrix inequalities are of great importance in engineering and other
applications, since the stability of a system can often be expressed in terms of
a complex set of matrix inequalities. The mathematical discipline of matrix
analysis can be used to simplify or better understand questions about such
inequalities. This project will continue the development of the systematic
manipulation of matrix inequalities and study related mathematical questions in
several complex variables, many of which are of independent theoretical
interest. This project will also explore potential applications outside
mathematics, including applications to engineering and economics, such as a
search for unstable equilibria in models of trade restrictions, which may inform
trade policy. A matrix inequality establishes the positivity of the eigenvalues
of an expression involving some matrices. For example, matrix inequalities arise
in the stability analysis of systems of ordinary differential equations where a
matrix solution to the Lyapunov condition is needed. This project will
contribute to the mathematical foundations of systematic algebraic and analytic
manipulation for matrix inequalities. Recent development of the subject has
concerned the study of free noncommutative functions, the natural class of
functions used to perform such manipulations in a dimension-free way. A
qualitative understanding of the free noncommutative functional calculus is
important for applications; it is a tool to work around the fact that matrix
calculations, such as inversion and multiplication, are computationally
expensive and sometimes unstable. Much of the study applies techniques developed
in systems and control engineering, such as realization theory and sums of
squares, whose mathematical theory is currently undergoing a rapid development.
This project is also concerned with the boundary behavior of analytic functions,
which has played an important role in the manipulation of matrix inequalities
and moment theory since the classical work of Nevanlinna and Loewner. The
research has several potential applications to free probability, random matrix
theory, several complex variables, and real algebraic geometry.
