Experimental program employing monoenergetic, low-energy beams of positrons to
investigate the structural and electronic properties of multilayer
heterostructures. The techniques of reemitted positron spectroscopy, positronium
formation fraction, and Doppler broadening of annihilation radiation will be
used in a depth profiling mode to study (1) positron transport, esp. effects at
metal-Si and Si-silicide interfaces, (2) positron tunneling microscopy, and (3)
thermalization of hot positrons and ground state formation in thin metal films.
