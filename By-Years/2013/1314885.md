OpenSSH reveals excerpts from encrypted login sessions. TLS (HTTPS) reveals
encrypted PayPal account cookies. DTLS is no better. EAXprime allows
instantaneous forgeries. RFID security has been broken again and again. All of
these failures of confidentiality and integrity are failures of authenticated
ciphers: algorithms that promise to encrypt and authenticate messages using a
shared secret key.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is easy to blame many of these
security problems on a lack of education: much stronger authenticated ciphers
have been in the literature for many years. However, in many cases these
stronger authenticated ciphers fail to meet the performance requirements of the
applications. Performance is exactly the motivation for RC4 in WEP; EAXprime in
the "Smart Grid"; HB in RFID; and "IPsec" continuing to support unauthenticated
encryption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is building a new generation of
authenticated ciphers that improve efficiency without compromising security and
that improve security without compromising efficiency. This work spans seven
main topics: more efficient ciphers; more efficient MACs; more efficient forgery
rejection; improved protection against side channels; improved protection
against misuse and bad luck; improved quantitative security; and improved
security proofs. The ultimate objective is to obtain the best possible security
subject to a variety of performance constraints specified by cryptographic
users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The high-security high-performance authenticated
ciphers produced in this project will be directly and straightforwardly usable
in cryptographic applications, avoiding the disasters in current applications
and finally bringing secure secret-key cryptography from theory to practice.
