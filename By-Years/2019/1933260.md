The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to
substantially transform the legal system and processes by incorporating
Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the legal process of discovering and analyzing
information. This project provides the legal community with AI tools that will
enable them to adapt to a fast-changing information landscape (i.e., by
procuring, organizing and extracting actionable knowledge from large amounts of
documents and data during the pre-trial procedure of discovery), and to leverage
the most recent advances on human-machine teaming for an effective delivery of
AI-assisted discovery to legal teams. The target customers are practitioners at
law firms, corporations, government agencies, and academic researchers and who
perform qualitative data analysis on large volumes of unstructured data. This
technology potentially aids the case discovery process in the legal field that
often involves large amounts of electronically stored information in preparation
for litigation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on advance
machine learning based algorithms and social teaming algorithms used to improve
the efficiency of qualitative data analysis and the effectiveness of data result
delivery to legal teams. The project explores the use of artificial social
intelligence-based algorithms that automate the analysis of large volumes of
unstructured text data to gain insights to the patterns within the data more
efficiently, with better individual and inter-coder reliability, and within
significantly shorter processing time. The results of this analysis will be
delivered to legal teams using computer-based agents that observe their
surroundings, infer their teammates goals and assist the legal team by providing
information at the appropriate level and time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
