Complex Manifolds and Algebraic Dynamics C. McMullen

DMS-0245419

Abstract

This project investigates the behavior of dynamical systems in settings where
the methods of complex analysis and algebraic geometry can be brought to bear.
The core of the proposal focuses on three types of area-preserving dynamical
systems:

* Automorphisms of algebraic surfaces, * Polygonal billiards and * Planar fluid
flow.

Analysis of the rich and still mysterious structure of these systems entails
many methods, ranging from estimates for differential equations with minimal
smoothness to rigidity results for Lie groups acting on bundles over the moduli
space of Riemann surfaces.

From meteorology to robotics, from fluid mechanics to quantum field theory, the
control and prediction of dynamical systems plays a central role in science and
technology. This project will include computer explorations of mathematically
simple systems that exhibit rich combinatorial structure and universal analytic
features. Its aim is to advance the theoretical understanding of dynamics and
geometry.
