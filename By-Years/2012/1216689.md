The goal of this project is to consider classical optimization problems,
originally stated in the context of abstract graph theory and combinatorial
optimization, whose hardness as well as approximation factors have been studied
extensively, and investigate them in a geometric context, that is, when the
input consists of geometric objects. While considerable progress has been made
on the analysis of such problems in the abstract setting, their geometric
variants have received much less attention. These problems include minimum
coverage of a given area, stabbing a set of geometric objects, geometric
packing, and obtaining largest sets of mutually intersecting geometric objects.
For each of these problems, new ideas will be explored, which aim to combine
tools from computational and combinatorial geometry with traditional algorithmic
tools from theoretical computer science. Specifically, this work exploits
techniques such as linear programming relaxation and local search, commonly used
in operation research, combinatorial optimization, and algorithm theory, with
tools from computational and combinatorial geometry such as geometric
arrangements, Epsilon-nets, Helly-type properties, and others.

This award will help to develop a new set of tools that will not only be
exploited in computational and combinatorial geometry, but will extend to other
(perhaps, more applied) disciplines, such as networking, computer graphics,
geographic information systems, learning and others, as they often pose problems
of geometric nature. In particular, each of the problems to be investigated in
this project has applications to these areas, and hence their importance is not
only theoretical but also practical.

The project will support and train one postdoctoral researcher in Computer
Science at NYU. The PI will disseminate the research to the scientific community
through conference and journal publications, teaching courses, as well as
presenting her works in departmental seminars, and collaboration with
researchers from various disciplines.
