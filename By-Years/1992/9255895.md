Christopher Newport University seeks to provide enrichment experience for an
academic year commuter EAI Young Scholars project in physics and mathematics.
The project participants will be 48 minority students entering seventh and
eighth grades. The program includes Saturday Academy sessions during the
academic year followed by a Summer Academy in hands-on physics and mathematics,
challenging research and development projects, and career exploration
activities.
