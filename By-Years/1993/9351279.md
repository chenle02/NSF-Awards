9351279 Pasachoff This project is increasing the solar-physics content of both
upper-class and freshman undergraduate courses by incorporating into the courses
preparation for, observation of, and data reduction from solar eclipse studies
at the 3 November 1994 total solar eclipse. The equipment, comprising CCD
cameras with suitable filters and digitizing and associated computer equipment,
is also being incorporated into use with the on- campus solar telescope in white
light and in hydrogen-alpha. The eclipse work is in the framework of a study of
the cause of coronal heating, following predictions that surface Alfven waves
would lead to oscillations in coronal loops with periods of 1-10 s. Earlier
versions of this experiment have been carried out at two eclipses, with
extensive student participation at home and on site, and found indications of
excess power at these periods in our Fourier analysis. There was an improved
version on site for the 1991 total solar eclipse, with even more extensive
student participation, but cloudy weather prevented observation. There is a
complementary research grant to perform this experiment at the 3 November 1994
eclipse in South America, Observations will be made with intensified CCD
cameras, frame grabbers, and computer digitizing and recording, instead of the
fiber-optics strands and photomultipliers in the existing experimental setup.
Student participation with the equipment requested here includes students in the
Freshman Seminar and the junior/senior solar-physics seminar as well as students
participating in the expedition on site. The data and equipment will remain
useful on campus, with the telescopes and in the courses, for years to follow.
