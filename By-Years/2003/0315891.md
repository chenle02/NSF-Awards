A major challenge for evolutionary biologists is to determine the degree to
which natural selection shapes genetic variation in natural populations.
Hybridization is common between two species of blue mussel found in the North
and Baltic Seas. The differential exchange of genes between the two mussel
species, particularly genes encoding enzymes involved in central metabolic
pathways, suggests those genes may be under selection and involved in adaptation
to low salinity conditions in the Baltic Sea. Tests for selection will be
conducted by comparing levels of genetic exchange for these metabolic genes
against nonmetabolic and presumably neutral (i.e., not under selection) genes
and by looking for signals of selection at the DNA sequence level.

This project will further the understanding of how natural selection operates at
multiple genes, especially at the boundaries between hybridizing species. It
will also enhance educational opportunities in population biology and
evolutionary ecology for women and minorities and contribute to the development
of K-12 educational outreach materials in these fields.
