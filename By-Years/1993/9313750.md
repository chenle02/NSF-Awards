This support for a 2-day workshop in June 1993 on Shelter Island, New York to
lay the groundwork for real cooperative studies on the nature of the transition
zone of the Earth's mantle. The convene will bring together a small number of
active scientist from the fields of seismology, mineral physics and chemistry,
and geodynamics and provide a forum for interaction and serious discussion
focussing on sharing knowledge and expertise (the "conventional wisdom:) of the
separate disciplines and designing new strategies for addressing the scientific
problems.
