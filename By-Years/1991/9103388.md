The Principal Investigator will attack two research problems dealing with
convective systems over the Amazon basin. The first is an attempt at estimation
of evapotranspiration using satellite-based techniques. Evapotranspiration in
the rain forest is an important component of the hydrologic cycle, but is
inadequately understood in this region. This portion of the research is a
continuation of work begun under a previous award. The second objective is to
investigate the characteristics of convection and compare these to environmental
conditions. While this has been done extensively in North America, similar
studies have been lacking in South America. Such contrasting studies are useful
for understanding the important physical factors for convection on both sides of
the equator. The PI will use a combination of ground-based and satellite data in
this research.//
