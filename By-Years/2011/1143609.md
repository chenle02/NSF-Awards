The Association for Women in Science (AWIS) will organize and host the 2011
workshop for the ADVANCE Principal Investigators (PI). This project will feature
a 2-day workshop in early November of 2011 that will not only serve as an
opportunity to disseminate cutting research and findings gleaned from ADVANCE
projects, but also serve to expand outreach efforts of ADVANCE to a broader
audience that will include representatives from minority serving institutions,
as well as other diversity stakeholders in the STEM disciplines. Specifically,
the project will focus on identifying topics for discussion, identifying and
soliciting keynote speakers and developing a dissemination plan.

Intellectual Merit: The goals of this organization are well aligned with the
mission of the ADVANCE Program. As such, it is ideally suited to host an ADVANCE
PI meeting. The proposed project will bring together ADVANCE PIs of
institutional transformation, institution transformation catalyst and PAID
awards for a workshop that will not only foster networking and dissemination of
new knowledge in the social science and organizational change disciplines, but
also attract a wider audience to the ADVANCE community. Specifically, this
meeting will target individuals from minority serving institutions.
Historically, the ADVANCE Program has not had a significant impact on this cadre
of institutions of higher education.

Broader Impacts: The broader impacts of this project lie in its capacity to
disseminate information on innovations discovered by all ADVANCE projects as
well as the insight gleaned from research to an expanded target audience that
includes women faculty from a diverse set of instituions.
