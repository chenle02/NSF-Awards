The South Central Connecticut Regional Water Authority, the Eli Whitney Museum,
and the Calvin Hill Day Care Center will collaborate to create a Water Learning
Lab. These partners and teachers from 16 towns will design and develop the
center to met the curriculum needs of 1st through 5th grade classrooms. The
outdoor facility will offer "hands on" and "hands in" experiences in the
movement, power, measurement, purification,and distribution of water. It will
offer opportunities for group building projects: canals, aqueducts and an
introduction to the tradition of engineering begun by Eli Whitney on this site.
The project will train 30 teachers each year intensively. The training will
encourage experience-directed learning in the classroom. The project will
identify gifted natural mechanics who may not show their full talents in
conventional classroom work.
