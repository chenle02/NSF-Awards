A symposium will be held in October, 1988 for the purpose of assessing the state
of understanding of the structure, dynamics function and genetics of the oxygen
binding heme proteins, myoglobin and hemoglobin. Approximately 140 scientists
and students will be attending from the United States and from foreign
countries. This is the first heme protein meeting dealing in a major way with
hemoglobin and myoglobin genetics and their potential impact on heme protein
research. The goal of the symposium will be to develop strategies for
effectively using the new genetically varied molecules and to expand future
research directions.
