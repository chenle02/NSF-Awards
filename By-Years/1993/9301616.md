Topic areas covered by the conference are: Active Semiconductor Devices, which
includes aspects of active semiconductor-based photonic components fabricated in
integrated from, or which are suitable for integration. Nonlinear pertain to
nonlinear devices in planar and channel waveguides. These include experiments on
and theory of frequency conversion devices such as second harmonic generators
and parametric oscillators; devices based on third order phenomena such as all-
optical switching, nonlinear couplers, and spatial solutions, and
photorefractive phenomena. Modeling, Numerical Simulation describe techniques
and mathematical algorithms for modeling and numerical simulation, or theory, of
photonic devices and materials, and results obtained by using such tools.
Waveguides and Waveguide Devices include passive and active dielectric waveguide
and waveguide devices, circuit integration and coupling, and their applications.
