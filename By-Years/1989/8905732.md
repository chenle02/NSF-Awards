This action is to support the upgrading of the control system for a
sophisticated soil testing apparatus in the Civil Engineering Department of the
University of California at Los Angeles . This apparatus is used for teaching as
well as for research. The upgraded control system provides the precision of
testing and the resulting accuracy of data measurement that is needed in the
development of models for the mechanical response of soils under conditions of
cyclic loading. These analytical and computational models are being developed
from experimental evidence for the behavior of cohesionless soils during large
three-dimensional cyclic stress changes, such as those that soil masses
experience during the strong ground shaking induced by large earthquakes. The
results from the upgraded soil testing apparatus provide the basis for
improvements in earthquake hazard mitigation.
