Changes in membrane fluidity at low, but non-freezing temperatures, are thought
to be involved in chilling injury, a physiological disorder that effects many
economically important plants. Recent research has shown that the chilling
sensitivity of some susceptible plant tissue is reduced by exposure to ethanol,
a mild anesthetic. Some anesthetics are known to increase membrane fluidity and
thereby lower the temperature at which cold-induced phase transition occurs. In
contrast, elevated atmospheric gas pressures reduce membrane fluidity and raise
the temperature at which cold-induced phase transition occurs. Singular and
combined effects of anesthetics and high-pressure gas atmospheres on symptoms of
chilling injury (induced ion leakage, stimulated respiration, and stimulated
ethylene production) will be examined in seedlings. Results will provide an
understanding of how these two factors can be used to manipulate chilling
response and ultimately an experimental approach to dissection of the mechanisms
that lead to plant adaptation to chilling temperatures.
