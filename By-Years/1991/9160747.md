At the present time, very little in non-molecular biology "hands- on" resources
are commercially available for incorporation into the classroom laboratory
setting. The primary focus of this research is to explore the feasibility and
potential for accelerating the incorporation of various aspects of biotechnology
into science curricula through the development of educational support systems
which integrate a variety of instructional materials. The products of this
research will integrate "hands-on" experiment modules, teacher instruction
guides, and visual presentation materials in the basic sub- disciplines of
biotechnology.
