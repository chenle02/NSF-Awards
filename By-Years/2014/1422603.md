The goal of this project is to lay the foundations for algorithmic research on
self-organizing particle systems. Particle systems are physical systems of
simple computational particles that can bond to other particles and that can use
these bonds in order to communicate with neighboring particles and to move from
one spot to another (non-occupied) spot. These particle systems are supposed to
be able to self-organize in order to adapt to a desired shape without any
central control. Self-organizing particle systems have many interesting
applications like coating objects for monitoring and repair purposes and the
formation of nano-scale devices for surgery and molecular-scale electronic
structures. While there has been quite a lot of systems work in this area,
especially in the context of modular self-reconfigurable robotic systems, only
very little theoretical work has been done in this area so
far.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will prepare the ground for rigorous
algorithmic research on self-organizing particle systems by proposing basic
models and solving some basic algorithmic problems in this area. More
specifically, the main objectives of this three-year project are (i) to refine
an amoeba-inspired model  for particle systems in 2D, and to develop appropriate
models for particle systems in 3D; and (ii) to develop self-organizing
algorithms for the smart paint problem, covering and bridging problems, shape
formation problems, and the macrophage problem in 2D and 3D. A transformative,
novel thinking approach will be needed if one indeed wants to capture the
essential nature of these systems, in some ways mimicking those that already
exist in nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will have an impact
in several respects, such as: (i) bridging the gap between theory and practice
in the area of self-organizing particle systems, with impact on many application
areas such as micro-fabrication and cellular engineering; (ii) international
collaboration; (iii) multidisciplinary activities, since the topics in this
proposal will foster collaboration with researchers in multiple areas such as
nano-scale micro-fabrication, cellular engineering, nano-scale medical
applications, biochemistry, and computer science; and (iv) enhancing diversity
at Arizona State University and at the Computer Science Theory\Algorithms
community at large.
