The purpose of this program is to unify into a single coherent structure the
various theoretical results that have been obtained on special models of the
interaction of selection and recombination in populations. By numerical and
mathematical solutions of the equations of gametic frequency change and
equilibrium, the various special cases of selection that have been explicitly
solved up to the present time will be related by a continous deformation that
connects them with general models of viability selection. Thus, for arbitrary
selection regimes it will be possible to predict the equilibrium gametic
structure when recombination is taken into account. By solving the equations
over the entire range of the variables, including a range outside the
biologically realistic one, and then placing the "window" of biologically
realistic limits of the values on the solutions, the selection/recombination
dynamics for arbitrary selection values will be followed throughout the space of
the selection and recombination parameters. This is of considerable application
because polymorphisms within very short linkage distances are now abundantly
demonstrated from DNA sequencing and restriction fragment studies. The
haplotypes in populations show considerable non-random association of sites, so
a complete theoretical treatment of selection in the tightly linked systems is
needed. This theoretical study should result in a general picture of the effect
of natural selection on the genetic composition of a population when
recombination is taken into account.
