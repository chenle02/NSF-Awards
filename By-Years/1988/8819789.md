Chemotaxis is the process by which bacteria detect important nutrients, poisons
and other substances and move toward or away from their source by swimming. The
molecular, cellular and genetic mechanisms involved in chemotaxis have been
studied extensively in a few bacteria such as E. coli. However, there has been
virtually no work done to determine how chemotaxis contributes to the survival
and competitive success of bacterial species in natural environments. Chemotaxis
is a very sophisticated behavioral response. It requires both the co- ordination
and functioning of over 60 genes and the expenditure of a significant fraction
of the cell's energy resources. So it seems likely that chemotaxis and its
regulation are major determinants of lifestyle and competitive success for many
bacteria. The proposed studies will explore the role of chemotaxis in the
ecological success of a particular soil bacterium, Bradyrhizobium japonicum. B.
japonicum is an agronomically important symbiont of soybean. It stimulates the
formation of nodules in which the bacterium converts nitrogen from the air into
ammonia for the plant in symbiotic exchange for carbon fixed by the plant
through photosynthesis. Formation of nodules depends on the ability of the
bacterium to survive in the soil in the absence of its host, its ability to
detect, reach and colonize the root surface of its host, and its ability to get
to those few root cells on the surface that are developmentally susceptible to
infection. The contribution of chemotaxis to each of these steps will be
investigated. Previous studies have shown that bacterial mutants which have
defective chemotaxis are significantly less efficient in nodule formation.
Conversely, mutants with enhanced chemotaxis are more efficient nodulators.
Mutations in several of the genes required for nodule formation specifically
abolish some chemotactic responses. In further studies, mutants of B. japonicum
with enhanced, altered or disfunctional chemotaxis will be isolated,
characterized and compared in mixtures with the parental strain to determine
which aspects of chemotaxis contribute importantly to soil survival, root
colonization and symbiotic infection. Long range goals are to understand how
chemotaxis contributes to success in dealing with the demands of complex,
dynamic environments and to use this knowledge to enhance the symbiotic
performance of plant- associated bacteria.
