The symmetries of a geometric object, such as the rotations preserving a cube or
a sphere, can be described by the mathematical notion of a group. Quantum
groups, one of the focal points of this project, are deformations of these
symmetries. Another focal point is a family of algebraic objects, Lie
superalgebras. These mathematical objects arose from and connect to the idea of
supersymmetry in physics. The PI will study supersymmetry in the form of Lie
superalgebra representations through a novel quantum group. The PI is in the
process of formulating and expanding a new approach to representations of
classical Lie algebras and establishing connections to geometry. This approach
is likely to lead to a new kind of higher symmetry and to have applications to
knot theory.

Recently the PI and his collaborators have initiated a theory of canonical bases
arising from quantum symmetric pairs, generalizing the classic constructions of
Lusztig and Kashiwara. These new canonical bases are intimately related to
geometry and category O. The PI proposes to enhance various geometric
constructions and categorification (which are of locally type A) to a unifying
theme of 'type A with involution'. The PI plans to develop a full-fledged theory
of canonical basis arising from quantum symmetric pairs. This should lead to a
categorification of the coideal algebras and their tensor product modules, which
in turn has applications to Koszul graded lift of category O of super classical
type. The PI intends to develop new methods to determine the irreducible
characters in category O for quantum groups and supergroups at roots of unity.
Finally, the PI proposes to give new geometric and algebraic realizations of
quantum coideal algebras of affine type, their modules, and the associated
canonical bases.
