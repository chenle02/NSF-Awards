The project will develop an understanding of the mechanism of animal locomotion
from biological observations at the neuronal level, hypothesize the knowledge as
engineering principles for feedback control design, and establish a systematic
procedure for designing neurodynamic controllers to achieve optimally efficient
autonomous locomotion. A simple yet accuratemathematical model for neuronal
dynamics is developed first from a control perspective. Lyapunov-based methods
will then be employed to analyse the oscillation properties of neuronal circuits
to drive mechanical systems for locomotion. A prototype mechanical rectifier is
used to experimentally validate the design principles to be developed for
locomotion control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next technological revolution seems
to rely on our understanding of complex biological systems. Such understanding
would enable us to develop a completely new kind of robust, adaptive, and
autonomous machines. The intellectual merit of this project is the basic
understanding of the mechanism underlying such sophistication, through
formalization of biological knowledge on animal locomotion in terms of
engineering language of feedback control. The impacts of this research include
innovations in a variety of fields. Realizations of new type of robotic
locomotion systems for space explorations would be a direct application.
Physiological control of the heart beat profile for stabilization of defective
heart may be another application.&lt;br/&gt;
