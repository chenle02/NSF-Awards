AST-9731168 ABSTRACT This project will build an inexpensive camera, the GRB
imager and polarimeter (GRB-IMP), which will be permanently mounted at the
broken Cassegrain focus of the Palomar 200 inch telescope. It will be available
to any observer with 10 minutes notice. The GRB-IMP will provide imaging
capability via a CCD camera and rapid photometry using either photomultiplier
tubes, avalanche photodiodes, or a combination of the two. Availability of the
GRB-IMP will maximize the possibility of acquiring adequate GRB follow-up
observations at optical wavelengths.
