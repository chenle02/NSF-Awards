The project will study damage-free ultraprecision machining processes on
advanced ceramic materials. The goal is to generate an improved understanding of
the material-removal processes that occur in nanometer-scale grinding of
ceramics, and ultimately to be able to control grinding damage generation in-
process. The research plan includes extending the ductile-regime grinding model
to include toughened ceramics, and defining grinding machining parameters
required for these materials. Further modification of the grinding process by
the introduction of engineered chemomechanical effects on the ceramic surface
will be developed, through controlled surface toughening. A goal of this
research is to develop a real-time acoustic emissions feedback system to measure
and control grinding damage in-process. Through preliminary research, the
sensitivity of acoustic emissions to material removal processes has been
established. Understanding the basis of that sensitivity and its relationship to
subsurface fracture generation will guide development of an effective control
strategy. It is expected that as a direct result of this research: (1) models
for ductile-regime grinding, developed by the principal investigator, will be
extended to include tough, advanced ceramic materials; (2) chemomechanical
effects in machining of ceramics will be studied with regard to their potential
for altering the surface properties of ceramics, thereby enhancing the
machinability of candidate ceramic materials; and (3) fracture-generated
acoustic emissions signals will be analyzed in a basic study of the these
elastic waves and their relationship to grinding-induced subsurface damage.
