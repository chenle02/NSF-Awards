A significant anthropological problem in adaptational studies is how humans
adapt to high altitudes. It has been demonstrated that not all human groups
possess the same phenotypic responses to hypoxia. Because of the variation in
conditions of previous studies, it has been difficult to determine whether
phenotypic differences among high altitude populations in the Andes, the
Himalayas and elsewhere are related to genetic differences, to differences in
genotype-environmental interactions during development, to differences in
nutrition and or disease, or to differences in barometric pressure that may
exist between mountainous regions above and below the equator. This pilot study
will explore in a systematic way the causes of population differences in
phenotypic response to hypoxia among genetically similar and genetically diverse
populations living above 3500 meters in one geographical area--Quinghai
Province, China--thereby avoiding variations in study conditions that have
hampered previous comparisons. The study will be carried out in collaboration
with researchers from Beijing Medical University and the Xining First Hospital.
