The Multi-university Center for Dielectrics will target research in three focal
areas: evolutionary, revolutionary, and basic. Evolutionary topics will
emphasize near-term industrial needs such as dielectric degradation mechanisms,
which affect component reliability. Revolutionary research involves a paradigm
shift in the industry. For example, nanoparticle deposition by electrophoresis
will produce new capacitor structures with submicron layers. Basic topics will
permit in-depth investigation of defect chemistry and microwave dielectric
relaxation mechanisms which opens new research areas in pulse power and wireless
components.
