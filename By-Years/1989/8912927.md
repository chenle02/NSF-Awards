Experimental and theoretical work will be carried out on quantum and charging
energy effects in sub-micron sized tunnel junctions, on high-temperature
superconductivity, and on arrays of Josephson junctions; ongoing work on quantum
conductance fluctuations in amorphous microbridges will be completed this year.
The proposed work will be carried out with the aid of our new clean room
microfabrication facility and microwave facility, together with our dilution
refrigerator facility, which allows us to reach the low temperatures which are
required for the work on quantum effects in small junctions. The objective of
the work on small tunnel junctions is to understand the interplay between forces
dependent on the phase of the superconducting pair wavefunction and those
dependent on deviations from electrical chage neutrality; devices sensitive to
the charge of a single electron may be possible. Their work on high temperature
superconductors is focussed on the phenomena of flux creep and flow with
associated energy dissipation; their emphasis is on ac measurements at
frequencies from dc up to microwaves. The potential practical significance of
these materials is well- known. Their work on fabricated Josephson junction
arrays will emphasize their use as model systems serving as a controlled
laboratory prototype for study of the behavior of granular high temperature
superconductors.
