This dissertation research in cultural anthropology studies the effects on
children's health of the education of mothers, the composition of the household,
and involvement of mothers in local woman's associations. The research takes
place in a rural area of Cameroon. Methods include a census and health survey of
the community, bi-monthly health surveys of a sample of households for a year,
intensive case studies of at least five households, and informal interviews with
a wide range of government officials, health workers and family/community
members. This research is significant because it will contribute to the field of
medical anthropology, and will provide health planners with valuable information
on the social mechanisms involved in child health.
