PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The International Photocopy Service of the British Library
Lending Division (BLLD) provides photocopies, microfilms or microfiche of
various research documents from its own stock or from that of other major United
Kingdom libraries upon request from the King Abdulaziz City for Science and
Techology (KACST) in Riyadh. Research documents are duplicated, then shipped
directly to KACST. This proposal requests additional funding to continue the use
of the service without interruption. JUSTIFICATION: The Photocopy Service of the
British Library will locate, then appropriately copy, research documents and
forward them to KACST upon request. KACST is using this service for researchers
who request certain citations from the KACST Library or by way of their Online
Search Service in the Kingdom. Investigators at the Universities in Riyah,
Jidda, and other locations then have access to articles, treatises, monographs,
etc. just as researchers do in more populous areas, an obvious benefit to
scientific research in the Kingdom. Participation of NSF in U. S. Commission
activities is grounded in the Foreign Assistance Act (22 U.S.C. 2357). All KACST
activities are funded by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia through the U.S./Saudi
Arabian Joint Commission. No. U.S. appropriated funds are used.
