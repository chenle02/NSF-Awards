With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry
Division is funding Dr. Amanda C. Bryant-Friedrich from the University of Toledo
to develop chemical models systems for the study of nucleic acid damage
resulting from oxidative processes. Synthetic organic chemistry along with
analytical and biophysical techniques will be utilized to synthesize and
evaluate both RNA and DNA derivatives that serve as precursors of reactive
intermediates formed through nucleic acid damage processes. Damage to nucleic
acids, particularly if not easily reparable, has broad implications in
biomedical science and chemical biology, being a hallmark of oxidative
stress/mutagenesis. The aim of this work is therefore to develop chemically
stable substrates that can be utilized to determine damage pathways under
biologically relevant conditions. Deoxyribonucleic acids (DNA) and their close
cousins ribonucleic acids (RNA) are key biological substrates vital for the
establishment of genetic characteristics and for the synthesis of proteins
needed to carry out cellular processes. Damage to these important molecules
leads to the compromise of the cell and has detrimental consequences in human
health. The development of tools for the study of processes that damage DNA and
RNA will allow for the experimental study of these damage processes with an eye
toward better understanding the consequences of oxidative stress and the
etiology of disease. This pursuit will allow undergraduates, graduate students
and postdoctoral fellows from a broad range of backgrounds to acquire
specialized training in biological chemistry. Women and minorities will be
active participants in the research and training made possible through this
award. The recruitment and retention of minority scientists has been and will
continue to be a significant area of focus of this laboratory.
