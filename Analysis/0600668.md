Viscoelastic Fluid Flows Abstract of Proposed Research

Becca Thomases

This project is to study the behavior of equations that model complex fluids
and to determine criteria for flows to become unstable. Attention will be
concentrated on the Oldroyd-B equations and related systems in elastodynamics.
These have complicated nonlinear behavior and the existence of global solutions
for large data is still not proved. One project is to study the possible
development of singularities of the solutions, using both analytical and
numerical techniques. Another project is to study the stability and numerical
simulations of the solutions of these equations. Some other model equations will
also be studied for comparison purposes.

These fluids arise in many applications especially biology and chemical
engineering. Many lubricants, plastics and polymers are modeled as such fluids.
This work will help understand the dynamics of such materials and develop
methods for the numerical simulation of their motion.
