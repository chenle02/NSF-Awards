9315067 Herbst The PI will continue to use the 0.6 m Perkin reflecting telescope
and CCD camera at Van Vleck Observatory to monitor supernova eruptions. The goal
is to obtain high quality, well sampled light curves of all the supernovae which
are sufficiently far north and sufficiently bright for this instrument. These
data will be useful in determining the degree to which type Ia supernovae can be
regarded as photometrically homogeneous, determining the photometric parameters
of types Ia and II supernovae and establishing the properties and frequency of
occurrence of various types of supernovae light curves. Undergraduate students
will be heavily involved in this project. ***
