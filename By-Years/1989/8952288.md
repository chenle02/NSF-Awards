Students are encouraged to select course work in areas outside of their major
studies to obtain a broad, liberal studies based education. Cooperation between
geology and chemistry is promoted by courses involving chemical analysis,
environmental studies, and geochemistry using common laboratory equipment. This
project adds an ion chromatograph to equipment that is already in place. This
equipment is used to teach the principles of ion separations, determinations,
and high pressure liquid chromatography in chemistry courses, to generate
analytical data in upper level geology courses, and for student research in both
fields. The grantee provides funds for this project that are an equal match for
the NSF award.
