This is a proposal to design and build a lens optimized for operation at low
voltage in a scanning electron microscope, and to combine the lens, field
emission gun, and other components into a working prototype of a LVSEM
instrument that should have size, lost, and performance advantages over existing
instruments. The project is undertaken cooperatively with AMRay corporation,
where the contribution will take place, and where a successful prototype could
become the basis for a commercial instrument. The prototype will be transferred
to the 1 MR facility in Madison.
