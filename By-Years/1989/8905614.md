The principal investigator will continue her work on developing a technique for
the study of sequences of random variable which satisfy decomposed mixing
conditions. This is a technical condition which allows the investigator to
consider the dependent random variable case. The results obtained for decomposed
mixing conditions will be applied to the study of the output of some statistical
smoothing procedures.
