This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes a Quantum
Intelligence System (QIS), a cross-industry Business Activity Monitoring (BAM)
platform that integrates business intelligence and optimization for real-time
performance monitoring, automation, and optimization of complex business
processes. The objectives are to demonstrate how to look through real-time data,
report performance indicators, detect and diagnose problems, and visualize
results. Its key innovation is to integrate a large amount of quantum
information, automatically perform many what-if analyses and optimize a sequence
of responses. The anticipated results include a preliminary prototype
demonstrating the business values. QIS can be applied to supply chain management
such as inventory management, production planning and logistics, resource/budget
allocation, quality monitoring, and control and maintenance for reliability. QIS
can also be applied to industries in the area of revenue, resource, and business
activity monitoring. QIS is a cross-industry platform to provide real-time
performance monitoring, problem detection and diagnosis, and improvement of
overall business efficiency and performance.
