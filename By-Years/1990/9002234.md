Professor Albrecht is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program
to develop and characterize novel nonlinear optical techniques and to apply
these techniques to the study of ultrafast dynamical processes in a variety of
molecular liquids. Two complementary four-wave mixing techniques are used. One
new approach uses nanosecond light pulses having a very short correlation time.
Both precise frequency (even sub-Raman linewidth) and time measurements are
possible, though on an "accumulated" basis. There is promise that inhomogeneous
broadening can be separated from the homogeneous. The second four-wave mixing
technique uses femtosecond multicolor pulses to measure time-resolved dynamics
on the same systems. Processes that affect electronic, vibronic, and vibrational
dephasing are examined either in molecular liquids and their mixtures or in
solutions of dye aggregates.
