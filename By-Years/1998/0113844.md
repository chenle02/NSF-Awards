The recently demonstrated techniques of photon state storage in collective
matter excitations will be used to investigate methods for manipulation of
quantum information. The specific aims are (1) experimental study of efficient
transfer of quantum information between light fields and long-lived collective
states of alkali atoms, (2) theoretical studies of quantum information
processing based on collective states, and (3) theoretical study of the optical
manipulation of solid-state qubits.
