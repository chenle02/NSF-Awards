This research will examine chloroplastic ALA synthesis as a heterogenous
phenomenon, whereby, two ALA-forming systems must be present, one of which makes
ALA that is destined to protochlorophyllide (Pchlide), while the other fills up
a pool that does not contribute to the Pchlide pathway and that could possibly
be involved in heme synthesis. This study will identify one ALA pool as the
precursor of Pchlide and the other ALA pool as the precursor of protoheme.
Therefore, it will be proven that the branching point between the Mg and the Fe
tetrapyrroles is not located at protoporphyrin, as generally thought, but at the
synthesis of ALA itself.%%% For a number of years it has been axiomatic that the
coarse control of chlorophyll synthesis lies at the level of 5- aminolevulinic
acid (ALA). ALA synthesis is the crucial point in the regulation of chlorophyll
as well as the pyrrole compounds. This study approaches the regulation of ALA
from a physiological perspective but using biochemical tools. The relationship
between the various metabolites that are formed from ALA in developing
photosynthetic tissue will be determined.***//
