Although the modern Congress is televised, recorded, and electronically indexed
at Purdue University, many teachers do not know how to access this information.
The Archives has developed and maintains finding aids, indexes, and an
electronic database making this unparalleled collection available for use by
faculty, students, and researchers. We will train teachers to use these modern
research methods and show them how to incorporate these new research skills to
improve their undergraduate teaching.
