The U.S. mathematical and phycial sciences communities are represented by the
Naitonal Academy of Sciences (NAS) in seven international scientific unions: the
International Astronomical Union (IAU), the International Radio Science Union
(URSI), the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP), the
International Commission for Optics (ICO), the International Union of Pure and
Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the International Union of Crystallography (IUCr),
and the International Mathematical Union (IMU). U.S. National Committees
(USNCs), staffed by the NAS, coordinate U.S. preparations for meetings of the
corresponding international unions and for scientific conferences, symposia, and
workshops organized by these unions to identify research topics, issues, and
programs of interest to their specific disciplines; identify and support U.S.
scientists to participate in union activities; and arrange for payment of U.S.
dues to the seven unions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through activities related to
the utilization of knowledge for the achievement of social goals, establishing
nomenclature and standards, participating in the governance of the seven
international unions, and advancing knowledge and understanding across the
research community, the intellectual merit of this project is demonstrated.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similarly, through activities that promote teaching,
training, and learning, and that promote the growth of and diversity in the
national and international workforce, the broader impacts of this project
manifest themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
