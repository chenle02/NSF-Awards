The effects of computer graphics and computer vision on our society are
increasingly pervasive. Courses in these fields provide a well established
framework for the assimilation of previously learned concepts from mathematics,
physics and computer science, and the rigorous development of robust problem
solving skills. Pace University will purchase four Sun 3/160S graphics terminals
for use on an existing 3/160 system. These will allow the teaching of state-of-
the-art graphics and vision techniques. Exposure to this state-of-the-art
computational environment will produce more intellectually sophisticated and
technically equipped computer scientists.
