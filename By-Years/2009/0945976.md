This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project has a goal of
creating a system that, while being inexpensive and simple to use, will be able
to analyze samples for the presence of a live pathogenic bacteria and determine
their species, as well as sensitivities to antibiotics within just a few hours.
As detectors, this system will utilize modified bacteriophages. To prove the
concept, it is proposed to create the first detector of the system targeted at
Campylobacters, which are emerging as one of the most significant causes of
human gastrointestinal infections worldwide. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
impacts of this research are expected in the biodefense area and medicine where
a flexible detection system will allow simultaneous multiparameter monitoring of
the environment or food and water supplies for their safety, as well as enable
physicians to choose the appropriate antibiotic at very early stages of
bacterial infection, thus increasing the efficiency of treatment and reducing
the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.&lt;br/&gt;
