Current luminescence bioassays rely solely upon measurement of luminescence
intensity to generate information.Recent success at Promega's Corporation in
producing multiple colors from beetle luciferases has created the opportunity to
greatly increase assay information content by using multiplexing techniques to
measure light intensities at different wavelengths. This could provide greater
assay reliability, precision, and ability to measure concurrent molecular
events. Promega's focus on beetle luciferases stems from the excellent
performance of the enzymes in bioassay methods. The assay of these enzymes,
which yields the highest quantum efficiency of any luminescence methodology,
demonstrates superior precision, linearity, and rapidity. To further assess the
feasibility of using multiplexing to increase the commercial potential of
bioluminescence assays.Promega proposes to identify novel substitutions that
regulate color by examining the relationship between amino acid substitutions in
the primary structures of beetle luciferases to the enzymes' spectral
properties. %%% Promega anticipates development of the following commercial
applications from this research: advanced genetic reporter systems for molecular
biological research, immunoassay, live-cell biosensors.
