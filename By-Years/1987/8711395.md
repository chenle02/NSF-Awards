This grant will support participation by undergraduate students and faculty
from Colgate University in research at Colgate and at the Nuclear Structure
Laboratory of the State University of New York at Stony Brook. The experiments
probe the properties of radioactive rare-earth nuclei. The nuclei will be
produced at the Stony Brook heavy-ion accelerator as the fusion/evaporation
remnants of nucleus-nucleus collisions, and laser-induced optical fluorescence
spectroscopy will measure their isotope shifts and hyperfine structure. Some
equipment development will be carried out at Colgate. At least six Colgate
undergraduate students will participate in this research. This three-year grant
is made under the auspices of the NSF Research at Undergraduate Institutions
(RUI) program.
