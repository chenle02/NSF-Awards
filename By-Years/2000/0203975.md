Proposal Number: DMS-0203975&lt;br/&gt;PI: Andre de
Carvalho&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of
2-dimensional dynamical systems is an active area of&lt;br/&gt;research.
Families such as the Henon and Lozi families have been&lt;br/&gt;intensively
studied in recent years and many beautiful results&lt;br/&gt;have been obtained.
However, we are still far from having a&lt;br/&gt;complete understanding of
them. In dimension 1, due to the&lt;br/&gt;efforts of many researchers during
the past two decades, there is&lt;br/&gt;an almost complete theory. Parallels
and differences between the&lt;br/&gt;dynamics of families in dimensions 1 and 2
have been exploited by&lt;br/&gt;several authors. The past work of the PI
includes the development&lt;br/&gt;of a 2-dimensional analogue of Milnor and
Thurston's kneading&lt;br/&gt;theory and the study of braids and braid forcing.
The present&lt;br/&gt;project proposes to further the study of dynamics in
dimension 2&lt;br/&gt;as well as some aspects of braid theory and Teichmuller
theory.&lt;br/&gt;The main topics to be studied are: Horseshoe
braids,&lt;br/&gt;Generalized pseudo-Anosov maps and piecewise linear models for
&lt;br/&gt;diffeomorphisms in dimension 2, Real and Complex Henon maps
and&lt;br/&gt;the Pruning Front Conjecture, Renormalization in dimension 2,
and&lt;br/&gt;some aspects of infinite-dimensional Teichmuller
Theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynamical systems is the branch of
mathematics that describes&lt;br/&gt;systems that evolve in time. Typical
examples are planetary&lt;br/&gt;motion, population patterns, weather prediction
or the economy.&lt;br/&gt;Since Newton, it is believed that simple mathematical
laws are&lt;br/&gt;capable of describing the long term behavior of many of
such&lt;br/&gt;systems. The problem is that often such simple
mathematical&lt;br/&gt;laws lead to extremely complicated long time behavior.
