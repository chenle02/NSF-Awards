The underlying theme of current research is development of a high- performance
parallel processing system based on large numbers (hundreds or thousands) of
microcomputers. Such a parallel system would consist of interconnected computing
nodes that asynchronously cooperate via message passing to execute the tasks of
parallel programs. Each network node, fabricated as a small number of VLSI
chips, would in turn contain a processor, a local memory, and a communication
controller capable of routing messages without delaying the computation
processor. This approach to parallel computation, like all others, poses many
vexing problems, including hardware design, operating system and programming
support software, and algorithm design. Although there are interests in all
areas of message-based parallel computation, their primary research areas are
operating system design and performance directed algorithm design. In
collaboration with the concurrent computation project at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, they are currently developing several classes of dynamic scheduling
algorithms. Among these is one group based on experience with adaptive packet
routing algorithms. In addition to their work in dynamic task scheduling, the
research team is developing a set of performance models for message passing
machines analogous to those used with vector processors. These models have been
used to predict the performance of problem partitioning strategies for solution
of partial differential equations; independent implementation of the
partitioning strategies has confirmed the accuracy of their technique.
