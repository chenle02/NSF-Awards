This grant will enable the addition of three new millimeter wave antennas to the
BIMA array, bringing the total number of antennas from six to nine. The increase
to nine will provide substantial increases in speed and sensitivity, permitting
a much greater range of scientific problems to be addressed by BIMA scientists
and visitors. A single day's observing will yield maps with as many as 800
independent pixels. The speed is essential for studying time varying phenomena,
such as comets, solar flares, and interstellar masers. The added sensitivity
will allow, for example, molecular line mapping in distant galaxies. The initial
array configuration will allow observations at 70-90 GHz, 90-116 GHz, and
210-270 GHz with an IF bandwidth of 830 MHz and a spectral line correlator that
covers 800 MHz, nearly the whole IF band. The system will have excellent
sensitivity for both line and continuum, with an effective sensitivity that is
comparable to the major single millimeter antennas in the world. The schedule
for construction will bring the full nine element array into operation in the
spring of 1992.
