This award supports Dr. Bruce H. Krogh and a graduate student from Carnegie
Mellon University in a collaboration with Sebastian Engell of the Department of
Chemical Engineering at the University of Dortmund. The collaboration draws on
recent research by the U.S. and German groups in the area of dynamic systems
that have both continuous and discreet states. Together they will augment
selected computer-aided modeling and simulation packages with interfaces to
software tools for analysis, synthesis, and verification of hybrid systems. The
new tools resulting from this project will enable U.S. and European researchers
and engineers to build and exchange models of real-world hybrid systems, and to
use a variety of tools for model verification, analysis, and design. Moreover,
the interface to currently existing software tools will be extensible to
incorporate future algorithms.
