9457028 ABSTRACT CTS-9457028 PI-Mulholland The research explores fundamental
processes and chemical pathways governing the formation of toxic combustion
byproducts. Experimental and computational studies are proposed to study
ignition and extinction phenomena, carbon growth pathways to polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs) and soot, and the pyrolytic transformation and oxidative
destruction of chloro-organic wastes. The experiments will be conducted in a
drop-tube reactor. Gas and liquid chromatography with mass spectroscopy,
infrared and ultraviolet detection methods will be employed to provide isomer
specific identification and quantification. Coupled with these experiments will
be the development of reduced kinetic data sets for quantitative analysis of
rate limiting phenomena and the utilization of molecular orbital models help to
identify reaction pathways.
