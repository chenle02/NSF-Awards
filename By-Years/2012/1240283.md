This grant provides support for the EcoCAR 2: Plugging into the Future Advanced
Vehicle Technology Competition. The NSF will provide support for the ?EcoCAR 2
NSF Outstanding Faculty Advisory Awards?. EcoCAR 2 is a new three year
collegiate advanced vehicle technology engineering competition jointly sponsored
by the NSF, United States Department of Energy, Natural Resources Canada, the
automotive industry (General Motors) and suppliers such as Cisco Systems,
Mathworks, A123, dSPACE, Freescale Semiconductor, Caterpillar, etc.), and is
managed by the Argonne National Laboratory. This is a continuation of the highly
successful educational experience for undergraduate students at US and Canadian
universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This competition challenges fifteen
universities across North America to explore solutions to minimize energy
consumption and reduce emissions while designing comfortable, safe, road-
vehicles commercially viable vehicles. At the conclusion of each year of
EcoCAR2, all fifteen teams will get together for a week long competition were
they will be competing for the coveted first place trophy. &lt;br/&gt;
