9600094 Feeny This project combines the approaches of systematics and chemical
ecology to investigate the factors controlling the number of host species
attacked by wasps of the genus Trogus (family Ichneumonidae), all species of
which parasitize caterpillars of the butterfly family Papilionidae. The
systematics of Trogus and related genera will be investigated to identify trends
in the evolution of host associations. To identify mechanisms of host-finding,
behavioral experiments will be conducted with the North American species Trogus
pennator. By comparing the chemical compounds used to locate host caterpillars
on different food plants, this research will test the hypothesis that taxonomic
restriction in host range results from conservative responses to chemical cues
shared by these plants. Parasitic wasps are the single most important natural
enemy of crop pests. Better understanding of their biology may suggest new ways
to manipulate parasitoids and agroecosytems for improved pest control and
reduced use of insecticides.
