A workshop entitled "Excited Baryons, 1988" is planned todiscuss the structure
of baryon resonances and their production on free nucleons and in nuclei. Baryon
resonance studies willplay an important part in the programs of the new
generation of electron and hadron accelerator facilities. In order to define
these programs better it is important to address the subject froma broadly
unified perspective encompassing elementary particleand nuclear physics issues
involving electroweak and stronginteractions.
