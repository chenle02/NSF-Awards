9313505 Moss The University of North Carolina at Wilmington, one of the sixteen
constituent institutions of The University of North Carolina is in a period of
transition, changing from a traditional four-year college to a regional, multi-
faceted university. The university has witnessed an increased enrollment of
students in the last ten years, a trend that is reflective of the growth
experienced within the Department of Chemistry. DeLoach Hall, home to the
chemistry department, is a twenty-four year old facility in need of
modernization. Faculty and students engage in chemical research projects that
emphasizes marine and environmental chemistry, biotechnology and high speed
computing. However, present conditions within DeLoach Hall impede research
productivity. Funds are requested to renovate laboratories by replacing the HVAC
system, providing needed fume hoods and snorkel vents, and installing a
research-grade cleanroom. These renovations will allow faculty and students to
conduct research of a high quality and enable them to embark on new research
areas, including collaborative projects with faculty from North Carolina State
University. Furthermore, as a result of the facility improvements, the
department will be able to improve its research training capability at both the
undergraduate and graduate level, thus better preparing students for graduate
education and entry into the nation's pool of trained scientists. ***
