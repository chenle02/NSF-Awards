This North Carolina State University (NCSU) project entitled Photonics Leaders
II (PL2) is a Strategies project for 80 underrepresented minority and rural 10th
grade students, their parents or caregivers, and 60 teachers. The project
nurtures interest in optics, electronics, computer hardware and software, while
building the intellectual, communication and personal skills needed for success
in the STEM workforce. NCSU researchers from Physics, Engineering, Distance
Learning and Education will partner with The Science House (at NCSU) and
industry leaders to develop, implement, and evaluate the activities. Students
and teachers will participate in hands-on and virtual learning, career and
personal counseling, and field experiences at universities and Research Triangle
Park, a Center for technological innovation. The project will engage parents to
be effective champions for students by offering information about college-
funding resources, college entrance requirements, and connections between
coursework and career opportunities.
