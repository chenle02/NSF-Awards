9319004 Roddier Adaptive optics (AO) is a technique to compensate in real-time
image degradation produced by the turbulent atmosphere. Funds are provided for
development of a science-grade instrument that can be mounted at the Cassegrain
focus of different telescopes on Mauna Kea. The system is expected to routinely
produce stellar images with a full width at half maximum of the order of 0.1
arc-second, from 0.8 to 2.2 um. Although the instrument will still require
trained operators, service observation will be offered to all IfA astronomers.
To achieve good performance, the system will require the use of a 16th magnitude
guide star or brighter within 20 arc- second of the object to be observed. The
system is to be used primarily for the study of stellar environments. In this
case a relatively bright central star will be used as a guide star, ensuring
optimum system performance. The main scientific goal will be the detection,
mapping, photometry, and polarimetry of the light scattered by dust in the very
close circumstellar environment. The sensitivity of the system should be high
enough to detect proto- planetary disks in already advanced stages of
condensation and even detect a Jupiter-like planet around a nearby star.
