Macosko - Abstract - 9527940 Immiscible polymer-polymer blends are a growing
part of the polymer industry. They can offer synergistic properties, the best
features of both components. They also provide a means for the recycling of
mixed polymer waste. Because the component polymers are immiscible, their blends
must by stabilized against coalescence. To obtain the desired properties, the
minor component must by well dispersed and its size and shape controlled,
typically at the submicron scale. To achieve this dispersion level, blends are
usually prepared in a twin screw extruder and block or graft copolymers are
added to compatibilize the blend, i.e. to aid in dispersion and prevent
coalescence. These copolymers are expected to reside in the interface between
the two components also aiding mechanical adhesion. There are two ways to add
copolymers to a blend: (1) Synthesize the block copolymers in a separate step
and then add it with the other components during blending; and (2) Create the
block or graft copolymer in situ, ruing the blending process by coupling
reactions across the interface between the components. In this project, several
strategies for making pre-made copolymers more effective are explored. The
objectives of the research program are: 1. Develop a model for morphology
generation during polymer melt blending that accounts for interfacial
stabilization via reactive coupling. 2. Establish the competitive advantage to
reactive blending versus addition of pre-made block copolymer. 3. Apply results
of 1 and 2 to isotactic polypropylene. 4. Evaluate the effects of optimized two-
phase morphology on mechanical properties. 5. Establish viable means of
producing functional polymers in usable quantities. 6. Quantify the role of
interfacial thickness and reaction kinetics on the efficiency of reactive
blending.
