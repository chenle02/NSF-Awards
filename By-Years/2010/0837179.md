Biological Sciences(61)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Laboratory investigations using
flow cytometry are being developed and implemented for use across the
undergraduate biology curriculum. The investigations are being designed to
foster growth in student understanding of how the diverse, dynamic, and
developmentally labile properties of living cell populations emerge from the
physical and chemical properties of individual cells, as an enhancement to the
technology typically available in undergraduate teaching laboratories. These
investigations are also allowing students to pursue authentic, sophisticated and
interdisciplinary laboratory investigations in cell biology, microbiology and
aquatic ecology courses. The project team is working with neighboring colleges
and high schools to provide additional instructors and students with access to
the flow cytometer and associated curriculum, and is collaborating with a
regional educators' group on the development and piloting of curriculum,
supporting materials, and assessment tools in which flow cytometry plays a
central role. These curriculum materials are being designed to demonstrate the
utility and versatility of flow cytometry technology, and to be suitable for
adoption by biology instructors and students nationwide.
