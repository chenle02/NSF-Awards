This award is for renewed funding of the Maria Mitchell Observatory (MMO)
Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site in Nantucket, Massachusetts.
The REU program will be offered annually to six qualified applicants, who will
perform state-of-the-art data analysis using a wide variety of space- and
ground-based astronomical observations. The student projects on offer include
mapping star formation across galaxies, uncovering the universe of hidden
quasars, and understanding the structure and evolution of galaxy
clusters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MMO REU program will have a significant
impact on the skills and career development of student participants by enhancing
their capability to do research, to present their results at scientific meetings
and in public settings, to write scientific papers, and to write observing
proposals to use national and international telescope facilities. Hundreds of
undergraduate students have participated in the REU program to date, the great
majority of them women, and many have gone on to successful careers as
astronomers at leading universities, observatories and other organizations
around the world. Indeed, roughly one of every 20 American women with a PhD in
astronomy today acquired formative research experience at the MMO. This award
will therefore contribute to developing a talented STEM workforce in the United
States.
