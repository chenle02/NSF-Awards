The aim of this project is to further the understanding of
the&lt;br/&gt;behavior of families of complex curves on a complex projective
&lt;br/&gt;manifold X.This will be done by addressing both enumerative
&lt;br/&gt;questions (e.g. How may curves are there with given degree and
&lt;br/&gt;genus and incidences?) and deformation-theoretic
questions&lt;br/&gt;(e.g. What deformations of curves lie in a generic
deformation &lt;br/&gt;of X?). Some of the important tools for attacking such
questions &lt;br/&gt;include the Atiyah-Bott localization theorem and
Kuranishi's &lt;br/&gt;formal deformationtheory. In addition to the research
component,&lt;br/&gt;the investigators will restart the successful
WAGS&lt;br/&gt;(Western Algebraic Geometry)
conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research relates to counting problems.
&lt;br/&gt;For example, given the set of solutions of a polynomial equation
&lt;br/&gt;in several variables, how many objects of a certain type (e.g.
&lt;br/&gt;lines) lie entirely inside the solution set? We further study
&lt;br/&gt;the 'shape' of the collection of objects even in cases in which
&lt;br/&gt;that collection of objects is no longer finite. This research is
&lt;br/&gt;related to a celebrated modern theory in physics, called 'string
&lt;br/&gt;theory,' which proposes to resolve the problem of unifying the
&lt;br/&gt;fundamental forces of nature by slightly 'thickening' space-time
&lt;br/&gt;in six independent directions. Our research studies the geometry
&lt;br/&gt;of the (tiny) cross-section of the universe in those six new
&lt;br/&gt;directions.&lt;br/&gt;
