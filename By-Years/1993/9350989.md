9350989 Martin The instructional programs in chemistry and biochemical science
are being enhanced by the addition of new experiments made possible by the use
of high performance liquid chromatography (hplc) and liquid chromatography-mass
spectrography (lc-ms). One hplc system is being added to our present mass
spectrometer for instructional laboratory experiments and student research
projects. A second is being paired with an existing hplc for other laboratory
experiments and research. At least nine new experiments are being adopted for
chemistry courses throughout the curriculum. Most of the new experiments are
sets of laboratory exercises centered on a "problem" to be solved by a "research
team" of students. Several of the new experiments are using chiral phase
chromatography for analysis of mirror image isomers formed during chemical
reactions. In addition, student undergraduate research opportunities are
increasing with more access to hplc and lc-ms. ***
