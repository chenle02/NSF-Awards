Alma College requests support from NSF for an upgrade of their slow speed
connection to a medium speed connection of its campus network to NSFNET. MERIT
is the midlevel network located in the state of Michigan that will provide
operations and network information services. It will give Alma College a 56
thousand bits per second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45
million bits per second) National Backbone network. The College needs greater
functionality and network speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries,
and make file transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail
system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the link. This is also a
unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative educational
resources.***//
