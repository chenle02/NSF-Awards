In the first step of visual analysis, early vision, simple image properties such
as brightness, color, texture, stereoscopic disparity, motion patterns are
analyzed and boundaries, lines, and other salient visual structures of the image
are measured and extracted. A number of theoretical and empirical arguments
point to the possibility that all early vision tasks may be accomplished by
algorithms sharing a common computational structure: convolution with kernels of
different orientations, scales, and shapes followed by simple quasi-local
nonlinear operations. Such kernals may be generated as deformations (rotations,
scalings stretchings) of a template kernel which is synthesized from task
specifications. In the last two years a method based on singular value
decomposition (SVD) has been proposed to make such continuous-parameter
filtering feasible- it has been demonstrated for rotations and scaling in 2
dimensions. This research endeavours to(1) demonstrate the method in new
situations including 3D rotations and scalings stretchings and changes of
curvature, (2) apply the method to generating filters for various early vision
tasks including texture and motion analysis, (3) explore new early vision
algorithms made possible by continuous-parameter filtering, (4) understand the
connections between filter-design techniques and the SVD method. //
