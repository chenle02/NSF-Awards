With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemical Sciences at Bridgewater State College will acquire a 300
MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) Spectrometer. This equipment will enable
researchers to carry out studies on a) the structure of synthetic inhibitors and
b) kinetic analysis of enzymatic reactions, proton exchange, and chemical
stabilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of
the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to
characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the
dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-
art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier
research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic
organic chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
