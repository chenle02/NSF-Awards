This award is concerned with the theory of finitedimensional division algebras
and the theory of Dubrovin valuation rings. Problems in finite dimensional
division algebras will be considered by using valuation theory, both the
classical valuation theory of division algebras and the recently developing
theory of Dubrovin valuation rings. Specifically, the principal investigator
will work on the structure of non-tame division algebras over Henselian valued
fields and the structure of defective division algebras. He will also develop a
global theory of Dubrovin valuation domains. A ring is an algebraic object
having an addition and a multiplication defined on it. Rings occur naturally in
many different settings in mathematics. This research is concerned with an
important class of rings called division algebras.
