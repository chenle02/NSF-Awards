The level of instruction of undergraduate chemistry is being improved through
the acquisition of a Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometer. Existing
courses being impacted by this proposal include: Organic Chemistry, Inorganic
Chemistry, Physical Chemistry, Chemical Instrumentation, General Chemistry, and
Senior Research. In addition two courses for professionals, "Chemical
Instrumentation" and "Microscale Qualitative Organic Analysis" are being
improved. The instrument is making it possible to integrate the laboratory
experience with the lecture material in the area of structure identification,
quantitative analysis, kinetics, and industrial chemistry. The grantee is
matching the NSF award from non-Federal funds.
