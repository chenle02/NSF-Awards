Computerized data acquisition can be used in undergraduate Biology classes to
facilitate scientific thinking in beginning as well as advanced students. The
Biopac system consists of a data converter and software which can be used to
expand experimental opportunities, increase the accuracy of physiologic data,
and make possible the application of the experimental method in one laboratory
session. Undergraduate students, having limited laboratory time, can use the
Biopac system to deftly generate and manipulate a broad array of physiologic
data (e.g. spirometry, bioelectric patterns, muscle contraction, heart and
korotkoff sounds). Even introductory Biology students can successfully use the
Biopac system to form and test an original hypothesis, generate and compile
data, and make conclusions within the laboratory time allotted. Advanced
students in Physiology can use the Biopac system to generate physiologic data
not possible with existing equipment. The Macintosh computer interface allows
literature search, networking of students, sophisticated manipulation of the
data, and reporting of results. The ease of data acquisition, facility of
manipulation, and expanded data forms provided will increase opportunities for
original discovery in Physiology. Through the use of independent
experimentation, students will develop increased scientific proficiency and
interest. Through the hands-on, computer-based interactive approach, students
will share in an increased scientific self-confidence and appreciation that will
benefit them and society at large.
