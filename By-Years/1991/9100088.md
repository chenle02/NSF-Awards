The NAS sponsored Committee on Atomic, Molecular and Optical Sciences (CAMOS)
will select and oversee a panel of scientists which will carry out an assessment
of future opportunities in atomic, molecular and optical physics. The panel will
report on scientific and technological opportunities, identifying and
recommending areas in which investments of resources should be concentrated,
and, as well, those of diminishing relative interest and promise. It will
address manpower, instrumentation, facility, and funding issues, not only in the
context of intellectual challenges, but also in the context of identified
national needs such as science education; defense, energy and environmental
applications; industrial and technological competitiveness, and appropriate
aspects of human health and welfare. Findings will be presented in a report
which meets the standards of the NAS, and which will be published by the
National Academy Press.
