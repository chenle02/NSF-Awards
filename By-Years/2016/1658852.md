Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Education is widely seen as a crucial
step toward economic development, democracy, and growth. Despite progress in
increasing enrollment rates, high dropout rates for adolescents, inconsistent
attendance, and low levels of learning still plague many developing countries.
Using high-quality surveys and administrative data from a large developing
country combined with variation from natural experiments, these three papers
will investigate how families choose to invest in human capital for their
children, and how market forces and government programs affect these choices.
Understanding whether early life investments encourage more educational
investments later on, whether higher low-skill rural wages increase dropouts,
and whether rural schools produce gains in consumption later in life will help
generate evidence so that governments can make informed choices about how best
to encourage human capital investment, and ultimately, economic prosperity. The
results of this research have implications for family and individual well-being,
economic growth, and national competitiveness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research
proposal is comprised of three papers. In the first, we will investigate the
effect of the largest workfare program in the world, on school enrollment and
test scores. Using the timing of the rollout across districts for
identification, we will identify whether the income effects of the program
outweigh the effect of increased demand for low-skilled labor, which may induce
children to leave school in order to work. The second paper estimates the extent
of dynamic complementarities in the human capital production function in rural
areas using exogenous shocks to consumption early in life and to the costs of
schooling in childhood. The model will include a potential return to human
capital in the labor market for children, which could induce higher-ability
children to drop out of school, even in the presence of dynamic
complementarities. The third paper will estimate the returns to rural schools
using three exogenous shocks to schooling: the Right to Education Act, the
introduction of free school lunches, and district rainfall shocks around the
time of primary school completion. We will measure returns not only to wages, as
is standard, but also health outcomes, consumption, assets, and marriage and
fertility outcomes. Together, these papers will contribute to the understanding
of how households choose to invest in schooling for their children, and how
valuable these investments are.
