Project SOAR is recruiting, retaining, and graduating academically talented
students as majors from the departments of biological sciences, chemistry,
physics and geology, mathematics and statistics, or computer science. Four
cohorts of students are being organized, beginning with 17 scholars in the
freshman year and with continuing support of 15 scholars for the cohorts from
their sophomore through senior years. The multi-disciplinary nature of the
project is supporting collaborations between faculty in the participating
disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SOAR scholars are being supported in a variety
of ways to ensure their academic success; these services include enhanced
faculty mentoring, year-long freshman seminar, STEM learning communities, a STEM
living community, peer tutoring, and peer mentoring. SOAR students are being
offered strong undergraduate research opportunities, internships, and co-ops and
the project is being informed by both internal and external advisory
boards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SOAR project is coherently designed around
effective practices for increasing retention and graduation rates for low-
income, first-generation students. The project is increasing the participation
of members of groups underrepresented in STEM and is increasing the number of
STEM graduates that will contribute to alleviating the region's needs. The
project is producing data via multiple modes of assessment and evaluation that
will inform institutional changes in recruiting practices, design of first-year
courses, use of discipline-specific learning communities, and academic support
services.
