Kids Network is a telecommunications-based approach to elementary science which
has been demonstrated to be very effective in stimulating students' interest in
science and technology. In this project, the Technical Education Research Center
and the National Geographic Society will develop models for introducing Kids
Network into preservice elementary teacher education. In the first year of the
project five institutions--Hampton University, Penn State, Purdue, Swarthmore,
and UC Irvine--will implement, document, and evaluate methods for utilizing Kids
Network in such courses as science methods, learning theory, educational
technology, and practice teaching. In the second year an additional ten
institutions will assist with refining these models and demonstrating their
disseminability. The project will also produce a Preservice Educator's Packet
providing practical suggestions for using Kids Network in preservice curricula,
and a monograph containing articles by participating faculty examining the
models and research results in relation to current thinking about elementary
science teaching. The cost sharing will be 20% of NSF's contribution.
