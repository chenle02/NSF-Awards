&lt;br/&gt;The project builds on a planning effort to examine the effects of
highly rated science curricula on diverse populations of students in a large
school district. The proposal now plans to study the effects of 3 highly rated
curriculum units on student outcomes (achievement, motivation, and engagement)
in the same large, diverse school system. Data will be disaggregated to find out
if the curricula produce different effects on various subpopulations of eighth
grade students. In addition to achievement data, a study will be conducted of
video analyses of student interactions. Finally, a scaling study will examine
factors likely to have an impact on the curriculum units' effectiveness,
including fidelity of implementation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
