9520899 Fitzgibbon This award will provide partial support for the Conference on
High Speed Flow Fields to be held at the University of Houston in November 1995.
The conference will bring together applied mathematicians, fluid dynamicists,
aerospace engineers, and others to address a blend of issues, including partial
differential equations of fluid flow, aero-thermodynamics, modeling,
computation, simulation, and experimentation. Major topics will include
mathematical modeling of flow models, recent developments in computational fluid
dynamics, data obtained from various space missions, and air breathing
propulsion technology. Contributed paper sessions and poster sessions will be
included and a proceedings will be published. The conference will include
leading researchers in this field from the international community and
participants will include both junior researchers and senior experts.
