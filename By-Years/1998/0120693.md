The goal of this Biocomplexity incubation study is to develop an approach for
studying coupled biogeochemical cycles in urban and agricultural ecosystems,
with a primary focus on nitrogen. A series of focused workshops will be held
addressing topics including: identification of knowledge gaps regarding key
processes, issues regarding temporal and spatial scales, developing a modeling
framework, and integration and education. The study regions for the full-scale
research program will be the Central Arizona-Phoenix ecosystem (currently site
of a Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) program) and the Minnesota River-Twin
Cities ecosystem (currently subject of an interdisciplinary watershed study).
The existing extensive databases from these and other studies will facilitate
the initiation of this project. Understanding coupled biogeochemical cycles in
human ecosystems (cities and farms) will lead to a holistic, integrated approach
for effective pollution management.
