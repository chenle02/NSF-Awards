We propose to assemble some of the most detailed and complete food web data yet
collected, and use these data to evaluate, extend, and integrate food web
theory. Data will be collected from several of the most thoroughly studied
ecosystems in the world including Lake Tahoe, Castle Lake, and Clear Lake in
California, and Mirror Lake in New Hampshire. In constructing food webs for
these lakes we will emphasize complete species lists (several webs will include
over 500 species), even resolution of producers, consumers and decomposers, and
estimates of the dominance of species and strengths of trophic interactions.
With these data we will evaluate the effects of scale (extent and resolution of
the data) on food web structure, extend food web theory to more precisely
account for real food webs (i.e., food webs with at least an order of magnitude
more species than those in current food web collections) and integrate food web
theory by delineating the complementarily between binary descriptions and
functionally prioritized descriptions of food webs. We will examine major food
web patterns including connectance, links per species, chain length, and
proportions of top, intermediate and basal species. The data will also be used
specifically to test several pertinent hypotheses about food web structure
including the intermediate trophic state hypothesis, the constant connectance
hypothesis, and previously described effects of scale and aggregation on food
web structure. I Larger goals of this proposal include improving procedures for
constructing food webs and integrating food web theory by assembling data using
both structural (binary) and functional approaches for the same systems. These
studies will help stimulate the clearly needed interaction and integration of
theory and empiricism for development of this vital subdiscipline of ecology.
