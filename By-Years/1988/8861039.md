The application of impeller fluidized microemulsion liquid membranes to the
separation of contaminants such as heavy metals and organics from wastewater is
proposed. The impeller-fluidizer developed by Helipump Corporation is a self-
pumping, durable, and inexpensive fluidizer design which provides higher mass
transfer and throughput rates than typical fluidizers. Liquid membranes have
been employed previously for the separation of metals (copper, uranium, cobalt,
nickel and zinc), organics (acetic acid, phenol), and, recently, amino acids
(phenylalanine) from aqueous solution. We proposed to employ a liquid membrane
in an impeller fluidizer to purify wastewater of prototypical contaminants
(phenol, ammonia, copper and mercury). In addition, microemulsions will be used
instead of coarse emulsions in formulating the liquid membrane due to their
inherent advantages. The successful application of the technique will result in
reduced wastewater treatment costs, while increasing production capacity. This
project combines two new technologies in the treatment of streams of process
water. The first of these technologies is that of liquid membranes. In the last
decade is has been found that dissolved metals and low molecular weight organic
chemicals can be removed from water by dispersing an emulsion into the water.
The emulsion itself is made up of a solution of chemicals in water, which has
been dispersed into an oil. The oil is immiscible in water. This emulsion is
stablized by surface active molecules called surfactants, which can be selected
to improve the separation. When the emulsion is then dispersed into the process
water, the oil phase of the emulsion forms a liquid membrane around the solution
of chemicals inside the membrane. The solution inside the liquid membrane is
designed so that as the ions or molecules which are to be removed from the
process water diffuse across the liquid membrane, they react with the components
of the solution to form molecules which are insoluble in the oil of the
membrane. This traps the molecules on the inside of the liquid membrane. By this
manner a very high concentration of the molecules being removed from the process
water can be obtained inside the droplets. In this project a more stable type of
emulsion with smaller size droplets inside the liquid membrane will be used. The
dispersion of the emulsion in the process water will be accomplished by means of
a new fluidizer commercialized by the Helipump Corporation.
