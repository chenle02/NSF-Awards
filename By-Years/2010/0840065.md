This project will establish a research foundation for archaeological education
in informal learning environments. It will investigate the use of archaeological
content and concepts to help museums and other informal learning organizations
increase and diversity their audiences. In addition to generating information
and a data base, the effort will develop a research framework for presenting
this subject to various public audiences with emphasis on underrepresented
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The plan is to develop and implement a Delphi
survey for a variety of stakeholders, including 60 museums, to determine what
they do to attract diverse audiences, what is needed to create effective
archaeology learning opportunities, and how successful they have been in
communicating archaeological content and concepts. The result will be a
synthesis that informs a broad spectrum of the informal science education
community.
