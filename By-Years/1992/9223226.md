This project continues research aimed at turning the temporal-logic formalism
into a practical tool. The goals are to establish a uniform temporal-logic
methodology for the specification, verification, development, and synthesis of
reactive systems, and to construct an experimental system that will provide
automated support for these activities. The class of reactive systems considered
includes concurrent, real-time, and hybrid programs, process-control and
embedded programs, hardware devices, and other systems whose role is to maintain
a continuous interaction with their environment. To attain these goals, the
following topics are investigated; (1) deductive techniques for the synthesis of
reactive modules from temporal specifications, (2) temporal specification and
verification of hybrid systems, and (3) an automated support system for temporal
proofs.
