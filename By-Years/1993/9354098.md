9354098 St. John Mark St. John, President of Inverness Research Associates, has
organized a four-day conference in October, 1993 devoted to systemic reform of
science instruction in urban school districts. Eight urban districts that are at
least three years into NSF-funded reform efforts will send teams to share their
experiences, develop new skills, and contribute to a proceedings volume that
will document the lessons learned in these projects. Project leaders from
Teacher Enhancement projects in Cleveland, Buffalo, Baltimore, San Francisco,
Pasadena, and Las Vegas will be primary participants. Teams from cities with
more recently initiated reform projects (New York, Los Angeles, Brooklyn, and
Cincinnati) will also attend. The monograph resulting from the conference will
identify barriers to systemic change encountered by the participating teams, and
the solutions they have crafted. Four of the participating districts will be the
subjects of in-depth case studies presented in the monograph. These lessons may
prove essential to the many urban districts embarking on systemic change,
including those districts eligible for NSF support through the Urban Systemic
Initiative. Cost sharing on this project represents approximately 10% of the NSF
contribution. ***
