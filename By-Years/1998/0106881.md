0106123&lt;br/&gt;Jacobson&lt;br/&gt;0106881&lt;br/&gt;Barth&lt;br/&gt;The late
Mesozoic to early Tertiary geology of California is characterized by an arc-
forearc-accretionary wedge sequence produced during convergence with the
Farallon plate. These elements have been severely disrupted in southern
California, resulting in eastern facies being emplaced over western and
underthrusting of the enigmatic Pelona-Orocopia-Rand Schists. This project will
follow up on prior results of work on this system that indicate eastward
younging in the schists, and that provenance of the schists matches the
provenance in the overlying basement rocks. The results of this extensive
detrital zircon dating effort is expected to discriminate between several
possible tectonic scenarios for the development of this complex geology. Results
are key to understanding the late Mesozoic to early tertiary tectonic
environment of the California sector of the western cordillera.
