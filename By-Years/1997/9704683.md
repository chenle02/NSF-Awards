This project has three research topics from the field of iterative solution
methods for nonsymmetric linear systems of equations arising in the
discretization of second-order PDEs. Of these, two focus on time-harmonic wave
propagation and one on convection-diffusion problems. The first topic consists
in extending algorithms for the solution of time-harmonic scattering problems
for the Helmholtz equation, from 2D to 3D. Based on a discretization which uses
an exact radiation condition - and hence permits small computational domains
relative to the scatterer - these algorithms use an imbedding technique combined
with a fast Helmhotz solver, resulting in fast and well-parallelizable
algorithms for an application which is becoming increasingly important. The
second topic is an investigation of recent algebraic multilevel techniques
applied to exterior Helmholtz problems. These techniques could lead to an
algorithm of optimal complexity for solving this type of problem. Finally, the
third topic involves investigating effects of stabilization techniques for
discretization of convection-diffusion problems on iterative solution of
discrete problems.
