The installation of a local area network, fairly powerful (windows-capable)
microcomputers on the network, and appropriate software enables a significant
improvement in the course on computing concepts taken by non-majors in computer
science. The course includes programming principles in practical (spreadsheet,
database) settings which, with the upgrade, are becoming interwoven rather than
disjoint, with the students learning through their immersion in an enriched
computing environment. With computer-facilitated classroom conversations, use of
e-mail, sharing of hardware and software resources on the network, and use of
the windows interface for general software management, students use tools in an
integrated, cooperative, and creative manner. The new setting removes old
obstacles to the study of computing principles (textual interface, awkward
movement to get from one software environment to another, isolation of
applications), and adds intriguing and engaging new features which stimulates
such study.
