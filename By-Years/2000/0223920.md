This award provides continued funding of The Nyanza Project, a Research
Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site on the shore of Lake Tanganyika, Africa
offering interdisciplinary research and training in paleoclimatology,
atmospheric science, limnology, and biology for undergraduates, graduate
students and secondary school teachers interested in tropical lake studies. The
award provides support for administrative staff, academic mentors, and equipment
at the site and allows for the participation American undergraduate students,
graduate students, and secondary school teachers in the field. American students
and mentors join their African counterparts for an interactive season of
teaching and research at the field site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU award
weaves science, education, and cultural exchange into a rich tapestry. As such,
it has the potential for opening doors for educational opportunity while it
opens minds to a greater understanding of natural science. The Nyanza Project
also promotes capacity building and technology transfer between American and
African students and colleagues. In general, the Nyanza Project offers a unique
educational and cultural opportunity to young scientists interested in the
natural sciences.
