Past commercialization efforts for robotics have been dominated by mobile bases.
Robotic arms tend to stay in cages or far from humans (e.g., manufacturing).
This I-Corps team wants to bring mobile manipulators to human environments to
perform repetitive manual tasks that people find undesirable. The team's initial
hypothesis is that surface cleaning is one such task. It is anticipated that
automation of surface sanitation can achieve more surface coverage with higher
frequency, creating a more sanitary environment that reduces illness. Such a
robot also has the potential to automate undesirable manual labor, as well as
reduce human injuries associated with repetitive physical work. Automating tasks
requiring lower skills or manual labor could ameliorate the labor shortage by
allowing humans to focus more on high-skilled labor. This project, therefore,
aims to define a commercial application for an intelligent mobile robot. The
presence of ubiquitous, friendly robots that can be used by more people will
ideally also inspire younger generations to pursue STEM education, leading to a
more skilled and competitive American workforce.

This project aims to define a commercial application for an intelligent mobile
robot with an arm (mobile manipulator). Based on over eight years of research
results in Human-Robot Interaction, the team intends to apply learning from
demonstration (LfD) algorithms to make the robot programmable by end users with
no robotics experience, which can be accomplished using an intuitive social
dialogue. The robot will also need to act autonomously in the presence of humans
in a way that is transparent and predictable, which requires developing
manipulation and navigation behavior with social awareness. The bulk of the
team's methodology during the I-Corps program will be dedicated to interviews
for customer discovery, with an initial target customer as health care
establishments. To validate this segment, the team intends to visit hospitals
and long-term care facilities to identify customer pain points, as well as
processes and barriers for adopting robotic technology. In addition, the team
plans to interview experts, attend meetings, and conduct literature searches to
better understand the domain; and, by the end of the I-Corps program, it expects
to have defined a set of key tasks that the robot must perform to provide value
to our target customer segment. These tasks will define specifications for a
minimum viable design of the robot hardware and software.
