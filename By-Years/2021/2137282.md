This project aims to facilitate efficient and reliable operation of next
generation active distribution systems. This will be accomplished by improved
monitoring, control and optimization of their operation. The overall impact will
be more reliable, less costly and environmentally cleaner energy delivery to the
end users. Furthermore, implementation and utilization of the project’s results
will provide job and training opportunities for the next generation of power
engineers in the nation. The intellectual merits of the project include improved
reliability of network applications that use the network model, by detecting
both measurement and network model errors; using novel compensation and
calibration methods that enable unbiased tracking of the system’s operating
states; and facilitating incorporation of renewable energy sources in overall
generation dispatch of large power grids. The broader impacts of the project
include training and education of students from underrepresented and minority
groups via REU programs in the summers and as student researchers during regular
semesters; and transformation of the monitoring and operation of future
distribution systems making them more reliable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of
the project is to address challenges in monitoring future distribution systems.
Distribution systems have been treated in isolation until recently, however
their composition and required analysis tools have drastically changed in the
recent years due to the renewable energy sources, non-conventional loads, and
energy storage facilities creating bi-directional power flows between
distribution and transmission systems. Thus, effective management of these
systems requires reliable and efficient monitoring of the state, topology and
model parameters. Thus, the project comprehensively investigates the monitoring
challenges for mixed-phase distribution systems containing different types of
measurements, non-radial configurations, and errors in both measurements and
network model parameters. Detailed mathematical formulation for mixed phase
distribution system state estimation which exploits modal decomposition,
extension of Lagrangian based parameter error detection method for mixed-phase
network models, dynamic tracking of line model and decoding them to detect and
locate different types of faults and disturbances; remote calibration of three
phase synchronized phasor measurements and localizing topology errors by
recursive multi-area estimation constitute the technical innovations associated
with the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
