Georgia Tech operates a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site on
structure-property correlations across length scales. The program emphasizes
team research in projects addressing characterization and modeling of
deformation and fracture in metals, mechanical properties of nanocrystalline
alloys, optically active nanomaterials, and processing and characterization of
functional composites. Fifteen students are recruited every year for an eight-
week summer research experience. The program also includes the participation of
six high school teachers every year. The teachers are part of the research teams
and develop curricular materials such as demonstration projects on the research
topics and computer-based materials modules. The teachers' participation is
supported by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the NSF Directorate
for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.
