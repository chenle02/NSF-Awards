Eve Vavagiakis is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Fellowship to carry
out a program of research and education at Cornell and Princeton universities.
Vavagiakis will undertake a program of data analysis and instrumentation
development to advance the use of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies
such as the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect for cosmological measurements.
Results from the project will allow astronomers to understand properties of
galaxy clusters and shed light on galaxy evolution and cosmology. For the
education component of this project, Vavagiakis will conduct astronomy outreach
to local high schools, develop educational materials to accompany a childrenâ€™s
book series featuring modern NSF-funded experiments, and provide research
mentoring for underserved and underrepresented
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will enable the highest
significance measurement of the pairwise kinetic SZ effect and advance future SZ
measurements to constrain fundamental physics. To achieve this goal, Vavagiakis
will: analyze CMB maps from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope combined with data
from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument; deploy a cryogenic array camera
based on kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) that she designed for early science
with a new submillimeter telescope; and develop an extended multifrequency
pipeline for SZ analyses for existing and planned CMB telescopes. By
demonstrating the background-limited sensitivity of KIDs, this project might
help establish them as detectors of choice for future millimeter and
submillimeter telescopes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
