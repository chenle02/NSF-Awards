Dr. Thomas B. Rauchfuss of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign will
design and synthesize a variety of molecular and solid-state metal sulfide
compounds. The four specific areas of study include metal-centered reactivity in
M4S3 clusters and osmium- and iron-sulfides, examining structure/reactivity
trends in M3S4 clusters, development of new routes to dimers and polymers
containing metal clusters, and manipulating the stability and stoichiometry of
newly discoverd C60-S-Fe adducts. A basic premise of the cluster work is that
reactive entities are best prepared by subtle means compatible with the
preservation of highly reactive sites, and patterns delineated in this study are
expected to provide a context for correlating a significant body of molecular
and solid state chemistry. Dr. Rauchfuss will also explore new hybrid bio-
organometallic materials and new carbon sulfides derived from C60 which bridge
the interface between inorganic and organometallic sulfide chemistry. The
overall goal of this research is a molecular-level understanding of the
synthesis, reactivity, and structure of metal sulfides. The information obtained
from this work provides an underpinning for new catalytic technologies, new
materials, and most importantly, the discovery of unexpected new chemical
phenomena. The work is motivated by the broad relevance of metal sulfide systems
and the chemsitry of elemental sulfur to such materials. Furthermore, the work
is expected to lead to the discovery of new chemical phenomena related to
materials used to clean fossil fuels, to transform atmospheric nitrogen into
life-giving ammonia, and to capture and transfer energy from the sun.
