The objective of this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project on
solid mechanics between V. Lubarda of the University of Titograd and D.
Krajcinovic of Arizona State University is to develop a theory coupling elasto-
plastic deformation of crystalline solids and damage mechanics as it applies to
plasticity of metals. The investigators combine their joint expertise, Lubarda
in elastic plastic theory and Krajcinovic in damage theory. The research results
will advance current knowledge of plasticity and its application to problems in
engineering and materials science. Of particular interest is the possible
application of this theory in metal forming processes. This project was approved
by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on Cooperation in Science and Technology and is
supported through a joint fund consisting of matching contributions from the
U.S. and Yugoslav governments. The U.S. contribution is provided annually by the
Department of State. No NSF funds are involved. The award, except for funds for
U.S. scientist travel, is made to the Yugoslav institution.
