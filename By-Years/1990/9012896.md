The objective of this proposal is to study how sequence and solution salt
concentration influence the structural, thermodynamic and kinetic properties of
a DNA-RNA hybrid oligomer. Questions to be addressed are: Do DNA-RNA hybrid
duplexes exist only as A-form helices or do they display a sequence dependent
shape?, What is the role of nearest neighbor sequence determining the stability
of a hybrid duplex? and How does salt concentration affect the physical
properties and behavior of hybrid molecules? Work will include: 1. Circular
dichroism studies of hybrid duplex conformation as a function of sequence and
salt concentration 2. Optical melting studies to develop a basis set of free
energy parameters for the prediction of stability and conformation of hybrid
duplexes in 1.0 M Na+ 3. Optical melting studies of the effects of salt on the
thermodynamics of duplex formation 4. The construction of a laser Raman
temperature jump spectrophotometer to measure kinetic properties of hybrid
duplex formation as a function of base sequence and salt concentration.
