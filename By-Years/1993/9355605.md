9355605 Lochhead TERC - Tools for Learning Center Teacher Enhancement Principal
Investigator's Network (TEPInet) A principal task is establishing a network that
could, among other things, eventually substitute for the annual Teacher
Enhancement Project Director meeting. The focus is on an important functions of
this meeting: the opportunity for PIs with similar interests to exchange
information and views. This focus is on interaction between PIs as an
enhancement of their awards. Additionally, this network will provide databases,
lists, "home pages" and the like containing information of interest to not only
the PIs but the educational communities they serve and the broader public. The
key concepts for TEPnet are (1) a distributed, electronically-united seminar,
and (2) moderated on-line discussions, based on the LABnet model. Cost sharing
is 23% of the total budget. ***
