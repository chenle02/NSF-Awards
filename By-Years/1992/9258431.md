This is an award to provide support for research on the role of metal- organic
interactions that result in sorption of metals and organic compounds on mineral
surfaces. These processes are of central importance in the transport of metals
in groundwater aquifers, in the removal of contaminants in water treatment
process and in the formation of soil. The award is in accord with conditions
contained in NSF 91-112, Young Investigator Awards FY 1992 Program Guidelines
for Submission of Nominations. Factors that control the transport and fate of
pollutants in aqueous systems are of interest because of the role they play in
controlling the movement and fate of the pollutants through aquifers, in
treatment process and natural systems. Results of this research are expected to
be applied in engineering design of water supply, water treatment and pollution
abatement systems.
