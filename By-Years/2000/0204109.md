ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;0204109&lt;br/&gt;Haesun Park&lt;br/&gt;University of
Minnesota- Twin Cities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to today's exponential growth of
the internet and computing power, an information retrieval&lt;br/&gt;system is
expected to handle a tremendous amount of data, and users demand more efficient
techniques&lt;br/&gt;to obtain useful information from the flood of data. The
goal of this proposed research is to find lower dimensional representations of
text data in vector space based information retrieval. Dimension reduction is
imperative for achieving high efficiency and effectiveness in manipulating the
massive quantity of data in today's information retrieval system. A problem of
fundamental importance here is to achieve better representation of the data with
relatively severe dimension reduction, rather than simple dimension reduction
through a lower rank approximation of a matrix. One difficulty is that it is not
easy to measure by a theoretical formula how well a certain dimension reduction
method provides a good representation of the original data, and it will be
essential to conduct theoretical research in parallel with experimental study.
