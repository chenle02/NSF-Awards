A combination of pulsed molecular beam, surface infrared spectroscopy, and
surface optoacoustic spectroscopy will be used to investigate the kinetics of
fundatmental chemical reactions on surfaces. Adsorbate diffusion, island
formation, trapping-desorption processes at deffect lattice sites, and
bimolecular surface combination reactions will be amongst the processes to be
investigated. Systems to be studied include carbon monoxide and nitric oxide and
some large molecular systems. A range of single crystal substrates will be used
in the study, including periodically-stepped surfaces. The investigation will
enable the mechanism for these important surface processes to be better
understood. %%% This five year continuing grant to the University of Maryland at
College Park for support of Professor Reutt-Robey as a Presidential Young
Investigator is designed to promote her rapid and effective growth as an
independent researcher in the area of fundamental kinetic processes on the gas-
solid interface. The research, in the general area of Analytical and Surface
Chemistry, promises to provide a better understanding of surface processes which
will be important for applications such as catalysis.
