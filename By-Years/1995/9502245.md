Flexibility and adaptability of a robotic manipulator can be achieved by
incorporating vision and sensory information in the feedback loop. Previous
research by the PI introduced a framework called ``controlled active vision''
for efficient integration of the vision sensor in the feedback loop. This
framework emphasized eye-in-hand robotic systems (where the vision sensor is
mounted on or close to the manipulator's end-effector) and was applied to the
problem of robotic visual tracking and servoing with very promising results.
This research extends the framework to other problems of eye-in-hand robotic
systems such as the derivation of depth maps from controlled motion; the vision-
guided, automatic grasping of moving objects; the active calibration of the
robot-camera system; the problem of automatically detecting moving objects of
interest; and the computation of the relative pose of the target from the
camera. In addition, the new work investigates issues such as the stability and
the robustness of the algorithms. All the work is experimentally verified on the
Minnesota Robotic Visual Tracker (a flexible eye-in-hand robotic system). This
research has potential applications to transportation (e.g., pedestrian
detection and tracking, vision-based vehicle following), inspection, and
assembly (e.g., vision-guided manipulation of moving objects).
