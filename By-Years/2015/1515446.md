Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of strong interactions between quarks
and gluons that make up hadrons, such as protons and neutrons. This project will
support theoretical and computational work to study the properties of this
fundamental force at low temperatures, where quarks and gluons are bound
together into hadrons, and high temperatures, where quarks and gluons interact
weekly and form a quark-gluon plasma. A post-doctoral fellow will be mentored by
the PI to work on several aspects of the proposal. Numerical computations will
use high-performance computing systems, and results obtained as part of this
project will be presented at international conferences in nuclear and particle
physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;QCD belongs to a class of (QCD-like) theories that
exhibit a transition from confinement (hadronic matter) at low temperature or
density to asymptotic freedom (quark matter) at high temperature or density.
This project will study the fundamental features of QCD-like theories by
studying them at finite physical volume using a new global observable. The
project will also study confinement by exploring the properties of certain
hadronic matter called hybrid/exotic mesons that are unique to QCD-like
theories. In addition, this study will address related topics such as the
existence of tetraquarks. The grand canonical ensemble for QCD-like theories at
finite density will be rewritten as a sum over canonical ensembles to study two-
dimensional QCD. The lessons learned there will be used to explore the
feasibility for studying four-dimensional QCD at finite density.
