The objective of this research is to investigate a new technique for the
production of amorphous alloys. This method is called Rapid Pressure
Solidification (RPS). The process involves pressurizing the material in order to
form a solid rather than the usual manner of cooling. The process will eliminate
the sizing, compaction, and sintering required in the fabrication of engineering
components from rapid temperature solidified powders. The research will be
carried out in phases. In the first phase work will be directed at refining the
existing RPS scheme by including pressure and temperature instrumentation, by
seeking reproducibility of the current results, and by conducting a search for a
low temperature alloy which will consistently show the effects of rapid
pressurization. The second phase will consist of matching theory with the
experimental results. Metallurgical kinetics, solid-solubility, and the
thermodynamics of binary systems and the effects of high pressure on them will
be investigated.
