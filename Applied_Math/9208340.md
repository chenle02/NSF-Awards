The investigator applies computer modelling to the investigation of the fluid
dynamics of aquatic animal propulsion. She has developed a reliable
computational model in which the fluid motion is described by the incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations, and the immersed organism is modelled by an immersed
elastic structure undergoing time-dependent motions. No inherent restriction is
imposed on the Reynolds number of the flow, on the geometry of the swimming
organism, nor on the complexity of the swimming motion. Moreover, fluid dynamic
interactions of multiple organisms in in the same domain of fluid can be
studied. The goal of this research is to extend the simulations to different
modes of swimming such as jet propulsion, as well as rowing and undulatory
motion and to extend the model to three dimensions, where more realistic and
complex motions can be studied. The project includes the effect of buoyancy on
the swimming of microorganisms, so one may study the phenomena of geotaxis, the
orientation of movement with respect to gravity, both in single organisms and in
collective swimming. One step in understanding the evolutionary adaptations of
aquatic animals, as well as the biochemical properties associated with
microorganisms, is understanding the mechanical and hydrodynamical implications
of different swimming morphologies and motions. This project provides the first
computational model of aquatic animal locomotion solves the full Navier-Stokes
equations that describe the motion of the organism in the fluid.
