Islands are dynamically interesting because they pose strong dynamical
constraints on the exchange between the island shelf and the open ocean, and can
result in important water mass transformation and export. These dynamics also
influence the circulation on the shelf, on the slope, and far from the island.
Idealized and realistic numerical ocean models will be combined with simple
analytic models to better understand what controls water mass transformation and
net downwelling around islands. The idealized framework emphasized here will
provide a clearer understanding of why these processes differ between different
islands and how they might be expected to change in a changing climate. Work
supported by this grant will contribute to both undergraduate and graduate
education programs at the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combination of analytic models and eddy
resolving numerical models will provide insights into the dynamics and
thermodynamics that control the diapycnal mass flux and mixing on island shelves
and export of product waters to the surrounding ocean. Particular focus will be
given to asymmetrical forcing situations in which the buoyancy-forcing, wind
stress, surrounding ocean, or bottom topography vary around the island
perimeter. The general approach will use theory to identify the relevant non-
dimensional numbers and provide a dynamical framework with which to guide and
interpret the numerical model calculations. The numerical models will be used to
test the basic predictions from the theory while more completely resolving
important processes such as nonlinear eddy fluxes and convection. Quantities of
interest include: properties of product water masses; distribution of upwelling
and downwelling; net diapycnal mass flux; induced circulations and fluxes across
the shelf break.
