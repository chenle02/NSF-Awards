This proposal aims to investigate how the optical properties of liquid crystals
are modified by external perturbation, in this case by an ordinary laser beam.
One area to be explored involves the study of laser-induced molecular
reorientation and macroscopic structural transitions, highly nonlinear optical
wave propagation, and laser induced nonlinear dynamics in liquid crystals.
Another area focuses on liquid crystal properties, such as those resulting from
surface or interface processes, that cannot be as easily probed by other
techniques.
