We propose to build an atomic force microscope with a conducting tip to identify
sites where electroactive molecules span an otherwise insulating lipid membrane.
The microscope will be capable of detecting currents of a few femtoamps, and
will operate under environmental and temperature (80-300K) control. Recent work
by Mazur and Hipps indicates that the current-voltage characteristics at
conductive sites are related to the redox chemistry of the electroactive
molecules and we propose to study this phenomenon using well-characterized
molecular assemblies of porphyrin-linked alkanethiols with the goal of
distinguishing individual organic molecules. Operation at low temperatures will
be used to control ion currents (such as unwanted surface conduction in a water
layer) and to stiffen soft samples (leading to higher AFM resolution). Our
ultimate goal is to develop a new spatial-mapping tool for studying electronic
and ionic processes across cell membranes. The first biological sample we will
study will be the well characterized (and highly ordered) arrays of the
photosynthetic reaction center from Rhodopseudomonas viridis. We hope to be able
to identify the cytochrome bcl complexes and determine their spatial
distribution in the membrane.
