The goal of this project is to use a single enzyme system, dihydrofolate
reductase, as the basis for a variety of experiments in a new biochemistry
laboratory course for non- majors, and in the modernization of an advanced
course for majors. Using a cloned gene as an abundant source of an enzyme that
plays an important role in cancer chemotherapy, enzyme mechanisms, gene
amplification and molecular evolution allows students to learn a wide range of
techniques and provides continuity to the exercises. The spectrophotometer,
centrifuges, fractionator, and electrophoresis equipment allow students to learn
protein purification, enzyme kinetics, immunoblotting, ultraviolet difference
spectrophotometry, plasmid isolation, restriction mapping, and DNA sequencing.
