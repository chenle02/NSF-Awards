A feasibitlity study is proposed for development of a mathematical learning
model for constructive induction and parameter selection, and its application to
a machining operation. The model will enable the decision maker (eg., machine
operator) to arrive at the most satisfactory decision regarding parameter
selection in the machining operation. The model will "learn" from past
performance of the operation, and from the operator's previous input, and
automatically determine machining parameters. The model is based on decision
variables such as feed and speed; objectives such as cost, production rate, and
quality; and the operator's overall index of performance or utility. This
approach should enable the model to become more customized to the requirements
of a specific operation, operator, and equipment, and could be valuable in
enhancing the interaction of operator and machine. The exploratory effort will
focus on determining various ways to construct the model and achieve the
objectives, in terms of both theory and application. The proposed study appears
to present a novel approach to parameter selection for machining operations,
which while far from practical usefulness, seems a necessary starting point,
which could lead to a sharper definition of the concept. An award is therefore
recommended under the procedure for Expedited Awards for Novel Research.
