The physics department is creating an upper division experimental physics course
for physics majors that will give each physics major an opportunity to do
experiments with up-to-date instrumentation in the area of basic plasm physics
and vacuum science. The creation of such a course constitutes a major
improvement in the quality of the Physics Bachelor's Degree program. The
instrumentation includes a vacuum system built around a 325 1/s diffusion pump.
Electronic equipment (Lockin Amplifier, Boxcar Integrator & Computer Interface
(GPIB) and electrostatic probes (Langmuir Probes, Gridded Energy Analyzer)
permit fundamental plasma parameter measurements, including plasma density and
electrostatic potential, electron and ion temperature and distribution
functions. Ion acoustic wave, ion beam, and chaotic dynamics experiments are
being performed as well. The instrumentation also includes a digital storage
oscilliscope which is integrated with an IBM PC/AT compatible computer for data
acquisition and analysis. Communications Software provides access to the
University's VAX computers for off line data analysis. The University is
matching the award with an equal amount of funds.
