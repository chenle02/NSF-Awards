The peculiar characteristics of the products and the technological constraints
of construction significantly differentiate it from other forms of
manufacturing; this suggests that the process of innovation and factors
governing this process will differ. This investigation will decipher the process
of product innovation in construction, which has been neglected by researchers
despite its immense importance to the technological advancement of construction.
This investigation will consider several successful product innovations that
occurred on different construction projects. Each project will be the subject of
an individual case study, and the study as a whole will use a multiple.case
design. The conclusions and implications obtained form the generalizations
across the multiple cases will not only add construction's dimension (which is
conspicuously lacking) to the existing knowledge base regarding the process of
innovation, but contribute to the technological progress in the construction
industry itself by allowing researchers and industry professionals to focus
their resources on the critical variables of the innovation process in
developing new products.//
