This research program is concerned with the solutions to the Navier-Stokes
equations in fluid mechanics. It addresses the question of existence of
solutions, the qualitative nature of these solutions, the relationship between
these solutions and the solutions of the corres- ponding inviscid flow problems,
and the computation of the finite difference approximations of the exact
solutions. The results of this research project are expected to lead to a better
understanding of physcial systems involving compressible viscous fluid flows and
hence a better design for these systems.
