Precision Combustion, Inc. (PCI) proposes to develop a clean-starting, high
turndown advanced technology catalytic combustor as the combustor for small gas
turbine engines for use in hybrid range-extended electric automotive vehicles.
The low NOx (e.g., l-2ppm) offered by an efficient lean burn catalytic combustor
together with the ability of clean starting (minimizing hydrocarbon and carbon
monoxide omissions) would make a range-extended (and hence commercially
attractive) electric vehicle with low enough emissions to satisfy air quality
needs. In this Phase I, PCI will seek to experimentally establish the viability
of its concepts for clean cold starting in an advanced catalytic combustor. The
emissions goal is to achieve better than California ULEV standards, and to
explore the potential for achieving emissions, especially of NOx, in the same
range as electric utilities with state-of-the-art aftertreatment. Such an engine
could legitimately be considered a `Zero Emission Vehicle` engine.
