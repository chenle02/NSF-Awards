The Biotron, constructed by the National Science Foundation at the University of
Wisconsin, is a premier research facility in the United States, providing
precise and unique environmental control capabilities for plant and animal
research. Use of the Biotron for plant research is significantly hampered,
however, by the insufficient light intensities provided by the current lighting
system. We propose to install electrodeless microwave lamps in one room of the
Biotron to have the potential of effectively simulating the sunlight spectrum
and providing in excess of 1000 mol m-2 s-1 of photosynthetic photon flux. These
new lamps will be evaluated for their potential to provide these photon flux
levels without excessive heating along with study of reflector design for
effective uniformity, lamp degradation over time, and capability for dimming to
carefully lower and raise photon flux levels. We will develop documentation to
provide information for utilization of these lamps in other facilities needing
high photosynthetic photon levels.
