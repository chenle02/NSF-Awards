This award supports dissertation research in ethno-botany and ethno-linguistics
to explore the cross-dialectical similarities and differences among the known
dialects of the Greenlandic language. The CoPI, student researcher, will be
examining plant knowledge and usage by Greelandic people and what this knowledge
can tell us about linguistic change in the country. The researcher argues that
because plants in the Arctic are circumpolar in range, suggesting a high
likelihood of similar uses among arctic peoples, and because the Inuit of
Alaska, Canada, and Greenland share ancestry and language, she should be able to
make some inferences about the relationship between Inuit knowledge of plant
usage and linguistic change. Greenland is home to three of the 16 Inuit language
dialects making it an ideal location for documenting plant names and uses to
preserve this knowledge and to determine how usage varies across dialects as a
proxy for knowledge across all Inuit dialects. Additionally, these data will be
used to test an explanatory model put forth by linguist Michael Fortescue (1986)
that suggests dialect distribution in Greenland is the result of relatively
recent migrations first to the island and subsequent migrations along the coast.
