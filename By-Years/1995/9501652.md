9501652 Chong The research aspect of this proposal deals with issues in
decision, control, and optimization problems for Discrete Event Systems (DESs).
DESs are dynamical systems that are driven by the occurrence of physical events,
and arise in virtually all manmade systems, including manufacturing systems,
communication networks, distributed computer systems, logistic systems, and
vehicular traffic. The proposal considers performance oriented DES models, and
focuses on the problem decision and control for performance optimization.
Methods for optimizing DESs have received significant interest in recent years,
and show tremendous promise for the development of efficient ways to optimize
large-scale complex man-made systems. The proposal focuses on parametric and
nonparametric decision and control problems. An objective of the study is to
couple perturbation analysis methods with optimization algorithms, both
parametric and nonparametric, with the aim of gaining further rigorous
understanding into when and why they work, and developing algorithms and tools
that will be useful in DES decision and control problems. This work emphasizes
applications in manufacturing systems, communication networks, and real-time
computer systems. The education component of this proposal focuses on three
efforts. The first effort is to develop and promote a program of undergraduate
involvement in research, through individual or team projects. The second effort
consists of developing a comprehensive research program and curriculum in the
area of modern control, including laboratory facilities for experimentation and
computing. The third effort concerns the principal investigator's ongoing work
in the professional development and training of engineering students, primarily
in his capacity of as the branch counselor and faculty advisor of the Purdue
IEEE student branch. ***
