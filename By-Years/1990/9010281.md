The object of this project is to investigate the monolithic integration of
different optoelectronic devices on a AlGaAs/GaAs quantum well wafer. MBE growth
on patterned GaAs substrate and focused ion beam etching techniques will be used
to achieve the coupling between the different devices. In this respect,
concentrated efforts will be on the following two structures: (a) Monolithic
integration of laser-amplifier structure to obtain high output power; and (b)
Monolithic integration of MQW laser and passive waveguides.
