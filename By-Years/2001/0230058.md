PROPOSAL NO.: 0230058&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Crimp (Baumann) Melissa
J.&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION NAME: Michigan State University&lt;br/&gt;TITLE:
Enhancing Bioengineering Opportunities for Engineering
Majors&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Michigan State
University will plan a systemically reform of its undergraduate
&lt;br/&gt;engineering programs and to enhance undergraduate student learning in
the field &lt;br/&gt;of bioengineering. This project will be undertaken by an
interdisciplinary team composed of faculty from the College of Engineering and
the College of Education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It will address the following
factors that affect the sustainability of curricular-change initiatives:
&lt;br/&gt; the role of strategic planning within the academic unit and at the
institutional level; &lt;br/&gt; the leadership role of department chairs/heads
and college deans; &lt;br/&gt; the role of faculty planning, faculty assessment
and faculty autonomy; &lt;br/&gt; the system of values and rewards for
individual faculty and for their academic units; and &lt;br/&gt; the role of
constituent groups in establishing and evaluating educational program objectives
and curricular outcomes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bioengineering was selected as
the focus for this reform effort because the State of Michigan recently
announced a $1B.i.e., $50M/year, twenty-year. commitment to developing "A
Michigan Life Sciences Corridor." &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
