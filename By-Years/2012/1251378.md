The project conducts a one-day symposium to synthesize recommendations from past
Maker Faire workshops and initiate new approaches to strategies and tools for
documenting and assessing the range of learning and engagement that is born of
designing, making and engineering activities as found in the Maker Faire
movement. Following the symposium, a post-symposium review panel will be
convened to review and critique the framework, using specified criteria. Staff
members from the New York Hall of Science will then integrate the reviews into a
revised framework document. The project has broader policy implications for
larger assessment systems in informal learning environments such as the Mozilla
Badges initiative.
