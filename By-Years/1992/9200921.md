The dramatic success of the export-oriented industrialization strategy of the
East Asian countries based on inexpensive labor enabled these countries to
rapidly attain the status of newly industrializing countries (NICs). The
assessment of the potential of these countries to move from the semi-periphery
to the core of the capitalist world economy depends on assembling empirical
evidence at both the level of within-country and that of across- countries. With
this evidence the nature and extent of expansionism of core transnational
corporations (TNCs) of a given industry can be estimated and utilized to
facilitate disentanglement of the complex patterns of the industrial mobility of
NICs in the world economic system. This doctoral dissertation project will make
a cross-country inter-industry comparison by comparing Korea with Latin American
cases over the last three decades and a within-industry comparison by studying
the divergent market strategies toward transnational corporations that the three
Korean automobile manufacturers--Hyundai, Daewoo, and Kia--took in order to
provide a solid empirical foundation for explicating the global functioning of
transnational corporations and the impact that they have had on the Korean
automobile industry. Statistical and historical data from the Korean automobile
manufacturers and government agencies with be combined with data from interviews
with engineers, economists and managers at the auto companies and with auto
experts and economic and social historians in order to illuminate the
developmental process. This project will contribute to social scientific
understandings of the paradoxical relationship between dependency and
development and of the process of industrialization from a world system
perspective. This project also will provide an excellent opportunity for a
promising young scholar to continue to develop independent research skills.
