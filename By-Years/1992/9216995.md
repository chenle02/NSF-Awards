In this project, the Principal Investigator will collect water samples for
analysis of Tritium and Helium content along hydrographic lines designated by
the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) as P-17N and P-14N in the North
Pacific. The measured distribution of these tracers would be combined with
hydrographic and other tracer information to study the general circulation of
the North Pacific.
