AST-0352664/Eikenberry, U Florida&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Florida
is designing and building the Canarias Infrared Camera Experiment, a near-
infrared open-use guest instrument for the soon-to-be-completed Gran Telescopio
Canarias 10.4-meter telescope. The camera is an all-reflective 1-2.5 micron
imager with a 3.4x3.4-arcminute field-of-view, offering built-in upgrade paths
for narrow-band imaging, low- and moderate-resolution grism spectroscopy and
imaging polarimetry. The combination of this camera and the Gran Telsescopio
Canarias will produce one of the most powerful near-infrared scientific tools in
the world, enabling a broad range of investigations from microquasars to stellar
populations to high-redshift galaxy evolution (including at least eight projects
currently funded by NSF). The present project will support the involvement of
two graduate students in the design, fabrication, integration, and commissioning
of the camera, as well as funds to populate the narrow-band imaging,
spectroscopic, and polarimetric upgrades to the instrument. This work provides
important training opportunities in astronomical instrumentation to two graduate
students, and also greatly enhances the scientific productivity of the camera.
