This project will support the Societal Institute of the Mathematical Sciences
(SIMS) Steering Committee for the Mathematical Sciences in the Human Genome
Project (HGP). The purpose of the Committee is to (1) monitor the rapid
developments in the HGP and related fields which particularly concern the
mathematical sciences, (2) make specific recommendations to appropriate groups,
and (3) initiate research/education projects when they seem reasonable or
necessary. The Committee will meet twice per year for the next two and one half
years. In general, the Committee plans to ensure that issues involving the
mathematical sciences are examined with proper attention to all their
ramifications, particularly for research and interdisciplinary training in
connection with the HGP.
