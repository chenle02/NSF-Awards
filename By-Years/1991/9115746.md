This study is an investigation of the fundamentals of heat and mass transfer
occurring during the steam cleaning of contaminants adsorbed in soil. The heat
transfer and the condensate and gas flow are analyzed assuming local thermal
equilibrium, convection, dispersion, gravity, capillarity and diffuso- and
thermo-capillarity. The mass transfer among the phases (solid, liquid, and gas)
are analyzed based on local non-equilibrium assumptions. The interfacial mass
transfer coefficients and the specific surface areas are obtained by a direct
simulation of two-phase flow in a phenomenological unit-cell. Experiments are
performed in soil columns using contaminant simulants with a controlled initial
equilibrium (solid-gas) condition prior to injection of steam. Transient local
temperature, capillary pressure, and contaminant concentration (in liquid and
gaseous phases) measurements are made. The results of the experiments will be
compared to those predicted in order to examine the validity of the
phenomenological unit- cell based kinetic model. The proposed research will
allow for the development and critical verification of the pore-level analysis
of heat and mass transfer in soil during steam cleaning. For the first time, the
local velocity and local saturation dependence of the mass transfer rates among
the three phases will be determined by a direct simulation and will be verified
experimentally. The results will also be valuable for analysis/prediction of the
isothermal remediation processes.
