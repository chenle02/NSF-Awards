This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

The investigators will carry out high spatial resolution mid-infrared imaging,
spectroscopy, and polarimetry of nearby active galactic nuclei (AGN), taking
advantage of the subarcsecond, diffraction limited resolution afforded by 8-10m
telescopes to probe the inner regions of AGN. The main goal is to elucidate the
spectral energy distribution (i.e., the brightness versus wavelength) of the
circumnuclear gas/dust torus in the infrared region, and compare the data to
detailed models for this emission. The group has substantial guaranteed time
using their polarimetric camera CanariCam on the 10.4m-diameter Gran Telescopio
CANARIAS (GTC).

Broader impacts of this program include developing international collaborations,
archival data release, bilingual outreach, and training of graduate students and
a postdoctoral researcher. The research will enhance our understanding of the
environs of active galactic nuclei, particularly the torus thought to block the
light from the central region depending on orientation.
