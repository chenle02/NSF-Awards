Coding theory is the study of error-correcting codes, which encode data to
protect it from noise. Error-correcting codes have been studied since the 1940s;
today, they are used everywhere from hard drives to satellite communication.
This goal of this research is to pose and attack new fundamental questions in
coding theory, inspired by new applications of coding theory across computer
science, mathematics, and engineering. In answering these questions, this
project not only addresses the application areas, but also develops insights to
tackle long-standing open questions in coding theory. This project is
interdisciplinary, and includes a synergistic education plan aimed at bringing
together students from different backgrounds. The education plan incorporates
course development of both graduate and undergraduate courses at Stanford
University as well as training for graduate students and research opportunities
for undergraduates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, this project focuses on
four new lenses into coding theory, motivated by applications in distributed
storage, cryptography, algorithm design and pseudorandomness. Each of these
lenses raises new fundamental questions in coding theory. These questions fall
broadly into the categories of "locality" and "list-decoding." Informally,
locality refers to the ability to decode a small part of the original data from
only a small amount of encoded data. List-decoding refers to the setting where
there is so much noise that the original data cannot be uniquely determined, and
the decoder must do the best it can to narrow the possibilities to a relatively
short list. By answering these new fundamental questions, this research will
both make progress on the motivating applications and will also develop new
theory illuminating the structure of locality and list-decoding in error
correcting codes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
