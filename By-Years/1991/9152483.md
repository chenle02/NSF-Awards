This project supports enhancement of the undergraduate physics laboratory
experience at the University of Delaware. Equipment is provided for improvement
of the modern physics lab in the areas of optics and spectroscopy. Direct
laboratory experience with modern equipment and measurement techniques is the
focus of our revitalized laboratory sequence. Current laser and spectroscopic
techniques are well represented by the following light scattering experiments:
Photon counting and detector properties, Properties of photons (single photon
interference, statistics, weak localization), Raman and Brillouin spectroscopy,
Photon correlation spectroscopy (critical opalescence, Brownian motion), and
Pulsed laser spectroscopy (dye lasers, time-resolved fluorescence).NSF grant
funds are being matched with funds from non-federal sources.
