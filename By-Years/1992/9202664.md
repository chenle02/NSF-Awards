Arizona State University (ASU), in collaboration with the University of Illinois
at Chicago (UIC), will carry out experimentally intensive, multi- disciplinary
research program on II-VI Compound Semiconductor-Based Light Emitting Devices.
The program will emphasize the growth and doping by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)
and subsequent characterization of a novel type of lattice-matched
heterostructure involving quaternary Zn1- xMnxSySe1-y confinement and cladding
layers and ZnSzSe1-z active layers. the new quaternary alloy, which has not
previously been grown, can be lattice matched to GaAs substrates over a wide
range of band gaps extending from the blue well into the ultra-violet. Favorable
band offsets are predicted for this system in both conduction and valence bands,
based on interpolation of existing data on Zn1-xMnxSe/ZnSe and ZnSySe1-y/ZnSe
heterostructures. True blue and violet lasers and heterostructure LED's based on
defects that plague existing ZnSySe1-y/ZnSe/Zn1-xCdxSe II-VI laser structures.
Ohmic contact layers based on Hg compounds will also be investigated to attempt
to solve the currently critical problem of contacting p- type material.
