The investigator applies tools from group representation theory to study
deformations of representations of profinite groups and of complexes of modules
for such groups. The investigator's main theme is to examine problems and
applications related to generalizations of the deformation theory of group
representations developed by B. Mazur. The generalizations are extensions of
this theory to (1) deformations of objects in derived categories, and (2)
deformations of representations whose images lie in various linear algebraic
groups, such as orthogonal groups. The investigator studies applications of
these theories to certain embedding problems. The second theme is to determine
for finite groups the ring structure of the universal deformation ring of an
irreducible modular representation, using only the local structure of the finite
group. The investigator also works on one other project which concerns moduli
spaces of representations of finite dimensional algebras. The goal is to use the
rich algebro-geometric structure of moduli spaces to obtain a better
understanding of the geometric behavior of algebra automorphisms.

Groups are abstract mathematical objects by which one may encode and study
symmetry, for example in chemical molecules, crystals, networks, or abstract
mathematical structures. Representations of groups provide a way to extract
information about the internal structures of a group. Roughly speaking,
representations can be thought of as "linearized snapshots" of the group which
are given by explicitly described matrices. In this project, the investigator
studies deformations of representations. The deformations of a given
representation form a family of representations which are associated to this
representation in a certain way. In case there is a single deformation which can
be used to describe all deformations, one talks about a universal deformation.
Universal deformations provide universal constructions which can be used to
solve certain problems all at once, which otherwise would have to be solved in a
case-by-case fashion. It is the goal of this project to study certain
generalizations of deformations of representations which in turn should lead to
more powerful applications in different areas.
