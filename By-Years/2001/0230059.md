Most Rodinia plate reconstructions propose juxtaposition of the western Amazon
craton with some segment of the 3000 km long Grenville margin of Laurentia. This
connection is based on linking similarly aged (ca. 1.2-0.95 Ga) mobile belts
across ancient continental margins. However, poor understanding of the
metamorphic and structural history of the western Amazon block has prevented a
test of these Laurentia-Amazonia configurations. This proposal requests funding
for exploratory work in recently exposed field areas to document the
deformational history of the western Amazon craton using structural mapping,
metamorphic petrology and geochronology. Preliminary mapping and sample
collecting of two&lt;br/&gt;key regions in the western Brazilian state of
Rondonia, located on the margin of the Amazon craton, will be undertaken in
collaboration with the Brazilian Geological Service (CPRM). The laboratory
portion of this project will focus on pressure and temperature (P-T) conditions
and geochronology (using 40Ar/39Ar and U/Pb systems) for the timing of peak
metamorphism and deformation. These data will test the feasibility of a larger
project in the area toward a firm understanding of Laurentia-Amazonia
interactions in late&lt;br/&gt;Proterozoic times.
