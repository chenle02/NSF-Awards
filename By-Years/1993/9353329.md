Among the concerns of the American Association for the Advancement of Science
(AAAS) for undergraduate science and mathematics education are the large
attrition of students from introductory to the intermediate courses and
concomitant declining numbers of majors, lack of attractive offerings for non-
science majors, poor science and mathematics preparation for prospective pre-
college teachers, and inability to recruit and retain women and minority
students. Other organizations, including the NSF, also have concerns and issues
that they would like to bring to the attention of appropriate university faculty
and administrators for action and/or comment. There is, at present, no single
effective and efficient access point for presenting these to the higher
education community , nor, more seriously, for coordinating and exchanging
information among the science and mathematics departments at different
institutions. This is a missing piece of the science and mathematics
teaching/learning infrastructure. The AAAS proposes here a mechanism, a Science
Deans Colloquium, for addressing the problem of access to the science and
mathematics communities in large research universities with the long-term goal
of improving undergraduate science and mathematics education through continued
interaction among the Deans. ***
