Many problems in number theory (for instance, understanding the number and
geometry of integer solutions to polynomial equations) can be approached by
studying dynamics of certain flows on symmetric spaces. On the other hand,
classical tools from analytic number theory can be adapted and used to better
understand the geometry and dynamics of these spaces. This project investigates
a number of problems where spectral theory and tools from analytic number theory
are used to study geometry and dynamics of certain group actions on hyperbolic
manifolds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynamics on hyperbolic manifolds come up in
many areas of mathematics: In number theory they are central in the theory of
automorphic forms; in low dimensional topology they are instrumental in the
proof of the geometrization theorem; in dynamics the geodesic flow on hyperbolic
manifolds is a classic example of hyperbolic (Anosov) dynamical systems; in
mathematical physics the spectrum of hyperbolic manifolds can be viewed as an
example of quantized chaotic systems. This project investigates a number of
problems where spectral theory and tools from analytic number theory are used to
study geometry and dynamics of certain group actions on hyperbolic manifolds,
with and without arithmetic structure. Specifically, the research studies
questions regarding the length spectrum of closed geodesics to understand how
much of the geometry of a hyperbolic manifold can be obtained from information
on the lengths of its closed geodesics; questions on the rate of escape to
infinity of one parameter flows on hyperbolic spaces (originating from problems
in Diophantine approximations); and questions on the strong spectral gap
property on locally symmetric spaces, which is crucial to many applications to
hyperbolic dynamics and number theory.
