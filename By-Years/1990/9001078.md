This study will address two substantive questions about a mathematical model
relating affect and identity in affect- control theory. First, the dissertation
student will test hypotheses derived from affect-control theory. Second, she
will extend the affect-control theory model by examining the implications of her
study for interaction potential, or the probability that two people will choose
to interact. The project will consist of two experiments using data collected
from undergraduate volunteers.
