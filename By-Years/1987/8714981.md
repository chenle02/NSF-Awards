Strong correlations exist between secondary mechanical relaxations in glassy
polymers and their mechanical properties. Previous dynamic mechanical studies
have not yielded precise information on the nature and origin of the mechanical
relaxations. Advanced NMR techniques have provided detailed information on
certain molecular motions, but these motions are not necessarily representative
of those detected by DMS. Molecular motions most directly relatable to
mechanical deformations are likely to be highly cooperative. Cooperative
molecular motions in copolymers of polycarbonates will be studed by
systematically varying sequences of mobile and less mobile repeat units. The in-
chain correlation distance will be determined using dynamic-mechanical
measurements. By measuring dynamic bulk relaxation, one can assess the extent of
intermolecular interaction associated with these cooperative motions. By
measuring the yield stress and post yield cold drawing dependence on temperature
and strain rate, one can establish correlations between molecular architecture,
molecular cooperativity, and mechanical properties. This research could
ultimately lead to polymers with improved mechanical properties by relating
those propertes with the structure of the polymers and their molecular motions.
