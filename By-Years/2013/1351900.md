Growing renewable generation capacity is leading to unprecedented variability
and uncertainty in power system operations, and calls for more flexibility
through balancing capacity, market products, and operating procedures. This
effort seeks to develop a comprehensive framework and supporting theory to
increase power system flexibility by developing the next generation of modeling
and control strategies for electricity loads and storage. The major anticipated
innovations are (1) new classes of models to characterize renewable generation
and electricity demand at unprecedented spatial and temporal scales, (2) new
tools to mathematically aggregate electricity loads and storage, (3) control
formulations for load and storage that can be executed in real time and used for
planning purposes and (4) pricing mechanisms that recognize the unique
capabilities of controllable loads and storage and support payments that are
equitable with conventional generators.

The effort also aims to broaden awareness of tools to transform power system
operations by engaging high school, vocational and university students via
problem based learning and interdisciplinary curricula. The outreach efforts
will directly address underrepresentation of ethnic groups and women in science
and engineering via mentoring and introducing students to emerging energy
systems concepts. The major intended outcomes of the proposed research are (1)
to reduce transmission capacity needs, (2) to eliminate the need to build
dispatchable generation capacity to manage variability and uncertainty from
renewable sources and (3) to improve the efficiency of the supply side by
reducing the need for combustion-based generation to operate at part load to
provide reserves.
