Braeside Observatory has monitored a variety of variable stars for the past
thirteen years. The instrumentation at the observatory will be upgraded through
the addition of a CCD camera. This will allow observations of fainter stars and
will allow observations even when weather conditions are mediocre. In the
immediate future emphasis will be placed on monitoring nova-like variables and
dwarf novae. A number of high school students will be involved in this project.
