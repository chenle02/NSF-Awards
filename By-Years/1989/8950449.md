Lebanon Valley College has acquired a FT-NMR and the accompanying computer-
based data station. The chemistry department uses the instrument to introduce
FT-NMR spectroscopy into the laboratory at a number of levels. Specific course
improvements include: introduction of topics and uses of FT-NMR spectrometry
into the organic chemistry laboratories; demonstration of the principles of
operation of a FT-NMR spectrometer and its analytical applications in the
instrumental analysis laboratory; use of FT-NMR in physical chemistry laboratory
to reveal relaxation times and rates of chemical reactions; and the use of NMR
spectroscopy in independent study and in summer research programs. The equipment
is integrated into our annual summer chemistry program attended by 30-40
advanced high school students. The institution is matching the NSF grant with an
equal amount of funds.
