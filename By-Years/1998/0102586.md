Support is provided for the 45th, 46th and 47th annual meetings of the Wind
River Conference on Prokaryotic Biology, held at the Aspen Lodge, Estes Park,
Colorado. The meetings are held annually each summer. This conference is
primarily concerned with the biology of prokaryotes, and is the major annually
occurring meeting devoted to this subject area. One significant feature of these
meetings is their accessibility to graduate students and post-doctoral students,
whose travel funds frequently are limited. Specifically to address this problem,
funds are provided for travel and support scholarships to facilitate the
attendance of graduate students and post-doctoral students working in various
areas that comprise prokaryotic biology.
