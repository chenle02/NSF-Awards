D.M. Scott (DuPont) and P.K. Agarwal (U. of Wyoming) Partial travel support
will be provided to a group of ten U.S. academic researchers to attend and
present papers at the conference "Frontiers in Industrial Process Tomography" to
be held April 9-12 in Delft (NL). Process tomography is an emerging field of
research because of the new experimental and computational techniques made
available in recent years, and its potential use for on-line process control and
in non-invasive laboratory experiments. The topic has received a special
attention in the European Community funding, and as a result there are
outstanding advances in the field at several European universities including the
Delft University. The conference will address modeling, measurements and
applications of multiphase and particulate flows. The topic is highly
interdisciplinary, and efforts have been made to bring the best qualified
scientists and engineers at the meeting, including academic and industry
researchers from Europe, North America and Asia. The focus of the conference is
on critical future developments needed to apply tomography technology to process
engineering. The meeting is held in conjunction with the "Control of Particulate
Processes" conference at the same location.
