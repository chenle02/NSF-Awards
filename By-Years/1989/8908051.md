This project provides resources to procure equipment to support research
associated with the analysis of mechanisms. The equipment is a real time color
graphics workstation and comprises a Silicon Graphics Personal Superworkstation,
a tape drive and a software development package. It supports four research
projects including 1) development of an expert system for mechanism design, 2)
computer aided dynamic analysis, design and performance evaluation of
geometrically complex mechanisms, 3) evaluation of robotic manipulators with
direct sensor feedback, and 4) development of a combined machine learning-
experimental approach for the evaluation of automated robotic mechanical
assembly.
