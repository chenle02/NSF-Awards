This action funds the participation of up to 70 NSF Minority Postdoctoral
Fellows in the annual national Institute for Teaching and Mentoring sponsored by
the Compact for Faculty Diversity (a partnership between the New England Board
of Higher Education, the Southern Regional Education Board, and the Western
Interstate Commission for Higher Education). The Compact for Faculty Diversity
(CFD) addresses the serious and chronic problem of the under-representation of
minority faculty in institutions of higher learning. CFD has a proven track
record of increasing the number of minorities earning the doctorate and entering
faculty positions. The Institute for Teaching and Mentoring provides an
opportunity for NSF Minority Fellows to attend a highly successful forum for
learning about teaching and research as a career, networking, sharing
information, career positioning, and identifying role models and mentors.
