Alur&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EMSOFT 2003 Workshop - the Third International
Workshop on Embedded Software, is held October 13-15, 2003 in Philadelphia on
the campus of the University of Pennsylvania. The proceedings of EMSOFT 2003 are
published as a volume in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series by
Springer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of EMSOFT 2003 is to bring together
researchers, developers, and students from academia, industry, and governments
so that the science of embedded software and the technology of their
applications an be advanced. The purview of the workshop spans all areas of
embedded software, including system design and integration methodologies,
scheduling and execution time analysis, models of computation and formal
methods, communication protocols, and fault tolerance. Currently, academic
papers on embedded software are dispersed at many different conferences, and
EMSOFT offers a unique venue with the central focus on principles of embedded
software.&lt;br/&gt;
