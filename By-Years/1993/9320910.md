9320910 Franck Technical abstract: The equilibrium and dynamic properties of
liquid mixtures, especially near boundaries will be investigated using
ellipsometric techniques. A key feature of the experiments is the achievemenr of
a very high temperature stability and very low thermal gradients. Studies
include the following: uncovering new surface critical phenomena through
chemical tuning, determining the effect of weak thermal convection on the
delicate liquid structure necessary to achieve gravity thinned wetting in
equilibrium, investigate potential of non equilibrium methods to when limited by
long equilibration times in polymer solution studies, and search for correlated
motion statistically in the dynamics of colloidal particles subject to intense
thermal noise and slight long range intermolecular forces. Non-technical
abstract: We have recently discovered details about how fluctuations in a
thermal system behave near a boundary. Up to now the effect of the boundary has
always been so great in microscopic observations that increasing its influence
would not lead to any new information. The situation is like listening to a
radio that is so loud that one can make out the rhythm of a song but not the
words. A potential solution is to reduce the strength of the boundary through
chemical means. Reflected light is used to detect changes at the surface. With
accurate temperature control the sensitivity of amplifying the effect of thermal
fluctuations is equal to the experimental precision of a few parts in a million.
