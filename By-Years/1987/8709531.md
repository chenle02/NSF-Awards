This is an indepth study of the atomic geometry and electronic structure of
several low and high index gallium arsenide surfaces prepared by molecular beam
epitaxy (MBE). The use of MBE-grown surfaces with in-situ probing of structure,
composition, and band bending will enhance the work on surface reconstruction
mechanisms and surface unstabilities, encountered with some high- index
surfaces. The investigation of Schottky barriers formation at low temperature
(LT=70-100oK) will be continued. The results obtained on these interfaces where
metal clustering, chemical reactions and interdiffusion are inhibited, are the
first to suggest that several independent mechanisms, diversly affected by the
temperature must be invoked to explain pinning on n- and p- type samples. This
work will be extended by studying interfaces formed at low temperature between
gallium arsenide and reactive transition metals. This study will involve
complete characterizations of low temperature interface morphology, atomic
geometry, rate of reaction, and Fermi level pinning. A generalization of the
results found during the past three years could be expected to have a
substantial impact on current models of Schottky barriers and be of importance
to the microelectronic industry.
