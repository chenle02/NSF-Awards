Torquato&lt;br/&gt;0804431&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator and his
colleagues study a variety of&lt;br/&gt;packing problems. The following five
general areas are explored:&lt;br/&gt;(1) identification and characterization of
dense packings of&lt;br/&gt;nonspherical particles for a wide class shapes in
two and three&lt;br/&gt;space dimensions; (2) study of sphere packings of
maximal density&lt;br/&gt;in high Euclidean dimensions; (3) identification of
low-density&lt;br/&gt;jammed sphere packings in various dimensions; (4) studies
of&lt;br/&gt;jamming on the unit sphere in arbitrary dimensions; and
(5)&lt;br/&gt;pursuit of improved order metrics to characterize the degree
of&lt;br/&gt;randomness in a packing. Important scientific advances
and&lt;br/&gt;outcomes are likely to emerge from the proposed research.
This&lt;br/&gt;very multidisciplinary project joins the applied
mathematics,&lt;br/&gt;statistical and condensed-matter physics, materials
science,&lt;br/&gt;engineering, and pure mathematics communities. Unifying
these&lt;br/&gt;different perspectives and goals is a challenging task, but
one&lt;br/&gt;that offers great rewards to the scientific community in general.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Packing problems, such as how densely solid objects
fill&lt;br/&gt;space, have fascinated people since the dawn of civilization,
and&lt;br/&gt;continue to intrigue scientists because of their connection to
a&lt;br/&gt;host of problems that arise in the physical
sciences,&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, engineering, and biology. While optimal
packing&lt;br/&gt;problems are intimately related to solid states of
condensed&lt;br/&gt;matter, disordered sphere packings have been employed to
model&lt;br/&gt;the glassy state of matter. Sphere packings in high
dimensions&lt;br/&gt;have relevance in communications theory. The way that
viruses&lt;br/&gt;package DNA in protein containers is a packing problem. What
are&lt;br/&gt;the densest packings of spheres in dimension greater than three?
&lt;br/&gt;What are the densest packings of nonspherical objects in two
and&lt;br/&gt;three dimensions? Can random packings ever fill space
more&lt;br/&gt;densely than ordered packings (implying disordered or
"glassy"&lt;br/&gt;ground states)? Can "randomness" of a packing be quantified
in a&lt;br/&gt;meaningful and precise manner? A greater understanding
of&lt;br/&gt;packing problems has implications for the synthesis of
novel&lt;br/&gt;materials, our ability to efficiently design
communications&lt;br/&gt;channels to send digital signals over large distances,
and the&lt;br/&gt;design of new drugs, just to mention a few examples.
