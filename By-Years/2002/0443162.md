This research is intended to result in a novel approach to concept learning. The
basic premise of this project is that intelligent systems ought to be able to
learn concepts autonomously through a combination of learning methods (e.g.,
boosting, statistical analyis and reinforcement learning) without requiring
extensive hand-engineering (e.g., knowledge representation, concept taxonomies).
The hypothesis to be explored in this project is that concept formation and
related tasks such as classification can be accomplished by computationally
exploitating underlying domain structure using methods that encourage parsimony
and compactness of system modules that correspond to concepts. The long term
goals for this line of research include better understanding of the nature of
systems that underlie and embody symbols and the discovery and demonstration of
methods that enable such systems to be created through a combination of
programming and autonomous learning. Nearer term project goals include exploring
how to harness what we know about learning in both machines and humans,
understanding the role of experience vs. "innate" structures, and better
understanding the role of credit assignment, focus of attention, and evolution
in such systems. This project will explore these research questions in two
particular contexts: concept learning in vision, particularly in the domain of
interstate highway traffic viewed by remote cameras, and concept learning in
planning, particularly in the domain of Sokoban problems.
