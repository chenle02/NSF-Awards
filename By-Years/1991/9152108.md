Southwestern College (SWC) is a primarily minority, public community college.
Through this grant the college is acquiring computer-automated laboratory
instrumentation that provides dynamic, modern laboratory experiences. Existing
physics lab equipment dates from the 1960's did not reflect the changed
technology SWC students encounter in four-year transfer institutions and in the
work place.The proposed equipment allows students to replace current lengthy
manual data acquisition with automated instrumentation techniques, leaving time
in the laboratory to explore the physical principles that incorporate the
measurements. This is a major shift in emphasis from the prior tedious, time-
consuming measurement and manual computation too often associated with physics.
The shift enables students to discover the excitement and joy of scientific
inquiry and thought, helping to develop critical thinking skills.This project is
part of the Physics Department Five-Year Plan, developed to achieve excellence
within the Physics Department and thus increase the number of minority students
who enter professional fields within science and engineering. Equipment acquired
includes IBM Computers and Interface Component Kits, Linear Motion
Instrumentation, and Rotational Motion Instrumentation--all items making a
complete package. The equipment has direct impact on six of eleven core
experiments conducted in undergraduate physics courses by 450 students per
year.NSF grant funds are being matched with funds from non-federal sources.
