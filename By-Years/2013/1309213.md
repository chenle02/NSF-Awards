The investigator proposes two different approaches to address a broad variety of
parametric and nonparametric inference problems under unknown nonstationarity
and dependence. The first approach explores several self-normalization based
methods to avoid the estimation of complicated limiting variance function. The
proposed methodology can be used to address various nonparametric inference
problems, such as nonparametric mean regression, quantile regression, and
nonparametric inference for locally stationary processes. The second approach
proposes a random perturbation based framework for robust inferences. The idea
is to suppress the unknown nonstationarity and dependence at the cost of
inflated noise level. The proposed random perturbation method is robust against
unknown nonstationarity and dependence, and it is generally applicable for
univariate and multivariate parameter inferences, conditional mean regression
inference, nonparametric inference, change-point analysis, and nonlinear
regression.

Many practical data exhibit complicated time-varying pattern and dependence.
Without taking into account such unknown nonstationarity and serial dependence,
existing statistical methods developed for independent data or stationary data
may not work well or even fail. The proposal aims to develop cutting-edge
statistical inference techniques and theories for a broad variety of parametric
and nonparametric problems under unknown nonstationarity and dependence. The
results from this project can be widely applied to data from climatic, economic,
financial, and longitudinal studies. The project will integrate research and
education through involvement of both undergraduate and graduate students. The
investigator will disseminate research results through teaching, publications,
and seminar presentations.
