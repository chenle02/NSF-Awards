Dr. Peter Wolczanski, Chemistry Department, Cornell University, is supported by
the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division for research into small molecule activation by transition
metals. The reaction pathways of d2 transition metals can be orbitally defined
as symmetric or antisymmetric, and their spin states can be assessed as singlet
or triplet. Using these principles, the reactivity patterns of three coordinate
group 5 and 6 molecules will be studied with respect to the influence of various
electronic states. High level quantum calculations will be employed to interpret
the chemical reactivity and to uncover underlying principles that can be used to
predict their reactivity toward small molecules. In addition, aggregates based
on [YMX]n will be studied in terms of their magnetic properties, and their
reactivity. When Y = tBu3SiS and X = halide, the steric asymmetry of the unit is
manifested in the formation of 12-membered wheels, where the magnetic coupling
between metal centers is antiferromagnetic. Finally, sterically bulky alkynes of
the type R2R'SiCCSiR2R' will be applied as ancillary ligands in systems aimed at
olefin catalysis, including polymerizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
will develop new understanding of the underlying factors that determine the
chemical reactivity of important classes of molecules. In addition systems will
be prepared that are of importance in nanomagnetics with possible applications
as nanocomputing materials. Catalysts for important industrial processes will be
sought. The educational objective of this project includes the education of
independent, versatile PhDs, postdoctoral associates and
undergraduates.&lt;br/&gt;
