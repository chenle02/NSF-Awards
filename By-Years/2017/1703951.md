The Chemical Engineering Division of the American Society for Engineering
Education (ASEE) will hold its 16th Chemical Engineering Summer School from July
29-August 3, 2017 at North Carolina State University. The Summer School has been
the premier faculty development workshop for new chemical engineering faculty
since 1931. In order to provide maximum benefit to the faculty, this workshop is
offered every five years. The Summer School is unique in its emphasis on the
development of new chemical engineering educators. By targeting faculty within
their first five years of their careers, professors can become more effective at
all facets of their job as educators and ultimately produce better prepared
undergraduate and graduate chemical engineering professionals.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the 2017 Chemical Engineering Summer School, new
faculty will learn best practices in effective teaching, including active
learning techniques. The instructors are leaders in chemical engineering
education. Furthermore, the participants will also learn about technical (such
as safety, sustainability, computational fluid dynamics, process modeling, and
emerging topics within the discipline) and non-technical topics (such as
communication skills, leadership, ethics, etc.) Historically, around 200
chemical engineering educators, many of whom are within the first five years of
their initial faculty appointment and others who are returning as instructors,
attend the Summer School. The new educators are able to form strong partnerships
with their peers who are in similar stages of their careers. In addition, they
meet and interact with senior chemical engineering faculty and receive critical
advice on career development matters. To foster interactions, the participating
faculty present a poster about their research and education activities at their
home institution.
