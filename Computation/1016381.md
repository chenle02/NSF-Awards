This research project will develop new numerical techniques for the
optimization/design and simulation of multi-phase/multi-fluid flow in
microfluidic devices. Novel techniques will be developed for modeling the effect
of surface tension and surfactants which will significantly reduce the
simulation time in comparison to state-of-the-art methods. Novel, non-
intrusive/derivative-free optimization techniques shall be developed for
controlling the creation of droplets and minimizing droplet re-coalescence.

"Lab on a chip" devices hold great promise for advancing research in proteomics
and diagnostics and drug discovery. One of the most frequently used microfluidic
operations is the separation of aqueous reagents into droplets. For example,
these droplets can be stored in a droplet trap array and then released/processed
at a later time. Another operation of microfluidic devices is the creation of
emulsions. A better understanding of how surfactants and microfluidic device
geometries affect droplet rupture and re-coalescence is fundamental in
understanding the emulsification process. Besides being an enabling technology
for the design of microfluidic lab-on-a-chip devices, numerical methods that aid
in the design process associated with multi-phase flow and/or surfactants have
applications in ship hull design, ink-jet devices, design of off-shore
structures, design of beach erosion prevention devices, and the design and
application of dispersants in order to break up oil emulsions (oil slicks) at
air/water interfaces.
