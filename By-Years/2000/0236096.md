Ectomycorrhizal (EM )spore banks are a fundamental,but poorly studied
component,of plant-fungal community ecology.EM spore banks can provide the
inoculum necessary for tree recruitment following severe disturbance and may
facilitate tree invasion into bordering non-forested areas.Rhizopogon species
are the most abundant component of spore banks in many western North American
pinaceous ecosystems,and in some forest-border settings they appear to be
virtually the entire spore bank.This proposal is focused on understanding the
spatial and temporal dynamics of Rhizopogon spore banks in the context of cyclic
fire and pine regeneration.A conceptual model for these interactions is
proposed,and five specific hypotheses related to the model are tested.These
hypotheses focus on differences in spore longevity and spore dispersal among
Rhizopogon species,and on differences in mode and frequency of dispersal within
mature-forests and post-fire forests.Measured parameters include:i)spatial
pattern of the spore shadow in forest border zones,ii)current dispersal rates
and modes into these zones,iii)spore longevity of three key Rhizopogon species
and iv)longevity of complex native spore banks.Hypotheses will be tested by
combining the techniques of bioassays,molecular ecology,large-scale spatial
sampling,and seed bank ecology.The work addresses a crucial,but essentially
unstudied,component of community ecology (i.e.,EM spore banks),and provides an
analogous system in which to test ideas developed for plant seed banks.The
broader impacts of this work are its direct relationship to forest regeneration
and expansion;the ability to predict the spatial and temporal extent of the EM
spore banks will provide forest managers with a rational way to assess the
likelihood of EM inoculum in highly disturbed systems.
