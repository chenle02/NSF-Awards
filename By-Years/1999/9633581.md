The focus of this research is the development of new chiral catalysts. Neutral
bis(oxazoline) bidentate and pyridine-bis(oxazoline) tridentate ligands will be
employed in conjunction with cationic copper(II), zinc(II), and aluminum(III)
salts for the generation of new families of chiral Lewis acids. These chiral
complexes will be investigated in the enantioselective catalysis of bimolecular
and intramolecular Diels-Alder reactions, Mukaiyama aldol reactions, cunjugate
addition reactions of unsaturated imides and alkylidene malonates and the
reduction of beta-ketoesters. Enantioselective olefin cyclopropanation, and
aziridination will also be explored as will approaches to the synthesis of new
chiral multi-dentate ligands bearing stereogenic P-chiral phosphorus and
S-chiral sulfur ligands where chirality at the metal-bound heteroatom is either
defined or induced from proximal stereogenic carbon centers. During the course
of the above studies, relevant target-oriented natural products syntheses will
be used to illustrate the generality of the reactions being developed. With this
renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr.
David A. Evans of the Department of Chemistry at Harvard University. Professor
Evans will focus his work on projects that center on the development of new
stereoselective organic reactions with an emphasis on absolute stereocontrol
through asymmetric catalysis. Development of this type of methodology has an
important impact on the fields of medicine, biology and materials science.
