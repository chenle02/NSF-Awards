Pinnipeds are an important group of marine mammals, comprising the walruses, sea
lions, and seals. Nevertheless, their evolutionary relationships to each other
and to other mammals remain unclear. Dr. Annalisa Berta is a vertebrate
paleontologist studying the anatomy of fossil and living pinnipeds for the
purpose of reconstructing their evolutionary history. Her research also
considers the functional capabilities of fossilized species, providing unique
insight into the evolution of behavior in the group, and its transformation from
terrestrial ancestors. Dr. Berta proposes to continue her investigations into
the evolutionary relationships among pinnipeds using morphological data from
fossils. The present project will focus on the phocids, a possible sister-group
to the walruses. Cranial and post-cranial material from the Oligocene- Miocene
of coastal Oregon will be examined, and locomotor capabilities (principally
forelimb versus hindlimb propulsion) estimated. This project represents a
logical extension of a previous award that supported study of the otarioid
pinnipeds (walruses, sea lions, but not seals). The proposed research has
implications for a wide scientific audience. Comparative anatomists and
vertebrate zoologists will welcome the new data derived from early Tertiary
fossils, along with new reconstructions of evolutionary relationships of major
mammalian groups. Functional morphologists will look to this study for critical
information on alternative adaptations to life in aquatic habitats. Evolutionary
biologists will integrate these findings with recent results based on DNA
sequence data, resulting in an unusually detailed understanding of this
noteworthy group.
