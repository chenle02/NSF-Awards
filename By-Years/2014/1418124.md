Scientific data increasingly takes the form of networks, but the ability to
collect and process graph data has out-paced our ability to analyze them
statistically. Most of the critical scientific questions about networks revolve
around comparisons between networks (e.g., over time or across experimental
conditions). Such problems arise in fields as different as neuroscience,
epidemiology, economics, climatology and criminology. Currently, network
analysts compare only basic descriptive statistics (e.g., the average distance
between nodes in the graph), ignoring issues of global structure and statistical
validity. We will develop a rigorous statistical theory of network comparisons.
Our approach rests on recent develops in network theory which show how large
graphs approximate continuous geometric objects, so that tools for geometric
comparisons can be applied to networks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our project will
develop rigorous statistical methods and efficient algorithms for network
comparisons. The first step is the flexible non-parametric estimation of
continuous network models, where we will pursue three complementary strategies,
using regression smoothing, density estimation in non-Euclidean latent spaces,
and ensembles of trees. Having represented networks as continuous stochastic
processes, we will develop statistical theory and methods for detecting and
characterizing differences between such processes. Interdisciplinary proof-of-
concept applications, including those in public health (through online social
networks), finance (through financial networks), neuroscience (through brain
connectivity networks), genetics (through gene regulatory networks), and
proteinomics (through protein interaction networks), will demonstrate the power
of the geometric approach in comparing large and disparate sample data.
