Proposal Title: SENSORS: Autonomous Analyzers for Toxic Metals in the Marine
Environment

Project Summary The PIs propose to design and field-test in situ autonomous
sensors for three marine pollutants: copper, zinc and cadmium. Objectives for
the sensors include the ability to accurately measure concentrations in the
range of 0.5-250 nM with a precision of at least 6%. These proposed sensors will
be based on the well-tested DigiSCAN technology developed in the Chemical
Sensors lab at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) and
currently being commercialized by YSI. This is a versatile, compact sensor
system for in situ wet chemistry that uses micro solenoid pumps for sample
uptake and reagent dispensing. To date, DigiSCAN has been configured for
colorimetric detection of nitrate and phosphate. The work outlined in this
proposal aims to adapt this instrumentation to utilize published
chemiluminescent (Cu) and fluorometric (Zn and Cd) detection methods for copper,
zinc and cadmium. Specifically, this will: (1) construct chemiluminescent (PMT)
and fluorometric detectors for DigiSCAN, (2) adapt published flow injection
analysis methods for Cu, Zn and Cd analysis to the DigiSCAN hardware, and (3)
deploy the instrument in anthropogenically impacted and relatively pristine
coastal environments. This development will also enable the analysis of other
metals such as iron and cobalt (chemiluminescence) as well as other analytes of
interest such as ammonia and aluminum (fluorescence).
