9709308 Taylor The collections presently housed by the Paleontological Research
Institution (PRI) contain more than two and a half million specimens; they are
among the largest and scientifically most important invertebrate paleontology
collections in the United States. These collections, however, had been allowed
to deteriorate and had been essentially inaccessible to the research and
educational communities for many years. In 1992, a major reorganization and
renovation effort was begun that continued after 1994 with NSF support. The
chief results of this effort to date have been the resuscitation of the PRI
collection and the transfer to PRI of the invertebrate fossil and Recent mollusk
collections of Cornell University (CU). Condition of and accessibility to these
collections has now significandy improved and use accordingly has greafiy
increased. This award will support the next phase of this process of renewal.
Two-thirds of the CU collection is stored in temporary trailers in the back yard
of the Institution; these will be rehoused in new, permanent storage facilities
in order to make them useful once again to the scientific community. PRI's type
and figured collection and the microfossil collection will also be rehoused and
curated in preparation for computerization. During the spring of 1997, the
Institution will be constructing approximately 4,000 square feet of new
collections space as cost-sharing with the NSF on this project.
