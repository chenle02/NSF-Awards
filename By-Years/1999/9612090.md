This grant is to purchase a physical acoustic high-frequency data acquisition
and signal process system for the investigation of in-process abrasive damage
assessment techniques using acoustic emission. The equipment will enable the
research conducted by the Abrasive Micro-Machining Center at Kansas State
University to obtain acoustic emission data well beyond the audible range,
thereby facilitating efforts to analyze the full range of data generated by the
acoustic emission signals. The system will be used to investigate innovative
methodologies for identifying the acoustic emission signatures associated with
workpiece subsurface damage in conventional and non-conventional abrasive
process of ceramics and steels and to develop acoustic emission methods for in-
process damage assessment and control. The acoustic emission data acquisition
and signal process system substantially enhances the research capability of the
Abrasive Micro-Machining Center at Kansas State University for understanding
subsurface damage in conventional and non-conventional abrasive process of
ceramics and steels. It is also valuable to the development of acoustic emission
methods for in-process damage assessment and control.
