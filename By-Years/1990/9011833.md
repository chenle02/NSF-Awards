The PI proposes to unify and distribute enhancements of the seismic processing
package SIOSEIS. Marine geologists and geophysicists from eleven universitites
actively use SEIOSEIS as a tool in the analysis of diverse geologic porblems
even though they use different computer and plotter manufacturers.The variety of
data types and analysis techniques has led to several groups making separate
enhancements that they are willing to share with all SIOSEIS users. This award
will integrate many of these enhancements and make them available to the entire
community.
