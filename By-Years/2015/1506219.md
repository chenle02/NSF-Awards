Non-Technical: This award by the Biomaterials Program in the Division of
Materials Research to Colorado State University is to design new materials by
encoding the assembly of building block proteins. This award is cofunded by US
Army Natick Soldier Research, Development &amp; Engineering Center. The intended
crystalline biomaterials are so precisely organized that they will diffract
X-rays, allowing high-resolution determination of the molecular structure
details. While there are many possible applications for such materials, this
proposal focuses on (1) determining the extent to which the position of
constituent building blocks can be programmed, and (2) assessing applications
for the protein crystal pore network. Specifically, the project will produce and
characterize close-packed hexagonal arrays of nanowires that may form useful
ultra-high surface area materials for catalysis or battery applications. Porous
protein crystals may also offer advantages as multifunctional delivery
materials, combining high capacity with the possibility of extensive
nanostructure control. The project provides educational opportunities from high
school and the University due to integration with AP Chemistry and Biomolecular
Engineering courses, as well as broad dissemination via an open-source software
platform (SHARPEN) for protein modeling and
design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical: The proposed research will study
proteins as building blocks to assemble crystalline materials in which it is
possible to exert sub-nanometer control over the location of constituent
domains. This research will also exploit the highly anisotropic pore structure
of existing protein crystals in pursuit of nanostructured material applications.
The project will produce and characterize close-packed hexagonal arrays of
nanowires via synthesis of conductive polymers or the capture of carbon
nanotubes within a parallel array of nanopores. Additionally, the research will
determine the suitability of porous crystals to serve as depots for the
controlled release of antimicrobial peptides under challenging operational
conditions. Specifically, the project will assess the extent to which protein
crystals with very different pore sizes adsorb antimicrobial peptides,
conditionally gate guest peptide release, and withstand demanding conditions
including denaturants, heat, freeze-thaw cycles, and desiccation. This proposal
also includes a software engineering effort to improve accessibility of the
SHARPEN platform, further extending the impact of protein design methodology
improvements. Research training will encompass cutting-edge areas of
bionanotechnology, molecular modeling, and nanostructure imaging.
