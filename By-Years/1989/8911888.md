This research is concerned with the dynamics of reacting shock waves and
continuum dynamics of phase transitions. In the first area, the principal
investigator will study the nonlinear development of low frequency instabilities
of multidimensional detonations. For one-dimensional geometry, the details of
transition to detonation will be studied numerically. Simultaneously, the
rigorous analysis of one-dimensional pulsating detonations will be performed. In
the area of shock induced phase transitions, a mathematical theory for
liquefaction shocks will be developed. This theory is expected to be analogous
to the ZND theory of detonations. The principal investigator will study the
experimentally observed phenomena of wave splitting and the low frequency
instabilities of liquefaction shock fronts. A combination of asymptotic methods,
numerical computations, and rigorous analysis will be used to achieve the goals
of this project.
