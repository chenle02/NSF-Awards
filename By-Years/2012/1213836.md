This award in the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) program of the Chemistry Division
supports work by Professor David Goldberg of the Department of Chemistry of
Johns Hopkins University to develop the synthesis and reactivity of a class of
porphyrinoid compounds known as corrolazines and corroles. These molecules are
designed to stabilize high-valent transition metals, including high-valent
metal-oxo species. The porphyrinoid ligands to be employed will provide access
to these species, allowing for their reactivity to be assessed directly in
biologically relevant and synthetically important processes such as hydrogen-
atom transfer and C-H bond cleavage. The anticipated findings should yield new
mechanistic information of relevance to both heme and nonheme enzymes, and may
provide insights into why Nature selects iron or manganese for a particular
function. The structure/function correlations to be obtained should also aid in
the design and development of synthetic porphyrinoid-based oxidation catalysts.

The research described in this proposal will provide new knowledge regarding key
intermediates proposed for a range of metalloenzymes and synthetic metal-based
catalysts. The knowledge obtained will advance our understanding of catalytic
processes in biology, and may translate into the development of new,
environmentally compatible, bio-inspired catalysts that can be used in oxidative
transformations of industrial importance. Undergraduate and graduate students
will receive training in chemical synthesis and mechanism, and more broadly in
the methods of experimental science. The research program also includes active
collaborations with scientists at several U.S. and international institutions.
These interactions will provide expanded training opportunities for students
participating in the research. Outreach programs aimed at broadening the
participation of underrepresented groups in the physical sciences are planned at
the high school and university level.
