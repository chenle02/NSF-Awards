The purpose of this project is to organize and host the 2023 National Science
Foundation Principal Investigators (PI) Meeting for the Computer System Research
(CSR) Program. The event will bring together investigators holding active
awards, along with representatives from government, community organizations, and
federal agencies. The meeting will serve as an important platform for
collectively reviewing CSR progress and developments, identifying cutting-edge
research opportunities, and fostering discussions on technological gaps and
barriers. Led by the community, the program agenda features engaging
presentations from PIs, comprehensive reports on program activities, and a
showcase of the latest CSR advancements and innovations. The intellectual merit
of the meeting lies in its comprehensive exploration of vital scientific issues
and technological challenges within Computer System Research.

The PI Meeting is an important opportunity for CSR PIs to convene, fostering the
sharing of research, discussions on new opportunities and challenges, and
exploration of fresh ideas and partnerships for future endeavors. The meeting
will also provide a platform for academic researchers to interact with
government agencies with a shared interest in Computer System Research. It will
play an important role in fostering knowledge exchange within the CSR community,
promoting growth across diverse sectors and technologies, and engaging potential
future proposers, transition partners, and sponsors. The 2023 PI meeting will
comprise presentations from researchers, poster sessions, special topic
discussions, and captivating demonstrations and keynotes from esteemed leaders
in both the research community and the government.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
