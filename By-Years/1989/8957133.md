This grant is for the initial year of a Presidential Young Investigator Award.
This award will enable the investigator to continue his research in earthquake
hazard mitigation, especially as it involves structural collapse and search and
rescue. Working with an interdisciplinary team which includes an architect,
emergency medical physician, and an injury epidemiologist, the investigator will
provide the earthquake engineering expertise as the team pursues such areas of
research as damage assessment and prediction, collapse mechanisms and
stabilization technology, search technology, and extraction technology.
