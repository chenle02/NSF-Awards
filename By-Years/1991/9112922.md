Colucci proposes to study the accuracy of extended (30-day) forecasts by a
numerical model, and to identify those dynamical characteristics of initial and
evolving states that distiguish between periods in which the model exhibits low
skill, from those with high skill, and those in which forecast skill changes
drasti- cally with minor variations in the initially defined state. The
technique to be used is "case compositing", in which the climato- logical record
is subdivided according to some objective measure of the relevant property (in
this case, forecast skill) and composite patterns are constructed for each of
the subcategories. Success is shown by finding physically meaningful and
interpretable differ- ences between the composites, which may then be used to
identify specific model deficiencies. It is highly dependent on the meteor-
ological and climatological insights of the practitioner. Colucci's past
accomplishments under prior NSF support show that he is well qualified in this
respect. The study will contribute to one object- ive of the US Global Change
Research Program, viz., an operational numerical forecast model for seasonal
climate to be implemented during the 1996-2000 period. Such a model will serve
as a stepping stone to subsequent models predicting multi-annual climate changes
(induced by natural and/or man-made causes) with sufficient credi- bility to
serve as useful guides in the framing of resource- management policy within the
private, national, and international sectors.
