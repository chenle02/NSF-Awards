CBET-1127689&lt;br/&gt;PI: Kandilkar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is to
host a conference on Microscale and Nanoscale transport in Edmonton, Canada. The
budget is to support the travel of keynote speakers, new faculty, post docs and
graduate students. Microscale and Nanoscale transport represent areas that are
expected to transform in a fundamental way many applications for which the
current solutions are either non-existent or are too expensive. Examples include
electronic cooling, micro reactors, heat exchangers etc.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planned conference provides a unique forum for
interdisciplinary researchers to exchange ideas and come up with novel
techniques. The previous meetings have resulted in a number of NSF supported
research themes, and have developed a large number of young researchers to
participate in this exciting new technology frontier. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
NSF grant will support bringing a number of prominent as well as emerging
researchers to this conference, and will provide exciting new ideas that are
expected to culminate into further advancements in this field.
