The oxidation of water to molecular oxygen is a characteristic reaction
associated with photosynthesis in higher plants. Light quanta producing
excitation of the photosystem result in the transfer of electrons one at a time
until four electrons are removed from two water molecules to produce oxygen. The
chemical intermediates involved in transferring electrons at high reduction
potentials and in storing the oxiding equivalents needed to yield oxygen are
being investigated. Manganese is involved in the water-splitting enzyme, and
X-ray spectroscopy at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory is being
used to determine the oxidation state, ligation and local structure around the
Mn. Together with studies using EPR spectroscopy, results have verified the
direct participation of Mn oxidation state changes in the water-splitting
process. This proposal aims to characterize the nature of the manganese binding
site, first by identifying the proteins involved and then in determining the
specific amino acids involved in providing ligands to the manganese., In the
near future it is hoped to characterize the molecular species involved, through
the use of electron-nuclear and electron-electron double resonance, and X-ray
spectroscopy as well the nature of the way in which water becomes incorporated
into the water-splitting enzyme prior to the final formation and release of
oxygen. Knowledge of this process will be most useful in developing artificial
systems whereby solar energy can be used to convert water into molecular oxygen
and hydrogen fuel.***
