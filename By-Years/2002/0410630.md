Biological Science (61) The goal of this project is to implement a new
laboratory experience that will enhance the ability of students to excel in
upper-level courses that incorporate research-based laboratories, as well as to
enable them to participate in faculty-mentored research earlier in their
careers. To accomplish these goals the PI team is redesigning the laboratory
portion of Cell Biology, a lecture and laboratory-based course that is the first
class for biology majors. The new course is strengthening student skills in
instrumentation and scientific investigation because all laboratory exercises
include an analytical and investigative component. The lab is also improving the
ability of students to maintain laboratory notebooks and to write by
incorporating writing experiences in all laboratory exercises. Finally the
course provides students with enhanced pre-laboratory training and continued
access to web-based laboratory manuals and training modules that can be used
both by students in the course and as refreshers by upper-class students
throughout their careers. Technology is being used for both the delivery of the
materials and by integrating equipment, data analysis, and writing into the cell
biology environment.
