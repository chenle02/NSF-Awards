Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0405281&lt;br/&gt;Principal
Investigator: Haydee Herrera&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research proposal focuses
on the study of the topology of&lt;br/&gt;manifolds with finite second homotopy
group and the Differential&lt;br/&gt;Geometry of quaternionic- Kaehler
manifolds. The emphasis of the&lt;br/&gt;project is on the determination of
analytical and topological&lt;br/&gt;invariants of the manifolds, such as the
signature, A-roof-genus&lt;br/&gt;and elliptic genera. Following the evidence
from our previous&lt;br/&gt;research, we propose to apply the aforementioned
theory to&lt;br/&gt;concrete Geometric Analysis/Differential
Geometry&lt;br/&gt;problems. Furthermore, this study has applications to
Algebraic&lt;br/&gt;Geometry (via twistor transform) and to Theoretical
Physics,&lt;br/&gt;since the manifolds under consideration are of interest in
sigma&lt;br/&gt;models and in String Theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My research
interests are concerned with the study of certain&lt;br/&gt;spaces of large
dimension, called quaternion-Kaehler&lt;br/&gt;manifolds. In the quest for
understanding the universe,&lt;br/&gt;physicists have developed many and very
sophisticated models,&lt;br/&gt;such as Relativity Theory and more recently
String Theory, that&lt;br/&gt;help explain and predict phenomena observed in the
Universe. One&lt;br/&gt;of the leading physicists of our times, E. Witten,
discovered&lt;br/&gt;that quaternion-Kaehler manifolds appear in the formulation
of&lt;br/&gt;certain Quantum Field Theories. My research focuses on
finding&lt;br/&gt;the possible shapes and properties of quaternion-
Kaehler&lt;br/&gt;manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;
