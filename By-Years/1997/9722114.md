A group of five physicists is making a major long-term commitment to research
related to the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Under
this award they will pursue the following activities: 1) the development of
input/output optics for the LIGO interferometers, exclusive of that defined in
the LIGO construction project, 2) development of dual recycling and resonant
side-band extraction, 3) computing and data management, and 4) simulation of the
LIGO optical system. This project is jointly supported by the Division of
Physics and the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.
