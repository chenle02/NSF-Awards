This award will support the renewal the REU Site at the SETI Institute (SI),
which focuses on astronomy and planetary science with a connecting theme of
astrobiology. Ten student participants per year will be paired with SI
scientists to conduct laboratory research at both SI and at the NASA Ames
Research Center. The undergraduate students will perform detailed research into
a variety of topics, including the interstellar medium, asteroids, geological
activity on Mars, and spectroscopy of the outer solar system. In addition, all
participants will attend tutorials by SI scientists on introductory concepts in
astronomy, biology, and geology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By offering high-quality
research experiences to students at a critical stage of undergraduate education,
the REU Site will contribute to increasing the nationwide pool of scientists and
engineers. Participants will develop the research methods and analytical skills
(mathematical, computational, and logical) necessary to process data, understand
primary research, and to remain current with new developments in the field. The
REU Site also has an active and highly developed plan to recruit
underrepresented minorities into its program, which will expand STEM training
opportunities to these groups.
