The main aspect of the project is to consider decomposing families of finite and
infinite groups as the product of cyclic, Abelian or solvable subgroups. The
historical background comes from Ito's theorem, Lazard's work on analytic pro-p
groups and the connection between bounded generation and the congruence subgroup
property for arithmetic groups established by Lubotzky, Platonov and Rapinchuk.
While the PI considers problems motivated by these major results, he also
investigates cyclic, Abelian and solvable decompositions in a broader context:
for finite simple groups, infinite permutation groups, geometric groups and
groups acting on trees. Besides rather surprising constructions (e.g., the
infinite symmetric group is the product of finitely many Abelian subgroups), the
existence of such a decomposition leads to strong asymptotic restrictions (e.g.
on subgroup growth). On the other hand, trying to show that a certain
decomposition does not exist forces one to look at the subgroup structure from a
new point of view which then can be analyzed further. An example for this is
Hausdorff dimension of groups acting on rooted trees.

The set of symmetries of any object or structure forms a group. Thus group
theory naturally comes into the picture whenever one needs to analyze symmetries
(e.g. in quantum physics and chemistry or inside mathematics in geometry, number
theory, coding theory and topology). The main goal of the proposed project is to
find certain 'coordinate systems' in families of groups and so generate these
groups in a transparent way using simple structures or to show that such nice
systems do not exist. An elementary example is the fact that every plane
isometry can be obtained as the composition of at most three reflections but not
as the composition of two. There are manifold connections between the existence
of such 'coordinate systems' and various other interesting group properties.
Other than deep and useful results, the project also has elementary aspects
which can be presented on an undergraduate level and thus serve educational
purposes.
