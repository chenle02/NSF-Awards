The availability and accessiblity of the computing and networking resources at
Bradley University has led many of the faculty to incorporate information
technology application into their curriculum as an integral part of their course
offerings, and has helped stimulate interest in, and a rapid growth of, faculty
research. The purpose of this project is to provide access to facilities and
resources not available at Bradley University and to provide a means of
communication between Bradley University faculty and advanced students and their
counterparts in other institutuions all over the nation, particularly in the
sceintific and technological disciplines where progress is rapid and currency is
essential. This will be made possible by NSF's support of appropriate routing
equipment and a medium speed communication connection (56,000 bits per second)
to the CICnet, the appropriate regional network, which is in turn connected to
the NSFNET nationwide backbone network.
