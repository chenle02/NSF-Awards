Funds are requested to renovate laboratories in cell and molecular biology and
biochemistry in the Department of Biological Sciences. These laboratories serve
as training and central facilities for researchers, students, and collaborators.
This modernization will enhance training programs at all levels. On the
undergraduate level, Lehman college is striving to establish first rate training
programs for bright minority students through active participation in federally
funded programs designed to propel them into scientific research careers. The
improved facilities should enable the Department to attract more such students
and, especially, to keep minority students in the pipeline leading to advanced
degrees. On the graduate level, Master's and Doctoral programs in biology,
particularly the plant sciences program, will benefit from up-to-date
facilities. With a dwindling group of botanically oriented departments
nationwide, CUNY's plant sciences doctoral program, in collaboration with the
New York Botanical Garden will have the capacity to engage in more sophisticated
experimental research.
