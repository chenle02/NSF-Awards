This research project focuses on scalable reconciliation methods that enable
ubiquitous information sharing in a networked mobile environment. It develops,
applies, and experiment with the most recent advances in information and coding
theory and computational methods relevant to data reconciliation. The proposed
approach entails addressing the problem from three related perspectives: peer-
to-peer reconciliation, network-wide reconciliation, and, usage modeling. The
latter specifically aims at investigating and modeling practical usage of mobile
devices in order to tune reconciliation parameters. The comprehensive approach
to the issues of data reconciliation promises to impact a large number of
individuals and corporations who use PDAs and other portable devices for
maintaining personal and work data. In addition, the results of this research
will be applicable to a wide variety of networking areas, including improving of
the efficiency of content delivery in general networking architectures,
minimizing the overhead of ad-hoc routing protocols, and reducing the delay of
gossip protocols.
