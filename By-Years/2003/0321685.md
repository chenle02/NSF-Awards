This project will expand and continue the operations of Gramene, a comparative
mapping database for rice and other cereals. Gramene is a public resource that
leverages the rice genomic sequence to allow researchers working on maize,
wheat, sorghum and other cereals to apply knowledge derived from the study of
the rice genome to the synteneic regions in their species of interest. We use
controlled vocabularies (ontologies) to describe rice genes, mutants and
varieties, high throughput analytic techniques to annotate features on the
genome, and a combination of automatic and manual annotation to discover
relationships between genetic and physical maps. All raw and processed data as
well as software, is available on the Gramene web site for unrestricted
use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our specific aims are to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Map
between the rice and maize genomes.&lt;br/&gt;2. Develop an open source genome
annotation pipeline.&lt;br/&gt;3. Develop tools to manage natural variation in
cereal varieties.&lt;br/&gt;4. Acquire and maintain quantitative trait loci
associations in rice.&lt;br/&gt;5. Undertake a pilot project to annotate maize
mutants with the Plant Ontology.&lt;br/&gt;6. Add advanced query tool and report
functionality to the Gramene web site.&lt;br/&gt;7. Undertake community outreach
to high school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this project
will be to improve the understanding of cereal biology. Rice, maize and wheat
are the three most important crops in the world, and improving their yield and
stability while decreasing their environmental impact are key to improving world
food and environmental security. Due to the shared ancestry of these three
crops, it is possible to apply results from one of these species to another.
However, to make this cross-species translation possible it is critical that the
thousands of researchers working in each of these species can effectively
communicate their discoveries across species and community boundaries. The
continued development of Gramene will help integrate the genomics investment
across the grasses, which will allow genomics researchers to communicate their
results effectively. Finally, it will also start providing the informatics
infrastructure needed to help bridge the gap between genomics and applied plant
improvement.&lt;br/&gt;
