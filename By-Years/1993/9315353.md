9315353 Taylor This award supports a paleobotanical study of Permian and
Triassic sedimentary rocks in the Shackleton Glacier portion of the Central
Transantarctic Mountains. This project represents a continuation of research to
elucidate the paleobiology and biostratigraphy of the late Paleozoic and early
Mesozoic of Antarctic. The Shackleton Glacier region is known to have abundant
fossil plants but there has never been an attempt to systematically collect and
describe the flora in detail. Fossils that have been reported include fossil
forests, permineralized peat deposits, compression/impression floras, and
palynomorphs (pollen). This award provides support for collection, description,
and paleoenvironmental interpretation of these Permian and Triassic plant
fossils. These fossils, including analysis of tree rings, is an essential
component of paleoenvironmental reconstructions for the Permo-Triassic and
provides an important method of testing paleoclimatic models for the region. ***
