Abstract ATM-9633517 Werner, Al Mount Holyoke College Title: Assessment of Pre-
Late Wisconsin-Kettle Basins: Potentially Long Records of Environmental Change,
Denali National Park and Preserve, Alaska This SGER awards supports the
exploration of 2 small lakes in the Denali area of Alaska for their potential to
yield a continuous environmental record of the last 60,000 years. Field work
will include the documentation of basin bathymetry, structure of the sediment
fill through acoustic profiling, and nature of the sediment infill. If
successful, these basins could provide a key record of paleoclimate for the
glacial period.
