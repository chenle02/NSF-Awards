The ribosome is the unique site of protein biosynthesis in all cells, and as
such a detailed understanding of its structure and function is of fundamental
importance to the more general understanding of cellular function at the
molecular level. The long term goal of work in this laboratory is to create a
detailed structure-function map of the ribosome. The work put forward in this
proposal is an important part of this effort, since it provides a uniquely
powerful approach for obtaining a detailed picture of the ribosomal components
that neighbor specific sequences of rRNA within intact ribosomes and subunits.
Specifically, The PI proposes to exploit radioactive, photolabile, complementary
oligoDNA probes of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) as photoaffinity labels to identify
ribosomal components that neighbor targeted rRNA sequences within an intact
ribosome or ribosomal subunit and to determine how the identities of such
components vary in different functional sites of the ribosome. The secondary
structures of rRNA are well established. The targeted sequences fall in single-
stranded regions having particular functional or structural significance,
including those known or suspected to be involved in the peptidyl transferase
center, in the anticodon-codon recognition center, in 30S:50S subunit contacts,
and in the binding of specific ribosomal ligands such as protein factors that
stimulate protein synthesis (e.g.,EF- G,IF3) and of antibiotics. These studies
will be carried out on the E. coli ribosome, which is by far the best
characterized. However, given the considerable conservation of ribosome
structure throughout evolution, the results obtained should also be useful for
understanding ribosomes from other organisms.
