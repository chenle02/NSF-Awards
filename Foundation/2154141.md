A common approach to a difficult mathematical problem is to try an easier
version of the problem, and see if solutions to the easier problem can give any
insights for the difficult one. Similarly, simple concepts are often used to
approximate, illuminate, or even define more complicated concepts. For example,
calculus uses the extremely simple concepts of lines and rectangles to
approximate very complicated functions and regions; and when a function cannot
be nicely approximated by a line, the next-simplest kind of function (a
polynomial) can often be used to do the approximation. This project will provide
research training opportunities for graduate students.

Approximation Problems abound in algebra too, where they often have the form:
suppose C is a subcategory of a complicated category K. Can C be used to
approximate, or extract information about, arbitrary members of the ambient
category K? Approximation Problems appear in many guises in homological algebra
and homotopy theory, and affirmative solutions to such problems can provide
useful new invariants for K. Starting with Shelah's work on the Whitehead
Problem in the 1970s, set-theoretic methods have been surprisingly effective in
dealing with such questions, which often turn out to be independent of the
axioms of mathematics. The project will employ a combination of set-theoretic
and algebraic methods to address some open problems in this area.
