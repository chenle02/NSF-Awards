A confocal microscope system will be purchased for studies on such problems as
the functional organization of neurons within a sensory system, the
developmental mechanisms involved in neuronal and glial differentiation, the
nature of the neural code, i.e., the algorithms through which information is
encoded in neuronal spike trains, the functional organization of the anterior
pituitary, the migration of cells on and through basement membranes in
multicellular organisms, interactions between the cell surface of fungi and host
tissues and the structural, elemental and molecular preservation of dinosaur
tissues.
