Non-Technical Summary IBN 95-13884 PI: K. Fite Finding Food: Neuroethological
Aspects of Foraging This is a proposal for partial support for a conference that
integrates functional (adaptive ecological) and mechanistic approaches to the
study of how animals forage. That is, how do animals locate, capture and
identify sources of essential nutrition. The unique feature of this conference
is that it brings together scientist who seek to answer this fundamental
question from the perspectives of 1) sensory mechanisms, 2) neural processes, 3)
cognitive and learning processes, and 4) behavioral ecology. This conference
will be an exemplary forum that will provide young as well as experienced
investigators a view of how contemporary science attacks an age-old question in
Animal Behavior, how do organisms find the sources of ingested energy necessary
to sustain life.
