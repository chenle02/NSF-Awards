Beginning in 1928, state, federal, and tribal agencies in northern Arizona
began entrusting archaeological collections generated from lands under their
jurisdiction to the Museum of Northern Arizona's care. The result is an body of
data on both the prehistory and history of the Colorado Plateau region.
Materials include almost 200,000 catalogued artifacts - almost all from
provenienced contexts with accompanying documentation including culture, site,
and time period. Added to this are bulk collections which also are accompanied
by excavation information. An extensive ethnographic collection which focusses
primarily on Hopi and Navaho materials numbers approximately 10,000 pieces. Both
archaeological and ethnographic collections are of great research value and
subject to intensive use. However, the crucial documentation which accompanies
them is not well organized. It is deteriorating and because of its volume,
difficult to organize and access. With NSF support the Museum will computerize
this material in order to cross reference individual records and provide greater
accessibility. This will minimize direct use and, therefore, the deterioration
of the paper records. Dr. Wilcox and colleagues will purchase a Questor-Argus
system which is specifically designed for museums collection management. This
project is important because it will prevent the deterioration of significant
scientific materials, many acquired with federal funds. It will increase the
access of the Museum's anthropological collections to researchers who wish to
use them. These materials are of importance not only to archaeologists and
ethnographers but also to local Native American groups interested in their own
traditions.
