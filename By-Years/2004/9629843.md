Licciardi, Joseph M Oregon State University Significant climate variability at
higher-than-orbital frequencies is now recognized as an important signal in late
Pleistocene ice and sediment records from the circum-North Atlantic region.
Records elsewhere also reveal climate variability at millennial timescales and
identify important but poorly understood mechanisms of climate change. This
doctoral dissertation project will examine the record of late-Pleistocene
glaciers in the western U.S. Better dating of the record and identification of
the mechanisms of its associated climate signal are objectives which will lead
to a fuller understanding of the spatial and temporal ranges of climate change
in this region. The intent is to develop an improved numerical chronology of
mountain glaciation using newly developed surface exposure methods and apply
these to numerous glacial moraines in mountain ranges of the western U.S. The
primary objective is to establish production rates of cosmogenic nuclides from
radiocarbon-dated flows. Results of the research will shed new light on our
understanding of stratigraphic complexity from one mountain range to another. It
will also serve to reveal the variation in climate in this region over the past
50,000 years.
