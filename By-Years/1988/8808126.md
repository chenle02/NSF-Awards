This work includes the development of computational methods for studying the
electronic states in condensed matter and to carry out calculations for real
solids and liquids. This is part of a long-range program to understand and
predict physical properties of condensed matter from the fundamental equations
for the electrons and nuclei. The work will lead to timely advances based upon
recent developments in the field, making use of ideas and computational methods
built up by the authors and co-workers, in particular, quantum Monte Carlo and
density functional techniques. The former can in principle calculate exact
properties of many-body systems, but its applications to condensed matter have
been thus far limited. The latter is simpler and is accurate for the ground
state properties of certain classes of materials. The main thrust of the
proposal is to combine these two complementary approaches to enhance both the
scope of the methods and their accuracies. An integral part of the program is to
apply the developments to problems with direct connections to experimental
physics and materials science--both to test the methods and to understand and
predict experimentally relevant properties. Examples include properties of new
materials such as superlattices, liquid and amorphous systems, and correlated
electronic states in magnetic insulators, heavy fermion systems, and the new
oxide superconductors.//
