The School in the Exploratorium (SITE) is implementing a three year multi-
tiered program designed to prepare a cadre of 37 Lead Science Teachers from the
San Francisco Unified School District and from Marin County school districts to
implement district-wide hands-on science teaching. Working in partnership with
the newly implemented SFUSD's San Francisco Science Leadership Project and
similar projects in the Marin County districts, SITE will provide intensive
training in physical science, inquiry-based learning and school leadership for
the Lead Teachers to support implementation of hands on science and the
introduction of the new California State Science Framework. This project will
result in the creation of 34 Lead Schools in which the Lead Teachers will work
with 74 colleagues also trained by SITE, to conduct on-site workshops for their
colleagues and principals both in their schools and throughout the districts.
Additional activities include year-long internships for twelve science
specialists for the districts. These specialists will have experience planning
inservice, working with students, mentoring teachers, and planning for district
wide change. Each school district has made arrangements for these specialists to
take on positions of leadership and continue in that role after the NSF support
is completed.
