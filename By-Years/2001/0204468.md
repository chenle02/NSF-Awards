The goal of this research is to develop a comprehensive co-design methodology,
including algorithms and tools to facilitate the simultaneous power, noise
margin, signal integrity, and power economy design with few, if any, design
iterations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key objectives
are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Develop novel hierarchical, efficient, distributed
and accurate system-level power delivery RLS models and analysis tools to
evaluate power reduction and noise-immune design techniques for power
delivery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Develop efficient power and area estimation
algorithms at the architecture level and at the physical design level.
