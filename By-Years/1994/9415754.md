9415754 Neuhoff This project addresses the development of the theory and
practice ofstructured vector quantizers for signal compression of sources such
as speech, images, video and music. Though the cost of storing and transmitting
information continues to decrease, such reductions seem only to stimulate demand
for information and, consequently, for further developments in compression.
Structured vector quantizers from a class of compression techniques that hold
significant promise for gains in performance. This project will develop theory
to increase the qualitative and quantitative understanding of the performance of
structured vector quantizers, particularly the tradeoffs between performance and
complexity. It will analyze a number of specific structured vector quantizers.
In addition, it will develop new structured quantization approaches. The
methodology is largely, but not exclusively, based on asymptotic quantization
theory techniques and concepts. The analysis and developments are for fixed and
variable-rate quantizers that minimize rate with respect to squared error and
perceptual fidelity criteria. ***
