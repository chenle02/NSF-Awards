The Department of Mathematics at the University of Hawaii will purchase computer
equipment and software which will be dedicated to the support of research in the
mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for several research projects,
including in particular: Differentiation and the Distribution of Zeros of
Functions; Lattice Theory; Learning, Generalization and Model Construction in
First-Order Logic; and Symbolic and Numerical Analysis of Ordinary and Partial
Differential Equations. The first project is concerned with the effect of
differentiation of the distribution of zeros of polynomials and certain other
functions. New techniques involving geometric mapping properties will be
employed to study several well-- known conjectures. The second project will use
recent advances in free and finitely presented lattices to study unsolved
problems in lattice theory, including solving equations in free lattices and
finding the covers of finitely generated lattice varieties. The third project
will study various aspects of mechanical theorem proving. The fourth project
will search for normal forms and natural geometric structures associated with
control systems.
