The research product will provide guidance to researchers by describing the
ethical foundations of research practices and some of the personal and
professional issues that researchers encounter in their work. Besides the key
concepts provided in the earlier editions of the guide, the third edition of On
Being a Scientist: Responsible Conduct in Research would address key issues that
have emerged since the last edition in 1995. These include financial conflicts
of interest, Internet and electronic publications, intellectual property,
interdisciplinary research and publication, commercial influences on research
agendas, management of human resources, and homeland security.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The committee that will conduct this study will include
academic and nonacademic experts in life and physical sciences, social sciences,
health sciences, engineering, environmental sciences and engineering,
statistics, as well as science and technology policy life and physical sciences,
engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Academies entity overseeing this
committee is the Committee on Science, Engineering and Public Policy (COSEPUP).
COSEPUP has a long history of seminal work in the areas of science and
technology policy, research conduct, and the education and training of
scientists and engineers including past studies entitled Responsible Conduct in
Research: Ensuring the Integrity of the Research Process, On Being a Scientist:
Responsible Conduct in Research-1 st and 2 nd Edition, Reshaping the Graduate
Education of Scientists and Engineers, Enhancing the Postdoctoral Experience of
Scientists and Engineers: A Guide for Postdoctoral Scholars, Advisors,
Institutions, Funding Organization, and Disciplinary Societies, and Science and
Security in an Age of Terrorism. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
incorporate National Academies Science and Technology Policy interns, who are
graduate students and postdoctoral scholars in science and engineering, as part
of education and training activities related to this study. The volume will
provide guidance to all research disciplines on how to conduct responsible
research, and how to respond to concerns regarding the activities of other
researchers. The study committee will include representatives from
underrepresented groups and a diverse array of academic institutions in its
focus groups and workshops.&lt;br/&gt;
