The principal investigator will continue his research in probability in
infinite dimensional spaces, particularly on convergence of empirical processes
indexed over general classes of functions and their applications in statistics.
He will consider uniform and universal classes of functions for different limit
theorems, the parametric and the non-parametric bootstrap, U-processes and
differentiable functionals with the general aim of increasing the applicability
of modern empirical process theory. He will also continue to study the
characterization and limit theory of max infinitely divisible and max stable
processes, and random sets.
