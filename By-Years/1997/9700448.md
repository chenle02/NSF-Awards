In a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem, a linear function of a symmetric
matrix variable X is minimized subject to linear equality constraints on X and
the essential constraint that X be positive semidefinite. Several problems can
be cast as SDP problems including linear programs, convex quadratic problems
with convex quadratic inequality constraints, matrix norm minimization and a
variety of maximum and minimum eigenvalue problems. In addition, SDP has many
applications in enginnering, combinatorial optimization and statistics. It is
known that several interior point algorithms for linear programs can be extended
to SDP problems. As in linear programming, many of these methods are
polynomially convergent and perform very efficiently in practice. In particular,
the class of primal-dual interior point methods and their higher- order variants
are the most effective interior point methods. In contrast to linear
programming, there are many ways one can compute the Newton search directions
used in primal-dual algorithms for SDP. For this reason, the theory of primal-
dual methods for SDP is substantially more difficult than that for LP. This
project addresses the development of the theory and implementation of primal-
dual interior point algorithms for SDP problems. The objectives of this research
project include: 1) developing a new primal-dual interior point algorithm for
SDP; 2) advancing the knowledge of the theory of polynomial and superlinear
convergence analysis of primal-dual methods for SDP; 3) studying the existence
and asymptotic behavior of continuous trajectories for SDP; 4) developing new
higher-order primal-dual methods for SDP; 5) implementing the new proposed
algorithm and comparing it against existing primal-dual interior point methods;
and 6) extending primal-dual interior point algorithms to the context of
nonlinear SDP and complementarity problems.
