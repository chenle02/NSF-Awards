Magnetocrystalline anisotropy and magnetostriction are fundamental properties
of magnetic materials and derive from the fact that the exchange energy which is
responsible for the existence of spontaneous magnetization is controlled by the
overlap of electron clouds in the crystal. Magnetocrystalline anisotropy derives
from the fact that the energy of magnetization is a function of the orientation
with respect to the lattice. This leads to "easy" and "hard" directions for
magnetization and is a critical parameter controlling the width of domain walls.
It is thus clearly important that we have accurate measurements of these
parameters if we are to make much progress in our understanding of TRM
mechanisms. A major problem is that both constants are known to vary with
temperature. In particular, we need values at temperatures near the Curie point
as this is where remanence in locked in. The PI will make sure measurements. He
will measure both constants for x-values up to 0.8 and temperatures up to the
Curie point. His goal is to measure the magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant
for several x-values and at temperatures significantly above room temperature.
He will use a technique that has seen only limited use in rock magnetism,
ferromagnetic resonance.
