This research involves the development of improved methods
for&lt;br/&gt;automatic processing of text documents. The research
focuses&lt;br/&gt;in particular on two specific text-handling problems:
lossless&lt;br/&gt;data compression and classification. Lossless data
compression&lt;br/&gt;is useful for reducing storage and transmission
requirements&lt;br/&gt;for large text documents. It is also an important step
in&lt;br/&gt;sending text securely via cryptography. Classification
arises&lt;br/&gt;frequently in web search problems and also in forensics,
where&lt;br/&gt;the goal is to determine the authorship of an anonymous
document.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approach is to draw new insights into these
problems by&lt;br/&gt;using a novel asymptotic regime in information theory,
which&lt;br/&gt;more accurately models real text sources than
classical&lt;br/&gt;models do. Specfically, the investigators consider a regime
in which &lt;br/&gt;the size of the data set and the source alphabet are
comparably large. &lt;br/&gt;It can be shown that most classical information
theory techniques&lt;br/&gt;fail in this "rare-events" regime. Nonetheless, new
techniques can &lt;br/&gt;be developed that are tailored to this regime that
yield new algorithms &lt;br/&gt;and insights.
