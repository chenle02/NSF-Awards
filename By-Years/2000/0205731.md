&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on innovative algorithms for generating highly
expressive synthetic speech. Current text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) systems
generate speech that lacks expressiveness. This is a serious obstacle for the
potential application of TTS to computer based language and speech remediation
for children. Using TTS has these advantages over recorded speech, which is
currently the standard in remedial systems: (i) TTS provides complete
flexibility in textual materials, and enables interactivity and
individualization, which are both key for successful language teaching and
remediation. (ii) TTS output can be modified more easily and along far more
dimensions than recorded speech, including temporal, intonational, and spectral
dimensions, so that speech output can be adjusted to a child's individual
pattern of needs.&lt;br/&gt;Generating expressive speech involves three hard
research problems. (i) Computation of abstract tags that specify, e.g., which
words need emphasis, and phrasing (e.g., where to pause). (ii) Based on these
tags, the system has to compute a fundamental frequency contour. (iii) Severe
modification of the stored speech fragments ("acoustic units") to obtain these
contours.&lt;br/&gt;The central goal of the project is to address these research
problems, and create a TTS system that will make the next generation of TTS
based remedial systems viable.&lt;br/&gt;
