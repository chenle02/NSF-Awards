Phase II joins 14 universities, National Laboratories and local industry to
increase the quality and number of Hispanic BS degrees in SMET conferred by PR-
AMP institutions each year by a total of 1,425, growing from the current 2,646
to 4,071. Up to 2/3 of these will be low-income and/or first generation college
students. PR-AMP universities conferred 1,896 BS degrees in 1993, which
represents 23.7% of the 7,995 degrees conferred nationally to Hispanics, making
PR-AMP institutions a key resource for producing Hispanic SMET graduates.
Through PR-AMP Phase II, about 32,000 student participants are expected to
benefit from the PR-AMP program. Institutional effectiveness and efficiency will
be optimized to increase the average graduation rates of PR-AMP institutions
from the current annual rate of 32% to 60%. PhDs in SMET conferred to BS
graduates from PR-AMP will increase from the current annual average of 48 to 83.
The thrust of PR-AMP Phase II activities will target the undergraduate component
of the SMET pipeline, as major systemic strategies are already in place on the
island to address the pre- college (PR Systemic Statewide Initiative) and
graduate (Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research-EPSCoR) levels.
Building on those strategies piloted and found effective in Phase I and creating
new initiatives to address all key aspects of the barriers to SMET education,
Phase II will develop the following core strategies: changing the
teaching/learning culture, faculty attitudes and curriculum though the
curricular revision of SMET curricula to incorporate effective teaching
strategies bases on an inquiry approach to learning and effective classroom
assessment method, with emphasis on gatekeeper and bottleneck courses; faculty,
industry and peer mentoring program to provide SMET students with a network of
academic and social support; strengthening undergraduat e research with emphasis
on local graduate research centers, National Laboratories and industry
internships; stipends for low-income SMET students to address financial need and
stimulate participation in the PR-AMP process; incorporation of multimedia
technology in the learning process; special bridging component, with pre-college
to college engineering program and an undergraduate to graduate transition
program; a teacher preparation program to improve the competence of future SMET
teachers; and the development of an institutional research and strategic
planning capability to measure variables that indicate the value-added in terms
of student outcomes and institutional effectiveness and efficiency.
