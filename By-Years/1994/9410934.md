9410934 Quinn In order to understand the molecular basis of learning, it will be
necessary to (1) identify the genes which influence learning performance, (2)
determine in which brain cells they are active, and (3) describe what happens
when they are switched on or off. Dr. Quinn's lab has identified a mutant fly
("radish") with specific learning deficits, and will now proceed to identify the
gene which produces altered learning performance in flies of this phenotype.
With this information they will be able to identify the product of the radish
gene and begin to determine the mechanisms by which the product acts to
influence the learning process. This will have great significance for
understanding both the neural and genetic factors that influence the
modifiability of an organism's behavior.
