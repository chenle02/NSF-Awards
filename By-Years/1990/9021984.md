A broad program of research in theoretical physics will include work on
superstring theory, including non-perturbative approaches, studies of two and
higher-dimensional quantum gravity, numerical investigations of quantum
chromodynamics, and study of the physics that can produce large-scale structure
in the universe. Superstring theory is the exciting candidate for a theory of
all the fundamental forces, including gravity, and quantum chromodynamics is the
increasingly-confirmed detailed theory of the strong nuclear force, so the
investigations to be undertaken are very important.
