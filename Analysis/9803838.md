Contents ------------------------------- Abbas Bahri This proposal aims at
studying various variational problems in Partial Differential Equations and
contact form geometry. These problems are connected to the study of changing
sign solutions for Yamabe type problems as well as the study of Yang-Mills and
Einstein equations. They are also connected to the finding of periodic orbits
for contact vector fields. There is finally some relation to quantum mechanics.
The tools are extracted from partial differential equations, geometry and
variational theory. \medskip There are in Physics several open problems
regarding the shape and the behavior of the universe as well as the behavior of
its elementary particles. Using these tools from mathematics, variational theory
and its extensions in particular, we are trying to give some contribution to the
understanding of these problems, which have an independent mathematical
interest. \end
