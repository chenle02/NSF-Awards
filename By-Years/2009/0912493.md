This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project will evaluate a method
to produce large quantities of single-walled carbon nanotubes that are
monodisperse in their diameter and/or electronic type (semiconducting or
metallic).

Availability of large quantities of monodisperse SWCNTs by size and electronic
type would enable many potential optoelectric and composite technologies using
carbon nanotubes.
