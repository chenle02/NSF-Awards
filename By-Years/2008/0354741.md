This project uses a precision Penning trap mass spectrometer to make atomic mass
measurements at a precision near or below one part in 10 to the eleventh.
Emphasis will be given to a precise intercomparison of tritium/helium with
importance to determination of the neutrino mass. The measurements will exploit
the novel, recently demonstrated technique of simultaneous cyclotron frequency
measurement of two ions in a Penning trap. This method greatly suppresses the
effects of fluctuations in the magnetic field and trap voltages which limited
the precision of all previous work. The existing program of precision laser
spectroscopy of hydrogen-like and helium-like ions will also be continued. These
measurements test relativistic QED atomic theory, particularly of higher-order
binding corrections. The broader impact involves education of both graduate and
undergraduate students as well as efforts to recruit under-represented
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
