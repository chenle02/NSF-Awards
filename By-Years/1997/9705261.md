request $46,744 for a planning grant whose goal is to empower parents by
bringing informal science and math education experiences to create a working
team of parents, teachers, and museum staff to underserved, ethnically diverse
students in their formative years, and their families. A major objective is to
develop a framework for a science resource kit for home use by parents and
children in grades K-3, and related parent training. The target audience is low
income, minority, recently immigrated parents, with little to no involvement in
their children's education. Parents from the target audience will serve on the
Planning Team. The function of the kits is to provide exciting,
intergenerational, exploratory experiences in math and science that are related
to the school curriculum. Each kit will be designed to be completely portable
and will appear to be a large trunk with wheels. Contents may include: a laptop-
size computer; hand lenses and two small microscopes; diffraction gratings and
flourescent sources; ramps and balls; mirrors, lenses and other optics.
