9407999 Norell Four field seasons of fossil collecting in Late Cretaceous
deposits of Mongolia by joint expeditions of the American Museum of Natural
History and the Mongolian Academy of Sciences amassed a large collection of
theropod dinosaur skeletons, including taxa considered to be among the closest
relatives of birds. This collection and the vast dinosaur collections of the
American Museum are the focus of a proposed analysis assessing the relationships
of birds to other theropod dinosaurs. Emphasis will be placed on developing new
character systems in the skull based on CAT scan images. Evidence for the
hypothesis that birds are most closely related to theropod dinosaurs, and indeed
are theropod dinosaurs, has rapidly mounted during the last decade. However, the
precise relationships of birds to theropod dinosaurs is controversial, as are
the relationships among the most primitive birds. A great deal of evidence
relevant to these questions exists but can only be made available by CAT scans
and manual preparation of fossils followed by comparison with other specimens
widely scattered in museums around the world. The anatomical details elucidated
by this study and the historical hypotheses it generates will provide a solid
foundation for studies of bird origins and the origin of avian flight.
