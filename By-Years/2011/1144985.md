Modern multicore architectures, that provide high raw gigaflops and teraflops,
have deep memory hierarchies and low overhead threading capabilities. Lack of
support for directly exploiting these capabilities leads to severe under-
utilization especially for data intensive applications. This project expects to
develop methods that efficiently use the available computational power to
provide cost improvement for large scale data processing systems.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop a highly efficient computation
framework called GLADE that will support a large class of data intensive
applications, and will be based on a novel computational model called
generalized linear aggregates. The commutative and associative properties of
Generalized Linear Aggregates facilitate highly efficient parallel and
distributed computation as well as exploitation of deep memory hierarchies,
especially when multiple queries are simultaneously executed as is typical in
many data-processing tasks. The resulting one to two orders of magnitude
improvement in computational efficiency can be expected to yield corresponding
reduction in cost and energy requirements of data processing tasks which in turn
will make it feasible to analyze much larger data sets than currently
possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will make the synergistic
combination of high performance computing and large scale data analysis widely
available to researchers, and other interested groups in government, industry,
and education. The enabling of a large number of data intensive application
using inexpensive computers that cost in low tens of thousands of dollars will
broaden the use of data analysis, exploration and mining for a wide variety of
existing and emerging applications. Examples of such applications include
network intrusion detection, social network analysis, climate data, ecosystem
analysis, and customer relationship management. Additional information about the
