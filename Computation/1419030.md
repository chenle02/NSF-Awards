This research concerns improved methods for the modeling of material systems.
Many materials modeling problems rely heavily on quantum mechanical models.
However, for quantum mechanics to be really useful, one has to couple it with
either continuum models or molecular mechanics models. The success of such an
approach has been well documented in chemistry applications. This project
explores approaches based on quantum mechanics (density functional theory)
coupled with molecular mechanics or continuum mechanics in modeling materials.
Although the coupled quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics approach has enjoyed
a considerable amount of success, winning the 2013 Nobel Prize in chemistry, its
application to general material systems, particularly metallic systems, has been
at issue for a long time. The problem comes from the non-local effect of the
errors made at the interface between the molecular mechanics and quantum
mechanics regions. This problem is particularly severe for metallic systems.
This project tackles these important challenges in the modeling of material
systems.

There are many technical hurdles that one needs to overcome. First of all, one
needs to improve the efficiency of density functional theory (DFT) algorithms to
be able to handle inhomogeneous systems, such as systems with point defects or a
small portion of extended defects. The next hurdle is to derive classical
models, based on either molecular mechanics or continuum theory, that are
consistent with DFT. This means that the DFT models reduce to classical models
in some limit. A third problem is to design coupling schemes that move smoothly
from DFT to classical models. The current project will focus on the second and
third problems, beginning with one-dimensional model problems. The
investigation's starting point is the Fermi operator formulation of DFT. By
making successive approximations on the Fermi operator formalism, the PI aim to
arrive at a consistent DFT/molecular mechanics or DFT/continuum model coupling
scheme.
