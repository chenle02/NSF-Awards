Implementation Projects in the HBCU-UP program provide support to design,
implement, study and assess comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the
numbers of students and the quality of their preparation by strengthening
science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and research.
The Pathway Ready Opportunities for Growth, Research, and Excellence in STEM
Skills (PROGRESS) Project at Prairie View A & M University seeks to support the
representation of students from minoritized groups in the STEM workforce by
increasing the number of STEM graduates from PVAMU. The project aims to produce
globally competitive candidates, bring talent to different sectors in STEM, and
contribute to the national STEM workforce. The project's theoretical framework
states that successful outcomes in STEM education occur by blending
psychological and social-environmental factors with STEM capital-building. The
PROGRESS Project will cultivate STEM knowledge and professional competency in
students through an interdisciplinary STEM educational design approach.

The specific goal of the PROGRESS Project is to increase the number of STEM
graduates at Prairie View A&M University through focusing on persistence in STEM
majors. The potential societal impact involves acquiring assets that will help
achieve the goal, including STEM cultural capital and STEM social capital. By
developing 21st-century learning, literacy, and life skills, scholars will
collect the tools necessary to build their STEM capital. STEM majors in the
disciplines of Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Mathematics will have access to
resources within and outside of the natural sciences, emphasizing the
interdisciplinary nature of science and career options. The PROGRESS Project
will focus on three objectives to build these skills and help students develop
STEM capital, including designing and implementing a) a Panther PROGRESS Network
for STEM students to access academic, career, and research mentoring, b)
interdisciplinary STEM courses, and c) Course-based Undergraduate Research
Experiences (CUREs). The project aims to use research and evidence-based
strategies to improve the quality of STEM education and achieve these goals. An
evaluation of the projectâ€™s objectives is underpinned by formative and summative
methods for documenting outcomes and tracking benchmark progress.
