The objective of this study is to further ascertain the feasibility of
reinforcing cohesionless soil by adding small, discontinuous reinforcing
elements to the soil matrix. The findings from Phase I study were that
cohesionless soils can be appreciably strengthened and stiffened by the addition
of such elements by both random mixing as well as by placement in discrete
layers. The research will include the use of manufactured elements in potential
commercial applications including retaining wall design and construction,
pavement system design and construction, buried pipe/conduit design and
construction, and marginal land improvement/vehicular trafficability
enhancement.
