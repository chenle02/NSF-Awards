This is a project to test a new model of how competition for food and risk of
predation interact to affect primate group size and structure. Most models that
predict primate group size treat predation risk and within-group food
competition as distinct factors which can be measured independently from each
other. In contrast, Janson proposes a mathematical model in which, for a given
habitat, both an individual monkey's food intake and predation risk are
functions of four socioecological parameters: group size, spacing between
individuals, time spent vigilant, and time spent foraging. Because parameter
values which decrease risk of predation also decrease food intake, the optimal
social group size in this model is remarkably independent of the intensity of
predation, while the other socioecological parameters covary with group size in
well-defined ways. Data on brown capuchin monkey social structure will be
collected on four groups in a low-predation environment in a National Park in
Argentina, and compared with data previously collected by the PI on the same
species in a high-predation environment in Peru. The proposed study will be the
first in which differences in both food availability and predation risk between
populations are measured and related to specific differences in social
structure.
