Researchers will study and demonstrate large area electron beam assisted etching
of theconventional insulators, semiconductors, and metals used in circuit
fabrication. Large area electron beam etching of SiO2, Si3N4 polysilicon, and
crystalline silicon will be explored. The films with various test patterns
defined in single layer resist will be etched with an electron beam etching
reactordesigned and built for this purpose. Etch rates will be measured
usingellipsometry measurement of the film thickness in prematurely interrupted
runs. Once end point detection techniques are developed for the electron beam
plasma, they will also be used to determine etch rates. The etch profiles will
be categorized with a profilometer and scanning electron microscopy. The
electron beam etched structures will be categorized with respect to possible
radiation damage using both high frequency capacitance voltage measurements and
avalanche electron injection techniques. The effects of a post etching low
temperature annel will also be studied.
