This proposal is for continued operation of an active CLEO/BTeV group at Wayne
State University. The group consists of two faculty, Professors Bonvicini and
Cinabro, one postdoc, two graduate students, and a few undergraduates. With our
past NSF support the group participated in the construction and operation of
CLEO and worked on CLEO-II physics analysis. The Wayne State group leads the
analysis efforts in charm decays and maintains the background monitoring
hardware. The analysis efforts have helped discover the DsJ(2460), have observed
the neutral D to kaon decay for the first time and analyzed its substructure
using the Dalitz technique. The group has demonstrated a novel method of
measuring the tracking efficiency with the data to very high precision. Physics
with the CLEO-c experiment is now starting. The group is working to maintain and
support physics analysis with the detector. Physics interests include three-body
hadronic charm decays and searches for charm mixing and other rare charm
decays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On BTeV, the group has participated in detector
R&amp;D where they have focused on the cooling of the pixel detector. The plan
is to move into construction with work on the hardware of the pixel cooling
system and testing of pixel electronic components. BTeV's ability to search for
rare charm decays has been studied. The group continues to work on an innovative
beamstrahlung monitor, which can optimize the delivered luminosity at electron-
positron colliders. A prototype has been built at CESR-c. The group plans to
demonstrate the detector, complete its construction, and work on the design for
a high-energy linear collider.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wayne State group runs a
very successful outreach effort in their REU/RET program. This program achieves
its intrinsic goals of promoting undergraduate and younger student interest in
careers in science, technology, and engineering, especially among the
underrepresented, and makes connections with K/12 teachers. The students and
teachers also have made a significant contribution to the research
effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: Since this proposal was submitted, the BTeV
research program to be conducted at Fermilab was terminated by the U.S.
Department of Energy.&lt;br/&gt;
