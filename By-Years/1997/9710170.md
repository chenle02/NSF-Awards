In this Minority Research Planning Grant (MRPG), the PI will develop a research
program directed at the study of business process reengineering (BPR). The PI
notes that the development and implementation of re-engineering programs fall
into radical and incremental approaches. Her efforts in this research will be
two-fold: (1) to identify and validate the critical factors that can make re-
engineering a success or failure and (2) to investigate modeling and simulation
methodology suitable for re-engineering processes.
