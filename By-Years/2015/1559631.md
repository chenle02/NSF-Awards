This award supports the renewal of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) site at the University of Washington, Seattle. The program offers a broad
selection of student projects from almost every sub-field of physics. It makes
use of the University of Washington's strong in-house "table-top" experimental
programs; its machine-shop facilities including a first-rate student shop;
CENPA, a DOE center-of-excellence in nuclear physics and astrophysics; and
theory opportunities ranging from the Institute for Nuclear Theory to a twenty-
teraflop local cluster. The award supports ten students per summer. Selection
will be competitive, considering past academic performance, letters of
recommendation, and taking into account the potential for impacting the
student's career. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each student participant will be
partnered with a UW faculty adviser. Several Physics faculty members participate
as advisers, as do selected faculty from affiliated departments. Student work
includes: design, construction, and commissioning of instrumentation; data
collection and analysis; numerical modeling; the development of software for
such modeling; and theory. Not infrequently this work culminates with a journal
publication.
