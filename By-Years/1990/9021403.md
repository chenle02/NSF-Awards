This Research Opportunity Award funds a project, "Crack Propagation Based Life
Prediction of Mechanical Components in an Analysis Environment" at Prairie View
A & M University in support of the University of Iowa's Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center for Simulation and Design Optimization of Mechanical
Systems. This two year project is reporting to the Center's Industry Advisory
Board. The project is developing an integrated crack propagation life prediction
capability system dynamic analysis for load prediction, finite element analysis
for stress prediction, and fatigue crack propagation analysis for fatigue life
prediction. The feasibility of automating this crack propagation life prediction
method for mechanical components is being demonstrated in an integrated analysis
environment. The Principal Investigator is competent and has the facilities to
perform the research. The Program Manager recommends that Prairie View A & M
University be awarded $100,000 for two (2) years.
