9529751 Wilson Recent work has developed a very precise description of relative
motion of the Cocos, Nazca, and Pacific plates over the 5 million years. This
project will expand the circuit to include the Antarctic plate thus extending
the motion of the Cocos and Nazca plates to older times. These motions will
allow the principal investigator to address questions about the origin of
microplates and the rate at which plate motions change.
