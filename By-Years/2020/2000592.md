This award will provide funding for the "Great Plains Combinatorics Conference
(GPCC) 2020" which will be held in Fargo, ND, during the weekend of April 25-26,
2020. The conference is being hosted by the Department of Mathematics at North
Dakota State University. The GPCC is a regional conference series in
combinatorics that has been held in 2014 and 2016 at the University of Kansas
and in 2018 at Kansas State University. A large portion of the funding will
support the participation of students, early-career faculty, and mathematicians
belonging to underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many research
universities in the western Great Plains have small groups (often just one or
two faculty members) working in combinatorics, and the low concentration of
universities means that combinatorialists are geographically isolated from each
other. Accordingly, the Great Plains Combinatorics Conference (GPCC) was created
in 2014 to provide an opportunity for combinatorialists in the Great Plains
region to present and share their research and to develop connections between
different areas of combinatorics. The meetings are held over a weekend, with
most participants arriving on Friday evening. There are 4 plenary talks on
Saturday, plus a graduate students poster session, and 3 plenary talks on Sunday
morning, leaving participants enough time to travel back to their home
institutions by Sunday night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following website has
been created for the conference:

NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
