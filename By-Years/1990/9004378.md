This research is to use long-period body wave data to resolve both spherical and
aspherical structure in the mantle. The analyses will use differential travel
time measurements to constrain large-scale mantle heterogeneity, stacking
techniques to image upper mantle discontinuity phases, and synthetic seismogram
modeling of waveforms from selected high-quality events.
