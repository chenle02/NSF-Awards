An inter-comparison exercise, the colloid will be conducted, wherein multiple
sampling systems for separating marine colloidal matter are tested. The primary
goal of this exercise is to determine if the colloidal material being collected
is chemically similar amongst the different filtration devices which are
presently used in oceanography. It is deemed necessary to sample both a
particle/colloid rich, high DOC coastal site and a low colloid and low DOC end
member to compare the operational differences amongst each sampling system.
Particular attention will be paid to internal blanks and sorptive losses, as
well as artifacts which can arise from differences in operating conditions.
