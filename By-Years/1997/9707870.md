The foci of this research are two fold. First, synthesis will be used to prepare
examples of small molecule receptors that precedent suggests will be selective
peptide binders and then screening them for binding with combinatorial libraries
of ca. ten thousand different tri- or hexapeptides. Receptor designs that show
high sequence selectivity will then be used as the basis of libraries of
receptors. Second, new simulation methodology will be developed to deal with the
sampling problem involved in averaging the populated states of a complex
molecular system, in particular, a molecular system having many distinct, low
energy forms or conformers. The methods developed will be used to predict
relative binding free energies of different substrates for a given receptor.
With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is
supporting the research of Dr. W. Clark Still of the Department of Chemistry at
Columbia University. Dr. Still will focus his work on the design and preparation
of synthetic, small molecule receptors for complex biological and chemical
substrates. Such small molecule receptors have potential value both in
understanding the basis of molecular recognition and in practical applications
involving chemical sensing, chemical separations and catalysis. The research
employs two different approaches: one experimental that uses combinatorial
methods in receptor design and one theoretical that involves calculations of
free energies.
