Understanding the environments and mechanisms responsible for the development
and maintenance of widespread severe convective windstorms (derechos) remains an
important research focus. These environments and mechanisms have been examined
with idealized simulations of strong, line-oriented convection (squall lines),
of which derecho-producing convective systems are a subset. These past studies
emphasize the importance of environmental low-level wind shear in controlling
the strength and longevity of squall lines. However, recent studies describing
observed derecho environments have suggested that low-level shear is not a
dominant factor. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address these issues, two main
objectives have been defined: 1) produce a reasonably comprehensive set of
horizontally non-homogeneous numerical simulations within the range of observed
environments associated with derechos, and 2) produce an analogous set of
horizontally homogeneous cloud-model simulations. This study will use a detailed
classification of the observed wind and thermodynamics profiles in derecho
environments as a baseline for the numerical simulations. The intellectual merit
of this proposal is that the disparity between the results derived from observed
derecho environments and those derived from idealized model simulations largely
will be reconciled, and our knowledge of the physical mechanisms responsible for
the development and maintenance of the line-oriented convection and the strong
surface winds within these types of weather systems will be increased. The
broader impacts are the improved forecasts of convective windstorms, resulting
in enhanced public safety and economic benefits to commerce.
