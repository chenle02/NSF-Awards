The S-STEM Program at Albright College supports students to overcome challenges
that typically cause undergraduates to leave the STEM fields. The S-STEM support
is used to increase recruitment and retention of talented students who may
otherwise not be able to afford college. Special attention is made to promote
high-quality STEM education opportunities to talented, low-income and minority
students. To accomplish this, early interventions for students include increased
tutoring availability, cohort-focused academic activities, and optional research
internship programs. Encouragement of diversity in the STEM workforce is
facilitated through professional development opportunities for STEM
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical features of this project centers on
the appreciation of the multiple contributions STEM fields make towards the
study of the environment. This S-STEM Program is capitalizing on prior progress
made in environmentally-oriented science curriculum at Albright College. In this
S-STEM Program, environmental science is the primary method used to increase the
visibility of the STEM fields. Across campus at Albright College, students are
recruited into the program from varied educational backgrounds. Students are
involved with projects that benefit the campus and greater community through
various class projects and learning experiences. Notable project implementation
components include improved student support services that lead to student
success in the classroom and their future career paths.
