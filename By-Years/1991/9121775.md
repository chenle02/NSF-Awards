Professor Mandel will study some of the most counterintuitive aspects of
quantum optics involving nonlocality and entangled quantum states. Mandel's
group will carry out experiments on interference effects in light beams which
show that even widely separated photons, derived simultaneously from the same
light source, will interfere quantum mechanically where no classical analogue
exists. The experiments are aimed at a deeper understanding of nonlocality and
indistinguishability in quantum phenomena which may point the way to a more
general theory of quantum mechanics of which the current version may only be a
local approximation.
