In this project supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry Program, Harry B. Gray of the California Institute of Technology will
investigate the factors that control long-range electron transfer in biological
systems. The studies will lead to a better understanding of the biochemical
oxidation-reduction mechanisms in life processes. The dependence of the rate of
electron transfer on donor- acceptor separation and reaction driving force
(Gibbs free energy) will be studied in several derivatives of sperm whale
myoglobin and horse heart cytochrome c. A methodology will be developed to
modify surface histidines with tetraammine- ruthenium pyridinium complexes which
will allow introduction of organic acceptor moieties in four well-defined
positions on the surface of myoglobin. Semisynthetic procedures will be used to
place organic acceptors at position-82 inside cytochrome c (phenylalanine-82
will be replaced by fluoro- and cyano-phenyl- alanines). Combined driving
force/distance-variation electron transfer experiments will be carried out on
the modified myoglobins. Photoinduced charge separation and charge recombination
reactions in zinc porphyrin/position-82-acceptor cytochrome c derivatives will
be investigated.
