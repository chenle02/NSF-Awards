This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in signal processing
involves Robert Gray of Stanford University and Michel Barlaud of the
Laboratoire d'Information Signaux et Systemes of the French National Center for
Scientific Research in Sophia Antipolis, France. The award provides travel
support and living expenses to Dr. Gray and a research assistant. The objective
of the research is to develop a theory and design of algorithms for image
compression and classification. Substantial time will be devoted to studying
digital mammograms, aerial photographs, and multimedia images. The project takes
advantage of French expertise in mathematical methods.
