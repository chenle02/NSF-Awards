9317247 Valentine In order to reconstruct and understand the nature and
radiation of early metazoans, PIs and Russian collaborators will study their
traces and compare them with the traces of modern bilaterian metazoans. Team
will combine study of trace fossils with observations of the traces produced by
living animals of appropriate grades, and will conduct laboratory experiments on
the kinetics of locomotion of these animals.
