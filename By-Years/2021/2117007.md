The deposition of thin films with precisely controlled physical properties is an
essential component of many important technological applications, from the
fabrication of integrated circuits to the creation of optical components to the
development of wear-resistant coatings. This award supports the acquisition of a
versatile sputtering thin film deposition system at the University of North
Florida (UNF). The system will be capable of depositing both electrically
conducting and insulating materials with the ability to tune a wide range of
deposition parameters to optimize film properties. It will significantly enhance
the research of the four PIs on the development and characterization of new
thin-film materials and devices with tailored electrical, optical, and
mechanical properties. It will also enhance the training of students across
multiple science and engineering disciplines at both the undergraduate and
masterâ€™s levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The magnetron sputtering system
will be capable of DC and RF sputtering, high-power pulsed sputtering, co-
sputtering, and reactive sputtering, giving users great flexibility to optimize
deposition conditions for a wide range of materials. PI Santavicca (UNF Physics)
studies microwave-frequency devices based on high-kinetic-inductance
superconducting nanowires. Such devices have applications ranging from single-
photon detection to quantum computing. The sputtering system will enable the PI
to fabricate these devices at UNF, greatly expanding the capabilities of his
research program. Co-PI Wurtz (UNF Physics) studies plasmonic nanostructures
such as spasers, or plasmonic lasers, and cut-disk resonators. The sputtering
system will enable him to fabricate these samples for the first time at UNF,
complementing existing facilities for optical characterization and simulation.
Co-PI Stagon (UNF Mechanical Engineering) studies thin-film coatings for
applications ranging from surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy to wear-resistant
coatings for high-speed machine tooling. The proposed system will significantly
expand the range of materials that he is able to study. Co-PI Warusawithana (UNF
Physics) grows complex oxide heterostructures using molecular beam epitaxy. The
sputtering system will create new possibilities for him to develop these samples
into microfabricated devices such as wires, capacitors, and tunnel junctions in
order to characterize the complex oxide materials and to produce functional
devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
