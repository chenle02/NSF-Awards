This grant is to provide research support for Dr. A.M. Lenhoff under the
National Science Foundation's Presidential Young Investigator Awards program.
Dr. Lenhoff's research will be focused on the fundamental rate steps and
mechanisms taking place in new separation processes especially the separation of
bioproducts. Two different types of separation technique will be within the
scope of investigation: liquid chromatography and liquid-liquid contactors. The
former employs a packed-bed sorbent. The latter is a class of steady-state
contact processes such as affinity separation.
