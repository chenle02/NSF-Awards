This grant in the Organic Dynamics Program will provide partial travel costs for
approximately twenty U.S. scientists attending the Tenth IUPAC Conference on
Physical Organic Chemistry, to be held in Haifa, Israel from August 5-10, 1990.
Individual grants averaging $1,000 will be awarded to successful applicants (to
be selected by a committee comprised of the Principal Investigator and the other
two U.S. members of the organizing committee for the Conference). The selection
process will emphasize efforts to invite and assist the participation of women,
underrepresented minorities, and younger chemists. The IUPAC Conference on
Physical Organic Chemistry traditionally has a broad scope, bringing together
scientists from the diverse areas within physical organic chemistry. This will
foster interaction and collaborative research among members of the international
scientific community.
