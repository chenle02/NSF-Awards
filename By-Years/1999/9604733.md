A major users group from the Biochemistry Department at the University of
Missouri-Columbia (MU) is requesting a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge.
In contrast to its predecessor (the Model E), the XL-I is well-suited for
sedimentation analyses by specialists and non-specialists alike. All facets of
instrument operation are under computer control. User-friendly software is used
to configure sedimentation conditions and data-acquisition parameters and to
perform subsequent data analysis. The XL-I is supplied with both interference
and absor-bance detection systems for maximum flexibility in experimental
design. The instrument would find application in a variety of contemporary
biological research problems.
