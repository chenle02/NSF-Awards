A major thrust of this program is the study of ion diffusion and transport in
turbulent plasmas, a topic of wide application, for example to edge-tokomak
physics and to magnetospheric plasmas. The experiments make extensive use of
laser induced fluorescence (LIF) and optical tomography techniques taking
advantage of the availability of unique plasma configuration at U. Cal., Irvine:
the Q-Machine, the Irvine Torus, and the Irvine Magnetic Mirror. Using these
diagnostic techniques the investigators are able to establish a test particle in
a plasma with fluctuating fields, follow it and compare experimental
measurements with theoretical predictions. The focus will be on comparison with
diffusion theory. In addition, with LIF techniques they will investigate the
transition of stochasticity in plasmas. Additional projects include studies of
mode coupling, wave launching, dusty plasmas, and diagnostic development.
