The Rosensteil School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences at the University of
Miami will acquire several items of oceanographic instrumentation to be placed
in a pool of shared use equipment. This equipment is maintained for use on or in
association with the two research vessels the institution operates. A
substantial part of the ships' operating schedule during 1988 is in support of
NSF-sponsored research projects. The instrumentation will also increase the
capabilities of the ships and of the University to support research and
engineering activities. The instrumentation includes: -A disk drive system and
other peripheral equipment for increasing shared-use, sea-going computing
capabilities, -a deck control unit for a device (CTD) that collects precision
Temperature and Conductivity data as a function of Depth, -precision temperature
sensors for the CTD, -probe and firmware for improving dissolved oxygen
measurements, -a thermosalinograph for continuously monitoring and recording sea
surface temperature and salinity while the ship is underway, -replacement water
sampling bottles for collecting discrete seawater samples at specific depths,
and -an uninterruptable power supply laboratory computer equipment. The
instrumentation described above will increase the capability of the Institution
to support NSF-sponsored research and engineering projects.
