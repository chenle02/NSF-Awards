Techniques using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning tunnelling
microscopy (STM) are applied to the investigation of platinum and palladium
model catalysts. These methods were developed during the previous grant to this
laboratory. Three types of systems are studied: single crystals, ultrathin
films, and microfabricated model catalysts prepared by techniques used in
microelectronic device fabrication; the last is an attempt to control the
particle size and morphology of a supported catalyst. Catalytic activity and
selectivity of these catalysts is measured for the hydrogenation of 1,3 -
butadiene. Adsorbed species are studied with infrared spectroscopy. An attempt
is made to describe the active sites and to correlate physical and chemical
features with activity and selectivity. This is a test of the utility of these
new methods in catalyst characterization and design. The methods are capable of
a very high degree of resolution that may (or may not) be helpful in
understanding practical systems.
