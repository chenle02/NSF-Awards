9412936 Macrina The American Academy of Microbiology will convene a colloquium
of leading scientists and scholars to deliberate on a critical issue relating to
scientific integrity: collaborative research. At this working meeting, 15
participants will work together to identify, analyze and develop recommendations
on such issues as: defining contributions and authorship; responsibilities of
individual researchers in collaborative relationships; intellectual property
ownership; accountability and quality assurance issues; and monitoring. A white
paper with an in-depth analysis and recommendations will be developed and
disseminated to individuals involved in teaching issues in scientific integrity,
to the broad microbiological community, to policy makers who have concerns about
collaborative scientific research, and to the public. Prior meetings have
provided the opportunity to describe relevant issues, but have provided little
analysis and guidance. This colloquium will focus on this very specific area in
order to explore and develop the issues in depth. The report from this treatment
will be useful to scientists and instructors in defining, refining, and
developing their courses in scientific integrity. It will also assist the lay
public in understanding the issues surrounding research collaborations. ***
