9730155 Abrevaya This project investigates a specific branch of the
semiparametric econometrics literature known as rank estimators. The project
focuses on the development of new rank estimators for various econometric models
and consideration of their asymptotic theory. This research should be of
interest to both theoretical and applied researchers in statistics and
economics. The estimators are simple to compute and avoid the well-known problem
of bandwidth selection. More specifically, existing U-statistic asymptotic
theory will be applied and extended, when necessary, in order to derive
asymptotic formulas for the following: rank estimators for the censored and
truncated regression models; new estimators of the transformation model based on
a fourth-order U-process; a new estimator for duration models that estimates the
coefficients of a proportional hazards model with unobserved heterogeneity; and
an estimator for the semiparametric binary choice models with symmetric errors.
Monte Carlo simulations will be used in order to examine the performance of the
new estimators relative to existing estimators. An exhaustive library of
routines for the rank estimators in the literature will be developed and made
available over the Internet so that practitioners will be able to use the
estimation techniques. ??
