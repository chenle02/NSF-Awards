People are social animals, in part, because they can accomplish things together
that they cannot do alone. The possibilities for acting in the environment are
very different when others are present. These possibilities for action, the so-
called affordances of a situation, are quantitatively and qualitatively changed
when we are with another person. Not only can we perform tasks that are more
demanding but, as a cooperative social unit, we may see new ways that such tasks
can be completed. &lt;br/&gt;With support from the National Science Foundation,
Dr. Kerry Marsh and her colleagues will advance our understanding of how pairs
of individuals shift from solo to shared action in physical tasks. Past research
suggests that fundamental mathematical principles determine the actions of a
solo actor in reaching or lifting for example. Dr. Marsh and colleagues extend
those principles to understand interpersonal action. The funded research will
investigate how physical limitations and environmental constraints on
individuals combine with interpersonal constraints such as past relationship and
shared goals to affect cooperative actions among individuals. The current
approach makes specific predictions regarding how and when cooperation will
emerge. Broader impacts of interpersonal cooperation are of fundamental societal
import, and the rigorous method of the funded study is unique and original.
