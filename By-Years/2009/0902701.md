Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ferroics form an important sub-group of
functional materials whose physical properties are sensitive to changes in
electric and magnetic fields. A multiferroic is a material that exhibits two or
more of the primary ferroic properties (ferromagnetism, ferroelectricity,
ferroelasticity). A composite of ferromagnetic and ferroelectric materials will
allow coupling between magnetic and electric subsystems that is mediated by
mechanical forces and is a magneto-electric (ME) multiferroic. Such composites
provide the opportunity for studies on the physics of ME coupling and have
enormous potential for novel devices. This project will expand research on
magneto-electric interactions to the new frontier of graded ferroics. Recent
studies on compositionally graded ferromagnets and ferroelectrics have
discovered new phenomena including internal potentials, induced anisotropy, and
spontaneous strains. The planned efforts will involve the synthesis of
functionally graded bilayers and multilayers of ferrites and ferroelectrics and
studies on the effects of grading and the nature of ME interactions. The grading
will involve piezomagnetic coupling in ferrites and piezoelectric coefficient in
ferroelectrics and will be accomplished by grading the chemical composition.
Studies on ME interactions will be done over 1 mHz ? 110 GHz including low-
frequency effects and coupling at electromechanical, ferromagnetic and
magnetoacoustic resonances. Postdoctoral research associates, graduate and
undergraduate students and high school interns will participate in the research.
Collaboration with industry is also planned for technology
transfer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical
Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is on composite materials that are
capable of converting electrical energy to magnetic energy and have enormous
potential for use in energy harvesting, energy storage and consumer electronics.
The composite will have two components that respond individually to electric or
magnetic field by producing a mechanical deformation. The project is aimed at
tailoring properties of the two phases to accomplish improved mechanical
response, and therefore, enhancement in the energy conversion efficiency.
Changes in the chemical composition of each phase in a controlled manner are the
avenue that will be explored to achieve these goals. Individual phases and
composites with composition variations will be synthesized and characterized in
terms of properties of importance for energy conversion. Postdoctoral research
associates, graduate and undergraduate students and high school interns will
participate in the research. Collaboration with industry is also planned for
technology transfer.
