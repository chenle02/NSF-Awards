This proposal will describe the knowledge and uses of medical plants by the
Mayan peoples of the highlands of Chiapas, Mexico. The long-term objectives of
the research are to produce a detailed comparative inventory of those plant
species deemed to have medicinal value by the indigenous Tzeltal and Tzotzil
peoples of the highland region, and identify those species that merit chemical
evaluation because of their potentially beneficial properties; to identify and
describe in Western bio-medical terms the folk syndromes of illness for which
medicinal plants are employed in recognized folk remedies; to develop textual,
audio- and video-taped recordings of the preparation and administration of
plant-derived medications for the recognized native categories of affliction and
disease; and to publish a multilingual, illustrated atlas and ethnomedical
encyclopedia in English, Spanish, Tzeltal and Tzotzil that compares regional
variation in ethnobotanical knowledge and uses of medicinal plants as reflected
in the differential distribution of plant species, ethnomedical and
ethnobotanical nomenclature, type of affliction treated, and methods of
preparation and application. The research will be conducted with the active
collaboration of state and local representatives of the Chiapas Public Health
Service. The results of this broad study will serve to codify the significance
of traditional medical knowledge for both indigenous and non-native peoples at a
time when the loss of this knowledge is seriously threatened by rapid economic
and social change. This type of research is important because the analysis of
specific folk systems of nature helps us to understand knowlege systems in
general.
