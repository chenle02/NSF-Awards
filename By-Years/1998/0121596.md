The Decentralized Image Retrieval for Education (DIRECT) project is developing a
peer-to-peer content based image retrieval (CBIR) service for the National SMETE
Digital Library program. CBIR allows the user to designate a query image so that
the service can search the library for images of similar content. DIRECT matches
images not by text metadata but by the color, texture, and shape of the image
objects. With such a system the users of the NSDL do not need to know
specialized languages to initiate a search. Furthermore, the matching process
does not depend on a match between the cataloguer description and the user
description. The system is available to all collections in the NSDL without
imposing new standards or protocols. This offers the promise for the NSDL to
support images that have not yet been cataloged or have incomplete metadata,
without the image collection provider or aggregator having to incur additional
cataloging overhead.
