An imaging system is assembled based on a very fast (18,000-40,000 frames per
second) video camera and an arc lamp producing a large-area, collimated, high-
intensity beam. The equipment will be used in studies of arc-anode attachment
instabilities, the mechanism of droplet formation in wire arc spraying, a
reacting countercurrent shear layer in a combustor configuration, and cathode
erosion mechanisms for very-high-current plasma torches.
