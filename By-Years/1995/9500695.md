9500695 Shatashvili This proposal is for a Career award in elementary particle
physics. It involves a research and an education component. The research will be
comprised of work on gauge theories which describe the force laws between
elementary particles. The study of the relationship between gauge theories in
four spacetime dimensions and rational conformal field theories in two
dimensions; and the connection between gauge theories and string theory used to
describe microscopic extended objects, will lead to further understanding of
fundamental properties of particle interactions. The education plan follows a
Russian style program of involving students in specially designed introductions
to advanced scientific ideas early on, say at the high school level and in
accelerated undergraduate programs. ***
