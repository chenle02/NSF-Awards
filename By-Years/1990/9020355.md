Laboratory flames of H2/CO/O2/N2 will be studied over a range of
stoichiometries seeded with sulfur and sodium species to determine the nature of
the chemistry controlling the formation of deposits of sodium sulfate and
carbonate on cooled substrate materials. With measurements of temperature using
Na-D reversal, atomic Na and OH profiles using LIF, and the surface deposit
composition using in-situ Raman scattering, a kinetic model for the deposition
process can be developed. Effects of substrate material and temperature, and the
composition of the gas phase species will be determined. In particular, the
reversibility of the Na2SO4 and Na2CO3 layer build-up will be examined as a
function of flame conditions. This program will resolve the nature of the
chemistry controlling the formation of deposits of sodium sulfate and carbonate
from flames on cooled substrates. It will establish which species in the gas
phase are involved in the heterogeneous surface production of these salts. Such
knowledge will be needed to develop combustion modification strategies to
minimize high temperature corrosion and deposition in sulfur and sodium
containing systems.
