The primary purpose of this Dissertation Improvement Award is to investigate
the role of developmental principles in the growth of non-human primates.
Generally, it is assumed that growth patterns of animals are responses to the
need for functional adaptations. However, it has been know for some time that
alterations in the growth of one area of the body can greatly affect the growth
and form of structures elsewhere. Specifically, the body's growth gradients
along anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral axes, potentially could greatly
affect form and function. In this research, the PI will apply the concepts of
relative growth to data derived from primates. Skeletal material from related
genera within a subfamilies will be compared for a variety of length and breadth
measures. In this way the interactions of growth gradients can be analyzed for
their role in producing the final phenotype.
