The focus of this research is to develop methodologies for the preparation of
chiral metallic cavities for catalytic synthesis. The concept is to build, via
template methodology, a polymeric cavity into which a metal can be placed and
used as a chiral catalyst. In this methodology, both the outer an inner sphere
environments of the metal catalyst shall be controlled. In the education portion
of this grant, the overall goal is to integrate organic and organometallic
chemistry in courses, research and seminars. Students will write papers and give
lectures on current literature topics which cover these two sub-disciplines. The
ability to catalyze reactions efficiently provides the basis for transforming
readily available organic materials into numerous useful products. For medicinal
products, one additional feature is the control of chiral topology. This
research project supported by the Organic Dynamics Program will address this
issue by designing chiral polymeric cavities into which chiral metal catalysts
can be tethered. A variety of test examples will be used to demonstrate the
concept utility. The education portion of this investigation will focus on the
integration of Organic and Organometallic chemistry. This will be done by course
work, seminars and research at both the undergraduate and graduate level
