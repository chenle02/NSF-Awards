Collaborative Research on Learning Technologies: Taming the Complexities of
Modern Manufacturing: A Network Enabled Virtual Factory to Support the
Exploration and Learning in Engineering Education The University of Southern
California has been awarded a 1-year grant of $237,298 to start on the
development of a virtual factory on the World Wide Web to present manufacturing
complexities in an understandable form for university engineering students.
University instructors will use the workspace to illustrate the concepts of
factors management in a realistic setting, and students will assume roles of
various factory personnel in small team settings. Student teams may span
institutional boundaries thus allowing information-sharing among students and
professors at a number of institutions.
