As the dimensions of integrated electronic structures continue to decrease, the
point is being reached where newer and more innovative methods of heat transfer
have to be considered. To accomplish this task will require a more fundamental
understanding of the heat transfer process, particularly when the surface is
microconfigured as is the case in electronic microcircuits. In this program, the
radiant heat flow from a microconfigured surface of heavily doped silicon will
be investigated. Because the size of the structures will be comparable to or
smaller than the peak energy from an equivalent black body at that temperature,
the radiant emission ought to be profoundly altered according to recent
theoretical research. Part of the research will be to examine structures where
alterations in the Stefan Boltzmann law should be observed according to this
theoretical work.
