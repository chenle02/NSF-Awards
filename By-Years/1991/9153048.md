The Instrumentation Technology program at the Texas State Technical
Institute/Waco is developing a laboratory to prepare specialized electronic-
electromechanical technicians for the continuous and batch manufacturing
industries. The intent of this laboratory development is to leapfrog the gap
between current state-of-the-art training facilities and industrial needs
through the integration of an entire control system. Through the use of process
control and automated manufacturing as a unified system, expanded educational
opportunities are provided by system-level integration of control components. A
high-level communication network using MAP is used to interconnect the various
components from a centralized control station via a token ring platform. The
network and associated process control components are used to educate technical
students to specify, purchase, install, operate and maintain this and other high
level communication networks.
