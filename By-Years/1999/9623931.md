The State University of New York (SUNY) is a very large public
college/university system which proposes to develop a SUNY alliance for minority
participation. The four SUNY institutions that offer engineering programs are
taking the lead on the proposed initiative. The four institutions are Buffalo,
Binghamton, New Paltz, and Stony Brook. While these institutions offer the
engineering programs in the SUNY system, the disciplines involved in the
proposed initiative will also include applied science, mathematics, physical
sciences, and biological sciences. A variety of successful minority programs
already exist throughout the SUNY system. The proposed SUNY-AMP proposes to
provide alliances among these programs and establish new programs to meet the
specified goals of the proposal. In particular, it is expected that the number
of minorities receiving bachelor degrees will increase twofold from 241
underrepresented minority SMET graduates to 480 by the year 2000. Likewise, the
expected increase in the master's degrees will be from 27 to 60; in the case of
Ph.Ds the number of degrees will increase from 4 to 24. Central to this proposal
are four stated goals: (1) Increase the number of minority students that are
accepted into the coalition of SUNY schools; (2) Help minority students excel
rather than merely avoid failure; (3) Expand research opportunities for minority
students; and (4) Double the number of SMET bachelor degrees awarded by
underrepresented minority students. In part, the alliance can be seen as a
coalition of four different regional alliances each centered around the four
institutions mentioned above.
