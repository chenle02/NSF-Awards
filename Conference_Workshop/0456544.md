Abstract Richter

The proposal is for partial support of the Southeastern-Atlantic Regional
Conference on Differential Equations that has met annually since 1981. The
primary objective of the meeting is to bring together graduate students, young
investigators, and more senior researchers. The program features plenary talks
by eminent mathematicians, with parallel sessions of contributed papers by
younger participants. The funding will be used primarily for the travel support
of graduate students and young PhDs.
