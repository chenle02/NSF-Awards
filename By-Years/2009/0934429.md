This grant supports participant costs for students to attend a Summer School on
Theory and Practice of Language Implementation during the summer of 2009. The
workshop affords students an opportunity to study leading edge topics with
first-rate faculty, and the summer school provides a setting for building a
community that will become the next generation of computer science researchers.
