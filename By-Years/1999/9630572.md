9630572 Morel The dynamic relationship between the trace metal chemistry and
microbiology of terrestrial and marine surface waters will be explored in this
study. The principal investigator will conduct both field and laboratory studies
to determine how two trace metals, copper and cadmium, are taken up by marine
and freshwater phytoplankton and bacterioplankton, bound to biochelators, and
released back into the water. The field work will be carried out in coastal salt
ponds on Cape Cod and in Swiss alpine lakes where other scientists already have
established programs to study trace metal biogeochemistry. Laboratory
experimentation will help quantify the rates of these various processes. Besides
improving current understanding of the role of plankton biochemical pathways
impacting the trace metal chemistry of surface waters, these studies should also
provide insight into how metal concentrations and chemical speciation are
related in a two-way cause-and-effect relationship to planktonic species
composition.
