9417238 Bebernes Work supported by this Small Grant for Exploratory Research
award seeks to explore the nature of solutions of partial differential equations
in the neighborhood of singularities. More precisely, in the evolution of
combustion processes, solutions to mathematical models only partially account
for a description of the temperature region after reaction begins. Such
evolutionary processes are typically initiated by boundary heat addition, by
localized volumetric heating, by passage of a dynamic wave or by very fast
compression. Localized heating during the ignition period creates regions in
which the heat production rate accelerates as the reactants are consumed. These
sharply focused hot spots can create explosive bursts of power generation which
can trigger the propagation of reaction waves through the medium. It is of both
practical importance and theoretical interest to understand how and why
detonations might be produced in various circumstances. The goal of this
exploratory, high risk project is to attempt to analyze how precisely
describable hot spot profiles, known for realistic ignition models, initiate
these reaction waves and determine their evolution. ***
