The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of technology that seeks to enhance road safety for drivers and
prevent future accidents by limiting vehicle lane departures because of
distracted or impaired drivers. This technology also reduces lane departures and
accidents in adverse weather conditions when drivers or lane-keeping
technologies fail because they cannot see the edges of the lanes. The proposed
activity may lead to more rapid adoption of advanced driver-assistance systems
and autonomous vehicles in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project
is based on the development of continuous electromagnetic (EM) signatures within
or on top of paving materials (asphalt or concrete) to complement existing
vehicle lane-keeping capabilities. The technology will enable better vehicle-to-
pavement passive communication in normal and adverse weather conditions. The EM
signature is created by embedding small amounts of metallic materials into the
existing pavement materials at specific lateral locations thereby changing the
magnetic permeability of the target location. By changing the lateral magnetic
properties in the lane, inexpensive vehicle sensors can detect their lateral
position with significant accuracy. This technology may be applied during new
roadway construction or during the repair of existing roadways and can function
in any type of weather conditions. Since improvements in vehicle safety require
knowing and maintaining the vehicle position within the lane, the innovation can
significantly reduce lane departures that lead to fatal
accidents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
