ablation deposition of technique is proposed for the growth of optical films,
towards the fabrication of low loss waveguide lasers. The proposed vapor phase
deposition technique will facilitate the formation of epitaxial ND:YAG films on
GaAs substrates, that would lead to the integrated opto electronic elements,
such as diode pumped blue green lasers and amplifiers. The two lasers employed
for the deposition process, a long pulse (100ns 1us) ? CO 2 laser and a short
pulse (15ns) excimer laser, will interact with the target of the material to be
deposited, and subsequently, with the laser generated plasma is obtained,
complete evaporation of the microscopic particulates in the plume leading to the
formation of a defect free films is expected. Extensive optical and ion probe
diagnostics of the laser generated plasma plume will be performed to aid the
optimization of the particulate free film growth process, and provide a
fundamental understanding of the dual laser ablation technique.
