This is a one-year standard award. This interdisciplinary workshop on
human/computer interaction and persons with disabilities will provide a national
forum for the exploration of the research issues and the development of a
national plan for the inclusion of the needs of persons with disabilities within
the more general human/computer interaction research framework. There has been
increased awareness of the need for including persons with disabilities in the
benefits to society of computing and communications technology. This has been
supported by the development of new technologies that provide increased
accessibility for persons with physical, sensory and learning disabilities. The
workshop will convene within the first three months of 1996 and will involve
forty university and industry researchers in human/computer interaction and
assistive technology, along with representatives of Federal agencies in a three-
day program. The outcome will be a report to the National Science Foundation. An
edited, draft report will also be presented at the ACM ASSETS Conference held in
conjunction with the ACM SIGCHI Conference in April 1996.
