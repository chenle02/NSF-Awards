The only cytosine methylase in Escherichia coli K-12, called Dcm, recognizes the
sequence 5'-CC(A/T)GG-3' and transfers a methyl group to position 5 of the
second cytosine. It appears also to be involved in a DNA repair process called
vary short patch (VSP) repair. This process corrects T/G mismatches at potential
sites of recognition for Dcm to C/G. It is believed to have evolved to eliminate
potential mutagenic effects of the deamination of 5-methyl cytosine to thymine.
Dr. Bhagwat will explore the role of Dcm in this repair process by means of
biochemical and genetic tools. He will try to answer three basic questions (1)
Does Dcm bind separate from those involved in DNA methylation? (3) Are there
other proteins in the process that genetically closely linked with Dcm?
Specifically, he will determine the sequence of the gene for Dcm (dcm) and
purify its product. He will delineate the region within the clones carrying dcm
gene that is essential for VSP repair and determine if it carries any genes
other than dcm. He will also map regions within dcm required for such repair and
correlate them with regions believed to be involved in DNA methylation. Finally,
he will test the purified Dcm for binding to synthetic DNA substrates containing
mismatches that resemble authentic substrates for VSP repair. Errors often occur
in the replication of DNA when cells divide to form daughter cells. Cells
contain machinery for the repair of these mistakes so that the occurrence of
harmful mutations which would otherwise occur are lessened. One of the systems
for this purpose is the "very short patch" repair system which the proposer is
investigating with both genetic and biochemical approaches.
