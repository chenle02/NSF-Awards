Network data, defined as one that encodes relationships between elements, is a
pervasive component of modern data analytics. The purpose of this project is to
advance our capacity to process and understand network data. The contention is
that the central difficulty in analyzing large-scale complex networks comes from
lack of structure. This loose nature contrasts with the rigidity of a closely
related construction: the metric space. If understanding networks is challenging
but understanding metric spaces is not, a route to network analysis is to
project networks into metric spaces. This motivates the technical goal of
designing methods and algorithms to implement these projections.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project builds on preliminary results combining a
projection axiom (networks that are already metric remain unchanged after
projection) and a dissimilarity-reducing axiom (smaller networks have smaller
projections) to establish existence and uniqueness results. Further explorations
are pursued in four thrusts: (1) Study of projection methods in symmetric
networks. (2) Incorporation of asymmetric networks and asymmetric quasimetric
spaces. (3) Metric representations derived from triangle inequalities written in
dioid algebras; which albeit metric in an abstract sense are very different from
regular metrics. (4) Generalizations to high order networks in which
dissimilarities are defined for tuples other than binary. Applications to
search, network comparison, and diffusion processes, complement the theoretical
research. Broader impacts come through industrial partnerships and an aggressive
educational agenda that leverages the University of Pennsylvania's institutional
commitment to play a leading role in the education of engineers that are to
exploit the opportunities afforded by the ever increasing access to data and the
ever broadening scope that networks play in our society.
