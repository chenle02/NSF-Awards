This project is a study of the classification of C*-algebras and the development
of its applications. The study of C*-algebras is a study of some special
algebraic systems. These algebraic systems are systems of square matrices,
possibly of infinite size. C*-algebras have a strong presence in many diverse
fields of science and mathematics such as dynamical systems, noncommutative
geometry, and quantum mechanics, to name just a few. C*-algebras are very
complicated mathematical objects that usually exist in infinitely many
dimensions. What "classification" does is to allow one to learn the identity and
structure of a C*-algebra from relatively small amounts of fairly simple
numerical data, analogous to the way in which fingerprints are used to identify
an individual. In applications, C*-algebras arise in many areas and often appear
in disguise, so it is of great advantage to use limited numerical data to
determine their structure. The present project aims to classify the largest
class of C*-algebras considered thus far, including algebras that are
particularly important in many applications.

The main goal of this project is to obtain a broad classification result for
amenable C*-algebras. Part of the strategy is to create new technical tools to
facilitate the interaction between the C*-algebra and its invariants. One of
these tools is an enhancement of the Basic Homotopy Lemma and another is a
K-theoretic characterization of asymptotic unitary equivalence. Another
important objective is to verify that certain commonly appearing C*-algebras
actually do belong to our classifiable class. This research will therefore
greatly simplify the way in which the theory of C*-algebras is applied. It is
worth noting one application, namely, to noncommutative homotopy theory and the
study of dynamical systems. The principal investigator will use this broad
classification theory to study a new relation among minimal homeomorphisms on a
compact metric space, a relation known as asymptotic conjugacy, and to
characterize it by means of K-theoretical data.
