The Blackmun papers, released on March 4, 2004, span the 1971-1993 terms of the
Court and are extremely important to the coding and entering of a complete and
highly reliable set of data that encompasses all the preliminary and merit votes
and associated variables from the second term of the Burger Court through the
end of the eighth term of the Rehnquist Court, and to an expansion and
successful completion of Spaeth's three-year grant (Jan 1, 2004-Dec. 31, 2006)
to include in his NSF-funded databases additional data that are key to
analyzing, modeling, and understanding the Court's agenda-setting process. This
SGER is preparatory to a proposal to compile, analyze, code, and enter the
relevant data from the papers of Justice Harry Blackmun into Spaeth's databases.
The Blackmun papers are a terra incognita; we know only that they are voluminous
and include virtually every document that Blackmun acquired in connection with
his duties as an associate justice. We do not know how well they are organized
for our purposes; if they are readily accessible; and how best to make copies
under the constraints of time and cost. On the basis of our past experience, the
costs of copying and supplying documents from the Library of Congress to
Professor Spaeth have been a major budget item in collaborative proposals. This
SGER will enable the researchers to prepare a budget that closely tracks the
costs of copying the relevant documents.
