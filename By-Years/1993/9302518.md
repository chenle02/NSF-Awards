This award supports the research of Professor Hayes to work in number theory.
Professor Hayes will be addressing Stark's conjectures in class field theory.
These conjectures are an ingenious and highly original answer to the questions
raised by the famous 12 problem of Hilbert. Professor Hayes has given
constructed proofs of the abelian Stark conjectures in function fields and he
now hopes to apply his insights to the number field case. This is research in
the field of number theory. Number theory starts with the whole numbers and
questions such as the divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among
the oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for purely
aesthetic reasons. However, within the last half century, it has become an
essential tool in developing new algorithms for computer science and new error
correcting codes for electronics.
