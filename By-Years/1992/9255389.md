Ten teachers and science educators will attend a workshop in the United Kingdom
in July, 1992 to see the Salter's Science Program in action and work with
science educators there to transcribe units for tenth grade science. The
Salter's Science Program is integrated science at all grades 6-10 and uses a
thematic approach. It is particularly intriguing because some ninth grade units
tested in some schools of the California Hundred Schools Project (NSTA Scope,
Sequence and Coordination) have been enthusiastically received. The units fit
the SSC model and may provide exemplars for materials that need to be developed.
The workshop also addresses the needs of teachers in teaching these materials.
