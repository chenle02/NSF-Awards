This I-Corps Teams project will help evaluate the commercial feasibility of
improving knowledge work with Mined Semantic Analysis (MSA) software. A recent
report on Artificial Intelligence, estimated a $2 trillion impact on knowledge
work from machine automation/augmentation. As a solution that offers highly
usable access to relevant domain knowledge, thereby enabling this economic
shift, MSA potentially addresses millions of users. Applications include 1)
Innovation management (technical document search) 2) Biomedical research
(literature search) and 3) Business management (market/competitive research.
MSA's concept based approach improves user interface visual prioritization,
rapid comprehension and facile navigation to refine search. The software enables
practical application of knowledge from billions of hours of human effort,
thereby reducing the gap between novice and expert users.

The project aims to validate product market fit of MSA software through customer
exploration and MVP prototype development. Building on work done over the past
several months, the goal of the interviews is to identify specific market
problems that the technology is capable of solving in a demonstrably better way.
The I-Corps team will test high potential areas such as: Intellectual property
research and analytics, Legal discovery, Investment/Consulting, Enterprise
search, Knowledge management, Biomedical literature and Healthcare information
search. The team's other project goal is to prototype core functionality to
align with key customer performance measures. This will include quick
experiments to gauge modes of user interaction and experience, visualization,
and some preliminary performance testing.
