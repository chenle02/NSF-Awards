The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a digital platform that transforms the way young children
perceive and engage in STEM career exploration. Factors promoting STEM
education, particularly for under-represented groups, have not been incorporated
into personalized learning plans. This technology will use artificial
intelligence to develop customized educational plans. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
I-Corps project is based on the development of the development and evaluation of
a new approach to generate recommendations by combining a model of surprise with
a model of user preference to deliver curiosity-inspiring recommendations. The
proposed technology is a digital platform that empowers students to pursue STEM
learning and careers. This project will incorporate artificial intelligence and
informal learning practices to recommend learning modules on a personalized
basis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
