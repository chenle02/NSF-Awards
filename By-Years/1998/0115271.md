With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Tennessee in Chattanooga will
acquire a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS). This equipment will
enhance research in a number of areas including a) study of reaction mixtures of
organic products; b) the study of organomercury species found in local
reservoirs and water supplies; and c) the study of the environmental fate of
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

Gas chromatograph with mass spectrometric detection (GC-MS) detection is an
extremely powerful technique used for the separation and analysis of complex
mixtures. This instrument will substantially strengthen scientific research in
the Environmental Sciences, Biology and Chemistry Departments at the University
of Tennessee in Chattanooga. It will also have a significant impact on student
involvement in research at this primarily undergraduate institution.
