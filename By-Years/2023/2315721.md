This targeted convening of experts on open science and public access will bring
together specific leading cyberinfrastructure experts to: a) explore approaches
to producing cross-platform public and open impact analytics at scale, b)
discuss open infrastructure opportunities to improve the FAIRness of usage data,
and c) identify needed steps to scaffold Americaâ€™s national infrastructure for
scholarly output impact reporting in light of the Nelson memo and the European
Open Science Cloud Core and Interoperability Framework. Workshop findings will
be documented in a report that will be distributed through public repositories.
