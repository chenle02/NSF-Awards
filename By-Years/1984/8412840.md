Many bridge decks of reinforced concrete which were constructed during the 1950
decade have been deteriorating and are now in need of repair or replacement. One
method is to replace the entire deck with precast reinforced panels which are
bonded together with an epoxy mortar. This project will investigate the physical
properties of the epoxy mortars for a range of temperatures from freezing to
high summer values to determine the behavior of the material to resist the
environmental and dynamic forces of the traffic on the bridge.
