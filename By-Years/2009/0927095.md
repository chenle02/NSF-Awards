The research objective of this BRIGE award is to apply new and existing
operations research and economic decision analysis techniques to understand
tradeoffs, both in the healthcare safety net for children and in dental disease
intervention policies. A mixed-integer programming model will be built for a
network of clinics, incorporating issues such as equity and fairness that do not
typically arise in operations research models, to quantitatively compare the
impact of increasing access to health services through government-subsidized
clinics against expanding government-subsidized insurance. The resulting co-
dependencies will be studied. Markov models will be created and analyzed to
determine optimal interventions in disease progression. A comprehensive dental
disease progression model will be built and incorporated into a cost-benefit
analysis to compare interventions for various populations, quantitatively
describing critical tradeoffs in disease prevention and treatment.

If successful, the results of this research will lead to optimization tools that
have tremendous potential to inform and shape government programs ? saving cost
and/or redirecting scarce resources to more effective programs. The research
will lead to a greater understanding of the health care safety net for children
and highlight opportunities for increased efficiencies. The disease progression
model will quantify, from a systems standpoint, the benefits of health promotion
and disease prevention as opposed to care and disease management. Research
results will be incorporated into course materials and outreach initiatives to
demonstrate the human impact potential of engineering and help attract
additional underrepresented students to engineering. The work will provide
opportunities to reduce disparities in healthcare currently experienced by
minorities as well as opportunities to use the research ? combined with the
targeted outreach ? to boost interest in engineering in the same
underrepresented groups.
