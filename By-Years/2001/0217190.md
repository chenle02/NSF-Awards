At the heart of the grant is a cutting stock problem - this is a classical
problem familiar to most researchers in operations research and has applications
in a number of continuous production applications including metals such as steel
or aluminum, paper, textiles, fiber-optic and electrical cable, and glass, to
name a few. However, the version around which the proposed research is built is
fundamentally different. The grant address the case where a company has
geographically distributed distribution points that it can stock with standard
sizes from its plants, and the customer demand for smaller sizes comes from
other geographically distributed points on a continuing basis. Second, this
demand is stochastic in nature. Third, it addresses a sustainable manufacturing
environment where the trim is not considered waste, but rather gets recycled and
has an inherent value associated with it. Fourth, the problem is not a static
one where a one-time decision has to be made. Rather, decisions need to be made
on an ongoing basis, and decisions made at one point in time have a significant
impact on decisions at later points in time. The overall objective is to find
long-run rates of replenishment for the standard sizes as well as long-run
policies for cutting these into smaller pieces so as to satisfy customer demand.
The grant will extend this basic model to consider supply chain design problems
and the analogous case for two-dimensional products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supply
chain problems are critical for most industries. While there has been much
research into optimizing supply chains, most research considers only a small
part of the supply chain. This grant is unique in that it provides optimal
policies for the design and operations of a supply chain under uncertainty.
Since it addresses one-dimensional and two-dimensional products it will have
applications to many industrial problems.
