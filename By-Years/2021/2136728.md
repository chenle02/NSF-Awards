The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I
project will be to mitigate healthcare costs and challenges associated with the
nation's growing aging population. The outcome of this project will be a system
that enables holistic, accurate, and faster monitoring of elderly people that
will 1) improve quality of life and health of senior citizens, 2) address the
future nursing shortage, particularly in the geriatric field, and 3) reduce
healthcare costs. The proposed technology can impact a wide range of public
health applications that require continuous, non-intrusive health
monitoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR)
Phase I project applies real-time computer vision and sensor fusion processing
for real-time continuous monitoring and analysis of health-related activities.
In addition, this project takes an essential step beyond current solutions by
analyzing seniors' group behavior and interactions with objects to determine
whether they suffer from loneliness, behavioral disorders, or confusion states.
This project utilizes multiple artificial intelligence algorithms to maximize
the discriminative power to understand human micro-body motions and thereby
create a training framework for personalized behavioral understanding and
monitoring. It also proposes an innovative solution to leverage the results of
computer vision as attention feedback to thermal sensors to enhance the accuracy
and robustness of thermal processing against temperature variations.
Furthermore, the project offers an integrative edge-based Internet of Things
solution to protect citizens' privacy while providing real-time continuous
feedback to responsible personnel. The proposed system offers a novel user
experience while protecting personally identifiable
information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
