This research will explore the use of single-sided bulk- silicon process
technology for the realization of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). Efforts
on fundamental materials characterization, the development of new microstructure
formation techniques, and the development of generic modeling and simulation
capabilities for MEMS will be conducted. Research results will be applied in the
fabrication of two- and three-dimensional devices, including electrostatically
driven linear micromotors, laterally driven resonant microstructures, and
microvalves. One device that will be considered is a fully integrated scanning
thermal profilometer (STP) that operates using laterally driven resonant
structures fabricated from bulk silicon. The STP will incorporate an integrated
polysilicon metal thermocouple for temperature measurement, a submicron silicon
tip supporting the thermocouple, electrostatic drive mechanisms, and a chip-
level package realized by stacking multiple silicon levels to protect the STP
from particulates and physical damage. The technology resulting from this
research should complement surface micromachining techniques to extend the field
of MEMS and realize new structures.
