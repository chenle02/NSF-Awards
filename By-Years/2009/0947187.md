Swanson&lt;br/&gt;0947187&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides $181,586 in
NSF funding over 12 months to acquire three major electron microprobe
components; the energy dispersive analytical spectrometer (EDS), the Tracor
Northern spectrometer automation system and the PAC X-ray counting electronics
which all need replacing on the institution?s EMP. This upgraded instrument will
be used for petrologic studies and analyzing archaeological materials.
Ultramafic rocks from the Blue Ridge (southern Appalachian Orogen) will be
assessed for origin. The PIs will also use the instrument to study fin-grained
anhydrites from the Redoubt Volcano, granitic rocks from western North Carolina,
crustal melts from South America, hydrous and volatile phases, planetary
materials, and metasomatic fluids in the Earth?s mantle. Additionally, the
upgrade EMP will be used for understanding mineral composition, zoning and phase
proportions. Institutional and outside collaborators will also be analytically-
supported. This requested equipment is needed to keep the facility up and
running. Historically, the EMP lab has led to approximately 100 research papers,
numerous abstracts and more than 30 M.S. theses and Ph.D. dissertations. The EMP
facility supports Geology and Chemistry departments at UGA and other geoscience
departments in the Southeast. A new initiative outlined in the proposal is to
use the facility to support wider participation by students at 4-year
institutions in the Southeast who do not have on-campus access to a microprobe
facility. The Department of Geology provides a service contract for this
instrument and supports a full-time Electron Microprobe Laboratory Coordinator.
The technician works with the instrument day-to-day and provides scheduling and
training for users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***
