Lattice-mismatched GaInAs and A InAs layers will be grown on InP and GaAs
substrates by MBE and MOCVD. Different-density misfit dislocations will be
intentionally introduced. Samples will be nondestructively characterized by the
x-ray rocking curve technique and the rocking curve topography technique, and
cleaned and cleaved. Thin metal film Ohmic or Schottky contacts will be formed
and I-V or C-V characteristics will be studied. Expected results are (l)
Schottky barrier heights for the ternary epilayer-substrate junction as a
function of the misfit dislocation density, (2) effects of the misfit
dislocations in the electrical characteristics for p-i-n and n-n+-n
heterostructures, (3) the critical thickness of the ternary epilayer as a
function of the misfit, and (4) assessment of the nondestructive x-ray technique
in measurements of the misfit dislocations. This proposed project is expected to
improve the present understanding of the effects of the misfit dislocations in
device performance and provide further and accurate data on the Schottky barrier
heights for metal-ternary and ternary-substrate contacts.
