ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;21 May 2012&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
1230974&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Oregon State University&lt;br/&gt;PI: D.
Bailey&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests three Shipboard Scientific
Support Equipment (SSSE) items for Oregon State University?s R/V OCEANUS; namely
Asset Management Software, Electronic Charting System (ECS) enhancements, and a
new cable lubricating system. These items will improve navigational safety,
enhance utility to science, and improve the overall maintenance and operational
efficiency of the vessel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The R/V OCEANUS
supports federally-funded scientific research in the Pacific in order to expand
human knowledge of the ocean environment. During operations, the vessel
routinely exposes graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography.
Pubic outreach is also achieved through real-time satellite connectivity from
ship to shore, and open house events. The OCEANUS is scheduled to complete one
hundred and thirty four (134) NSF sponsored days in 2012.
