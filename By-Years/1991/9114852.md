The research work will examine the mechanics of superplastic deformation with
the intent of providing broadly applicable flow rules for use in the modeling of
the superplastic forming process. Such a model can be used to devise processing
methods which increase the productivity of the superplastic forming process and
increase its range of application. The research study is a comprehensive one,
including aspects of strain-rate path effects, anisotropy, grain coarsening,
cavitation and interfacial friction modeling. The project involves verification
of the research models in laboratory tests and in tests on production equipment
in industry. Superplastic forming is used to shape high performance alloys in
aerospace application and will find increased use in its applications to the
forming of titanium aluminides and other, "next generation" aerospace materials.
Better understanding of the behavior of materials during superplastic forming
will allow the fabrication of high performance parts at lower cost and with
higher reliability.
