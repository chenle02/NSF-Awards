Proposal #: 93-21397 The PI requests funding to purchase shipboard
instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research. The instruments will be used
aboard the R/V GYRE, a 172 foot vessel, which is owned and operated by the
University. Instrumentation requested includes computer hardware for the
shipboard computer system, an automated dissolved oxygen titration system, and a
gyrocompass interface board for the ADCP. The instrumentation requested is
required for support of NSF-funded cruises aboard the GYRE during 1994 and will
enhance the scientific capability of the vessel in the future.
