This proposal requests SBIR Phase II support to further develop Theseus, an
unmanned aircraft for very high-altitude scientific missions. During Phase II,
the PI proposes the following activities: (1) assemble a scientific advisory
group; (2) complete the design and construct an engineering mock-up of a
multispecies sampling payload; (3) validate the proposed powerplant through
subscale tests; (4) verify weight projections for cryogenic fuel tanks; (5)
develop methods to reduce structural fabrication costs by 25%; and (6) complete
a preliminary design.
