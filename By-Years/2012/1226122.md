TECHNICAL AND NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:

This award provides partial travel support for graduate students to attend the
National Graduate Research Polymer Conference to be held on May 21-24, 2012, at
Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.

The conference will offer the opportunity to about 200 students, as well as
professors, researchers, and industry representatives from across the country to
hear the latest research in the interdisciplinary polymer science and
engineering field. There will be four plenary talks by distinguished leaders in
the field. Specific symposia have been organized on bio-related polymers,
energy-related materials, nanostructured materials, photonics and electronics,
surfaces and interfaces, self-assembling polymers, as well as on structure,
characterization, theory, and processing.

The major broader impact of this conference is the unique opportunity for the
graduate students to stay current with the state-of-the-art research across the
polymer frontiers and to promote fruitful interactions among all participants.
Moreover, the conference will offer a panel discussion on career options for
polymer/materials students, as well as a career fair to promote networking with
company representatives.
