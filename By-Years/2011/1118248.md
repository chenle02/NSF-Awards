Frederick D. Lewis, George C. Schatz, Michael R. Wasielewski (all at
Northwestern University), Torsten Fiebig (Boston College) and Alexander L. Burin
(Tulane University) are jointly supported for research into the electronic
structure of DNA. More specific objectives include the investigation of the
nuclear and electronic structure of short, well-defined duplex base pair domains
in both the ground and electronically excited states; and investigation of the
structural and electronic changes which occur upon the oxidation or reduction of
duplex domains. The team will study short stable base pair domains in custom-
designed hairpin and dumbbell structures. A wide range of state-of-the-art time-
resolved spectroscopic, computational, and structural techniques will be used to
probe how the structural changes within DNA are coupled to the properties of
excited and ion states within it. Experimental approaches include molecular
design and synthesis, spectroscopy, time-resolved transient absorption
spectroscopy, time-resolved EPR spectroscopy, molecular dynamics, time-resolved
circular dichroism, and electronic structure calculations. David Tiede (Argonne
National Laboratory) will also collaborate with the team and bring expertise in
time-resolved diffraction techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The structural and
functional integrity of DNA is critical to its role in biology, so that this
project will provide fundamental information on how light and chemical agents
introduce reactive sites within DNA, which change its structure and potentially
alter its function. The anticipated outcomes of this collaboration include
elucidation of the properties of neutral and ionized short DNA base-pair
domains, training of undergraduate and graduate students in an important
interdisciplinary area, and providing a model for interlocking collaboration
among investigators with varying experience and in different research
environments. This project is supported by the Collaborative Research in
Chemistry Program.&lt;br/&gt;
