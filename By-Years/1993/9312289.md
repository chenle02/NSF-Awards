The Antarctic pack ice seals are represented by four species, Crabeater, Lobodon
carcinophagus; Weddell, Leptonychotes weddellii; Leopard, Hydruga leptonyx; and
Ross, Omatophoca rossii. These species could be potentially affected by human
related environmental impacts that are beginning to occur within the Antarctic
ecosystem. The impact that such disturbances as global warming, ozone depletion,
and commercial fisheries, could have on the ecology and population dynamics of
these species is unknown. Because of their dependence upon the pack ice
ecosystem, it has been hypothesized that this group could be particularly
vulnerable to slight changes that would be caused by such events. Census data,
from very limited surveys, in the early 1980's, have shown that the crabeater
seal population may have declined in certain areas of the Antarctic in recent
decades. This species is currently being viewed as an indicator of fisheries
impact. However, very little is known about the total distribution, abundance
and general ecology of this species around the Antarctic continent. Thus, it is
difficult to properly interpret local changes that may be observed from
investigations. This workshop will produce an integrated study document that
will prioritize topics of research on these marine mammals. The workshop will
encourage cooperation and sharing of data, logistic resources, and scientific
expertise.
