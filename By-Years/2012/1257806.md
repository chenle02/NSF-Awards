The advent of methods for economically sequencing entire genomes has ushered in
the field of population genomics. Although whole-genome sequencing harbors the
potential to yield estimates of population-genetic parameters with unprecedented
accuracy, the methods essential to the analysis of data have lagged behind
greatly. The proposed work will develop a general statistical framework for the
analysis of population-genomic data. The general strategy is to derive and
computationally validate a set of efficient estimators for population-genetic
parameters at three levels: individual genomes; multiple individuals within
populations; and multiple populations. Specific subprojects include the
measurement of patterns of variation and covariation among nucleotide sites,
levels of population subdivision, and the development of novel methods to
facilitate genome assembly and the refinement of genetic maps. Considerable
emphasis will be focused on the development of efficient estimation algorithms
for use by the genomics research community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These methods
will be widely used in both applied and basic research. Special attention will
be devoted to identifying optimal sampling strategies, including the tradeoffs
between depth of sequence coverage per individual and numbers of individuals,
and between length, number, and quality of reads. As a consequence, the
resultant methods should enable investigators to harvest the maximum possible
information from their existing data sets, while also promoting the future
design strategies to maximize informational yield per unit sampling and
sequencing effort. The software to be developed will be permanently housed and
freely available at the National Center for Genome Analysis Support, and
workshops will be held to assist the user community in the implementation of
such tools. The Plant Genome Research Project is co-funding this research.
