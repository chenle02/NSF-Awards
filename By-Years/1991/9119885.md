The physiology, behavior, and survival of Weddell seals in their first year of
life is the subject of this scientific investigation. For Weddell seals, this
period encompasses the brief period of maternal dependence (6 weeks),
development of swimming and diving abilities and dispersal from natal colonies
as shore-fast ice turns to pack ice and open water. It is the least known aspect
of the life cycle of any mammal and likely to be the most important period
affecting their survival to adulthood and eventual reproductive success. The
following areas will be emphasized: 1) physical and physiological changes
related to maternal investment, weaning, and development of diving abilities; 2)
the ontogeny of diving behavior and dispersal of pups in their first year using
satellite telemetry. 3) comparative study of diving and movements by older
juveniles (1-2 years old) using satellite telemetry. 4) correlative study of the
maternal, physical, physiological and behavioral factors that affect the
movements, condition possibly the survival of pups in their first year of life;
and 5) continued measurement of population size, survival rates and productivity
of Weddell seals in McMurdo Sound as a continued long term study of their
population dynamics and context for interpreting interannual variation in
condition or behavior of juveniles.
