This award will provide partial support for a Workshop on Research Opportunities
in High Temperature Superconductors in Copper Mountain, Colorado. There are now
so many directions to follow in high temperature superconducting research, that
some organization of the research effort is necessary to take advantage of the
new discoveries of the past year.
