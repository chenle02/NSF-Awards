This study will continue analysis of fold development in single layers by use
of computer modelling and by the study of natural folds. The aim is to better
understand folding processes in non-linear materials, in layers oriented oblique
to the principal bulk strain directions, and in layers that undergo non- coaxial
strain. Finite element models will be used to study variations in shape and
strain distribution in symmetrical folds as functions of viscosity contrast,
power-law exponent, initial shape, and initial wavelength of the layers. A
comparison will be made between the development of symmetrical folds &amp; that
of asymmetrical folds that develop either in simple shear or in oblique layers
subjected to pure shear. Criteria will be developed, based on fold shape and
strain, that will give information on bulk deformation paths in rocks. Natural
folds will be studied for arc length vs. thickness distribution, fold shape, and
strain pattern. These data from natural folds will be compared with the
experimental data in order to gain insight on their rheology during deformation.
The results of this study will greatly improve our understanding of rock
behavior during tectonic folding.
