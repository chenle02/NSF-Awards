This SMALL GRANT FOR EXPLORATORY RESEARCH project is to study the role of "spin"
in polymers. The idea is that long chain molecules may give rise to stresses
that are different than when the length is zero. This novel idea is untested as
such but is related to the concept of "plastic spin" in metals.
