This research program will lead to an improved mathematical model for creep and
shrinkage of concrete, its probabilistic aspects, and its effects in structures.
Constitutive relation, which takes into account strain-softening due to
fracturing at variable humidity and stress-dependence of shrinkage and thermal
expansion coefficients, will be developed. Creep tests at various moisture
conditions and high temperatures will be conducted with six-inch cylinders in a
unique, large triaxial-torsional testing machine with temperature control. Also
tested will be creep of small hollow cylinders under triaxial-torsional load in
which fracturing due to humidity variations is suppressed by prestress. Effects
of cracking on the overall drying diffusivity of concrete will also be measured.
Numerical algorithms for step-by-step finite element analysis will be formulated
and verified numerically, and certain applications in structural analysis will
be demonstrated.
