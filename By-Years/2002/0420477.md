This project, supporting collaboration among co-located and remote experts
requiring interactive ultra-high-resolution imagery, aims at developing a high-
end visualization "LambdaVision" multipanel display as a means to advance both
scientific research and public safety as validated by users in various
disciplines and training exercises in disaster response. LambdaVision will
target applications requiring extremely high data rates and very large, high-
resolution images, such as earth surface imagery. Applications include
scientific simulations and disaster response. Plans included the development of
smaller versions for use in the classroom and in the field. The following
research applications will use the system:&lt;br/&gt;Geoscience Research ,The US
Geological Survey, Integrated Ocean Drilling Program&lt;br/&gt;US National
Lacustrine Core Repository, Computer Science Research in Visualization, Advanced
Networking Middleware, and Multi-User Collaboration ,Scalable Adaptive
Graphics,Advanced Networking Middleware,Collaborative Methods for Display-Rich
Environments&lt;br/&gt;Research Instrumentation Development, LambdaVision and
Lambda Table Architecture LambdaVision and Lambda Tabel Seamless Display
Technology ,LambdaTable Tracking System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: PIs
have a history of developing technology that domain scientists use. The work
includes designing systems suitable for use in the field, classroom, and
lab.&lt;br/&gt;
