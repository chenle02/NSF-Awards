The proposed projects that will benefit from a high performance parallel
computer are concerned with the molecular mechanisms of excitability in nerve,
muscle, and other cells. Dr. Anthony Auerbach will study the kinetic properties
of single ion channel currents elicited by the neurotransmitters acetylcholine
or glutamate. Dr. Donald Faber will carry out computer modeling of synaptic
currents in conjunction with experimental studies of central glycinergic
synapses. Dr. Frederick Sachs will study the structure and dynamics of
mechanosensitive ion channels as seen by high resolution image processing of
membrane patches. A long term goal of these studies is to understand the
molecular processes by which cells regulate ionic fluxes in response to
environmental stimuli such as the presence of neurotransmitter molecules of
membrane tension. They all require computationally- intense algorithms include
matrix operations, Monte Carlo simulations, and three dimensional image
processing (deconvolution and tomographic reconstruction). Acquisition of a
parallel computer capable of sustaining at least 150 MFLOPS will significantly
expedite these calculations.
