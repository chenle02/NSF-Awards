This project develops methods to scale data mining tasks to large, inherently
distributed databases. Meta-learning computes base classifiers by applying
learning programs in parallel to database partitions, and then integrates them
by another learning process outputting a `meta-classifier`. Meta-learning the
correlations of the base classifiers boosts overall predictive accuracy.
Efficiency is achieved by parallel processing and reduced serial time per
learning process. Meta-learning is scalable by data reduction and parallel
processing in hierarchical organizations. We explore, analyze and validate a
number of approaches to meta-learning, and deliver demonstrable systems allowing
other researchers to directly utilize our results. We develop field tests of the
resultant technology by launching `learning agents` over the internet and
combine their collective knowledge by `meta-learning agents`. Many defense and
commercial applications will benefit from learning new knowledge by integrating
and analyzing very large amounts of widely distributed data. One organization
working collaboratively on this project is the Financial Services Technology
Consortium. The FSTC has defined a realistic application amenable to meta-
learning techniques and are providing real datasets and learning tasks. The
project participants will demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach for
fraud detection of electronic transactions in electronic commerce applications
of the internet.
