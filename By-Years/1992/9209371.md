This research is to develop a scientific basis for analyzing and optimizing
fixture configurations in a manner that allows for the automated design of
fixtures during computer aided process planning. The uniqueness of the approach
is the inclusion of clamping force and the resulting deformation into the
optimization process. This will be accomplished by abstracting the workpiece
geometry into a finite element model of the part and fixture to analyze both the
components as they are subjected to clamping forces. The final stage will be the
optimization of the configuration of the fixture on the basis of an optimization
model that is to be researched and developed as part of this project. Designing
of fixtures to hold the workpiece during processing is a critical aspect of
process planning and a function that is still carried out on an empirical basis.
A scientific approach will enable the automation of this process while improving
the efficiency of the manufacturing sector.
