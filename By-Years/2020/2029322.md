In response to the growing COVID-19 pandemic, the Molecular Sciences Software
Institute (MolSSI) will leverage its position as a neutral commodity resource to
help the global computational molecular sciences community quickly provide their
scientific data and expertise to address the COVID-19 crisis. The MolSSI is
jointly supported by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure and the
Divisions of Chemistry and Materials Research. The centerpieces of this
engagement will be (1) a centralized repository for simulation-related data
targeting the virus and host proteins and potential pharmaceuticals, and (2) a
select set of MolSSI Software Seed Fellowships for Ph.D. students and postdocs
targeting COVID-19 related software tools that operate on the data developed in
the repository. These two components will enable the biomolecular simulation
community to share and utilize key data and other resources to help identify the
structural and dynamic characteristics of the host-virus complex to generate
potential leads for therapeutics. Although this project is intended to address
the acute COVID-19 crisis, in the near term, it also will impact research
communities and the next generation of computational molecular scientists in the
confrontation and proactive resolution of future world
problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MolSSI will create and curate a large-scale
repository containing: simulation input files (structures, configurations,
scripts, Jupyter notebooks) in an organized structure; MD trajectories, analysis
tools, and ready models for drug discovery; pointers to preprint servers such as
arXiv, bioRxiv, and ChemRxiv on biomolecular simulation research in regards
SARS-CoV-2; and DOI services that create citable data. In addition, it will
engage the molecular sciences community through a set of Software Fellowships
for graduate student and postdocs to carry out software development, such as
large-scale MD simulations, design of drug discovery tools such as docking,
machine learning for small molecule toxicity predictions, and methods for
determining whether new drugs are bioavailable or can be synthesized.
Collectively, these resources will speed the identification and development of
leads for antiviral drugs, analyzing structural effects of genetic variation in
the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and inhibitors that can disrupt protein-protein
interactions to viral entry into cells and adherence to surfaces that cause
disease spread.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is being funded by the CARES Act
supplemental funds allocated to CISE and MPS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
