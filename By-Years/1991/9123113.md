This award provides funds to purchase plant growth chambers to aid plant
biology research on the campus of University of California at Davis. This is
part of the UCD plan to totally upgrade their obsolete plant growth facilities,
to which UCD committed substantial resources. Research areas of the UCD faculty
members who are users of the plant growth facilities range from plant cell and
molecular biology, developmental biology, population genetics and evolution,
plant physiology, environmental biology and plant- microbe interactions. The new
facilities will also enhance graduate student training in the area of plant
biology at UCD.
