9526231 Schwartz The proposed research integrates synthesis, microstructural
characterization, and superconducting properties characterization to explore the
critical influence of a metallic interface on the HgBa2Can-1CunOx system, the
superconducting oxide system with highest critical temperature yet achieved. The
project objectives include identifying chemically compatible metallic
substrates, understanding and controlling interfacial reactions, understanding
the influencing factors for microstructural development of the superconducting
and competing non- superconducting phases (including texture), and understanding
the microstructure/superconducting properties relationships, including flux
pinning and weak links. Synthesis studies will employ a two-zone assembly that
allows for independent control of the mercury pressure and the annealing
temperature. Tapes will be cast on metallic substrates. Thermal processing,
atmosphere, stoichiometry, and substrate metal are important variables. The
samples will be characterized using a variety of techniques. %%% The project
addresses the underlying scientific issues for applications of the HgBa2Can-1
CunOx superconducting oxides. A deeper understanding of the relationships
between metallic interfaces, microstructure, and properties of high temperature
superconductors will result. ***
