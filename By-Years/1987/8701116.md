The proposed research involves studies on the development and structure of
leaves of selected C3 and C4 plants, utilizing bright.field, phase and electron
microscopy. The developmental and structural studies are complemented by
experimental studies aimed at determining: 1) the pathways followed by
photoassimilates in immature (sink) and mature (source) leaves; 2) the sites of
phloem unloading in sink leaves and of phloem loading in source leaves; and 3)
the pathways followed by water and solutes entering the leaf apoplast in the
transpiration stream in leaves at different stages of development. The
experimental studies include: plasmolytic studies aimed at determining the
solute concentrations of various cells of the leaf; microautoradiographic
studies aimed at determining pathways followed by .1.4C.sucrose and .1.4C.assimi
lates in leaves; ATPase localization studies aimed at determining the sites of
active phloem unloading or loading; free.space marker studies aimed at
determining the pathways followed by water and solutes entering the leaf
apoplast in the transpiration stream; and whole leaf autoradiographic studies
aimed at following patterns of sink.to.source conversion and water movement in
developing leaves. These studies will provide a greater understanding of the
structural changes of leaf development related to sink.to.source transition in
leaves, and of the way in which substances manufactured in the leaf are loaded
into the food conducting cells of the leaf veins for export from the plant.
