Funds are requested for purchasing a multinuclear 500 MHz nuclear magnetic
resonance spectrometer to be shared by twelve research groups in various
biochemical, biological and chemical research projects. These users represent
various departments on campus (Biochemistry and Biophysics, Chemistry,
Agricultural Chemistry, and Pharmacy), making the requested instrument a truly
interdisciplinary resource. The research groups are divided into two groups: (1)
Major Users (six) who have research projects that require a commitment of
instrument time on a 500 MHz spectrometer to study aspects of solution-state
dynamics, kinetics and /or structure function relationships of biologically
interesting molecules; (2) Minor Users (six) who have research projects in which
NMR spectroscopy is not a primary research tool, but can be used to provided
valuable data and insight that is not easily obtainable by other methods. The
projects that require this new instrumentation include: structural and dynamics
studies of DNA-binding proteins and their interactions with DNA; determining the
solution structures of DNA uracil glycosylase, its inhibitor, and the enzyme-
inhibitor complex; detailed structural studies of marine natural products and
antibiotics; identifying specific sites of covalent modification of enzymes by
highly specific inactivators; and using oxygen isotope- induced carbon resonance
frequency shifts to study the extent of repair in aging proteins. The 500 MHz
instrument requested in this proposal will complement the existing equipment in
the Departments of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Chemistry, Agricultural
Chemistry, and Pharmacy. As a physical method used to characterize molecular
structure and dynamics, NMR spectroscopy is uniquely suited for the detailed
study of biomacromolecules. The availability of a 500 MHz spectrometer at OSU,
as well as the expertise to train users in the collection and analysis of NMR
data, represents an important resource and opport unity for researchers to
pursue an exciting, state-of-the-art method vital to biophysical research.
