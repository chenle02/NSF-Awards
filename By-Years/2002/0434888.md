Proposal Number: 0434888&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Travel Support for Second
Bertinoro Workshop on Future of Distributed Computing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI:
Lorenzo Alvisi&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will focus
on cross-pollination of research in distributed computing, fault-tolerance, and
security with the goal of identifying the conceptual and practical foundations
of a new generation of reliable and secure distributed systems. Invited talks
from outstanding researchers will set the theme for the workshop, followed by
reports of current research activities and directions. The workshop will involve
students as well as researchers well-established in these fields. To encourage
reporting of preliminary results without prejeducing their publication in
established journals, no published proceedings are planned, but accepted
position papers will be available on the Internet. The workshop is not expected
to lead to specific new programs at NSF but rather to generate research
collaborations that will be better able to respond to existing NSF programs and
more generally to critical national needs in these areas&lt;br/&gt;
