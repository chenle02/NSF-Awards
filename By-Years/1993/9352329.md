9352329 Alexander The University of Mississippi's Department of Mathematics is
implementing a new calculus curriculum, Project CALC (Calculus As a Laboratory
Course). The University is the first comprehensive public university utilizing
materials and methods of Project CALC, developed and first implemented at Duke
University. After extensive review of its mathematics curriculum, the Department
selected Project CALC to test as an alternative curriculum and teaching strategy
in the undergraduate curriculum. Project CALC is an innovative calculus program
which emphasizes more applications, numerical and graphical techniques,
modeling, use of current technology, and collaborative learning. After the
initial one year trial period, the Department is pursuing implementation of
Project CALC in all of its calculus sections. The objectives of this project
are: 1) to enable continuation of a phased implementation of Project CALC at the
University of Mississippi, 2) to refine the materials and implementation
strategy where necessary to better suit the environment at a comprehensive state
university, 3) to afford students an opportunity to have an innovative and
exciting new learning experience; especially underrepresented minorities, for
whom the strategies of Project CALC seem to be particularly successful, and 4)
to share with the broader mathematical community experiences in order to
facilitate calculus reform in environments similar to the University of
Mississippi. This project ties in closely with the Mississippi Alliance for
Minority Participation. ***
