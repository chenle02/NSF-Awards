9526175 Hall This research involves a continuation of the wide-ranging study of
the reactions of electron-rich olefins with electron-poor olefins to form a
variety of small molecules and polymers by "charge-transfer polymerization." The
fundamentals of these processes are being worked out by variations in monomer
structure, solvent, concentration and temperature. In addition to these
parameters, the effect of the complexation of the electron-poor monomer with
Lewis acids will be studied in each system. A wide variety of industrially
important monomers will be examined from this point of view. %%% This research
aims to simplify and control thermal and direct photochemical polymerizations in
order to optimize polymerization processes and polymer properties. The
importance of this research lies in both expanding fundamental information of
thermal and photochemical cycloadditions and polymerizations as well as in
various practical aspects. ***
