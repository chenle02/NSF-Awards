This project supports participation by early career mathematicians from US
universities in an International Conference on Sequences and Codes. It is
organized by Nigel Boston (Wisconsin), Robert Calderbank (Princeton) and
Jonathan Jedwab (Simon Fraser University), and will take place July 17-21, 2006
in Vancouver, Canada. More information is available on the web at

This conference will contribute to the development of a core of mathematical
scientists armed with powerful computational and analytical tools who are
excited about applying mathematics in an interdisciplinary context. One example
of applications impact is the value of algebraic and combinatorial structures
such as Clifford algebras to cross layer design of multiple antenna wireless
communication systems. The value of engaging the mathematical sciences community
is to realize the promise of multiple antenna systems without exceeding the
signal processing complexity of single antenna systems. Another example comes
from the emerging area of multiple antenna radar, where the design of the
waveform and the subsequent processing of the return determine the ability of
the radar to discriminate targets from clutter, to discriminate closely spaced
targets, and to detect small targets in complex scenes. All these are critical
operational issues.

The conference will increase the pool of early career mathematicians who
appreciate the power of mathematics and the important role that it plays in
engineering disciplines. It will promote interdisciplinary exploration and
breadth, and help early career mathematicians flourish in the different cultures
associated with the different academic disciplines. This ability to bridge
different worlds is a quality that is increasingly important to success in both
academic and non-academic careers.The emphasis is on the synergy between theory
and application, since information theory and coding are subjects that advance
by discovering new applications. The conference will feature recent examples
where this synergy is present, specifically space-time codes for wireless
communication and Clifford algebras, quantum information theory and quantum
error correcting codes, radar and sequence design. The evolving applications
context helps to define new areas of theory and provides measures for what is
considered interesting. The development of a fundamental theory grounded in
specific examples often illuminates the right abstraction, one that becomes a
new primitive as theory and practice evolve together. When this synergy is not
present there is always a risk that the theory will become detached from its
original applications context and lose relevance.
