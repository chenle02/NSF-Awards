Lasers provide the chemist with the means of carrying out high resolution, high
sensitivity experiments related to, for example, solution chemistry,
spectroscopy, molecular dynamics, and biophysical chemistry. If laser
instrumentation is configured as a central facility, the research of a group of
first-rate investigators can be enhanced. The Department of Chemistry at Cornell
University will use this award co-recommended by the Chemical Instrumentation
Program, the Biological Instrumentation Program, and the Atmospheric Chemistry
Program to aid in the acquisition of a series of lasers. The lasers will provide
a high-resolution continuous wave (cw) system, a nanosecond facility, and a
picosecond facility. The general areas of chemical and biophysical research that
will be enhanced by the acquisition and shared use of the instrumentation
include: 1) Study of reactions in solutions and the detailed interactions of a
solute with a solvent 2) Study of the relationships between Raman scattering,
resonance fluorescence, and normal absorption spectra. 3) Study of molecular
dynamics in gas-phase interactions 4) Biophysical studies using time-correlated
single photon counting
