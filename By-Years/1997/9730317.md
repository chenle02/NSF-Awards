Douglas Dorset is jointly supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division and the Polymers
Program in Division of Materials Research to continue his studies of direct
methods for electron crystallography. The overall thrust of the research program
is to continue the application of direct phasing methods to electron
crystallography. Specific goals of the current project are: 1) to improve
methods for collecting more accurate electron diffraction intensity data; 2) to
optimize the use of direct methods for handling undersampled reciprocal
lattices; and 3) to develop refinement procedures which circumvent the
difficulties associated with multiple scattering problems. Although the proposal
is primarily focused on methodology development, various applications are also
proposed on small organic systems such as triphenylene, TCNQ, pyrene,
quaterrylene and anthanthrene, and polymeric systems such as whisker crystals of
p-oxybenzoate, spider drag line silk, and oriented films of
poly(tetrafluoroethylene). X-ray diffraction has had a tremendous impact on the
fields of Chemistry and Material Science. It provides a direct experimental
probe of molecular structure at the atomistic level. However, for many important
organic compounds, only small crystals can be grown that are unsuitable for
investigation by X-ray diffraction. Electron crystallography presents a powerful
alternative for studying such compounds providing that a number of technical
difficulties can be overcome. Dorset's work in this area is directed at
improving this alternative to conventional X-ray crystallography to the point
where it is precise and relatively easy to use.
