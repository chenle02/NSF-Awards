Body temperature rises as a result of exercise in a running wheel during the
active period of the daily cycle in female rats. During their inactive period,
in which they do not exercise, body temperature is elevated above what it would
have been if they had no previous exercise bout. Dr. Satinoff will study the
parameters of this phenomenon of post-exercise elevated body temperature.
Experiments will be aimed at determiming : 1. whether males display this
phenomenon as well as females, 2. what duration of exercise is critical and 3.
what temporal characteristcs of the exercise are important. This research will
contribute to knowledge about how exercise affects body temperature regulation
in both immediate and longterm time frames.
