This project, in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organo- metallic Chemistry
Program, involves an investigation of the basic reactivity patterns of
decaborane and derivatives, and of cyclopolymerization reactions of diallyl
derivatives of various nonmetal elements. Of especial interest in the former
area are transition metal derivatives of decaborane that might serve as
precursors for metal borides, in addition to new compounds of various
metalloids. In the latter area, ring opening reactions at the nonmetal center
will lead to functional groups that can be used to specifically tailor the
polymer for various applications. %%% The immediate goal of this project is to
further advance our fundamental knowledge of chemical reactivities. Ultimately,
it is such knowledge that will allow the development of new and advanced
materials.
