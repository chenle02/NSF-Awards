This proposal will increase our understanding of how the brain operates by
revealing fundamental principles of information processing by the cerebral
cortex, which is widely held to be the site of human conscious experience.
Brains cannot be understood until their fundamental processing unit, the
cortical column, is understood using the type of circuit level analysis
proposed. In addition, the interdisciplinary nature of the proposal will offer a
unique opportunity to train young undergraduate students in both neuroscience
and mathematics, disciplines that increasingly are synergistic in neuroscience.
Women and minority undergraduate students will be recruited to participate in
the research and materials for educators of middle and high school students will
be developed that deal with the neuroscience of our
senses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cognitive functions such as thinking, perceiving
and remembering, rely on the coordinated activity of neurons in the cerebral
cortex. The cortical column is believed to be the functional unit of the cortex,
thus understanding its circuitry and function is crucial to determine how the
cortex works. The cortical column is composed of 6 interconnected layers, each
with distinct function and connections. The goal of this application is to
understand the role of this layered structure in cortical information
processing. Primary visual cortex (V1) will serve as the model system because
its anatomy and functional properties are better known than those of any other
cortical area. Electrode arrays will be used to record simultaneously across all
layers the responses of populations of neurons in V1 to visual stimuli that are
known to drive this area of cortex. This approach will reveal how the different
layers of V1 are activated in time and space by different kinds of visual
stimuli. These methods will also allow an examination of the flow of visual
information processing across layers of the cortex, a fundamental but heretofore
understudied question. Finally, mathematical modeling will be used to understand
how complex interactions between connections within a cortical column compute
the neuronal responses specific to each layer.
