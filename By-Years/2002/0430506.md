Numerical simulations of chemical processes are performed to improve the ability
to extract physical parameters like density and temperature from airglow and
radar observations of the upper atmosphere. These simulations are based upon
quantum mechanical principles and include physically realistic elastic and
inelastic collision characterizations, as well as physically realistic
descriptions of reactant velocity distributions. The derived cross-sections and
quenching rates improve upon extant values that continue to defy accurate
laboratory determinations, and are applicable to a broad range of research in
planetary and cometary atmospheres, laser design, and plasma physics
simulations. Particular emphasis is placed on Oxygen (O), Hydrogen (H),
metastable O(1D), and He (Helium) reactions germane to terrestrial aeronomy.
