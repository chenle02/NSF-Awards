This equipment award will allow the establishment of a computer graphics
facility to support research in the computer aided design and analysis of
electric power distribution systems. Four projects will use the equipment, they
involve; load modelling, feeder reconfiguration, harmonic propagation and
applications of artificial intelligence to power systems. These projects are
primarily related to the distribution automation system which has caused many
new general problems to be investigated. The projects are being sponsored by the
newly established Electric Power Research Center (EPRC) at N.C. State which is
an organization supported by electric power industry companies to promote basic
and applied research. The equipment being requested includes a graphics
workstation, digitizing board, color plotter and also hardware and software for
the existing MICROVAX configuration. The proposed equipment will supplement a
DEC MICROVAX-II and ETHERNET interfacing equipment already in place. This
additional graphics capability will be used to facilitate the manipulation of
large distribution system data bases and to represent results in a more
comprehensive fashion.
