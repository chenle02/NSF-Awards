This is a four-year Information Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers
(ITEST) scale-up project aimed at developing Computational Thinking (CT) with
200 teachers and 15,000 middle school students in nine states' diverse learning
environments, such as urban, remote rural areas, and Native American
communities. Embedded in existing computing education and STEM courses, the
project-developed curriculum--Scalable Game Design (SGD)--introduces students to
CT through game design and advances them to STEM simulation design. The project
builds on a previous NSF-funded ITEST effort, which suggests that a combination
of professional development (PD) types (face-to-face, online, and blended) using
SGD can result in high participation of diverse students with high degrees of
motivation across gender and ethnicity. The study's key goal is to determine the
extent to which the use of three models of PD for teaching CT support classroom
teaching and student learning, motivation, and performance; thus a replicable
model for scaling-up CT education.

Framed within a scale-up working theory that identifies capacity, reach, and
sustainability as fundamental requirements, the key research question is: How do
face-to-face, online, and blended professional PD models for teaching computing
support classroom and student learning outcomes in various school contexts? To
address this question, the project (a) develops a highly adoptable middle-school
CT curriculum (a structured expansion of SGD) that addresses issues of access,
capacity, replicability, fidelity, and cost), integrated into existing computer
education and STEM courses; (b) creates a scalable set of game-design activities
so that students with no programming background can produce complete and
exciting games; (c) builds computational instruments that analyze student-
produced projects for CT skills; and (d) investigates the interaction of
pedagogical approaches and students' motivational levels, so that teachers can
broaden participation. To assess motivation across gender and ethnicity, the
study employs established valid and reliable motivation instruments. To measure
performance, the project uses Computational Thinking Pattern Analysis, an
embedded assessment instrument that measures computational thinking patterns,
illustrates divergence between tutorial and student projects, and computes
learning trajectories from students' projects.

The project's key outcome is a research-informed and field-tested scalable
prototype to promote middle and high school CT based on game and STEM simulation
design.
