The Arizona State University will initiate a five-week, commuter, Young
Scholars project in Mathematics and Computer Science for 120 students in grade
8. The students participate in a summer program emphasizing mathematics and
computer science; they then return for a second year of instruction. During the
academic year the students participate in Family MATH activities with their
parents, attend presentations given by scientists, and go on field trips.
Teachers from participating schools receive mathematics and computer
instruction, and then participate in the Summer program and follow-up
activities.
