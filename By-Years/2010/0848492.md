This project is awarding scholarships to academically talented and financially
needy students and is supporting the scholars through a variety of structures
and programs. Students from underrepresented groups are being especially
targeted for support and student scholars are enrolled in one of four
engineering disciplines. More than half of the current student population on
this urban campus works more that 20 hours per week and the scholarships enable
students to focus on their studies to graduation. The scholarship program builds
on a successful LSAMP program on campus, extending support and mentoring
activities into the junior and senior years for targeted students. The methods
being employed in the project include a revision of engineering courses to
include active, collaborative learning, a mentorship program that involves
research faculty, a targeted recruitment strategy, opportunities for networking
with engineering professionals, and a learning community infrastructure.
