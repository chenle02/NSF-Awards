With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Beak will elaborate
the dynamic behavior of organolithium in organic transformations. The endocyclic
restriction test methodology will be applied to a myriad of organic processes of
importance to organic synthesis. By the use of this methodology, a better
understanding of the transition state trajectories shall result. Thus, the
improved use of this popular reagent should makes its application more efficient
and predictable. Information about the ground states of a given reaction is
relatively easily obtained. However, the same clear understanding of the
transition states of reactions involving organolithium reagents is not known.
Thus, this investigation will attempt to elaborate these states in order to help
users of these reagents to employ them more efficiently. Moreover, new and basic
physical organic methodologies shall be validated.
