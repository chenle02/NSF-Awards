One of the highest priorities at the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras is
to foster a strong research environment. UPRRP is therefore committed to the
improvement of the institution's academic scientific infrastructure. In response
to this commitment, the College of Natural Sciences will undertake a project of
renovation of research facilities at the Facundo Bueso (FB) building. The
project provides for the 1) renovation of one Physics and twelve Chemistry
laboratories, 2) the relocation to the FB building of the Biology Museum,
support facilities and three systematics laboratories, now housed at an older
building. This award will support the total or partial repair of electrical and
plumbing systems, installation of fire alarms, installation of new or
substitution of corroded fume hoods, ducts and laboratory furniture, floor and
ceiling repair, and substitution of existing wall or window units of air
conditioning for a more efficient cooling system. The project will assure a
better use of facilities and increase the effective space available for research
and research training of graduate Hispanic students in areas such as
systematics, natural products, material sciences, electrochemistry, laser
spectroscopy and photochemistry, inorganic photochemisty, and biomembranes.
