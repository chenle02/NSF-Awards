The investigator proposes to study a number of optimization models and
algorithms that are broadly useful in data dimension reduction, latent
information extraction and hidden knowledge discovery. The focus is on problems
involving low-rank matrices of very large sizes, including the fundamental
problem of computing principal singular value decompositions for unstructured
dense matrices, as well as 3D-image processing techniques with applications to
hyperspectral data processing and wireless video networks. The overall goal is
to develop reliable algorithms that are much faster (by one order of magnitude
or more on large problems) than those in use today. Since many of the proposed
algorithms are extensions to the classic augmented Lagrangian alternating
direction method (ALADM) originally designed for certain convex programs, a part
of the project is devoted to a theoretical investigation on establishing a
convergence theory for ALADM in more general settings.

Modern technologies, such as 4D CT-scans, satellite remote sensing and DNA
microarrays, are creating an explosion of data made available in massive
quantities and at fast rates. Mathematical and computational techniques play a
crucial role in helping make sense out of such massive data sets in a timely
fashion and with minimal human interventions. The PI's work involves studying
and designing new algorithms for solving several classes of mathematical models
designed to help discover and extract the most useful information buried or
hidden in large amounts of data. New algorithms have the potential to run much
much faster than today's state-of-the-art methods, thus providing more
processing power and speed to numerous data-driven applications such as medical
diagnoses, agriculture planning, environment surveillance or genetic research in
biosciences.
