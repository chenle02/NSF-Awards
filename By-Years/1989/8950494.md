This funding supports the upgrade of the computer science curriculum at St.
Cloud State University by setting up an operating system laboratory with a
number of microcomputers and the necessary peripherals and software. Each
computer is a stand-alone system and available to the student for lab projects.
Over a two-quarter period, the students will implement parts of a multiuser
operating system in the laboratory while studying the theoretical aspects in the
classroom. The institution is providing matching funds in an amount equal to or
greater than the funds provided by the Foundation.
