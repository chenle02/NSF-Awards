Questionnaires and interview schedules routinely depend on respondents to serve
not only as informants about themselves but as informants (or "proxy reporters")
about others. This study brings recent developments in cognitive psychology to
bear on the study of the conditions affecting the quality of proxy reports. A
combination of methodologies will be employed, ranging from laboratory
experiments to focus groups and survey instruments, so that findings will be
validated in both experimental and field settings.
