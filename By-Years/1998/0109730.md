This Small Business Innovation (SBIR) Phase I Project proposes to produce soft
magnetic Fe-Co nanocomposites with end applications in EMI suppression, motors,
generators, magnetic bearings, magnetic recording heads and many advanced
electric systems. High performance electronic color image display has become a
standard feature of many modern commercial products. These products must use
timing circuits and operating frequencies from as low as 30 MHz to over 130 MHz.
Wide bandwidth electromagnetic interference (EMI) noises are inherent to these
characteristically high frequency architecture systems. Hence development of
cost effective and high performance materials are of great interest to prevent
EMI. Excellent magnetic properties of nanocrystalline Fe-Co can find an
important application in EMI prevention devices. In accordance with this
development, Materials Modification Inc. (MMI) proposes to synthesize and
process Fe-Co nanocomposites by the powder metallurgy (P/M) route. MMI has
expertise in nanopowder processing techniques that can be easily scaled up for
production. Upon completion of this Phase I project, an&lt;br/&gt;advanced Fe-Co
soft magnet with high permeability, large saturation magnetization, low energy
loss (hysteretic and eddy current), and high temperature properties will be
developed. Composition and structure will be tailored at the nano-scale to
obtain the desired mechanical and magnetic properties required for EMI
suppression devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nanocrystalline Fe-Co soft
magnets can be used in EMI prevention devices, motors and transformers,
generators, magnetic bearings, data communication interface components, magnetic
recording heads, sensors, and reactors. Fe-Co nanocomposite with superior
magnetic properties, low core-loss, and creep resistance at elevated
temperatures can be used in integral starter/generation (ISGs) and power units
(IPUs) in a modern aircraft.&lt;br/&gt;
