Binary systems composed of neutron stars, black holes, or a mixed pair are
expected to be some of the most important sources for the upcoming generation of
advanced earth-based gravitational wave detectors such as advanced LIGO.
Numerous models exist for describing such systems, such as post-Newtonian,
phenomenological, Effective One Body ones, and numerical simulations of the full
Einstein equations (the field of numerical relativity). Regardless of the model
to describe it, the problem suffers from a fairly large dimensionality. Roughly
speaking, the number of configurations to study is too large for an exhaustive
analysis. For this reason, large regions of the parameter space have been so far
unexplored. Under this award, we will engage in a systematic study of the
physical parameter space for gravitational waves from compact binary
coalescences (CBC) using a Reduced Basis approach. Reduced Basis will be used
for efficiently selecting within certain physical models for CBC the most
relevant regions in parameter space to solve for and analyze, compactly
representing the corresponding gravitational waves, and predicting new ones
based on such selection. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reduced Basis modeling is an
active area of basic and applied research at the forefront of many fields, from
climate studies and weather forecasting to gene classification and hyperspectral
imaging. We envision that the techniques we will develop in our gravitational
physics research will also find application in other fields. Additionally, as
part of our outreach efforts, we will engage students from underrepresented
groups. In particular, we will work with students from Howard University (one of
the top HBCUs in the country) and give presentations at local Hispanic High
Schools such as Cardozo and McCormick.
