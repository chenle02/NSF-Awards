This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will assist in the
development of an &lt;br/&gt;innovative method for effective and low cost
destruction and removal of hazardous air &lt;br/&gt;pollutants (HAPs),
specifically Halogenated Volatile Organic Compounds (HVOCs), &lt;br/&gt;using
non-thermal plasma generated in microwave discharges. In the non-thermal
&lt;br/&gt;technique described in this proposal, the non-equilibrium properties
of the plasma are &lt;br/&gt;fully exploited. These plasmas can produce
energetic electrons (typical energies of 1-10 &lt;br/&gt;eV), which effectively
lead to the creation of free radicals without the necessity of adding
&lt;br/&gt;the enthalpy associated with very high gas temperatures. Therefore,
from the chemical &lt;br/&gt;point of view, destruction reaction rates normally
associated with temperatures of 10,000 &lt;br/&gt;to 100,000 K can be realized
with the gas near ambient temperature. The proposed &lt;br/&gt;technique
utilizes the dissociation and ionization of the background gases to produce
&lt;br/&gt;radicals that, in turn, destroy and decompose the toxic and hazardous
compounds. The &lt;br/&gt;input energy of the system is directed mostly to the
production of the desired density of &lt;br/&gt;radicals which react
preferentially with the HVOCs that are often present in very small
&lt;br/&gt;concentrations in the exhaust gas. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The
proposed technology will meet a growing need in the semiconductor industry, and
&lt;br/&gt;other HVOC sources for a simple and cost-effective method for the
removal of hazardous &lt;br/&gt;compounds from the flue gas. The new method is
likely to be successful due to its &lt;br/&gt;simplicity and the ease with which
the gas-cleanup unit can be retrofitted to the existing &lt;br/&gt;combustion
systems. &lt;br/&gt;
