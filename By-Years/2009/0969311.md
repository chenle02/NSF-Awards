This is a research program on mixtures of ultracold atomic gases with the goal
to study novel forms of matter. These gases represent an entirely new material
with unique and controllable properties, and they provide a model system for the
physics of electrons in modern materials. The experiments focus on phenomena far
from equilibrium and in the presence of disorder, two themes that are poorly
understood theoretically, but of great importance in uncovering the workings of
High-TC superconductors and colossal magnetoresistive materials. One series of
experiments will deal with spin transport in Fermi gases, with implications for
the emerging field of spintronics. A second class of experiments will establish
the rules by which diffusion, interactions and disorder can quench metallic
states and how impurities promote or destroy superfluidity. This research will
test and thereby advance current theories and is relevant to diverse fields of
physics: From studies of high-temperature superconductors in condensed matter
physics, to the quark-gluon plasma of the early Universe and the behavior of
neutron matter in nuclear physics. Improved knowledge gained from these
experiments may enable material scientists to harness the power of modern
materials for storage devices with extreme data density, for energy efficiency
and lightweight electric motors. The work will provide training for graduate and
undergraduate students and postdocs on lasers, computer control, vacuum
assemblies, and radiofrequency and microwave electronics, thereby combining
research with education objectives. The direct observation and manipulation of
many-body states will provide a very stimulating and rewarding experience at a
time when the fields of atomic physics and condensed matter physics merge. All
research will be performed on campus and will be fully integrated in teaching
and education, via MIT's program for Undergraduate Research Opportunities (UROP)
and in physics and public lectures by providing visual illustrations for basic
concepts in physics.
