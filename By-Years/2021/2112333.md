The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve outcomes of medical endoscopy
procedures through 3D imaging where only two-dimensional images were previously
obtained. 3D imaging can reduce costs through improved and earlier detection of
cancer and other disorders. The proposed technology can also impact other
specialties, such as ophthalmology and dermatology, where quantifiable depth
imaging can have a profound impact. Additional opportunities for the proposed
camera exist in mobile, consumer devices, and in-cabin automotive
monitoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will develop technology
for a compact, single camera 3D imaging system integrated with endoscopes to
capture both high-resolution color images and measurable depth information.
Current 3D imaging in minimally invasive procedures, captured by stereo cameras,
is limited to laparoscopy using multiple trocars to perform surgery. The stereo
cameras take an entire trocar by virtue of the space needed for the two cameras.
Stereo imaging is not translatable to endoscopy, which houses all instruments
inside a single tube. This new 3D imaging system works by integrating an
optimized lens modification and back-end neural network to extract three-
dimensional information from the imaged area. Because the proposed modification
integrates within the single camera module, it can scale with size, enabling
three-dimensional imaging capabilities in smaller endoscopes (e.g., for use in
gastrointestinal tract, urology, or gynecology) where instrument sizes are
constrained. This project will: (1) develop new algorithms to improve high
resolution imaging and accuracy, (2) optimize for real-time performance, (3)
miniaturize the imaging system toward endoscopy, (4) design a visualization
system for the clinical workflow, and (5) validate the system for tissue
imaging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
