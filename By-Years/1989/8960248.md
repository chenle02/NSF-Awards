This project will develop computationally efficient and adaptive inversion
algorithms for use in such disciplines as medical imaging, nondestructive
evaluation, geophysical prospecting and robotic vision. Study will begin with
the basic mathematical model for electromagnetic nondestructive evaluation.
Phase II effort will refine the methods explored in Phase I, and develop a
comprehensive computer code to implement the algorithm developed in Phase I,
including a parallel version of the algorithm. Successful conclusion of this
project would have a significant impact on the fields mentioned above, and would
provide knowledge about applying conjugate gradients to nonlinear problems in
general, and about developing versions of the conjugate gradient method for
parallel computer architectures.
