The investigator and his colleague analyze, develop, and implement
computational methods for perturbed generalized eigenvalue problems. The project
has three main parts: a) Study the mathematical foundation of solution schemes
for the calculation of a few (extreme) eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors
of generalized systems; b) Develop practical computer solution procedures for
the generalized and modified eigenvalue problem; and c) Devise efficient
implementation in MIMD distributed memory computer environments. These problems
arise in the dynamic analysis of structures. A frequently encountered problem is
how to take into account in analysis and design changes introduced after the
structural dynamics analysis has been completed, and the natural frequencies and
modes have been computed. The investigators develop robust, accurate and fast
algorithms for solving a variety of such problems.
