The rapid growth of computerized technology related to design has generated
tremendous pressure on both the industrial and academic communities. Industry
has need for engineers prepared to meet the challenges of this new workplace
environment. Colleges and universities must find ways to incorporate these
experiences into the various aspects of the undergraduate curriculum. To this
end this project enhances the current CAD laboratory with state-of- the-art
technology at the lowest possible cost. The essential equipment and software
provide students with learning opportunities in the areas of (a) solid modeling,
(b) 3-D surfaces, (c) 2-D/3- D drafting, and (d) finite element modeling and
analysis. This environment permits the development of the requisite skills and
results in graduates suited to career needs. The award is being matched by an
equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.***//
