The requested high intensity rotating anode x-ray generator will be used in
conjunction with existing x- ray diffraction instrumentation at the University
of Wisconsin-Madison to study the effect of material processing on the defect
structure in semiconductors such as CdTe, GaAs, and silicon. Three research
programs that will utilize this x-ray source are: (1) The magnitude and origin
of surface polish damage in GaAs (2) The effect of Bridgman crystal growth on
the defect structures in bulk II-VI semiconductors (3) The evolution of surface
and subsurface damage during the reactive ion etching of silicon and GaAs.
