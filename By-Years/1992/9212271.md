Funded through an Engineering Research Equipment Grant, equipment will be
purchased for the case in a variety of investigations relevant to the dynamic
behavior of polymers: phase separation phenomena, dynamic relaxation, and
rheological materials characterization. The equipment consists of a mechanical
spectrometer. Application areas for this research are polymer processing
(coating, mixing), as well as biological systems (blood clotting).
