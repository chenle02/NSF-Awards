Each autumn and spring a rush of wings fill the night skies as birds migrate
between distinct locations for breeding and the other for over-winter survival.
However, recent reports indicate that the numbers of migratory species are
rapidly declining worldwide. Reasons for these declines have been attributed in
general to global environmental change but few specifics are known. Even though
bird migration has been appreciated for hundreds of years, little is understood
of how environmental conditions influence regulation of the physiological and
behavioral mechanisms of migration. Another enigma is that even though spring
and autumn migrations appear similar in distance and terrain covered, the
climatic conditions and physiological and behavioral states of migrants in the
two seasons differ. The studies proposed are designed to determine the
mechanisms of both spring and autumn migrations in a long-distance migrant, the
Gambel's White-crowned Sparrow. Comparisons are drawn with a close relative and
non-migrant, Nuttalls White-crown Sparrow. Intraspecific comparisons of this
nature are rare and vital for determining the adaptations of migrants.
Specifically, how do such factors such as photoperiod (day length) affect the
behavior, physiology and biochemical changes required to migrate long distances
(6000 km)? For example, migrants must increase appetite to achieve a temporary
state of obesity and increase aerobic capacity and endurance of flight muscles,
etc. to complete each migratory bout. Studies will test how the spring increase
in day length affects feeding, fattening and skeletal and heart muscles.
Comparisons will be run in autumn, when day length is declining. Results from
these studies may provide intricate clues for determining how the environment
affects migrants in order to slow or even prevent further loss of this
remarkable adaptation.
