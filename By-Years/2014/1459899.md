Classical market analysis built in the assumption that market participants
interact in a single market with the same information. Research over the last
forty years has highlighted the importance of asymmetric information in markets.
Research over the last twenty years has highlighted the importance of limited
participation in markets via network linkages. The project develops new
approaches to studying the role of information and networks in markets. The
classical approach to analyzing asymmetric information in economic settings is
to understand the consequences of assuming one particular information structure.
In this paper, we develop an alternative approach to understanding what can
happen in all information structures. This alternative approach delivers
powerful tools and new insights about the role of information in markets.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The project builds on earlier work supported by the NSF
on what can happen in strategic situations across different information
structures. The first component of the project on "Information and Markets"
applies that approach to classical market settings. In this context, the
approach highlights the distinct roles of information in making more outcomes
feasible but also in imposing more incentive constraints on what can happen. The
approach also clarifies the strategic foundations of competitive equilibria
under asymmetric information. A second component on "Information and Price
Discrimination" looks at outcomes under price discrimination, generalizing prior
work on single good monopoly. A third component of the project is on
"Information, Networks and Volatility". The problems of arbitrary networks and
arbitrary information structures are tightly linked. Building on earlier work
for symmetric environments and interaction, we examine which information
structure generates the most volatility in an economy with both idiosyncratic
and aggregate shocks in arbitrary networks with general information structures.
