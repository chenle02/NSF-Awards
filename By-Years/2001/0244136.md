This award provides renewed funding for a summer internship program at the
Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO), Columbia University. The goal of the
summer internship program is to teach undergraduates about the process of doing
scientific research, to expose the students to a wide range of research topics,
to facilitate interactions with a wide diversity of fellow science students and
researchers, to expose the students to a range of career options, and to teach
the use of database software. LDEO pairs each student with a LDEO senior
researcher. Students develop research projects, conduct data analysis and
present final results of the project. Use of large computer databases and the
extensive computer systems available at LDEO is an important component of the
research conducted by all the interns. In addition, LDEO organizes a lecture
series, including panel discussions on ethics in science.
