Research Experiences for Undergraduates in Software Tools for Concurrent
Programming This Research Experiences for Undergraduates project will support
six students in Summer programs each year, for three years. The goal of the
project is to continue an already established REU site program so as to continue
to provide opportunities for highly talented and qualified upper division women,
minority and disabled undergraduate students to participate in research programs
in the field of parallel processing. The students will investigate problems
related to parallel program development, debugging, scheduling, and performance
profiling under the supervision of the principal investigators and faculty
mentors and in collaboration with graduate students. The students will be
recruited nationally with emphasis on recruitment of students from institutions
lacking research facilities and located in the southwest region of the United
States. ***
