9320120 Town Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is the principal naturally-occurring
member of a class of plant growth hormones known as auxins. IAA is involved in a
wide range of plant processes including cell growth and differentiation, fruit
development and senescence. In plants, most of the IAA occurs not as the free
acid, but conjugated either to various sugars via ester linkages or to amino
acids or peptides via amide bonds, the latter form of conjugate being more
prevalent in most dicots. Several roles have been postulated for auxin
conjugates, including storage for use during germination, IAA homeostasis, and
even tissue targeting. Various lines of evidence suggest that auxin conjugates
are active only after hydrolysis to free auxin. Despite the obvious importance
of auxin in the plant, and the potential significance of the much larger
reservoir of conjugated auxin, very little is known about the biochemistry and
even less about the molecular biology or genetics of the synthesis or
degradation of IAA conjugates. In this proposal, several approaches will be used
to isolate genes involved in IAA conjugate metabolism. This laboratory has
recently isolated a cDNA encoding a conjugate hydrolyzing activity by a yeast
complementation strategy. The principal focus of this proposal is to
characterize many facets of the structure, expression and biological function of
this activity in Arabidopsis. As time permits, other studies on conjugate
function and metabolism which were ongoing prior to the cDNA isolation will also
be continued. ***
