The purpose of this project is to analyze the evolution of industries such as
computers and telecommunications where network externalities are important, ie.,
industries in which a consumer benefits from going along with the crowd by
picking a product that others tend to choose. The study consists of two parts.
First, an analysis will be conducted of seller behavior in network industries
including strategic pricing, the timing of product introduction, the incentives
to establish industry-wide standards, and gradual commitment by each seller to
its preferred technology. Second, models will be developed of consumer behavior
in network industries. The focus is on the decision of buyers to buy converters,
which allow them to communicate with otherwise incompatible networks and the
timing of these decisions in the presence of uncertain technological progress.
Because of the importance of computers and telecommunications in our economy,
there are many public policy issues regarding these industries. One example is--
should the United State encourage the adoption of the NHK standard for high-
definition television? This research is important because it will provide a
better theoretical framework for addressing such issues.
