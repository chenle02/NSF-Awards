This proposal requests funds to support experimental studies of heavy quark
physics with the BaBar Collaboration at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC). This research program in experimental particle physics centers on a
primary physics goal of elucidating the source of CP violation (matter-anti-
matter asymmetry) through the study of the decay of mesons containing the bottom
quark. A secondary physics goal is to probe aspects of the strong interaction
force by making precise studies of baryons containing the charm quark of
hadronic decays of the B-meson. Such studies are challenging both theoretically,
since they are difficult to calculate from first principles using the standard
theory (Quantum ChromoDynamics or QCD); and experimentally, since they occur
with very small probability. The Stanford group will also conduct an R&amp;D
program on chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond sensors for use in radiation
monitoring and single-particle detection in high-radiation environments. This
program will be carried out with the BaBar detector and the PEP-II storage ring
as well as other facilities at SLAC.
