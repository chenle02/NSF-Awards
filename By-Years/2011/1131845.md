This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liason with Industry (GOALI) award supports
the study of a new forming process to create a mechanical joint between
dissimilar materials. Friction stir forming will be studied by experimental,
modeling, and material analyses. The intrinsic process forces and temperature
will be measured. The effect of process parameters on the material deformation
and joint strength will be experimentally investigated. A more accurate modeling
prediction of thermo-mechanical material behavior will be made. A complete
metallurgical analysis will be conducted to characterize the effect of friction
stir forming on the work material grain structure. This new, efficient process
has a relatively small environmental footprint and will be capable of
simultaneously heating and forming the work material into a strong dissimilar
material joint. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this new joining process
will result in a stronger, lighter joint made entirely from the parent material
in a variety of dissimilar materials. The process is a quick one-step process
without the need for external fasteners, fluids, or any other material. In
traditional joining methods, such as fusion processes, joint strength in
dissimilar metal joints is limited. The major goal of this research is to
establish the link among the force/heat input, material structure, material
properties, and resulting joint strength. The nature of work material forming at
high temperature will be fully characterized and the proposed work will
contribute extensive knowledge about material forming by friction stir
processes. This research will stimulate new avenues and applications for
friction stir processes, and make them suitable for a wide range of materials.
General Motors is a partner in the research and will implement the process into
the manufacture of their automotive body structures.
