9622598 Greenstein Telecommunications is an industry which is undergoing rapid
change and renewed competition. In this era, there is still no general agreement
about the appropriate approach for encouraging modernization of the regulated
U.S. telephone system. This research will specifically look at the impact of
regulation on modernization through local exchange companies' adoption of
digital infrastructure. Prior research has found that various forms of incentive
regulation, and in particular price regulation, has led to greater deployment of
digital infrastructure than has traditional rate of return regulation. In
addition that price regulation works more effectively than earnings-sharing
schemes, although price regulation works better paired with earnings-sharing
schemes than when used alone. The proposed research builds on this previous
research by looking at the political influences on adoption of particular
regulatory schemes and on the speed of adoption of digital infrastructure. A
data set which includes political variables will be constructed to facilitate
this research.
