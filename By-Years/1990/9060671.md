This project is funded under the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Small
Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which is designed to provide an
opportunity for small business, particularly the small high technology firm, to
participate in NSF research. Phase I of the SBIR program serves as a filter to
select promising proposals and determine if the firm can do high quality
research. Phase II is the principal research project. Phase III is the
conversion of the NSF-funded research into commercial applications and
technological innovation supported by follow-on private venture capital or other
non-federal financing. This is a Phase I project. This project addresses a well-
known problem in communications: accurately receiving and demodulating a weak
signal in the presence of other, stronger signals. The technique could be used
in a diversity of applications including cellular telephone networks and GPS
navigation receivers. Conventional direct sequence, code division multiple
access (CDMA) receivers have limited capability for preventing mutual
interference in the reception and demodulation of the CDMA signals. Performance
of a new CDMA receiver structure providing much more rejection of the
interfering CDMA signals for a given bandwidth spreading ration is being
investigated. The new receiver structure applies its additional protection to
each of the CDMA signals to be received using a hardware-efficient embodiment.
