The relationship between the structural and surface characteristics of catalysts
based on molybdenum oxide and the selectivity of these catalysts in the partial
oxidation of methane is investigated. Among the issues addressed are the nature
of active sites, the effects of promoters, catalyst- support interactions, the
role of lattice oxygen, and the participation of the gas-phase oxidant.
Supported, unsupported, and promoted catalysts are prepared and characterized
using laser Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy
with three- dimensional imaging, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy, steady-state kinetics, and transient response
experiments. The role of lattice oxygen in the oxidation reaction is examined
using in situ laser Raman spectroscopy in conjunction with isotopic labelling.
Methane is readily available from natural gas or refinery effluents. Its direct
partial oxidation to methanol or formaldehyde would offer major savings in both
capital and operating costs over traditional methods of making these products.
Molybdenum-oxide catalysts show promise for this conversion, but further study
is needed to obtain a practical process.
