This project involves the study of viscosity solutions to fully nonlinear
partial differential equations. Earlier work in this area set the stage for the
complete development now available for first order equations in finite
dimensions, and subsequent developments in the theory of viscosity solutions of
first and second-order fully nonlinear equations yielded strongly developing
theories of Hamilton-Jacobi equations in infinite dimensions and fully nonlinear
second order equations in finite and infinite dimensions. The present work is
concerned with viscosity solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi equations in infinite
dimensions, second order equations in both finite and infinite dimensions, and
second order equations in the space of integrable functions. In recent years
there has been a remarkable development of the theory of fully nonlinear partial
differential equations of first and second order; this development followed the
successful introduction of the notion of "viscosity solutions" of these
equations which allows one to admit nowhere differentiable functions as
solutions. Equations of this sort arise in many areas of mathematics and its
applications, including control theory, the theory of differential games,
problems of a geometrical nature, asymptotic problems, etc., etc. The pace of
this development is currently at its peak, and fundamental work remains to be
done to render the theory more accessible, more general, and more complete. The
proposed work lies in these directions and chiefly concerns the using of the new
methods to complete several aspects, including "infinite dimensional" versions
partially motivated by the theories of control and differential games involving
systems whose state lies in infinite dimensional spaces and more penetrating
studies of the finer structure of viscosity solutions in both infinite and
finite dimensional settings.
