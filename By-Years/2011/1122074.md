A functional role for progesterone and its receptor in female behavior and
physiology is fairly well established; however, the data on progesterone and
progestin receptor (PR) function in males are relatively sparse. Although there
are only a few studies examining the action of progesterone in males, the
results confirm an exciting yet understudied role for progesterone and/or the
progestin receptor in adult male behavior and physiology. The goal of this
project is to test the hypothesis that progesterone impairs social behavior,
specifically social memory/recognition and recently collected preliminary data
strongly support this hypothesis in a male rodent model. This research is
valuable as it will develop a framework for understanding the role that
progesterone plays in influencing social behavior (i.e., social recognition) in
males, and provide new molecular targets, such as the underlying steroid
/neuropeptide interactions and epigenetic mechanisms, for understanding how
social recognition is regulated. These studies will also aid in the
understanding of which neural pathways in the brain become compromised in some
disease states in which one?s ability to socially recognize other individuals is
impaired. The current project will also provide a valuable opportunity for
education and dissemination of knowledge. The training provided is designed to
give back to the community by engaging students from elementary to graduate
school, as well as increase participation of women and students from
underrepresented backgrounds in all aspects of experimental science. The data
and techniques used to gain these data will be shared with the scientific
community, as well as disseminated to the public.
