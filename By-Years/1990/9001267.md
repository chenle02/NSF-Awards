This project tests the predictions of 'patch dynamics' community ecology models
at the level of the whole community. It will help explain the diversity of
insect communities and the evolutionary diversity of insects as a whole. 'Patch
dynamics' models describe how dispersal, intra-specific aggregation, and
disturbance allow competing species or predator and prey species to coexist on
patchy ephemeral resources. Two specific questions will be answered: 1. Does
community species diversity increase as the spatial patchiness of a resource is
increased? 2. Does community diversity increase over several generations as the
temporal discontinuity of the resource increases? Three experiments will
manipulate laboratory-grown mushrooms as a patchy ephemeral resource for
insects. The first experiment will determine the length of exposure that will
give maximum insect diversity on mushrooms in the other experiments. The second
experiment will compare the diversity of insects supported by a standard mass of
mushrooms divided into either one, four, or sixteen patches. The third
experiment will compare diversity over several generations between identical
spatial arrays of mushrooms that are renewed at different temporal intervals.
