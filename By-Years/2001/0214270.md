With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Kathryn Bock will conduct three
years of psycholinguistic research on the cognitive processes involved in
producing number and gender agreement in normal spontaneous speech. The project
will compare agreement in English, Dutch, and Russian using laboratory tasks
that measure the accuracy, timing, locus of attention, and cognitive demands
associated with the production of agreement in verbs and pronouns. The research
addresses how speakers tacitly identify the conceptual and perceptual precursors
of number and gender and tests competing views about how number and gender
information are used when producing agreement under the typical time-pressures
associated with speaking.

The devices of number and gender agreement are linguistic flags to the parts of
sentences that belong together mentally, serving to bridge meaning and the
grammatical form of the utterances that speakers use to express their thoughts.
The bridge is well travelled: Even in English, a language with relatively simple
agreement requirements, speakers call on the operations that implement agreement
more than once in every five seconds of running speech. Also, despite intuitions
to the contrary, agreement is surprisingly reliable. By the age of 4, the
normal, spontaneous use of number agreement is almost 95% correct. The
implication is that an explanation of the workings of agreement can enhance our
currently negligible scientific understanding of how human perceptions and
conceptions are transformed into a medium that allows them to be communicated
with precision to other people.
