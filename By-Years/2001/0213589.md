Professor Nathan Lewis of the California Institute of Technology is funded by
the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program for studies leading to better
control of the electrical and physical properties of silicon-based materials and
devices through an emphasis on silicon surface chemistry. The projects include
chemical and electrical passivation reactions on single crystal silicon
surfaces, charge transport behavior of structures obtained from mesoporous
silicon photoelectrodes, as well as characterization of silicon-based nanotubes
and nanospheres, and formation of organic/inorganic composites.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chemical modification of silicon surfaces is important in
interfacing molecular electronics to semiconductor-based circuitry and
developing chemical sensors, optoelectronic devices and photovoltaic and
photoelectrochemical cells. Perhaps surface modification can fool inexpensive
polycrystalline silicon samples into having electrical and physical properties
of the more expensive large single crystals currently used.
