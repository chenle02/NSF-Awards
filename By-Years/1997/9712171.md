ECS-9712171 Nasser Peyghambarian Professors Peyghambarian and Mazumder will
explore the potential of organic photorefractive polymeric devices in a number
of applications, including erasable high density optical storage, reconfigurable
interconnects, holographic security and real time image processing applications.
This work will particularly focus upon the organic photorefractive materials
used, and the effects of creating high optical excitations densities in organic
solids.
