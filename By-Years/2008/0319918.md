This Small Business Innovation Research Phase 1 Project will use a commercial
laser system for laser chemical etching to develop processes to fabricate Micro-
opto-electro-mechanical systems (MOEMS) components such as micro-lenses,
channels, and electrical contacts by directly writing with a laser. MEMS/MOEMS
devices are often difficult to make and the architectures are often limited by
the need to use conventional lithographic tools borrowed from the integrated
circuit industry. The main issue that arises in the fabrication of MOEMS devices
is simply that of creating controlled non-flat surfaces with high precision, or
fabricating something on a non-flat surface, and high quality surface finish. In
this proposal the feasibility of creating the general structures in close
proximity, for creating by direct laser etching and writing, a MOEMS test
structure incorporating optical, microfluidic, and electrical elements will be
developed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Micro-opto-electro-mechanical systems (MOEMS)
are making inroads in the Optoelectronics, medical equipment, sensors,
communications, aerospace and automotive industries. This market is ever
expanding and will be a multi-billion dollar market by 2005.&lt;br/&gt;
