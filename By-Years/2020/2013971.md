This program (US-SCAR) supports and strengthens U.S. participation in the
Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR). SCAR is an international
organization established in 1958 to facilitate international collaborations in
Antarctic science, and SCAR serves as an advisor to the Antarctic Treaty System
(ATS). The U.S. is one of 12 founding member countries of SCAR (there are
currently 44 members), and Americans have consistently played a strong role in
SCAR leadership. US-SCAR promotes the progress of polar science within the U.S.
and the international Antarctic scientific community by facilitating the
attendance of U.S. scientists, particularly early career researchers, at the
SCAR Open Science Conferences and Symposia on Biology and Earth
Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The U.S. National Committee for SCAR is the Polar
Research Board (PRB) (US National Academies), and funding for the PRB comes from
various government agencies. The PRB budget does not include funding for US-SCAR
activities, however. This program absorbs a variety of costs associated with
U.S. participation in SCAR, including travel to meetings, enhancing outreach
capabilities, and establishing a more effective format to ensure maximum US
participation in SCAR initiatives. US-SCAR provides opportunities for U.S.
scientists, especially early career researchers, to 1) present their work in an
international forum, 2) learn about the most recent findings on all aspects of
Antarctic science, 3) establish and strengthen international contacts and
collaborations, and 4) be actively involved in the development of new directions
and the establishment of new frontiers in the international framework of polar
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
