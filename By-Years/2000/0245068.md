The proposed research involves research in Particle, Fields and Strings. We
propose to continue investigating some of the most fundamental questions
concerning quantum gravity. The first is the smallness of the vacuum energy. The
second is why the vacuum and matter energy densities are comparable today. We
are exploring new theories in which General Relativity is modified at very large
distances in such a way that the gravitational coupling is wavelength dependent.
We propose to study "brane world models" perturbative string theory and quantum
gravity. We will also study Anti-de Sitter Conformal Field Theory holography to
study fundamental questions of quantum gravity. One question is whether quantum
evolutions in the presence of gravity remain unitarity. We are proposing a novel
approach to renormalize the electroweak sector of the standard model for use in
understanding radiative corrections. We will also perform an updated analysis of
neutron beta decay because of new experiments on electron asymmetry in the decay
of polarized neutrons.
