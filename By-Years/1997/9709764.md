This project involves light scattering and absorbtion measurements on aerosol
agglomerates as a function of particle size and diffraction indices. The
dynamics of agglomeration at various Knudsen regimes will be measured and
evaluated. The fractal optics and kinetics experiments will be compared with
existing theories and a new model proposed by the P.I. A multi-angle optical
diagnostic technique for size and morphology of particle and aggregate in
unsteady flows will be developed, with application to turbulent flows in flames.
If successful, the study will provide better understanding of the aerosol
aggregation mechanisms, of light scattering and absorption processes from
aggregates, and a new instrument to measure the aggregate size and composition
in turbulent flows. Application range from soot formation in air pollution
studies to powders synthesis in flame reactors.
