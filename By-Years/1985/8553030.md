It is anticapated that the research program will result in a new family of
triangular and quadrilateral elements which will permit more accurate analysis
of plates and shells subjected to a wide variety of loading which produce either
linear or non-linear response. The current state-of-the-art in finite element
modeling is often inadequate in treating fluid-shell interactions under dynamic
loading and collapse. It is anticipated that this research program will lead to
a more complete and correct finite element method which will be of interest to
industries fabricating large plate and shell type structures.
