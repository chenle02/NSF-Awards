The Evolution of Terrestrial Ecosystems computerized Database is designed to
allow broad-scale comparisons of the paleobiology and paleoecology of
terrestrial ecosystems and their plant and animal communities. In particular,
research interest in this project focuses on making detailed comparisons on a
locality-by-locality basis of paleocommunity structure, paleovegetation, and
paleoenvironments, and on tracing patterns in biological structural change in
terrestrial ecosystems throughout geologic time. Such studies require the
synthesis of large amounts of information currently scattered throughout a vast
literature or lying unpublished in museum collections, and are difficult to
undertake using the available information resources within paleontology. The
current award will support the purchase of new hardware and modifications in
existing software. The specific goal is to migrate the project to a more
standard version of UNIX running on a modern, high-performance workstation and
to re-write the Graphical User Interface to be compatible with X Windows
standards. This will immediately allow increased performance and functionality
at sites were the database is currently being compiled and used (the Smithsonian
and UCSB). It will also allow access to the database by multiple users on a wide
variety of remote computers.
