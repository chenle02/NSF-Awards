Abstract:

The analytic part of the proposal is concerned with two questions concerning
nonlinear differential equations arising from conformal geometry. The first is
to formulate a general notion of weak solutions for a family of fully nonlinear
equations containing the equations to prescribe the symmetric functions of the
Weyl-Schouten tensor, and to provide criteria for removal of singularities of
such equation. This would open the way to find solutions to these equations by a
more traditional variational method. The second is to find Sobolev inequalities
for fourth order equations that arise in conformal geometry in dimensions three
and four. The geometric part of this proposal is concerned with applications of
our recent work in prescribing the second symmetric functions of the Weyl-
Schouten tensor on a four-dimensional manifold to the diffeomorphisms
classification of a class of four-dimensional manifolds, as well as applications
to the study of Kleinian groups in higher dimensional manifolds.

This proposal is concerned with new methods to solve a family of nonlinear
differential equations that is associated with conformal geometry in which the
primary data is the knowledge of angle measurements. The ability to solve these
equations gives us new numerical invariants that will eventually allow us to
classify these geometries in three and four dimensions a subject that is of wide
interest in the geometry and topology community. The differential equations are
highly nonlinear and appear among a family of such equations that have only
recently yielded to a geometric approach. Such development will generate a set
of new tools to analyze the structure nonlinear partial differential equations a
subject also of wide interest in general.
