The PI will work on the numerical analysis aspects of discrete exterior
calculus. This is a class of numerical methods for solving partial differential
equations (PDEs) and these methods attempt to preserve the geometric and
algebraic structures of the physics being modeled. One ingredient of this
project will be the use of algebraic topology and differential geometry to
create and analyze discretizations of objects and operators of exterior calculus
that appear in important PDEs. Several discretizations will be derived and the
convergence and stability of the resulting numerical methods will be studied. In
addition to this, the PI will develop algorithms and software to make it easier
to conduct experimental studies involving such discretizations. All of this will
be done in the context of several physical problems.

Numerical solution of partial differential equations is a core part of numerical
analysis and its applications in engineering and science. Some of the equations
that the PI will work on have applications in ground water contamination, oil
exploration, weather modeling, nuclear fusion, star and planet formation and
formation of solar flares and storms. The research in this project will use pure
mathematics topics like differential geometry and algebraic topology as well as
computational mathematics. Thus it will be a unique vehicle with which to
introduce these topics to students in mathematics as well as computer science.
Due to the wide appeal of the applications mentioned above, the PI will use
animations, images and concepts produced in this research to create interest in
mathematics and science amongst primary school students.
