The purpose of the work is to produce and refine a predictive model of
floodplain land value changes over time and space by testing several theoretical
models presently at different levels of validation, and develop an heuristic
framework for the relationships between residential property values and the
incidence of flooding. The literature from both natural hazards research and
urban economics will be integrated and incorporated into the conceptual model.
This model will be tested with data from a limited number of study sites, and
the analysis will use multiple regression techniques, the hedonic approach and
the "repeat sales" method (Palmquist). The results of the research will create a
data base and an analytical framework useful to other researchers, decision-
makers and floodplain managers.
