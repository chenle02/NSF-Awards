This project addresses the development of advanced cementitious materials. The
opportunity for substantial improvement of the properties of cement and cement-
based composites has been given a major boost by recent research in densified
cement matrix materials, 'MDF' cement, and slag and silica-fume cements. Taken
together with the rapid increase in our understanding of the theory of brittle
matrix composites, this new control of phase chemistry and processing offers
very substantial hope of new-order of magnitude increases in properties.
Applications for such substantially improved cement matrix materials extend from
special durable concretes to specialized materials such as machine tool and
molding materials, to substrates of low dielectric constant, or varistors. This
project includes these major components: o Enhancement of the matrix by
manipulation of its phase composition o Introduction of novel preparation and
processing approaches to making cement-based composites o The study of totally
unexplored self transformation- toughened cements o Detailed characterization
and properties investigations of the above materials. Later stage studies will
include regions of particulate nanocomposites and fiber reinforced materials.
