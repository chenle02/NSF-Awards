This is a SGER project to collect and to study the perishable earthquake and
structural response/damage data due to the October 17, 1989 Loma Prieta
earthquake. Work underway in this project is to collect and analyze damage data
of the San Francisco Bay Bridge due to the October 17, 1989 earthquake. Such
data is rapidly disappearing during the intensive repairing process commenced
immediately after the upper deck failure. In cooperation with the California
Department of Transportation (Caltrans), extremely valuable data on severely
damaged bridge elements including the collapsed deck has been recovered and
continues to be collected. This body of engineering data will be processed and
analyzed. A report of such information, including the implication to the bridge
response and design consideration will be prepared.
