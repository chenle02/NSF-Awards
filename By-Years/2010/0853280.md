&lt;br/&gt;Tomova's research centers on Heegaard splittings of 3-dimensional
manifolds and bridge surfaces for knots in manifolds. Given a knot in a closed
3-manifold, a bridge surface is a surface that decomposes the manifold into
handlebodies and also cuts the knot into simple arcs. In the last year and a
half Tomova has proven several important results about the behavior of bridge
surfaces. She intends to extend and generalize her results and apply her work to
several open problems in the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the
discovery of the DNS molecule and the recent advent of string theory, the study
of knots has come to the forefront of modern science. Knot Theory is a subarea
of Topology which studies the properties of knotted strings and is the main area
of interest of Maggy Tomova. Her study of knots also requires an understanding
of 3-manifolds, objects that locally look like 3-dimensional space.&lt;br/&gt;
