The focus of this research is on the mathematical theory of anisotropic complex
fluids, such as viscoelastic materials, liquid crystals, and ionic fluids in
proteins and bio-solutions. The research will include two categories of
problems: (1) Mathematical analysis of the systems with basic variational
structures that are common to complex fluids. (2) The application of such a
general framework, in particular to the study of ionic fluids in cells and
proteins. Complex fluids, including mixtures and solutions, are abundant in
daily life. The complicated phenomena and properties exhibited by these
materials reflect the coupling and competition between microscopic interactions
and macroscopic dynamics. The project will study the underlying energetic
variational structures that are common to all these materials. New mathematical
approaches in the modeling, analysis and numerical simulations will be developed
in order to understand these multiscale-multiphysics
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Major efforts will be devoted to the study of
ionic solutions in proteins. Molecular biology has shown that understanding
behavior of proteins and nucleic acids in biological plasma (ionic solutions) is
essential for understanding and controlling many biological systems. Nearly all
biological processes involve the transport of electrically charged ions. Ion
channels are instrumental for a vast number of biological phenomena, with many
diseases (such as cystic fibrosis) and drug treatments dependent on channel
functioning. In mathematical analysis of these phenomena, variational methods
show a great promise because they deal naturally with systems with many
components that flow between definite boundaries. In this research we will apply
energy variational methods to study biological plasma, ionic solutions of
sodium, potassium, and chloride ions as they flow through specific protein
channels.
