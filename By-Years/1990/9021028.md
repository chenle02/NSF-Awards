The research project involves the design, development and experimental
demonstration of a model that integrates time with object databases. Preliminary
evidence suggests that existing notions of temporal data must be modified
because of the transition from the relational to the object model. As such, this
model is the first step towards the synthesis of an integrated object model that
supports the temporal aspects of data modeling in addition to the structural and
dynamic ones. Investigations to be undertaken include: (a) the study of the
semantics of time and the development of a set of temporal principles to be used
as an underlying basis for the design of our temporal object model; (b) the
study of the temporal aspects of objects and the development of a model for
integrating time with objects and the formalization of the model; (c) the
augmentation of the data modeling power of object and semantic modeling
concepts, particularly versions, with temporal modeling concepts; (d) the
extension of an archetype extensible object database model to incorporate
notions of time; and (e) the development of suitable user interfaces.
Anticipated applications of these investigations are in engineering, business,
medical information systems, scheduling, computer aided design and computer
integrated manufacturing.
