The objective of this research is to understand the influence of particle size
distribution in powdered materials on subsequent coarsening, densification and
grain growth during solid-state sintering. The program involves experimental
testing, modeling and computer simulation of the sintering process.
Stereological analyses of the microstructures resulting from the various
processing steps reveal effects of particle size distribution and controlled
additions of impurities. The emphasis is along two related paths, the effects of
particle size distribution on coarsening and the mechanisms of grain growth
inhibition as influenced by dopant concentration and type. Material systems
under study include tungsten-nickel-iron, zinc oxide-barium oxide, and aluminum
oxide doped with magnesium oxide.
