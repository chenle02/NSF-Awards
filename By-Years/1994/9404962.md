9404962 Ward This research is to analyze the regularity of recurrence of large
earthquakes (M greater than 7) from major plate boundaries around the world.
Regularity of earthquake recurrence is a critical input into many seismic hazard
studies. Many of the previous studies of earthquake recurrence have concentrated
on "characteristic", segment-breaking events. However, both the definition of
segments and the selection of "characteristic" events are not unambiguous. By
analyzing a large number of recurrence series and establishing a set of
objective selection criteria, the study will quantify systematically the
regularity of large earthquakes. This research is a component of the National
Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
