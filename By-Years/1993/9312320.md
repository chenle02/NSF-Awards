This grant supports a workshop on numerical modeling of mantle convection, to
be held at Los Alamos National Laboratory. This workshop is part of the
Cooperative Studies of the Earth's Deep Interior (CSEDI), and is designed to lay
the groundwork for developing the infrastructure necessary to advance numerical
modeling of mangle convection. 15 scientists will participate in developing a
statement of purpose that will form the basis for a long term effort to develop
the tools necessary for further advancement in modeling mantle dynamics.
