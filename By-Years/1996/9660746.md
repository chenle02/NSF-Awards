9660746 McDonald This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) I project will
design and test key components of an advanced coring system. The research will
address real-time monitoring of the core length in the barrel and closure of the
barrel opening to prevent core loss. While partial or complete core loss is
generally not a problem in competent formations, it is a serious problem in
unconsolidated and highly fractured ones. Partial core loss is experienced in
approximately 20% of wells cored, representing considerable costs. Phase I will
combine acoustic measurement technology with a high speed, microprocessor-based
data acquisition system and mud-pulse telemetry unit. The acoustic sensors will
be deployed along the inner core barrel. The microprocessor will transmit the
status of the coring operation to the surface by controlling the position of a
valve located above the core barrel to modulate standpipe pressure using a
pulsewidth modulation scheme. The bottom of the core barrel will be fitted with
a springloaded valve which fully closes to prevent core loss. The valve is
actuated by momentarily increasing the mud flow rate. Commercial applications
are expected in geologic investigation, fossil fuel exploration, and
environmental remediation. This technology will be compatible with conventional
and wireline-retrievable coring systems for use in commercial coring services.
