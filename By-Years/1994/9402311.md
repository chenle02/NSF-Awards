9402311 Azizinamini Concern for safety and lack of information has resulted in
the ACI 318-89 building code imposing a 10,000 psi limitation on concrete
compressive strength, that can be utilized in the design process when
calculating tension development length of reinforcing bars. This limitation is a
result of the fact that the current code requirements are based on test data
form specimens with compressive strengths in the range of 3,000 to 6,000 psi;
however, concrete with compressive strength exceeding 14,000 psi is being used
in construction. The overall objective of the research is to develop a unified
theoretical model that would explain the behavior of deformed bars embedded in
concrete of any compressive strength. Of particular interest is the case of
concrete with compressive strength exceeding 14,000 psi. Further, it is intended
that the research findings be provided in the code language format, adoptable by
code-writing organizations.
