9731543 Sanford This award to University of Washington will provide support to
complete software development and carry out field tests of the recently built
version of the "Towed Transport Meter," an instrument which uses electric field
data measured from an instrument towed behind a ship to measure ocean currents.
A goal of this development is to provide a system which may be operated with
minimal operator involvement, and hence may be used on ships of opportunity on
which ocean research is not the primary mission. Testing will be carried out in
the vicinity of the Gulf Stream off Florida, where a strong current signal and
ancillary data may be used to confirm the operational status and calibration.
