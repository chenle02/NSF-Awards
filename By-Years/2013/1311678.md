This collaborative project combines observational and theoretical efforts with a
goal of improving knowledge of magnetic fields on low mass stars. They will use
high precision lightcurves of M-dwarfs from the Kepler satellite to probe
starspots on late type stars to determine how stellar mass and rotation affect
local magnetic fields. They will use data already acquired from Kepler, and new
photometry with moderate sized (1-m aperture) robotic telescopes and new spectra
with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. Starspots are short-lived areas on the
surfaces of stars that are caused by magnetic activity. The researchers will
also investigate the effect of magnetic fields on fundamental stellar
properties, such as temperature, luminosity and radius as a function of M-dwarf
mass. They will also determine the relative importance of magnetic fields on
observatory activity, such as flares and hydrogen-alpha emission.

Broader impacts include providing research opportunities to undergraduate
students in STEM majors, with an effort to broaden participation by students
from traditionally underrepresented minority groups. They will also engage a
group of amateur astronomers to obtain time series photometry of bright
eclipsing binary stars.
