Abstract Hart, John E. University of Colorado ATM-9714221 Title: Studies of
Rotating Fluids The objective of this research is a critical examination of
theories and modeling techniques relevant to atmospheric dynamics, by means of
laboratory experiments on mechanically driven rotating fluids. Detailed
measurements of velocity fields in single-layer and two-layer systems will be
made using high resolution particle image velocimetry and laser doppler
anemometry. The data will test theories of baroclinic wave chaos, Reynolds
stress closure models of turbulence, and subgrid scale modeling methods
currently used in meteorological large eddy simulations. Most of the experiments
will take place in a rotating cylinder, with fluid motions being driven
mechanically by a differentially rotating lid. This system has advantages of
simplicity, the presence of a homogeneous direction, the ability to study a
large range of Reynolds numbers (l03 to order 106), the suitability for use of
particle image velocimetry, and the relative ease of comparing model predictions
with the experimentaldata. Experiments on two-layer flows will focus on
asymmetries in the baroclinic instability and chaos problems. An extensive set
of experiments on single-layer flows will provide a categorization of
instabilities on the sidewall, as well as data on separation and instability in
the top and bottom boundary layers. Preliminary work has shown that this three-
parameter system has numerous instabilities, mixed in with vertically erupting
horizontal boundary layers. These phenomena are important for understanding the
behavior of boundary layers under atmospheric vortices. Detailed characteristics
of the flows will be compared with results from axisymmetric numerical
simulations and linear instability theory. Fundamental studies such as these
underlie future improvements in numerical models of atmospheric motions.
