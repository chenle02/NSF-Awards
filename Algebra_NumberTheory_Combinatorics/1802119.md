Circle and sphere packings can be traced back to the ancients, and continue
today to be a rich source of non-Euclidean geometries having fascinating groups
of symmetries. The study of such connects geometry to algebra, combinatorics,
and arithmetic. The PI will continue to develop new tools to handle questions in
this novel setting, with many applications to naturally arising problems,
attacks on which have only recently become possible. Integrated with the
proposed research projects are numerous educational and outreach components,
including collaborations with the National Museum of Mathematics, the Johns
Hopkins "Center for Talented Youth", and running summer REUs at DIMACS.

The PI and collaborators will study interactions of hyperbolic reflection groups
with arithmetic and geometric properties of crystallographic packings. They will
attack the problem of understanding which polyhedral packings support integral
and superintegral crystallographic packings, with potential applications to
which number fields arise as invariant trace fields of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. A
number of other projects are also proposed, in quasi-conformal and symplectic
geometry, and homogeneous dynamics and Diophantine approximation.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
