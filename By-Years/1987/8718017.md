The Longyearbyen Observatory in Svalbard is a mainstay in optical experiments of
the polar region. Observations from Longyearbyen are expected to play a major
role in the CEDAR initiative. However, the observatory itself is small and
already overcrowded. As the CEDAR science campaigns become more frequent
pressure for the limited space will be further exacerbated. This award
facilitates the use of the Longyearbyen Observatory in Svalbard by visiting
experimenters. In particular, approximately 400 square feet of badly needed
additional space to the existing observatory will be provided. Furthermore,
transformers and surge protection devices will be installed to provide
conditioned 120 volt power to the instruments of the visiting U.S. scientists.
