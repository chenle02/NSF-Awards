Important to the scientific study of the judicial process is the provision of
data that can be meaningfully used to answer a variety of questions about the
public's use of law and the workings of courts. The purpose of the project being
undertaken by Dr. Gibson is to develop and test a new method for enhancing the
reliability of content analysis of judicial opinions. The method can be termed
"computer-assisted content analysis," though it has little in common with the
traditional computer-based methods of content analysis. In particular, the
method is an adaptation of computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI)
technology to the coding of opinions. The project consists of several tasks.
First, the CATI system will be adapted to content analysis. Second, a sample of
opinions of the U.S. Supreme Court will be coded. Finally, a formal assessment
of the reliability of the computer- assisted content analysis will be conducted
by comparing the data to the more traditional methods of analyzing opinions.
This analysis will be conducted by merging the newly-coded CATI data with data
from the National Science Foundation-funded U.S. Supreme Court Judicial Data
Base. This project has considerable scientific promise. It should yield a new
method that can be widely adapted to coding judicial opinions not just of the
United States Supreme Court but of a wide variety of different courts. Such an
analytic innovation will allow judicial scholars to turn their attention to the
important goal of developing comparable measures of theoretical and practical
significance. As important, it should yield a technique for coding data that can
be executed in a systematic, reliable, standarized, and efficient way.
