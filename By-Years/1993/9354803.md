9354803 Plumb This curriculum development project will enable Jamestown
Community College and (through dissemination activities) other two-year colleges
to continue to move toward a heavily observation-based approach to introductory
physics, consistent with the nature of physics as an observation-based
discipline. In the area of mechanics, there exists a growing body of teaching
methods and materials which emphasizes direct observation and active student
involvement. This project will identify, study, pilot test and evaluate a
variety of similar approaches to the teaching of electricity and magnetism and
selected topics in modern physics. A notebook of successful methods and
materials will be a tangible outcome of our efforts to help students develop a
solid conceptual understanding of topics in electricity and magnetism.
