Procurement of state-of-the-art computer equipment will enhance the
productivity and will contribute to a fundamental understanding of the
mechanical design processes, and develop proof-of-concept computer tools that
can improve the way mechanical design is done. Ongoing research includes: (1) a
"features" methodology for complex geometries in component design; (2) a
language and environment for design of mechanical assemblies; (3) computational
models for iterative redesign and respecification; and (4) geometric reasoning
in mechanical design domains.
