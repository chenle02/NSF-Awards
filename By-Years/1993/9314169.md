9314169 Schouten Recent GLORIA sidescan, multibeam bathymetry, magnetic and
gravity surveys would be used to derive a kinematic solution for the evolution
of the Juan Fernandez microplate located at the triple junction between the
Pacific, Nazca, and Antarctic plates. The solution will be compared with the
kinematic solution for the evolution of the nearby Easter microplate. The
hypothesis that the motion of oceanic microplates may be caused by forces
applied to them on their boundaries by the movement of the surrounding larger
plates will be tested. This will provide the formulation of a general model for
oceanic microplate tectonics. ***
