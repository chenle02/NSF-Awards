Engineering-Engineering Technology (58) Through this project, Rochester
Institute of Technology [RIT] is adapting the University of Maryland's exemplary
program in Electronic Packaging and Reliability and implementing the Reliability
Education and Analysis Laboratory [REAL]. The project is integrating reliability
and failure analysis concepts and laboratory experience into the undergraduate
electronics-packaging curriculum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project impacts
RIT's existing three-course sequence in electronics packaging, which is open to
engineering and technology students in all disciplines, and to practicing
engineers. Specific topics include failure modes, failure mechanisms, failure
detection, failure modeling, root cause analysis, reliability statistics,
prediction, testing and analysis. The laboratory component of REAL includes
moisture sensitivity studies, thermal cycling of assemblies, and destructive and
non-destructive analysis of assemblies. Through this laboratory experience, the
students are able to apply learning reliability theory to today's complex
workplace, and to qualify new products and processes. Included is an industry
input mechanism to ensure its applicability to the engineering workplace.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcomes from REAL are being shared with K-12
educators through Project Lead the Way summer training institutes.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RIT is home to the National Technical Institute for the
Deaf. Service to support these students is being incorporated into REAL. The
project is leveraging campus-wide resources that provides a sustained
recruitment and support mechanism for women and minorities.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is focusing on student learning and is
incorporating both formative and summative assessments to assess student
learning. Techniques such as minute papers, one-sentence summaries, and
application cards are being used to provide quick feedback to the
teaching/learning process. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
