In a world where decisions are increasingly driven by data, data analytics
skills have become an indispensable part of any education that seeks to prepare
its students for the modern workforce. Essential in this skill set is the
ability to work with structured data. The standard "tools of trade" for
manipulating structured data include the venerable and ubiquitous SQL language
as well as popular libraries heavily influenced by relational query languages,
e.g., dplyr for R, DataFrame for pandas and Spark. Learning and debugging
relational queries, however, pose challenges to novices. Even computer science
students with programming backgrounds are often not used to thinking in terms of
logic (e.g., when writing SQL queries) or functional programming (e.g., when
writing queries using operators that resemble relational algebra). This project
proposes to build a system called HNRQ (Helping Novices Learn and Debug
Relational Queries) to address these challenges, by explaining why a query is
wrong, and helping users to fix and learn relational queries in the
process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first step in the project is to automatically
construct small database instances as counterexamples to illustrate why queries
return wrong results, and allow users to trace query execution over these
instances. Going beyond convincing users that the queries are wrong, HNRQ
further aims to guide users towards the next level of understanding---by helping
them generalize from specific counterexamples to semantic descriptions of what
cause wrong results, and by providing useful hints on how to approach the
problems correctly. This ambitious goal will push the boundaries of existing
research and will likely lead to the development of novel methodologies for
providing explanations and hints. The project will make HNRQ general and
practical by embracing the full complexity of real-world query languages and by
delivering interactive performance for users to experiment with changes to
queries and database instances, observe their effects, and obtain automated
feedback and hints all in real time even for complex queries and large
databases. The project plans to evaluate HNRQ not only through user studies but
also by measuring its direct impact on learning outcomes. The project is
committed to making HNRQ open-source and easy to adopt by educators around the
world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
