The goal of this research project is to design and implement a system for
content-based image retrieval that can (1) provide a large variety of image-
distance measures that can be used singly or in combination to satisfy a wide
range of user needs and (2) provide rapid access to images, even in an extremely
large database. The focus of the work is the development of a general, scalable
architecture to support fast querying of very large image databases with user-
specified distance measures. This includes the development of distance-measure-
independent algorithms and data structures for efficient image retrieval from
large databases. Methods for merging the general, distance-measure-independent
algorithms with other useful techniques that may be distance measure specific,
such as keyword retrieval and relational indexing, are being pursued. The
problem of providing users with multiple distance measures of many different
varieties is being studied. New methods for combining distance measures and a
language in which users can specify their queries without detailed knowledge of
the underlying metrics are being designed. A prototype system is being
implemented to test the developed methods, and evaluation is being performed on
both a large general image database and a smaller controlled database. The
results of this research will be: (1) techniques that facilitate rapid retrieval
of images by eliminating huge portions of the image database from the search,
making content-based retrieval feasible on very large and growing databases; (2)
new, high-level methods by which users can combine distance measures to form
meaningful queries, so that content-based queries can become a standard way to
query image databases; and (3) a general framework for content-based retrieval
that can accommodate new distance measures as they are developed by other
research efforts. The work has application to medicine, art, photography,
entertainment, and advertising/marketing.
