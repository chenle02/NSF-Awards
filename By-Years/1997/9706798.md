9706798 Harper The incorporation of ophiolotic rock assemblages that are
believed to have formed on the ocean floor is a tenacious problem that continues
to defy solution. However, some of them can be used to reconstruct the oceanic
environment in which they formed. In such cases they can contribute greatly to
understanding the tectonic processes that lead to their incorporation into upper
crustal sedimentary assemblages. Harper's study using geochemistry,
geochronology, sedimentary provenance and field structure is a well defined one
that will address these questions in the Coast Range ophiolites in southwestern
Oregon. His analytical methods are varied, and the results will bear on the
origin of this ophiolite sequence and on its relationship to other ophiolites in
several structural belts in California.
