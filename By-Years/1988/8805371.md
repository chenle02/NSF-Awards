Continuing his geological research in the Turkana Basin region of Northern
Kenya, Dr. Brown and his colleagues will conduct a detailed study of specific
subareas to determine local paleoenvironmental conditions. Some represent sites
where hominid (human) fossil specimens are exceptionally well preserved while
others are potential sources of hominid materials. Archaeological sites of great
antiquity will also be examined and set in chronological order. Dr. Brown will
provide detailed description of local sections, analyze sediments, and document
lateral variation in lithologies. The goal of the research is not only to date
important localities but also to determine local paleoenvironmental conditions
and reconstruct landscapes at critical periods of time. In this process, Dr.
Brown will also search for additional sites with archaeological and
paleontological remains. The East African Rift Valley in which Dr. Brown will
work is the prime source of evidence which relates to the development of
humanity over the last four million years. Some individual sites have been well
studied but others have not, and Dr. Brown is the first to attempt a
chronological and climatic synthesis. This research contributes to that goal. To
understand the history of human development is important, not only to date
milestones along the road but also to reconstruct the shifting environment in
which humans emerged, since it is clear that species respond to and are shaped
by such fluxuations in their environment. This research will help to accomplish
these goals.
