Kress&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0229871&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will calibrate a
thermodynamic model for sulfur in silicate melts as a function of temperature,
pressure, oxygen fugacity, sulfur fugacity and bulk melt composition. The
resulting model will be applicable to a wide range of problems in igneous
petrology, volcanology, magmatic ore genesis, planetary geology, and metallurgy.
Two categories of experiments will be performed. The first set will study a
variety of silicate melt compositions in a controlled sulfur atmosphere at
super-liquidus temperatures to calibrate a thermodynamic model for sulfur.
Results will be used to incorporate sulfur into Ghiorso and Sack's (1995) MELTS
model. A second set of experiments will determine the partial molar volumes of
sulfide liquid components in the system O-S-Fe-Ni-Cu. These experiments will
employ a modified single-bob Archimedian method to measure density. Results will
be used to calibrate a model for sulfur in silicate liquids at
pressure.&lt;br/&gt;
