In this project funded by the Chemical Structure and Dynamics Program A of the
Chemistry Division, Dr. Craig Murray of University of California, Irvine and his
graduate students are using short and ultrashort laser pulses to explore
interactions of small molecules with light. After absorbing light of
sufficiently high energy, these small molecules dissociate via different
pathways and with different time scales. Detailed information on these processes
is obtained by time-resolved imaging of the products. An outreach program
involves active participation in the research lab of local high school teachers,
providing them with insight into some current research activity. The program
additionally provides a day at university experience for their students,
exposing them to opportunities available to them in higher education. The
program draws connections between fundamental chemical processes studied in the
laboratory and larger scale applications. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project
uses velocity-map (slice) ion imaging coupled to tunable nanosecond and
picosecond laser systems to measure correlated photofragment product state
distributions. With this technique, unconventional photochemical processes in
small gas-phase molecules are explored, such as roaming-mediated intersystem
crossing, multiple roaming pathways and extrusion of atomic or radical species.
Time-resolved measurements using transform-limited picosecond pulses explore how
the correlated product state distributions evolve in time, identifying
characteristic time-scales for roaming, intersystem crossing, and conventional
dissociation mechanisms.
