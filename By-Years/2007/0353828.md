This joint award from the Chemistry Education Program and the Western Europe
Program, Office of International Science and Engineering, supports the
continuation of an international Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)
site at the University of Florida. Randolph Duran and Michael Scott provide
leadership for the site. Over twenty faculty from French institutions are
available to serve as REU mentors for U.S. students. During the award period
(2004-2007), each summer ten students will travel to France to participate in a
10-12 week program at a French research institution, including Universite Pierre
et Marie Curie, University Montpellier, CNRS National Laboratory, and University
of Strasbourg. Through French funding, a similar number of French students,
recruited from the same institutions, will be doing summer research at the
University of Florida. Recruitment for REU student researchers will extend
nationwide. The research topics for the students will center on materials
chemistry. A mid-program science workshop will afford students the opportunity
to hear one or two lectures on a focused topic and to interact scientifically.
Student participants will conclude the program with a project summary
presentation at the French institution where the research is being done and a
science workshop at the University of Florida the following fall. By
participating in this international REU site, the undergraduates will see
research performed in a different manner and within a different cultural context
from the traditional U.S. model. An enhanced evaluation of the program will be a
longitudinal study via interviews and surveys aimed at examining the impact the
international experience has on students' career choices and cultural attitudes.
A chemistry faculty member from Lincoln University will also spend the summer in
France to facilitate the students' integration into their host research group
and serve as a mentor.
