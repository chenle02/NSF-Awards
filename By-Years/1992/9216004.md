The principal objective of our proposed research is to design, analyze and
develop a neural network fuzzy adaptive controller model for complex processes
capable of learning fuzzy control rules using process data and improving its
control through on-line adaption. The learned improvement should be according to
a performance objective function that provides evaluative feedback; this
performance objective should be broadly defined to meet long-range goals over
time. Fuzzy control has proven effective for complex, nonlinear, imprecisely-
defined processes for which standard models and controls are either inefficient,
impractical or cannot be derived. Hitherto, procedures for deriving fuzzy
control, however, have been mostly as hoc heuristics. The learning ability of
neural networks can be used to systematically derive fuzzy control and permit
on- line adaption to optimize control. The operation of neural networks
integrates very naturally with fuzzy logic. The neural networks will be designed
and tested using simulation software and simulated data, followed by realistic
industrial data to the extent possible. The statistical procedures of the
learning process will be investigated and evaluated with standard statistical
procedures (such as ANOVA, graphical analysis of residuals, etc.). The
computational advantage of dynamic programming- like methods of optimal control
will be used to permit on-line fuzzy adaptive control. Tests for the
consistency, completeness and interaction of the control rules, as well as tests
for stability, will be applied. Comparisons to other methods will be made so as
to identify any advantages of the resulting model.
