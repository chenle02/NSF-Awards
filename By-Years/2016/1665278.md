In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamic &amp; Mechanism B
Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Dasan Thamattoor of the Department
of Chemistry at Colby College is developing new approaches to small-ring
compounds containing a triple bond. As the triple bond prefers a linear
geometry, incorporating this feature inside a small ring can lead to
considerable strain. Investigating such strained molecules can teach us about
structure, bonding, energetics, and chemical reactivity. It can lead to the
design of new reactions for the preparations of pharmaceuticals and energetic
materials. The project, which integrates elements of synthetic, mechanistic, and
computational organic chemistry, is designed to provide undergraduates with a
wholesome research experience, and engage them as partners in the scientific
enterprise. In addition, several initiatives to promote the delivery of high
quality education in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) in
the local schools (K-12) will be pursued. This includes providing summer
research opportunities for high school students and partnering with educators in
the elementary, middle, and junior high schools to enhance STEM offerings.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project contains a set of aims, appropriate for an
undergraduate-driven research program, to generate strained cycloalkynes from
new photochemical and thermal sources. These sources are based on
cyclopropanated phenanthrene and indan systems and are to be studied for the
generation of known and new carbocyclic, heterocyclic, and polycyclic alkynes.
Matrix isolation and time-resolved laser flash photolysis will be used to study
the kinetics of the cyclic alkylidenecarbene intermediates. Flash vacuum
pyrolysis will be studied as a complementary approach to the photochemical route
for generating these strained cycloalkynes. The chemistry of strained
cycloalkynes, with respect to the pathways by which they are formed and
consumed, will also be investigated by modern computational methods.
