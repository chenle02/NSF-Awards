Jung's method of complex desingularization does not adopt to nonzero
characteristic because in the complex case the local fundamental group above a
normal crossing of the branch locus is Abelian whereas in nonzero characteristic
it need not even be solvable. This is shown by constructing an unsolvable
surface covering of degree six in characteristic five. Taking a plane section of
this unsolvable surface covering, leads to a conjecture about the structure of
the algebraic fundamental group of an affine algebraic curve over an
algebraically closed ground field of nonzero characteristic. This Affine Curve
Conjecture was settled affirmatively by Harbater and Raynaud. Various
Recognition Theorems of group theory, which played a crucial role in the initial
explorations of this Conjecture, have lead to some progress in a refined version
of this Conjecture over finite ground fields. These Recognition Theorems, have
also lead to some progress in Conjectures about Local and Global algebraic
fundamental groups above normal crossings of branch loci of higher dimensional
algebraic varieties. Another fertile application area for the Recognition
Theorems has been in the direction of Permutation Polynomials and Exceptional
Polynomials. This area, together with Guralnick's very recent work on genus zero
coverings, as well as the theory of Moore-Carlitz-Drinfeld Modules is a rich
source for finding explicit equations with prescribed Galois groups. The
proposer intends to continue his investigations into the application of the
Recognition into these areas of Galois theory.

This research is in the combination of the fields of algebraic geometry and
group theory. Although they are amongst the oldest parts of modern mathematics,
both these fields have had a revolutionary flowering in the past fifty years. In
its origin, algebraic geometry treated figures that could be defined in the
plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Likewise, group theory had
its origin in the study of symmetries. Nowadays, both these fields make use of
methods not only from algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and
conversely they are finding applications in those fields as well as in physics,
theoretical computer science and robotics. Moreover, interplay between algebraic
geometry and group theory continues to enrich both these disciplines.
