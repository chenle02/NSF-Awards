0203760&lt;br/&gt;Balachandran&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This U.S.-Mexico award will
support Dr. A.P. Balachandran and Dr. R.D. Sorkin of Syracuse University
together with Dr. A.B. Stern of the University of Alabama in a research
collaboration with Dr. D. O'Connor and Dr. R. Capovilla of the Centro de
Investigacion y de Estudios Avanzados del IPN (CINVESTAV) in Mexico City,
Mexico. The researchers intend to work on various ideas in the general area of
non-commutative geometry with important applications to quantum physics, string
theory, and relativity theory. The Office of International Science and
Engineering and the Physics Division of NSF will contribute funds for the
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has two components. The first is to
develop an alternative to lattice field theory using emerging ideas from non-
commutative geometry. The approach uses matrix algebras that approximate the
algebra of functions of a space with the approximation becoming finer as the
matrices become larger. The method has the advantage of preserving the
underlying symmetries including chiral and supersymmetry and easily capturing
topological data. This component also incorporates the more complete study of
field theories on non-commutative spaces, with particular emphasis on the
noncommutative Chern-Simons theory. The second component involves the causal set
approach to quantum gravity where the quantum spacetime emerges from a discrete
causal structure. The principal goal of this aspect of the project is to find a
suitable quantum sequential growth dynamics for causal sets. Both components of
the project have a significant numerical component with Monte Carlo simulations
for the first component currently in the calibration stage. The numerical work
is being carried out by the Mexican group, who are experts in the statistical
physics involved, while the US counterparts are experts in the algebraic and
topological aspects of the project. &lt;br/&gt;
