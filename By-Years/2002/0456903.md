"A standard model for medium to heavy-mass nuclei"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our
current knowledge of the structure of atomic nuclei is still far
from&lt;br/&gt;complete as it is mainly rooted on the properties of nuclei in
the vicinity&lt;br/&gt;of the line of beta stability (nuclei with a ratio of
neutron number over&lt;br/&gt;proton number reasonably close to one). For that
reason and because the&lt;br/&gt;understanding of nuclei has a broad range of
application, including&lt;br/&gt;Cosmology and Astrophysics, the physics of
exotic rare isotopes has become&lt;br/&gt;one of the top research priorities
both in the U.S. and worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to accompany the
present development of new rare-isotopes&lt;br/&gt;accelerators around the
world, the goal of the present theoretical project&lt;br/&gt;is to develop a
fully microscopic model of medium to heavy-mass nuclei. It&lt;br/&gt;is quite
urgent to realize such a long-term goal of nuclear structure
since&lt;br/&gt;current best many-body methods are hardly predictive when
applied to unknown&lt;br/&gt;medium-mass isotopes with a large excess of
neutrons. Among several&lt;br/&gt;important features of the project, our goal is
to achieve a better&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the modifications brought about
by the presence of a&lt;br/&gt;neutron-rich environment to the nucleon-nucleon
interaction. This is a key&lt;br/&gt;element to describe accurately medium-mass
neutron-rich nuclei which are of&lt;br/&gt;prime interest to unreveal nucleo-
synthesis scenarii in the universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
