This project provides travel support for U.S. participation in the XXIIIrd
International Conference on Photonic, Electronic, and Atomic Collisions, which
is to be held in Stockholm, during July 23-29, 2003. Support is limited to those
U.S. scientists who are students or hold junior research positions in an
academic, governmental, or industrial institution. Awards will be based on the
anticipated contribution by the individual to the success of conference. Due to
the strong presence of non-US, particularly European scientists in this field,
this award fulfills a critical need for students and young researchers in this
area to meet and begin networking with their international counterparts
