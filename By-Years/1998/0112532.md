Duffy &lt;br/&gt;0112532 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will develop
new theoretical techniques and conduct new high pressure and temperature
experiments to examine the melting curves, crystal structures, and high-
temperature equations of state (EOS) of the following materials: MgO, SiO2,
MgSiO3, and Au. They will accomplish this by developing a major extension of the
density functional theory - molecular dynamics (DFT-MD) method and applying it
to minerals of the Earth's deep mantle. The approach is to develop empirical
"optimal" potentials from the results of a DFT-MD simulation. This optimal
potential can then be used in further calculations involving much larger systems
and longer run durations. From this, the investigators can determine crystal
structures, melting curves, liquid viscosities, compressibilities, elastic
constants and other thermoelastic properties directly at lower mantle P-T
conditions. They will also carry out detailed comparison of their simulation
results with laser-heated synchrotron experiments on MgO, SiO2, and Au to assess
the reliability of the OP method. In particular, they will focus on measurements
of melting curves of these materials at high pressure to provide a sensitive
test of the optimal potential calculations.
