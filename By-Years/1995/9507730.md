This project involves the dissertation research of a student from the
University of California-Davis. The project is to study marriage strategies of
traditional people in Nepal. The student will examine monogamous, fraternal
polyandrous, and polygynandrous marriages, examining the decision rules used to
guide people into each type of marriage. The methods will include household
survey censuses, retrospective fertility and marital histories, and in-depth
interviews. The student will test hypotheses that individuals will select
marriage forms that enhance their individual economic positions with
consequences for their behavioral ecological fitness. This research is important
because it adds to our understanding of alternative forms of marriage, which are
increasingly rare in the world. In addition the project trains a social
scientist in research methods and enhances our knowledge of this exotic but
important region of the world.
