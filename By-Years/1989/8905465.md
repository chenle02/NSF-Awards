Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to modern NMR spectroscopy is essential to
chemists and biologists who are carrying out frontier research. The Department
of Chemistry at Marquette University will use this award from the Chemical
Instrumentation Program and the Instrumentation and Instrument Development
Program to help acquire a high-field NMR spectrometer. The areas of research
that will be enhanced by the acquisition include: 1) Protein control of heme
reactivity 2) Vibrational spectra of hemoprotein model compounds 3) Models of
assimilatory and dissimilatory nitrite reductase 4) Photochemistry of
unsaturated organosilanes 5) Organic synthesis via organometallic methodology 6)
Photochemical and photophysical studies of polypyridine complexes of Ruthenium
(II).
