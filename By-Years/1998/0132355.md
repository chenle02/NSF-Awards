The e-Print Archive has been a major advance in the dissemination of scientific
research. It has effectively transformed the research communication
infrastructure of multiple fields of physics and other scientific communities.
It has been in operation since 1991 and has recently moved its base from Los
Alamos National Labs to Cornell University. It has experienced continuous growth
and has become in such general use that the APS and the University of California
Digital Library have become mirror sites. Other scientific research areas are
utilizing the archiving system as well. The number of submissions are over
20,000 per year and the site processes about 3 million transactions per month.
The project has positively influenced the process and progress of scientific
research and can be credited with many of the innovations in the electronic
transfer and sharing of scientific information. It provides rapid access to
current research at both larger and smaller research institutions and allows
fuller participation in research by developing countries. It represents research
at the leading edge of electronic dissemination of scientific information and
continues to provide a service of great value to a number of scientific
disciplines. Its continued development will have a strong influence on
scientific advances in many disciplines.
