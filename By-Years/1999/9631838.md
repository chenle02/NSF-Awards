9631838 Ewing In this project, tropospheric aerosols will be studied using
infrared spectroscopy. Sea salt aerosol particles will be generated and studied
in the laboratory under conditions that mimic those in the troposphere both in
high and mid-latitudes. Chemical transformation of these aerosols by nitrogen
oxides and acids of nitrogen oxides will be followed by infrared spectroscopy.
The object is to unravel the temperature and humidity dependent mechanisms by
which aerosols containing sodium chloride are transformed into sodium nitrate
with the release of chemically active chlorine. Adsorbed layers of water
influence the chemistry on salt particle surfaces even under arid conditions.
The properties of the salt-water interface will be studied. Aerosol salt
solution droplets, common to the marine boundary layer, will also be
investigated. Spectroscopic experiments to study the uptake of sulfur dioxide in
aerosols of water and ice particles are planned. ***
