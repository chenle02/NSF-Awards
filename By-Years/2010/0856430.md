The research objectives are to (a) bring together researchers and engineers at
various stages in their careers to discuss recent advances in experimental
mechanics and the role that is being played by non-contacting measurement
methods, including full-volume measurements (e.g., computer aided tomography),
general surface motions (e.g. stereo-vision) and simulation methods integrated
with experimental measurements, (b) serve as a catalyst for international
collaboration and partnership in the broader area of experimental mechanics and
(c) provide participants with the opportunity to view and use modern, vision-
based technology to make quantitative measurements. To meet these objectives,
(a) internationally recognized research scientists and engineers will serve on
the organizing committee and (b) outstanding investigators in non-contacting
methods will be provided partial travel support to ensure their active
participation via an invited presentation.&lt;br/&gt; The growth and development
of digital imaging technology, coupled with extraordinary advances in
computational and image processing technology, is culminating in a wide range of
vision-based, non-contacting measurement methods, providing the impetus for this
Workshop and Symposium. Educational efforts will include (a) broad dissemination
of the time and place for the symposium via email, direct personal contact and
professional society distributions (e.g., the Society for Experimental
Mechanics), (b) special encouragement to young investigators to attend via small
travel grants, (c) direct access to vision equipment and technology for hands-on
experience, and (d) dissemination of the results from symposium in the form of
proceedings (CD-ROM, print) and, for those cases where high quality papers are
available, publication in archival outlets such as the Journals of Strain and
Experimental Mechanics. &lt;br/&gt;
