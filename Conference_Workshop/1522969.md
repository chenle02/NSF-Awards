This award supports participation in the conference "Clifford Lectures on
Algebraic Groups: Structure and Actions" held March 2-5, 2015 at Tulane
University in New Orleans, Louisiana. The conference will stimulate research on
the interplay between geometry and number theory. An important goal of this
conference is to prepare graduate students for research in the areas of
algebraic group theory, algebraic geometry, and number theory, in particular to
suggest thesis projects. The Clifford Lecture Series is a medium-sized
conference and it provides ample opportunities for its participants to interact
with each other. This atmosphere is invaluable especially for graduate students
and junior researchers new to the field. It is anticipated that the meeting will
lead to active collaborations between the participants, including students and
faculty from non-Ph.D.-granting institutions.

The main speaker is Michel Brion (University of Grenoble, France). His talks
focus on the structure and actions of algebraic groups over arbitrary fields,
the applications of algebraic group theory to algebraic geometry (automorphism
groups and their birational analogues) and number theory, and various aspects of
homogeneous varieties and their equivariant embeddings (algebra, algebraic
combinatorics, geometry).
