The proposed 3-day worshop (to be held in Honolulu, Hawaii, February 23-26,
2014) focuses on the combustion of methane hydrate and CO2 sequestration under
the deep-ocean condition, where high-pressures and high-temperature combustion
takes place involing multiphase fuel-oxygen-nitrogen environment. It will have
participation from US and Pacific Rim researchers while involving 5 US graduate
students and/or post-doctoral fellows. The requested fund is used exclusively
for supporting these students. The educational impact and the benefit of
preparating next generation researchers and engineers are significant.
