The use of ultrasonic standing waves to facilitate the production of mammalian
cell-cell hybrids has been demonstrated. However, no evidence has been presented
to show that such hybrids are cultivable or functional. The proposal seeks
support to create mouse-mouse hybridomas by electroacoustic fusion and by
electrofusion, to culture the resulting hybridomas for determination of relative
yield by each method, and to determine whether such hybridomas secrete
antibodies. Electroacoustic fusion allows the use of physiological solutions in
contrast to electrofusion which requires potentially harmful hypotonic media,
and conventional polyethylene glycol fusion which employs toxic organic
compounds. Electroacoustic fusion, therefore, offers the possibility of
producing greater yields of viable, functional hybridomas.
