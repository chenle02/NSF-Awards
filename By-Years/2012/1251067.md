The Capture, Analyze, and Prevent Bugs (CAP Bugs) project at Utah State
University educates students to proactively avoid bugs by collecting and
classifying data about mistakes made by novice programmers. Bug data is shared
with students and faculty. As a result, students feel less isolated and more
confident and faculty members are given the means to promptly address issues in
their courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project includes a web application that
recommends bugs to avoid in the future based on bugs logged by students; a
website that contains videos and exercises about how to identify common bugs,
why they occur, and how to fix them; and course materials based on real bugs
from real students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, a system for software
testing competitions is under development. Testing competitions provide an
alternative to programming competitions, targeting students with problem solving
skills, but lacking extensive programming experience. The software testing
competitions appeal to a broader audience and attract women, underrepresented
minority students and students with limited exposure to programming.
