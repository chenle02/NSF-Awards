9712497 Klibanov The surprising observation that enzyme catalysis can be carried
out in essentially nonaqueous systems has opened a major opportunity for
biocatalysis. Dr. Klibanov has played a major role in this area. Apparently,
little structure/activity work has been done in these systems. This proposal
aims at studying the structure/activity relationships of crystalline (and
sometimes crosslinked) enzymes in nonaqueous systems. The x-ray crystal
structures of two model enzymes, as well as their intermediate complexes, will
be elucidated and correlated with catalytic properties and stability. Reasons
for diminished activity in non-aqueous solvents and for solvent effects on
stereoselectivity will be sought. We believe that this work will have a
significant impact on the economical production of important specialty chemicals
such as chiral drugs and intermediate. This award is co- supported by the
