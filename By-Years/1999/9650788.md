This project involves development of a small computer laboratory for use in
conjunction with upper-level physics courses. Physics is a field of education
which develops understanding of the physical universe; however, the need for
mathematical formalism often confounds the student to such an extent that the
physical interpretation of events is not obvious. This computer laboratory is
being used to help students make the relationships between physical events and
the mathematical equations used to describe them. The laboratory is making
computer hardware and software available to all the students, thereby leveling
the playing field between students who have personal computers and those who do
not. It frees students to spend most of their time developing an understanding
of physics and not learning to use a computer.
