This project is to extend studies of S isotope systematics to other continental
hydrothermal systems, making use of new drillcores and fluid samples from active
geothermal systems as well as fossil epithermal gold deposits. The PI will
examine the general systematics of sulfur isotopic zoning of sulfide minerals in
response to boiling and other forms of fluid immiscibility in ore-forming
environments. The generality of the proposed parallel effects on precious metals
deposition will also be tested at several localaties. In addition to the Valles
Caldera, the Geysers and Coso geothermal fields in California offer two active
settings where boiling and precious metals deposition occur. Additionally, the
McLaughlin and Cactus Queen gold deposits in California offer two fossil
epithermal systems where similar systematics may have existed during ore
genesis.
