More than 100 of the world's brightest and most motivated high school students
will gather in Pittsburgh in July 2011 for the 9th International Linguistics
Olympiad. Unlike math and science Olympiads, which focus on material students
have already mastered, linguistics Olympiads introduce new material through
logic puzzles in languages unfamiliar to the students. In the course of solving
a puzzle, the students can discover something about the grammar or sounds of a
language, its conceptual system, its culture, or its historical relationship to
other languages. In addition to fostering insight into human linguistic and
cultural diversity, this competition fosters meta-linguistic reasoning that is
essential for computer science, language technologies, and indeed any career
involving analytical problem-solving skills and the ability to present a logical
argument supported by data. Because it has been the tradition of linguistics
Olympiads to assign half of the score for the written explanation of the answer,
the contests also encourage the ability to clearly present a hypothesis and
explain how it is supported by the data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More information
