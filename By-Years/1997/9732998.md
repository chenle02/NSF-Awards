Professor Anne McCoy of Ohio State University is supported by a CAREER grant
from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to examine
theoretically the photodissociation and reaction dynamics of elementary systems
composed of several atoms. A general approach will be developed to approximate
the quantum effects of large systems by treating a few degrees of freedom
quantum mechanically and the remainder of the system classically. This method
will be applied to a number of systems where detailed experimental data exist.
Novel educational ideas will be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate
courses, including cooperative learning environments in lectures and
recitations, and use of the world wide web for information dissemination via
course homepages. By probing photodissociation and reaction dynamics under
conditions where comparisons to experiments can be made, an important step is
made in the connection between gas phase phenomena and more complicated
chemistry occuring in the condensed phase. To make chemistry more relevant to
students, they will be actively encouraged to think about concepts and their
implications, rather than specific problem-solving techniques.
