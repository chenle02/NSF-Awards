9526710 Morgan The PI proposes to develop an experimental capability to measure
electrokinetic streaming potential data of the cross-coupling coefficient (volts
per pressure difference) and the associated approximation of the water/mineral
surface potential at in situ P/T conditions for whole rock samples. Most of the
values presently available were obtained at ambient conditions or on crushed
rock at elevated temperatures. These will be the first streaming potential data
to be collected on a suite of earth materials in contact with varying chemical
solutions at elevated P/T conditions of the earth's crust. These data are
essential for understanding the role of water in subsurface processes, and will
have many engineering and environmental applications related to ground water
monitoring, oil-well pumping patterns, electroseismic effects and possibly as
electromagnetic earthquake precursors, as well as scientific applications in
fracture mechanics, seismic attenuation, electrical impedance modeling. ***
