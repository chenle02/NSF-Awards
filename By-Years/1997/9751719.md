During the past 7 years, the Department of Physics has made two major reforms in
its laboratory program for the introductory calculus-based physics course. The
first effort in 1989 involved the introduction of the microcomputer-based
laboratory (MBL) tools into instruction in the first quarter of the course. The
second effort built on the first and extended the use of the MBL tools into the
second and third quarters. In addition, a series of new activities were
developed in which students first acquired important concepts of physics using a
guided-inquiry approach. Students then in later laboratories used these concepts
quantitatively to solve more complex experiment problems. The innovations
supported by the present project permit integration of interactive simulations
and multimedia into this laboratory learning system. These simulation activities
supplement the experiments and allow more efficient use of the limited time that
is available to achieve learning objectives. The simulations that accompany real
experiments build student confidence in the authenticity of the simulated world.
By observing multiple representations of processes, students have a better
chance of developing imagery and intuition for the abstract symbolic
representations used in physics. By observing a complex process in slow motion,
they become better at breaking it in parts, solving the parts, and reassembling
them to answer the big questions. By predicting how the change in a parameter
affects a process, they become better at reasoning about physical processes. In
summary, the supplementary simulations help students see how the computer can be
a useful modeling tool for real-world processes.
