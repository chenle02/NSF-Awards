Baculoviruses, insect viruses, are the focus of intense interest because of
their remarkable ability to hyperexpress and process foreign eukaryotic genes
and their potential use as insecticides. Despite this widespread interest, the
mechanism by which baculoviruses replicate is unknown. This proposal is based
upon recent work in our laboratory which identified and characterized the
origins of replication from two baculoviruses genomes, the first time such
sequences have been identified. The long term goal of this project is to use
plasmids containing replication origin sequences to develop a detailed
understanding of the mechanism by which DNA is replicated in baculoviruses. This
includes the characterization of the structure of the origins of DNA
replication, the identification of genes necessary to the process, and
elucidating the function of those genes. Since the transcription of the late
genes is dependent upon DNA replication, the results of this work should also
make it possible to elucidate the processes involved in late transcription. %%%
Information derived from this project will not only enhance our understanding of
a basic biological mechanism but will also be of practical use, in that it will
facilitate the design of recombinant baculovirus for use as expression vectors
and as insecticides.
