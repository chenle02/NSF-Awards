This award in the Chemistry Division provides three years of support for a
Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in the Chemistry Department,
University of Minnesota. The site will be coordinated by Dr. Louis M. Pignolet.
Ten students will spend 10 weeks involved in independent research projects in
all areas of chemistry. The students' laboratory experiences will be
supplemented by weekly faculty-run seminars covering modern research topics,
round-table `progress reports` attended by all student participatnts, and
research discussions within individual research groups. All students prepare a
report of their research project in the form of a poster display or oral
presentation at the end of the summer. Travel is provided for some students to
present a paper at a major national chemistry meeting during the next academic
year
