Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will include numerical
studies of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), and
Quantum Gravity. Quantum Chromodynamics is the theory of the strong nuclear
force, Quantum Electrodynamics is the theory of the electromagnetic force and
Quantum Gravity seeks to explain the gravitational force. The present project
will develop a practical simulation method for massless quarks in QCD, an
algorithm to simulate QCD in environments rich in protons and neutrons, and will
determine whether several conventional field theories, including QED, are
consistent. Massless quarks and the generation of dynamical masses are essential
ingredients in understanding the properties of nuclei. The physics of
environments rich in protons and neutrons underlies nuclear physics and should
explain the properties of dense stars. The consistency, or lack thereof, of
field theories used to build models of strong, weak, electromagnetic and
gravitational interactions will determine the directions of elementary particle
physics in the near future.
