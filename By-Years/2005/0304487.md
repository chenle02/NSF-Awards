This Nanotechnology in Undergraduate Education (NUE) award, funded by the
Division of Materials Research, the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the
Division of Chemistry, supports Dr. A.B. Western, Rose-Hulman Institute of
Technology, Dr. T.F. George, U. of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, and Dr. G. Zhang,
Indiana State U., to create a sophomore-level course that introduces technical
students to the field of nanoscience. The course focuses on emerging
applications of materials and devices created on the atomic level, as well as
fundamental properties. Engineering aspects of manufacturing on the nanoscale
are introduced along with experimental techniques used to study entities that
may be only a few atoms in size.

The team of educators and researchers also develops a textbook and electronic
ancillary package for the course. The electronic archive of instructional
materials related to nanoscience includes images, simulations, and computer
programs to enhance visualization and is made available through the National
Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Educational Digital Library.
