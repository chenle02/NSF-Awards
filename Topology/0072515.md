Abstract

The proposers are interested in geometric and topological properties of
hyperbolic 3-manifolds arising from the Bianchi groups, and more generally in
the properties of arithmetically-defined 3-manifolds. The proposers intend to
unify two of the main themes of research in this area, namely, the cuspidal
cohomology problem with non-trivial coefficients, and the enumeration and
description of immersed totally geodesic surfaces. The proposers intend to
explore possible connections between non-vanishing results in cuspidal
cohomology and generalized bending deformations supported on totally geodesic
surfaces.



The Bianchi groups are particularly interesting mathematical objects as they
lie at the crossroads of several distinct area of pure mathematics: number
theory, infinite group theory, geometry, and topology. They have been studies
from these diverse points of view for more than one hundred years. Certain
three-dimensional spaces arise in a natural way from the Bianchi groups; these
spaces come equipped with a "hyperbolic geometry". This, in a nutshell, means
that pairs of straight lines generically diverge from one another unlike
Euclidean geometry. Three-dimensional spaces with a hyperbolic geometry are
central to the study of general three-dimensional spaces as they represent, in a
certain sense, the "generic" examples. Hyperbolic spaces are among the most
difficult to understand, and therefore the proposers aim to elucidate the
geometry of these important examples mentioned above.
