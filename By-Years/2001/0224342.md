FMRI Analysis of Emotion Regulation and Its Developmental
Trajectory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With National
Science Foundation support, Dr. Gabrieli and colleagues will conduct a three-
year investigation of the maturation of the brain systems that support emotion
regulation using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a noninvasive
technique that can identify brain regions recruited for specific emotion and
cognition processes. Children and young adults, ages 8 to 30, will participate
in two experiments that examine how they regulate an initial emotional response
to either highly negative or highly positive photos. These studies will identify
what brain regions initially respond to negative or positive emotional
experiences, and what brain regions then support cognitive regulation of those
emotional responses. Of greatest interest is how these brain responses mature,
or change, from late childhood through early
adulthood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Emotion regulation, the subject of this
research, is a fundamental aspect of human experience and behavior, and the
interaction between thoughts (cognition) and feelings (emotions) that guides how
people evaluate and act on what is going on around them. Successful emotion
regulation makes people resilient to difficult circumstances, and thus can help
people avoid distress or psychiatric diseases such as major depression.
Successful regulation also promotes prosocial behaviors, such as not behaving
violently in response to feelings of anger. It is generally thought that
children and adolescents have emotions as strongly felt as do adults, but that
the cognitive regulation of emotion matures slowly as children and adolescents
learn how to regulate their feelings in ways that promote positive social
interaction and long-term mental health. Risky behaviors that pose severe health
threats for adolescents may reflect the faster maturation of emotion than
cognitive aspects of emotion regulation. Although emotion regulation is thus
important for health and for social functioning, little is known about its
underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms. For example, it is unknown whether
people use the same brain systems to regulate negative and positive emotions.
Further, nothing is known about how these mechanisms support the normal
maturation of emotion regulation in childhood and adolescents. The findings from
this research may also illuminate the roots of mental diseases that reflect a
disadvantageous development of emotion regulation pathways of the human
brain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
