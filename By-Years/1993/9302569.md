Every four years, the International Congress of the History of Science is
convened. This 19th meeting is being held in Zaragoza Spain from August 22 to
29. This award partially supports the international travel costs of at least 23
American researchers in the fields of history of science and technology and the
social studies of science and technology. US researchers play a
disproportionately large role in the development of science and technology
studies today. It is important that the strength and vitality of US scholarship
be demonstrated at these meetings. More important, however, is the chance to
expose US researchers to the leading researchers in science and technology
studies from Europe, Asia, Africa and South America. Spain provides an ideal
site for such an international meeting at a time when the discovery by Europeans
of new worlds is being reflected upon. The exchange of ideas and approaches
among international scholars and the professional contacts which will be
established at this meeting promise to enliven and strength research around the
world.
