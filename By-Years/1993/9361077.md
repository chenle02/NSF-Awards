9361077 Achaerkar There are many applications for a tunable coherent 390 nm to
3.5 um source but there are no tunable laser sources and very few discrete laser
lines in this region. By using a titanium sapphire laser and frequency doubling
there is limited tunability but this approach suffers for poor conversion
efficiency, large size and weight. In this Phase I study, Schwartz Electro-
Optics, Inc. (SEO) proposes a Cr:LiSAF laser operating at 0.78-1.0 um as a pump
laser for an Optical Parametric Oscillator (OPO) and a Second Harmonic Generator
(SHG) for the generation of 0.39-3.5 um tunable source. SEO manufactures a high
power flashlamp pumped Q-switched Cr:LiSAF laser (model Laser 1-2-3). For this
study this laser will be used at no cost to the program. The concept of pumping
Cr:LiSAF with a laser diode to reduce laser size and weight and improve
reliability will be evaluated. In Phase II program, the diode pumped, all solid
state, broadly tunable laser source will be used in the desiqn, fabrication, and
test of a DIAL system for remote sensing. *** .
