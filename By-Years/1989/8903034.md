The goal of this project is to develop knowledge-based environments for
supporting group coordination. The PI builds on his earlier experience with the
Information Lens (an intelligent system that helps people find, filter, and sort
electronic messages) in developing more powerful and flexible tools to support a
wide variety of coordination processes. The research builds on a prototype
system. The new work will integrate many of the important features of (a)
object-oriented databases, (b) hypertext, (c) electronic messaging, and (d)
intelligent rule-based agents. The system will allow unsophisticated computer
users to create or modify their own cooperative work applications using three
key primitives: semistructured objects, customizable folders, and semiautonomous
agents. The researchers experiment with a variety of applications in this
environment such as: (a) intelligent tracking of tasks for project management,
(b) managing design changes in engineering groups, (c) group decision making,
and (d) collaborative authoring. In developing these applications, the existing
prototype will be augmented with more knowledge of objects, more knowledge of
processes, and more kinds of agents. The significance of this work is in making
electronic mail systems more flexible and easier to use. It is especially
promising for alleviating the burden of managing large electronic mail files by
organizing and prioritizing messages.
