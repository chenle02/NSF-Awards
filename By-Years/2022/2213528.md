This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2). In this project, funded by the Mathematical and
Physical Sciences Directorate and housed in the Chemistry Division, Professor
Michael Ferracane and his students at University of Redlands will study the
structure, properties, and opioid activities of a series of related cyclic
peptides. This research will improve fundamental knowledge of cyclic peptide
structure while assessing the scaffold’s therapeutic potential. Notably, the
project will integrate new software/equipment into research and coursework at
Redlands, and it will provide six undergraduate students from underrepresented
groups with the opportunity to (1) engage in research projects on and off
campus, (2) participate in a series of scaffolded professional development
exercises, and (3) mentor similar students through on-campus
programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Ferracane and his students will assess
the structure-activity relationship of cyclic tetrapeptides to better understand
their chemical structure, properties, and potential as opioid therapeutics. They
will perform chemical synthesis, NMR analysis, and molecular modeling as well as
a series of assays that measure solubility, membrane permeability, and opioid
receptor binding. It is believed that distinct conformations impart a peptide
with the ability to be soluble in water, passively permeate membranes, and bind
the opioid receptors. The combined work will illuminate how a cyclic
tetrapeptide’s unique sequence and environment affect its overall conformational
landscape and then relate these findings to measured properties and opioid
activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
