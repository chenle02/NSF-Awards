The research entails investigations into the study of the moduli space of Yang-
Mills fields on 4-manifolds using techniques of topology and the geometric
theory of partial differential equations. This research should lead to a deeper
understanding of the quantum theoretic background to minimization of action
functionals. As such, there are potential applications to quantum theory and
space-time physics.
