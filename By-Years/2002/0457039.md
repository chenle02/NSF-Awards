This experimental research program will shed light on the nature of parity
nonconserving (PNC) interactions inside the nucleus, via the study of nuclear
anapole moments. A deviation of the measured results from theoretical
expectations could serve as evidence for new phenomena at an energy scale beyond
that directly accessible to any planned accelerator; or could change our
understanding of how electroweak physics is modified in the presence of nuclear
matter. The proposed technique is related to previous studies of atomic PNC, but
uses diatomic molecules rather than atoms to achieve a dramatic increase in
sensitivity. The small energy splittings and the narrow spectral lines
associated with hyperfine/rotational structure in molecules enhance the size of
weak interaction effects by several orders of magnitude. This will make it
possible for the first time to observe nuclear spin-dependent PNC effects from
many different nuclei, over a wide range of mass numbers A, carrying both
valence protons and valence neutrons. The ability to combine many observations
will make it possible to completely characterize the different contributions to
nuclear spin-dependent PNC effects. The broader impact of the program will
involve extensive student training as well as several collaborations. This award
is funded jointly through the Atomic, Molecular, Optical and Plasma Physics
Program and the Nuclear Physics Program in the Physics Division.
