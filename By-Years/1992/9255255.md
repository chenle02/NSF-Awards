This study conducts further analysis of teacher background characteristics and
student performance outcomes. A relationship between teacher coursework and
student outcomes had been demonstrated in a previous analysis of the NELS:88
teacher transcript files by this researcher. The current project expands upon
these findings by incorporating an analysis of teacher background and student
performance outcomes within a broader conceptual framework. It also seeks to
improve the statistical validity of the analysis, improve the transcript-based
measures of teacher quality, and uses additional variables from the NELS:88 data
files to test alternative hypotheses concerning student outcomes.
