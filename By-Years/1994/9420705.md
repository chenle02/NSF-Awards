94-20705 Smyth The Principal Investigator will conduct a theoretical study of
the dynamics, structure, and escape of Io's atmosphere. The objective is two-
fold: To understand (1) the vertical transport dynamics and gross structure of
the satellite's atmosphere and (2) the escape rate and velocity distribution of
neutral gases at the satellite's exobase. The long-term goal is detailed
aeronomy studies that include multi-species chemistry. The work will couple
1-dimensional (1-D) hydrodynamic models of the lower atmosphere with kinetic
models of the middle and upper atmospheric regions. A 2-D description will be
developed for the mid-levels to determine the interactions of the co-rotating
heavy-ion plasma flow with the neutral lower atmosphere. The chemistry of such
chemical species as sodium, potassium, sulfur, and sulfur oxides will be
considered. This project will further our understanding of Io's atmosphere, the
interactions of the atmosphere with the magnetospheric plasma, the nature and
composition of the heavy ion sources for Jupiter's plasma torus, and the effect
of these gases on the satellite's magnetosphere. **
