In many plant communities, the most important interactions occur below ground.
It is here that up to 80% of the plant mass is located, as roots, and these
roots play a significant role in determining the composition and diversity of
species in plant communities. Understanding belowground community structure and
the mechanisms of root competition has been hampered, to date, by the inability
to identify roots by species. This research will develop DNA markers to identify
species and quantify their abundance in mixed root samples. These markers will
be validated in a set of experiments addressing fundamental questions about how
root competition, particularly for spatially patchy resources, affects
individual plant foraging behavior and the diversity and relative abundance of
species in mixtures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The molecular methods developed will
provide essential tools for other research that requires an understanding of
belowground structure in plant communities. This work will strengthen
interdisciplinary partnerships by bringing together faculty specializing in
ecology and genomics. Also, four students, three undergraduates and one graduate
student, will conduct original research.
