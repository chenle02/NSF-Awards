9724825 Whitehead This Americas Program award will fund a collaborative research
project between Dr. John A. Whitehead, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,
Massachusetts, and Dr. Sergey N. Bulgakov, Universidad de Guadalajara, Mexico,
to conduct laboratory experiments that will shed further light on deep ocean
circulation. The investigators will examine the flow driven by subjecting
rotating cylinders of water to different temperatures along the top, side and
bottom boundaries, in order to characterize length and velocity scales of the
resulting flow. Comparison of the experimental results with theory will be made
over a wide range of parameters, including simple linear theories, numerical
models, and measurements of circulation being done in the Sea of Japan. The
project, motivated by the thesis work of Dr. Bulgakov, has already produced
encouraging results from earlier experiments. The collaboration with Dr.
Whitehead, a leader in applying experimental results to real oceanographic and
geophysical problems, has the potential to provide significant insight on a
number of important geophysical issues. ***
