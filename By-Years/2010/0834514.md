As the scale and complexity of parallel systems continue to grow, failures are
inevitable. For years research focused on pre-failure prediction and tolerance -
predicting failures and taking precautionary actions before failure occurrence.
Despite progress on failure prediction, unexpected failures occur in practice,
especially in modern systems with unprecedented sizes and complexities. Relying
on pre-failure prediction and tolerance alone is insufficient for fault
management because of the inevitability of failures. Just as failures need to be
carefully avoided and managed when they occur, post-failure diagnosis and
recovery is of equal importance and has a profound impact on almost every aspect
of parallel computing. The goal of this research project is to develop RAPS, a
Recovery Aware Parallel computing System for post-failure diagnosis and
recovery. The research focuses on how to quickly and effectively resume parallel
computing after a failure has occurred. The ultimate goal is to seamlessly
integrate post-failure diagnosis and recovery with pre-failure prediction and
tolerance as a compound fault management solution for parallel computing. The
approach consists of (1) development of new diagnosis mechanisms for fast
failure detection and root cause analysis, (2) development of system-wide
orchestration for recovery coordination, (3) design of new recovery techniques
for quick restoration of parallel applications, and (4) a comprehensive
evaluation. The results of this project can significantly improve the
productivity of parallel systems. This project also enhances the CS curriculum
at IIT and broadens the participation by underrepresented groups.
