Precision measurements of the properties of elementary particles play an
important role in testing the validity of quantum electrodynamics (QED).
Professor Gabrielse is measuring precisely the natural frequencies of a single
electron confined in a specially constructed charged-particle trap. He will
measure the electron magnetic moment, and exploit the one-electron cyclotron
oscillator to study hysteresis adn bistability in this particularly simple
system exhibiting nonlinearity.
