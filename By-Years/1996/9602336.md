Cornell University is the recipient of ARI funding for the renovation of the
Molecular Beam Expitaxy (MBE) facility into a class 1000 clean room. Located in
the Department of Electrical Engineering, and housed in Phillips Hall, this
laboratory is presently dedicated to compound semiconductor research using MBE
for material synthesis. The facility plays an integral role in engineering, and
serves several departments in addition to other Universities. Compound
semiconductor wafers from the facility are used for research into faster
transistors, improved semiconductor lasers and new understanding of fundamental
semiconductor physics. Interdisciplinary research is expanding due to thrusts
into III-nitride semiconductors. The operation of the MBE machines is limited by
the lack of proper temperature and humidity control, and poor air cleanliness
due to irreparable failure of air-handling equipment and improper facility
design and operation. Once renovated, the MBE facility will impact research by
improving wafer yield, and higher material quality that will permit
collaborations with industry that are presently not feasible. User safety will
improve by removing the conditions of heat and humidity that currently serve as
a dangerous diversion in a laboratory where hazardous chemical and machines are
used. Outdated facilities, including antiquated fume hood and safety showers,
will be replaced and ADA compliant. The renovated research space will house more
students and visiting scientists, and will be able to accommodate the growth in
undergraduate research and new graduate level research courses. This project
will enhance the strong reputation of Cornell's MBE program as it continues to
attract the interest of scientists throughout the country who need access to
compound semiconductor materials to meet stringent research requirements.
