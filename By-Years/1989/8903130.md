This project is to study the stresses and strains in the vicinity of a
concentrated load acting on an elastic plate. Obviously, concentrated loads do
not exist in the real world, but it is important to study what happens as the
distributed load becomes more and more concentrated. The project hopes to show
that classical plate theory is much better than the current literature world
suggest.
