This collaborative proposal concerns the investigation of nonlinear, dispersive
wave phenomena described by the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation and its
physical applications, particularly in two-dimensional shallow water waves. The
KP equation admits a particular solution called line-soliton, which is a steady
propagating wave with high amplitude, like a beach wave. Broadly speaking, the
project has two main goals that are interrelated, namely, (i) to study
combinatorial and geometric aspects of the solution space of the KP solitons,
and (ii) to develop an asymptotic theory where the KP equation as the leading
order equation for real applications in two-dimensional wave phenomena. Detailed
analytical and numerical studies of the interactions, stability and initial
value problem of the KP solitons will be carried out in this project. The
theoretical results will be carefully compared with experimental measurements.

Preliminary work suggests that some of these newly discovered solutions of the
KP equation may have important physical applications such as the Mach reflection
of an oblique incidence wave onto a vertical wall and in the generation of large
amplitude "rogue" waves in shallow water near a beach. An objective of this
research is to apply the results of this project in order to investigate
possible mechanisms generating waves of extremely high elevations frequently
observed in open seas and along coastlines, for example, tsunamis. Understanding
the nature and dynamics of such extreme waves, and ultimately predicting such
wave phenomena in oceans near highly populated coastal areas are significant and
urgent tasks. The proposed research activities will involve several
undergraduate and graduate students who will gain first-hand research experience
in applied mathematics. Since the theory is shared by various other physical
systems, it is anticipated that the results from the proposed work would provide
insights into areas such as light waves in nonlinear optics, and spin waves in
magnetic thin films.
