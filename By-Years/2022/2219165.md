This award is funded in whole under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public
Law 117-2). The foundations of a new partnership between the University of Texas
Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV) and the McDonald Observatory of the University of
Texas at Austin will be established. This program will provide students from a
Hispanic-Serving Institution (UTRGV) the opportunity to carry out research at a
world-class astronomical observatory. The McDonald Observatory is home to eight
professional telescopes including the 11-m Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET), the
largest optical telescope in North America. The Observatory is located in the
Davis Mountains of West Texas, which offer some of the darkest night skies in
the 48 contiguous states.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UTRGV students will be trained in
optical photometry and spectroscopy with state-of-the-art astronomical
instrumentation at McDonald Observatory. Using the McDonald telescopes to take
imaging data for a few selected nearby galaxies, students will make a systematic
study to determine the nova rate of nearby galaxies, a rate which is currently
poorly constrained. Novae are particularly luminous astronomical transient
events and nova rates of nearby galaxies give an insight on stellar evolution
and in particular stellar population synthesis models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
