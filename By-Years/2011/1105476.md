The PI's research will focus on the following three issues. The first is whether
the Heegaard genus of a hyperbolic 3-manifold is determined by the rank of its
fundamental group. There, he will try to find examples where these differ via a
computer search along several different avenues, including among congruence
covers of arithmetic 3-manifolds where there is concrete control on the genus.
The second goal is to understand the computational complexity of certain
topological questions, and in particular whether there is a polynomial-time
algorithm to determine the genus of a knot in the 3-sphere. The third project is
to explain why certain twisted Alexander polynomials are so good at detecting
topological properties by connecting them to the Culler-Shalen theory of
character varieties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topology is the study of objects up to
rubbery stretching, and geometry the study of rigid bodies. The goal of this
project is to understand certain fundamental problems in these areas by
combining surprising relationships between them with deep connections to other
areas of mathematics and computer science. Both topology and geometry are
becoming more important to applications such as data mining, and this project
includes collaboration with computer scientists as well as developing software
for exploring aspects of these problems which will be freely available to other
researchers via the web.
