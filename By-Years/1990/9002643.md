Solar wind plasma speed, the interplanetary magnetic field, the geomagnetic
field, and the galactic cosmic ray intensity near the Earth all vary
periodically in response to solar rotation. This study addresses specifically
the problem of defining observationally the strength and period of recurrence in
lists of impulsive events. The analysis strategy is to determine the frequency
with which events are separated by a given time interval. Comparison of this
frequency with that expected for events which occur randomly establishes the
significance of the periodicities observed. Specifically, the analysis of
interevent intervals in K-coronal data will compare the differential rotation of
bright and dark coronal regions. With these coronal results, analysis of
intervals between fast solar wind streams locates a mean latitude of origin for
the solar stimulus for interplanetary recurrence. Impulsive geomagnetic
disturbances as a proxy for interplanetary shocks, and their recurrence
properties will be compared with similar analyses of recurrent cosmic ray
variations. Longer term recurrence of geomagnetic disturbance will decide if
there are terrestrial effects of the recently reported 150 day periodicity in
solar flares.
