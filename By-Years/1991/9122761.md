The focus of this research is the synthetic potential inherent in catalysis by
transition metal complexes. Allyl systems involving Pd, Mo, Ni and W will be
manipulated to obtain chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantioselective
transformations. Among the other topics to be investigated in the project are:
Intramolecular carbametallation, metal catalyzed proton shifts leading to
reactive intermediates that can undergo prototropic cycloisomerization,
bifunctional reagents including organosulfur intermediates, and the design of
composite functional groups. The theme of developing reactions that minimize
chemical waste pervades every aspect ofthe work. %%% With this Accomplishment
Based Renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of
Dr. Barry M. Trost of the Department of Chemistry at Stanford University.
Professor Trost will focus his work on developing efficient synthetic approaches
to complex organic molecules of theoretical and biological interest while
increasing "atom economy". The use of catalytic amounts of transition metal
complexes is stressed in the work.
