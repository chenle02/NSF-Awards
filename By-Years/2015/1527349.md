This grant will help support the attendance of fifteen graduate students and ten
post-doctoral researchers or early-career faculty at the inaugural The Minerals,
Metals, and Materials Society (TMS) Summit on Integrated Manufacturing and
Materials Innovations to be held in November 2015 in Pittsburgh, PA. This forum
will provide an environment for rich discussions and interactions to not only
assess the state-of-the-art in materials-related manufacturing innovations, but
also to roadmap the key areas of future directions for the
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will bring together scientists,
engineers and decision makers from academia, industry and government. The key
technical theme will be the integration of materials and manufacturing
innovations. The summit will provide a forum for presentations and discussions
on materials-related manufacturing topics including digital manufacturing,
Integrated Computational Engineering (ICME), hybrid manufacturing processes,
nanomaterials, sustainable manufacturing and additive manufacturing to name a
few. The outcomes will be identification of technological and economic
limitations and barriers to implementation as well as a roadmap for key areas
for future development.
