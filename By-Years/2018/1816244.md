The PIs request funding to support a workshop that will bring together two
diverse communities: marine science and engineering and academic engineering.
They propose a two-day workshop at Northeastern University in Boston (date to be
determined), will bring together researcher/engineers who work on problems on
the seafloor and in sensing with those who work on land developing sensor
networks and networking. The goal of the workshop is to identify gaps and future
technology needs for advancing the state of the art for the next generation of
seafloor science. The final deliverable will be a report that addresses these
topics and a technology roadmap that addresses the technology needs and gaps for
seafloor science.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
