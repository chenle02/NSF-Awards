The Computer Science faculty at New Mexico Highlands University has developed
degree programs in Computer Science and Computer Information Systems that meet
the needs of largely, under- represented students. These students are highly
motivated but have been poor foudations in problem solving, internal model
development, and abstraction skills - all important in understanding the
concepts of Computer Science. This project augments the present curriculum in
Computer Science and Computer Information Systems by adding computer
laboratories to a number of the courses. For each laboratory, exercises and
computational experiments are being developed to help the students realize the
abstractions they find so difficult. The goal is to allow more students to
graduate with strong computer science backgrounds and a sense of confidence.
