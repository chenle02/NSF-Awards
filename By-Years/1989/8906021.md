32 Vector boards will be added to the existing 32 node Intel iPSC/2 computer at
the Theory Center. This will vastly increase the capabilities of the system;
increase memory by 25%, 80-fold increase for single precision, and 30-fold
increase for double precision operations. This upgrade of an existing parallel
computational system will greatly expand the scope of the on-going research in
both engineering and computer science at Cornell.
