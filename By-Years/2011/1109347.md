Supermassive black holes located in the centers of massive, centrally-located
cluster galaxies can serve as engines of powerful, magnetized jets that interact
with the intracluster medium and can profoundly affect the flow of heat within
the cluster and the formation of stars within the galaxy. The actual physical
mechanisms involved in these interactions between these jets and the host
cluster are poorly understood and remain a major challenge to astrophysicists.
This project aims to perform magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) computer simulations with
the goal of understanding how black holes stop clusters from cooling and how
stable cluster atmospheres can be constructed that satisfy all observational
requirements of temperature, entropy, field strength and topology and gas
composition. At the same time, this research will investigate how magnetized
jets evolve self consistently in dynamic environments. The proposed simulations
will be the first generation of adaptive mesh refinement-MHD (AMR-MHD)
simulations of resolved, ballistic jets in self-consistently evolved, realistic
clusters. The principal investigator (PI) will construct the first exhaustive
parameter study on how radio galaxies evolve for a set of fundamental jet
parameters that include magnetic fields.

Educationally, this project will provide funding and training of a postdoctoral
research scientist and an undergraduate student. In addition, the PI's public
outreach activities include a web site for presenting and explaining this
research to a general audience that will include videos of his public lecture
series.
