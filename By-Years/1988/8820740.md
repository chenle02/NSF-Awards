This research, part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, is designed
to study ion-molecule collision dynamics at translational temperatures below 30
degrees Kelvin. The experimental results will be analyzed using statistical
phase space models. The knowledge gained will provide insight into the dynamical
properties of long-lived collision complexes and will be applicable to the
analysis of molecular synthesis in interstellar space. Absolute rate constants
of reactions occurring within the core of supersonic jet expansions will be
measured. The method uses the transition flow region of a free jet expansion as
the kinetic medium. Microscopic evolution models for polyatomic jets will be
developed in order to obtain the rotational state distribution of the reactants.
