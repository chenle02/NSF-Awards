This project will develop innovative software to broaden access to free one-on-
one tutoring, starting in the domain of computer programming, which is crucial
for many kinds of 21st-century jobs. Learning is one of the most important and
fundamental lifelong endeavors. A well-educated public is crucial for
maintaining a healthy, prosperous, and innovative society. Regardless of
subject, one-on-one tutoring is the most personal and effective way to learn.
Although recent efforts such as MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) are scaling
up access to lectures and other educational materials, it is hard to scale up
one-on-one tutoring to online settings because there are far more learners in
the world than qualified expert tutors. Access to free online tutors will
especially benefit lower-income learners, who are more likely to be from rural
areas or underrepresented minority groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical
objective of this project is to investigate how to scale up peer tutoring of
computer programming through user interfaces and algorithms for matching
learners with tutors, hosting tutoring sessions within real-time code
visualizations, and reviewing archived sessions. The central idea is to draw
from the large pool of learners concurrently accessing online educational
resources to serve as peer tutors for one another. Although peers lack the deep
expertise of experts, many are effective tutors since they recently learned the
material and can empathize better with learners. This project will build upon
Online Python Tutor, a Web-based educational tool that the researcher created to
visualize the execution of computer code, now one of the most popular websites
for learning programming in the Python language. This project's specific aims
are to build a peer tutoring system atop the Online Python Tutor website and to
use it to study online peer tutoring interactions. The system has two main
components: 1.) PythonLive is a real-time tutoring interface for computer
programming that enables multiple users to concurrently write, execute,
visualize, and chat about code, a single tutor to effectively handle multiple
simultaneous tutees, and offline learning by reviewing archived tutoring
sessions. 2.) TutorMatch is an interface that uses crowdsourcing and machine
learning to connect learners with appropriately-skilled peer tutors in real-
time. In sum, this research will contribute new software-based techniques to
facilitate peer tutoring of computer programming, which draws upon and
contributes to the fields of human-computer interaction, social computing, and
computer-supported cooperative learning.
