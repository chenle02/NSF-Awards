This research involves several problems in the study of stochastic measure-
valued processes, processes which model the spatial distribution and time
development of a large population. The problems are concerned with the general
formulation of these processes and with their connection, via de Finetti's
theorem, with exchangeable systems of interacting particles. This research
studies processes which arise in population genetics. In particular, the work
involves studying generalizations of the specific models used in population
genetics and identifying their connections to interacting particles systems.
