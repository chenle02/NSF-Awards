With the advent of modern molecular methods for genetic analysis, it has become
feasible to study ever more refined aspects of the genetic structure of
populations. The developments have stimulated considerable growth in studies of
the genealogical structure of populations, as well as investigation into the
composition of populations of mixed genetic background. These two fields of
study are based on common molecular and statistical tools, but have largely been
developed in isolation from one another. The proposed symposium will provide a
forum for presentation, comparison, and discussion of the various approaches
currently available for genealogical analysis and strain identification.
Participants have been drawn from a national pool, and the proceeding will be
publicized on a national level as well. This symposium will bring together
scientific leaders in various related areas in a way that is certain to generate
useful interaction, and that could give rise to fruitful future collaborations.
Finally, this symposium is being structured in a way that will encourage
attendance by graduate students, so that people in their formative stages will
have the opportunity to benefit directly from the intellectual synergism that
will arise from this meeting.
