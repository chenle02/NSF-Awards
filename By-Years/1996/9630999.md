U. of California, Los Angeles Naturally occurring droughts are a chronic problem
for agriculture and resource management in the Great Plains of the U.S. and
Canada. Attempts to predict potential drought severity are hampered by the short
length of most climatic records from the plains. The research proposed will
utilize tree ring analysis to extract long term climatic records needed to
establish baselines for assessing potential severity. The research project will
obtain tree rings from living trees and subfossil wood at a number of sites in
Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. These sites when combined with existing
sites in the U.S. will form a truly comprehensive tree ring network of the
plains for the first time. Tree ring chronologies based on ring widths and
densities will be constructed for at least the last 500 years. Relations between
precipitation, ring widths and density will be examined and transfer functions
developed to reconstruct regional records of drought for this period of time.
The resulting records will be analyzed to determine the comparative ability of
latewood density as a predictor of precipitation, the severity of recent as
opposed to older droughts, and drought occurrence patterns and periodicities in
the northern plains. The research is both theoretical and applied.
