This research seeks an understanding of the origin of magnetospheric plasma
waves and their influence on the dynamical behavior of trapped particles. This
will be accomplished through theoretical analysis and numerical computation. The
path integrated growth rate and ultimate damping mechanisms for plasma waves
will be studied in realistic model environments using the HOT RAY tracing code.
This will establish the conditions for significant wave gain and the
effectiveness of energy transfer, via the waves, to other components of the
plasma. The stochastic acceleration of particles to high energy and
precipitation loss to the atmosphere during resonant interaction with
magnetospheric plasma waves will be studied by evaluating the rate of diffusion
along the characteristic resonant diffusion surfaces. Several of the proposed
topics are relevant to the ongoing GEM inner magnetosphere campaign,
particularly as they address processes in the inner magnetosphere and
geomagnetic storm conditions.
