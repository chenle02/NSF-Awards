This project investigates a computational framework to deal with the stochastic,
dynamic, and spatio-temporally distributed nature of forthcoming power systems.
The envisioned advances in adaptivity, awareness, and scalability aim at
engaging currently inactive electricity consumers in a sustainable power system.
Smooth integration of photovoltaics, wind, storage systems, and electric
vehicles, will promote innovation and development, in terms of markedly
advancing the resource allocation, learning, and monitoring infrastructure.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed research aims for broad socio-technical
advances in energy networks. Successful completion of the project will offer
cyber innovations to enable systematic integration of stochastic renewable
generation while improving end-user satisfaction. Given the universality of the
research tools and methodologies, the utility of the proposed research goes well
beyond the envisioned application area to the broader fields of optimization,
stochastic processes, control systems, machine learning, statistical signal
processing, and cyber security. Broader transformative impact will result from
pragmatic test cases proposed for validation, involvement of undergraduates in
research, and outreach activities.
