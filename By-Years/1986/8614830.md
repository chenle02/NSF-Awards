As part of previous NSF supported research (EAR 85-07929), software was
developed for reverse-time extrapolation of elastic waves. This was done in the
context of imaging of Earth structure, but, the same concepts may also be
directly applied to imaging of earthquake sources. Exiting studies of earthquake
imaging use the acoustic wave equation, so that only P-waves are considered.
Thus, the ability now exists to produce concurrent images of both the P and S
waves by extrapolating the observations with the elastic wave equation and this
is the goal of the proposed research.
