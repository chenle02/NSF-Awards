A key element in improving the capacity of U.S. manufacturers to compete in
world markets on both cost and quality is the modernization of production
technologies, that is, the adoption of innovations in the processes by which
goods are made and services are delivered. This study examines the technical and
organizational interdependencies among firms which are important to the
diffusion of programmable automation, a process innovation with broad
applicability to many manufacturing industries. The study focuses on the system
of inter-organizational linkages among three classes of economic organizations:
between equipment makers who manufacture programmable machines and machine tool
users; among users; and between these users and the customer-firms to whom they
are suppliers. The goals of the study are : 1) to develop a richer theoretical
understanding of the nature of and the conditions under which ties between
organizations are important to the diffusion of programmable automation, and (2)
to empirically test hypotheses about these relationships. The researchers will
draw on data collected in 1987 in a survey of manufacturing plants as well as
results from a resurvey of these plants in 1990. The findings from this study
could be extended to process innovations more generally, since programmable
automation is applicable to a broad spectrum of industries. These results should
contribute to an understanding of the mechanisms necessary to facilitate the
more rapid and widespread diffusion of advanced automation technologies.
