The proposed work is the continuation and conclusion of the analysis of acoustic
oceanographic data obtained by the principal investigator in the Greenland Sea
Tomography Experiment. This experiment, conducted during 1988-89, consisted of a
pentagonal array of five acoustic transceivers with a sixth moored in the
center. The goals of the experiment were to study the episodic formation of
Greenland Sea Deep Water, the response of the Greenland Sea gyre to variations
in wind stress and ice cover, and the propagation of acoustic energy in the
marginal ice zone. The large data set obtained in this experiment, as well as a
concurrent moving ship tomography test, and several other oceanographic studies,
is currently being analyzed at four academic institutions. This project will not
only improve our understanding of deep water formation and circulation, but is
also an excellent test of the utility of acoustic information in defining
oceanographic processes.
