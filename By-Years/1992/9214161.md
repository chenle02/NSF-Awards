The Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology at SUNY Stony Brook will
renovate five laboratories into modules for graduate, undergraduate and
postdoctoral research and research training. The renovated laboratories will
bring together four recently appointed faculty members from Biochemistry and
Cell Biology who share common research interests. The renovation plan permits
these junior faculty to all be moved in proximity of each other and to provide
room for growth of their research programs and room for collaborative projects.
A common theme of research of these cell biologists is macromeolecular transport
through the cell. To further encourage interactions among these faculty and
their students, all of their laboratories will open to a common central corridor
with shared facilities. The renovated laboratories will also adjoin two recently
renovated laboratories belonging to faculty members in the Department of
Neurobiology and Behavior. The proximity of these researchers will also act as a
catalyst for the production of a mutually nurturing and creative environment
between two departments in the Division of Biology.
