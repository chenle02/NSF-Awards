The 2012 Joint Statistical Meetings Diversity Workshop and Mentoring Program is
a multi-day activity which will take place during the 2012 Joint Statistical
Meetings (JSM) in San Diego. It will consist of a series of interactive sessions
and small group mentoring activities which aim to

1. Establish critical mentoring and networking relationships for minority
statisticians at early- to mid-career levels (i.e., undergraduate students,
graduate students, early statistics professionals); 2. Motivate students to
pursue graduate study and careers in statistics; 3. Share best practices for
recruiting and mentoring minority students and faculty; and 4. Increase the
active participation of minorities in the American Statistical Association.

Participants in the workshop and mentoring program include underrepresented
minority graduate students in statistics or biostatistics programs; top minority
undergraduates in statistics, mathematics, or related disciplines; minority
statisticians in academia, government, and the private sector; key faculty from
minority-serving institutions who advise and mentor undergraduates in math or
related disciplines; and faculty influential in the faculty and/or student
recruitment processes at their home institutions.

This program is unique in that it does not limit its focus to students only, but
also provides opportunities to benefit early career professionals. It is further
unique in its holistic approach to career development which allows individuals
to participate in the program as both mentor and protégé simultaneously. These
elements help create a community of support and accountability for the success
of all involved.

This awarded is supported jointly by the Infrastructure Program and the
Statistics Program within the Division of Mathematics.
