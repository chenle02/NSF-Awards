The PI's request funding to develop a low power, autonomous solid state sensor
for simultaneous measurement of seawater pH and Total Alkalinity. The proposed
research involves micro sensor development, electrochemistry, marine chemistry,
and electrical engineering. Combination of two ISFET measurement principles will
be used for rapid, sequential measurement of pH and Total Alkalinity in order to
generate a full thermodynamic description of the CO2 system in the analyte
solution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Making
sensors to measure pH and total alkalinity in real time and at the appropriate
precision is important to our understanding of ocean acidification. If
successful, they plan to commercialize it. Other situations where total weak
acid or base concentration in combination with the pH form useful information,
this proposed system might be used, like in food industry and for biomedical
applications. Two graduate students will be involved in this project.
