This award supports an international conference entitled Evolution of the First
Nervous Systems II. This three day meeting will revisit a similarly titled
conference held in 1989, and take place in May, 2014 at the Whitney Laboratory
for Marine Bioscience of the University of Florida. Speakers will cover a range
of pertinent topics, with an emphasis paid to the phylogeny of basal metazoans
(e.g., ctenophores and cnidarians), where nervous systems are first represented
and to earlier groups (e.g., sponges) where some components of nervous systems
have been identified. The meeting will address several important questions
including when nervous systems first appeared in evolution, whether nervous
systems emerged once, or multiple times, where the molecular tool kits that
define neurons (e.g., voltage-gated ion channels, neurotransmitters and their
receptors) came from and how they were harnessed to make the first neurons, and
the very compelling question that underlies the whole topic of nervous system
evolution, what is a neuron? The proceedings of the meeting will be published in
a special issue of the Journal of Experimental Biology and will include a
chapter that will synthesize the content of organized discussions on specific
questions such as those listed above. This meeting will provide unprecedented
insight into one of the most significant events in animal evolution, the
appearance of the nervous system and, in doing so, provide a baseline from which
to trace the evolution of nervous systems and, ultimately, the human brain. The
meeting will be promoted to a global audience through on-line journals and
meetings, and a strategic effort is being made by the organizers to involve
undergraduate students from liberal arts colleges and minority serving
institutions.
