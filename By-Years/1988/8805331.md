The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program provides
support to increase the participation of minority faculty and students in
science and engineering by strengthening the research environments and
capabilities of institutions that have significant minority student enrollments.
Investigators at Atlanta University will use support from this planning and
developmental grant to develop novel approaches to study eucaryotic cell
membranes' topology and function. The researchers will also attend seminars and
well known laboratories that address topics on molecular biology. The principal
investigator is a talented and experienced minority biologists who has a
commendable record of training minority students. This planning and
developmental grant will further strengthen her capability to perform mainstream
research.
