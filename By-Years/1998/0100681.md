XML is becoming the principal medium for data exchange over the Web, and for
information integration in general. Increasing amounts of public and private
data are described in XML while more legacy sources (e.g., relational databases)
offer public XML views. The feasibility of many applications that have emerged
with the growth of XML on the Web requires new and complex query optimization
techniques. The goal of this research project is to develop a "chase &
backchase" optimization method for XML queries. Based on chasing with
constraints and incorporating cost-based optimization, the method brings
together strategies such as use of indexes, use of materialized views, semantic
optimization and join/scan minimization, allowing optimizations that depend on
non-trivial interactions between these strategies. Particular attention is given
to the challenges posed by XML document order and by regular path expressions in
queries. This project is expected to result in a theoretical foundation and a
practical framework for defining and using indexes, materialized views and
complex constraints in XML query processing systems. The practical framework
will be demonstrated through a publicly available software prototype appropriate
for teaching about XML query systems and for supporting related research
projects.
