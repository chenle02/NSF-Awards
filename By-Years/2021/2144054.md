The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to solve a variety of infectious diseases for
which there is no adequate prevention or therapy, such as HIV, flu, malaria, and
the common cold. Vaccination has proven immensely difficult for these diseases,
often because there are countless natural strains. Providing antibodies directly
represents a possible solution because some of the broadest antibodies can
subdue 97% or more of circulating strains. However, antibodies will not last
beyond a few months in the body. This project proposes to make a collection of
mutations in the constant part of antibodies to stabilize them potentially for
decades or even a lifetime. This will improve public
health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase I project will advance the potential applications of mutagenizing the Fc
region of a model antibody toward the eventual development of stable
prophylactic antibodies. First, the Fc will be made resistant to all cellular
and all major microbial antibody proteases. Mutations conferring resistance of
antibodies to some proteases have already been achieved; these will be combined
in the model system. Resistance to all remaining proteases will be engineered by
targeted mutation, if the cleavage sites are known, and by comprehensive
mutation, if the cleavage sites are unknown. High-throughput screening of
mutants will be facilitated by full-length Immunoglobulin G phage display.
Second, Fc is stabilized in vivo by the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). An unbiased
screen of all possible single and double mutants in Fc, also by full-length
Immunoglobulin G phage display, will isolate mutants that have still further
enhanced binding to FcRn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
