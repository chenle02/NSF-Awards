The origin of the continental crust is fundamental to understanding the
evolution of the Earth as a whole. Recent work has shown the bimodal behavior of
certain siderophile and chalcophile mobile elements (e.g. Pb, As, Sb) in terms
of their greater than expected enrichments in volcanic arcs and the continental
crust, compared to their geochemical behavior during igneous fractionation. This
project will extend our studies to additional elements (e.g. Pb, Zn, Cd, Sn, Hg,
and Bi) in suites we have analyzed for other elements. Characterizing and
quantifying the affected elements and their enrichments will allow a better
understanding of the location and geochemical conditions under which the
enrichments occurred, for example, ridge versus subduction zone environments. We
will analyze new samples for our complete set of siderophile elements, from
additional arcs and from samples that extend our across-arc data. The
compositional data from the volcanic arcs from additional samples of the ancient
continental crust will be important for improving estimates of the composition
of the continental crust. The modelling efforts will use a more sophisticated
transport model that will also allow evaluation of isotopic constraints.
