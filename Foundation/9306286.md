This project will continue to study several topics in set theory, primarily
concerning the core model and its applications. The most important aim of this
research will be to extend core model theory so that one can prove the existence
of a core model in the presence of a Woodin cardinal. The probable structure of
this core model is already known; the main problem seems to be to develop
techniques which can be used to prove an extender is a member of the core model.
Other areas of study concern applications of the core model under the assumption
that there is no model with a Woodin cardinal. These potential applications
include questions related to absoluteness, to the singular cardinal hypothesis,
and to Jonson and Ramsey cardinals. The ultimate aim of this research is to
chararcterize the structure of well-founded models of set theory. As their name
suggests, the 'core' of a universe of set theory, if it exists, provides a
skeleton with a relatively well-defined structure and thus gives a good deal of
information about the form of the full model. Since set theory lies at the very
foundation of mathematics, this enterprise has important consequences for the
soundness of many accepted mathematical practices, although it is customary for
most working mathematicians to take this on faith.
