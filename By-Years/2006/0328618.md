SGER: A Testbed for eRulemaking Data&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This small grant will
support a collaborative, multi-disciplinary planning project to explore the
potential application of text retrieval, text clustering, text summarization and
topic threading research tools in the area of Federal government rulemaking over
the Internet. Rulemaking is the process of considering public opinion before
issuing final detailed implementation rules in response to laws passed by
Congress, Erulemaking is the collection of public comments in digital form,
including email, phone, and fax. One issue that the work will begin to address
is the problem of large scale (greater that 100,000) submitted
comments.&lt;br/&gt;
