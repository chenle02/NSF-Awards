This research is on finding fundamental algorithms for synthesizing analog
integrated circuit layouts from schematics. The algorithms use sensitivity-
driven, graph-based methods. One set of algorithms uses the sensitivity of the
circuit's performance to resistive and capacitive layout parasitics, thermal
gradients, and fabrication process gradients to determine the relative positions
of the circuit elements. Another set of algorithms generates the physical layout
using the sensitivity data. These use a weighted constraint graphs approach that
has been utilized in IC layout compaction. The graph weights and constraints are
determined from the sensitivity data. An appropriate solution of the graph then
yields the analog circuit layout. Layouts for analog circuits are still hand
crafted by experts familiar with the circuit, system and manufacturing
requirements. About 10% of application-specific designs, 50% of full custom
designs and 80% of printed circuit board designs contain analog circuits. This
research addresses a fundamental need in analog design: automation of the layout
of circuit elements, and the P.I. is addressing important unsolved problems in
this area. The novelty is in using a sensitivity analysis to determine relative
placement of components on the chip. The principal investigator is a promising
and competent young professor who should make significant contributions to the
field.
