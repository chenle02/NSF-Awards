The Biology/Chemistry Scholarship Program (ABC) is increasing the number of
underrepresented minorities earning degrees in STEM disciplines by awarding 25
four-year scholarships (15 Biology and 10 Chemistry) to qualified incoming
freshmen. Scholarship recipients are selected based on financial need, GPA,
SAT/ACT test scores, letters of recommendations, extracurricular activities,
demonstrated leadership skills, and U.S. citizenship. A myriad of support
programs that include supplemental instruction, summer bridge programs in STEM,
career counseling, and service learning, internship and/or research
opportunities will ensure success of the students. The program improves pathways
and opportunities for underrepresented minorities to pursue STEM degrees. The
goal of increasing STEM enrollment and degrees in biology and chemistry is
accomplished by placing emphases on student support services, increasing
faculty-student interactions, forging articulation agreements with existing
partners in the Business/Industry Cluster, and expanding interdisciplinary
options. The ABC scholarship program demonstrates that insufficient numbers of
underrepresented minority students in the STEM disciplines are effectively
addressed with targeted student support services and mentoring. The ABC program
creates a pipeline for recruitment of talented and financially disadvantaged
students, as well as provides further testing of a collaborative student-support
model for success. This program is positively impacting the under-representation
of minorities and women seeking careers in the nation's work force.
