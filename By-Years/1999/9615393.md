9615393 Bevis This project is designed to compare the rates of deformation over
geologic time scales of 105-106 years with the rates of deformation over human
time scales of 10o -101 years. The area selected for this study is western
Argentina, where growth structures have been actively evolving for the last 5
my. Deformation is also active and will be monitored by GPS over the next 3
years. These data will also be compared to a decadal record of earthquake
activity, and aseismic components. The results will also have implications for
the episodicity of continental deformation, temporal clustering of continental
deformation within a volume, and simultaneous movements of faults at different
sampling intervals.
