This is a project to study how emergent combinations of social networks,
knowledge, and resources lead to innovation within and across organizations,
with special attention to brokerage activities that facilitate these
combinations. Recent work on global competition suggests that successful
organizations foster collaboration across departmental, firm, and national
boundaries. Research in organization theory, strategy, and sociology recognizes
the importance of social combinations to innovation, entrepreneurship, and firm
competitiveness, but we know little about the social processes and interpersonal
skills underlying the creation of such combinations and how they are fostered on
the ground. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three key questions will be explored: 1) How
do social networks, individual knowledge, and resources combine and lead to
organizational innovation? 2) To what extent does participation in innovation
also lead to promotion within a firm? 3) How do these relations vary within and
across different firms? Ethnography, comparative case studies, and a two-stage
social network study will be used in multiple organizations differing in size
and product/service offering to answer these questions. Research findings will
advance organization theory. They will also practices which managers can use to
foster innovation and that professionals and scientists can apply to enhance
their own performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
