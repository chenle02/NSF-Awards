Researchers at the University of Minnesota will purchase a field scanning
electron microscope with the resolution necessary to answer critical scientific
questions about important biological systems. This microscope is capable of
examining the surface topology and distribution of surface ligands on large
specimens (&gt; 10mm in diameter) at a resolution of 20-50 Angstroms. The first
applications of the microscope will be in studies of endothelial cell adhesion,
the role of proteoglycans in weakening of tissue microstructure and the role of
cytoplasmic dynein in Drosophila melanogaster development. The microscope will
provide critical support of strong ongoing research projects into the
fundamental biological processes in these systems. The instrument will further
greatly facilitate the education, training and research of graduate students and
post-doctoral fellows in biological sciences.
