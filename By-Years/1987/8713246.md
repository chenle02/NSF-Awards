This research program investigates the viscous flow of immiscible fluids in a
Hele-Shaw cell. The effects of transverse variation of interface curvature,
finite viscosity ratio, gravity, small tilt of cell wall and variable surface
tension will be analyzed. The results of this investigation are expected to
resolve the known diagreemants between theoretical results and observations,
both in nature and in experiments, on steady state behavior and stability
features of this type of fluid flows.
