Professor Gillet will continue his work on Arekelov theory and algebraic
K-theory. He wishes to study non-archimedean Arekelov theory. He also intends to
study the connections between K-theory and motives in particular to use motives
to construct a K-theory with compact support. This project falls into the
general area of arithmetic geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest
areas of mathematics: number theory and geometry. This combination has proved
extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that withstood
generations. Among its many consequences are new error correcting codes. Such
codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
