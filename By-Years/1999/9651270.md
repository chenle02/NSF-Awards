Instrumentation is essential to modern laboratory work, but is frequently too
expensive for introductory courses in which many students require simultaneous
access. This situation often results in very limited access to instruments and,
often, to the use of low-cost, low-performance instruments. If appropriate
instruments were selected and utilized, with careful thought to high throughput
and off-line data handling, many of the time and funding bottlenecks would be
greatly reduced. This project is utilizing three such instruments to upgrade the
introductory courses in quantitative chemical analysis dramatically at the
freshman and sophomore levels. Atomic Absorption/Atomic Emission spectroscopy is
a proven technique that is being used to process many individual student samples
rapidly. Newly developed miniature spectrometers can be used as low-cost, rapid
instruments for a variety of spectroscopic and spectrophotometric measurements.
The basic technology is proven, but considerable development work is required to
convert this into a routine teaching instrument. Gas chromatographs are being
modified with multibore capillary columns to provide high resolution in less
than 5 minutes per sample, with no need for time-consuming temperature
programming. One of the goals of this project is to develop, critically
evaluate, and distribute instructional applications for these newer
technologies. The department also expects to provide much more realistic and
modern analytical experiences for introductory chemistry students. This
objective requires the use of updated technology, but can be facilitated by a
major restructuring of the way that student laboratories are organized and
operated. The project is directly affecting approximately 100 students per year,
especially those majoring in chemistry, biology, geology, medical technology,
and environmental sciences.
