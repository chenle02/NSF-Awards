The proposed research concerns two basic topics: a) the study of networks with
temporal processes at the nodes and b) variants of wavelet analysis involving
temporal and spatial point processes. Applications are made to understanding the
interconnections of the auditory system of the brain on the basis of recorded
spike trains and to creating isoseismal maps of earthquakes in the aftermath of
a destructive event. The network effort relates to graphical modeling while the
wavelet work may be seen as a competitor to local weighting procedures, for
handling nonstationarity. The topics come together in the problem of assessing
whether learning is taking place in a biological neuron network. In the case of
the network study, principal applications are to contemporaneous spike trains
obtained from biological neurons at locations, determined post mortem in cats
and rats, having in mind the goal of inferring a latent wiring diagram. In the
case of the wavelet research, applications are made to both seismology and
neurophysiology seizing on the ability of the wavelet approach to handle
nonstationarity. Both the temporal and the spatial cases are considered.

The research proposed is motivated by problems arising in the fields of biology
and seismology, for example, and the belief that they may be well-addressed by
contemporary research work involving the concept of networks. Work involving
novel mathematical expressions, which allow some change in time or space to take
place in a situation, also relates to the research. Both theoretical development
and empirical model fitting and verification will be involved. There may be
applications to the Biotechnology (BIOT) area of Federal strategic interest. The
value of working in fields as diverse as biology and seismology is that
analytical techniques thought of for one may be abstracted and applied in the
other.
