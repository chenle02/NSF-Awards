The primary objective of this proposal is to study the dietary choices
demonstrated by an ape (the chimpanzee) and several congeneric species of
monkeys in the Kibale Forest of Uganda. Physical anthropologists have for many
years debated the reasons for the grater success of monkeys relative to apes
since the Miocene and the clear diminution in the number of species of ape.
Wrangham has hypothesized that the success of the monkeys has been due to their
ability to process secondary compounds in vegetation more effectively than apes.
These compounds are a variety of toxins which limit the food choices of animals
unable to detoxify and digest them. Confirmation of this hypothesis will be
advanced by observation of the food choices of the two primates during a
synchronous study. In this study the investigators will observe the food choices
of the study species during feeding in order to quantify the dietary intake. In
addition samples of the foods will be gathered for laboratory analysis. The data
will then be analyzed for food choices and composition and the used to clarify
the habitat utilization by this ape and the three monkey species.
