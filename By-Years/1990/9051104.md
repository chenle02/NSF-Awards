This proposal will provide laboratory experiences for physics students at a
community college on the concepts of continuous or variable changes that can
occur during particle dynamics. Both the subject matter and the laboratory
techniques are not usually presented at this level, and, hence, this proposal
affords an interesting opportunity to study the ability of subjects to grasp
this subject matter. The instructor (P.I.) is very qualified and these
experiences will enhance the understanding of these concepts by these students.
