Commutative algebra is the local theory of algebraic geometry, and algebraic
geometry is the study of geometric objects defined by polynomial equations. The
study of algebraic geometry stems from Descartesâ€™ introduction of the coordinate
plane to better understand the geometry of objects defined by polynomial
equations. For example, the polynomial equation y=x^2 defines a parabola in the
coordinate plane and the polynomial equation x^2+y^2=1 defines a circle. In
contrast, the graph of the equation y^2 = x^3 has a sharp point, a type of
singularity. Geometric objects defined by polynomial equations may admit
singularities. The local study of these singularities is a necessity to
understanding the geometry of the object. The main research goals of this
project concern itself with the study of singularities when the defining
equations have coefficients in a positive characteristic numbering system.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Singularities of prime characteristic rings are studied,
classified, and understood through descriptive behavior of the Frobenius
endomorphism. This project focuses on the study of F-pure and F-regular
singularities, numerical invariants designed to relate rings among these
singularity classes, and test ideals. A particular emphasis is to determine
sufficient conditions that imply equality of the finitistic and big test ideal
of a local F-pure ring. The purpose of doing so is to investigate the weak-
implies-strong conjecture from tight closure theory, to establish unifying
behavior of F-regular rings, and to relate the numerical invariant F-signature
with the behavior of valuation rings centered over an F-regular
ring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
