Recent work has established the possibility of deriving auxiliary information
from biometric data. For example, it has been shown that face images can be used
to deduce the health, gender, age and race of a subject; further, face images
have been used to link a pseudonymous profile in the Web with a true profile,
thereby compromising the privacy of an individual. The objective of this work is
to design and implement techniques for imparting privacy to biometric data such
as face, fingerprint and iris images.

In this regard, the following tasks are being conducted: (a) methods to modify
biometric data such that the modified data can be used for re-identifying an
individual but cannot be used to derive auxiliary information about the subject,
such as gender and age; (b) methods to generate multiple privacy-enhanced
templates from the same biometric data in such a way that these templates cannot
be linked using a biometric matcher; and (c) methods to decompose and store the
biometric data of a subject across entities such that individual entities cannot
determine the identity of the subject, but collaboration across entities is
essential for eliciting the identity of the subject. Finally, methods to assess
the degree of privacy of a biometric image are being developed in order to
quantify the amount of private information that can be derived from it. The
proposed methods are being evaluated on publicly available face, fingerprint and
iris datasets in order to determine their efficacy in the context of cyberspace
applications.
