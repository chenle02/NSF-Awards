Einstein's field equations, besides providing the basis for the best current
description of the behavior of gravitational physics on the astrophysical and
cosmological scale, also is the source of a rich collection of mathematically
interesting questions. Prof. Isenberg will investigate several of these,
including: 1. solutions of the Einstein constraint equations of a more general
character than currently known 2. occurrence of singularities in solutions to
Einstein's equations (i.e. the so-called "Strong Cosmic Censorship" conjecture)
3. the relationship between mathematical manifolds and their geometries (i.e.
"Ricci flows") This work will increase the interaction of ideas and tools in
mathematics and theoretical physics.
