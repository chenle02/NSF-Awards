This research is concerned with the Kazdhan-Lusztig theory. This involves Kac-
Moody Lie algebras and groups, their representations and the combinatorics of
Bruhat ordering on Coxeter groups. The principal investigator will study the
combinatorics of Bruhat ordering, the geometry of Schubert varieties, and
highest weight representations of Kac- Moody Lie algebras. This project is in
the general area of Lie algebra. The principal investigator is concerned with
the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials which are combinatorially defined objects having
deep connections with structures in geometry and representation theory. This
work is important in both mathematics and physics.
