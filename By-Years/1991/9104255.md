This award funds a postdoctoral research fellowship in plant biology for two
years. The project entitled "Analysis of the vacuolar membrane inositol
1,4,5-triphosphate receptor ion channel of guard cells" is to be carried out in
the laboratory of Dr. Julian Schroeder at the University of California at San
Diego. The applicant received his Ph.D. training in the area of plant
biochemistry. In his postdoctoral training, Dr. Ward will focus on the
electrophysiology of guard cells in bean and other plants. The Postdoctoral
Fellowships in Plant Biology are designed to increase the number of outstanding
young investigators in plant biology.
