Texas Southern University (TSU) is taking an aggressive posture regarding the
implementation and utilization of comtemporary information computing and
communications systems for teaching, research and community service throughout
the institution. TSU, part of the Historically Black Colleges and Universities
community, considers that this must be done if it is to enter the mainstream in
terms of the educational and research services it intends to deliver. TSU's
Department of Computing and Applied Sciences plans to install an advanced
architecture parallel super-minicomputer to support its research and graduate
program initiatives in three areas: 1) software engineering, 2) computational
sciences, and 3) the joint area of the application of software engineering
techniques and principles to computational sciences. This grant provides partial
support for TSU's thrust. The funding will be used for installation and
administration of the new machine, and to begin investigation of the effort
required to transport existing sequential algorithms to the new parallel
architecture. Further effort funded by other sources will follow.
