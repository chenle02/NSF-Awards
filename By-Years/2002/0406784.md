An Intensive Search for r-process-Enhanced Stars, and Abundance Patterns in the
Early Galaxy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AST 0406784
Timothy Beers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Timothy Beers, at Michigan State
University, will undertake a program to complete a large-scale search for very
metal-poor stars in the halo of the Galaxy that, based on a rapid sequence of
neutron absorptions in nuclear reactions, are referred to as highly "rapid-
process-enhanced", or "r-process-enhanced" stars. Highly r-process-enhanced,
very metal-poor stars provide a means to investigate the nature of the r-process
itself in the early Galaxy, the sites for the production of the r-process
elements and the age of the Galaxy. This latter effort is significant because
the PI uses a method that is independent of precise knowledge of stellar
evolution, chemical evolution of the Galaxy, and cosmological models. The
proposal also seeks support for the analysis of the chemical elemental
abundances for the large sample of low metallicity giants that are the
candidates for the search. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will have broad
impact on a number of research areas, including astronomy, nuclear physics, and
chemistry. Opportunities for traini
