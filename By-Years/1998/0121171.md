0121171&lt;br/&gt;Berlin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Americas Program thesis
enhancement project will support thesis dissertation research by Mr. Cameron
Adams under the supervision of Dr. Eloise A. Berlin of the University of
Georgia. The study, in collaboration with El Colegio de la Frontera Sur (ECOSUR)
in Chiapas, Mexico, aims to use cognitive methods to establish whether the
Highland Maya have a shared ethnophysiology. A model of such a physiology will
be developed and transcripts of open-ended interviews will be analyzed for
structured metaphor usage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because perceptions of body
function inform much of culturally defined medical behavior, including practices
such as behavioral and medicinal prescriptions and /or proscriptions,
researchers have argued that a thorough understanding of concepts of physiology
lead to a greater understanding of any medical system. Through its modeling of
Highland Maya ethnophysiology, the proposed research will serve to address
various issues in medical and cognitive anthropology and advance efforts at
developing culturally appropriate health care delivery systems for indigenous
populations in Mexico and elsewhere.&lt;br/&gt;
