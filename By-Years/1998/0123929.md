The proposal is a collaborative proposal involving University of Pittsburgh
&amp; Case Western Reserve University. The proposal plans to explore fundamental
questions and associated middleware development issues to support broadcast and
multicast data dissemination. When many people try to access the same
information (for example, news sites during the Election), servers are often
overwhelmed resulting in long delays. If an effective multicast capability
existed across the Internet, a single server could have served all the requests,
saving both computer power as well as reducing the amount of overall Internet
traffic. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The approach will highlight gaps in the state-
of-the-art and will research and explore new techniques and algorithms. The
objectives include&lt;br/&gt;1. transparently provide applications with data
management services such as caching, scheduling and consistency maintenance,
&lt;br/&gt;2. improve internet functionality, performance, and cost-
effectiveness, and&lt;br/&gt;3. reduce the application development time while
improving performance and reliability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal plans
to make the information and developed software available to
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
