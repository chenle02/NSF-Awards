This award will support the 1989 Symposium on the Interface of Computing
Science and Statistics to be held April 9-12, 1989 in Orlando, Florida,
organized by the Interface Foundation of North America, and hosted by the
Department of Statistics of the University of Central Florida. The program will
be centered around the theme of "statistical software and the human interface."
This conference is a continuation of the Interface Symposium series. This year's
program will include a collection of sessions on departmental computing, the
future of UNIX, graphics, high dimensional data structures, Bayesian computing,
evaluating statistical software, regression diagnostics, quality control and
experimental design, vectorization, and many other topics. One of the sessions
will focus on the development of young investigators, where new Ph.D.'s will be
invited to present their dissertation results as invited papers. The conference
will consist of a keynote speech by Professor John Nelder, three parallel
invited sessions, and a number of parallel contributed paper sessions.
