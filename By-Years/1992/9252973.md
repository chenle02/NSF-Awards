In science and mathematics education, leaders agree that instruction needs to
focus more on understanding than coverage. There is little evidence however that
teachers or test makers do much directly to promote such higher order thinking.
To overcome this problem we will work with a high- stakes test maker to develop
outcome measures of higher order thinking; assist a group of science and
mathematics teachers in preparing assessment strategies which can be used to
promote higher order thinking in their classrooms; study the effects of those
strategies on student performance using the developed outcome measures and a
related high stakes measure; and develop a teacher assessment inservice package
which illustrates and explains sample classroom assessment strategies that
promote higher order thinking. The one year funding allows completion of steps
one and two above. If test makers see that higher order thinking is being
promoted in the classroom they will emphasize such thinking in their high-stakes
test development.
