The rate and pattern ofdental development in early hominids is a focus of
controversy in current research in physical anthropology. This controversy is
part of the larger question of whether developmental periods in early hominids
can be characterized as more "humanlike", more "apelike", or distinct from
either. The prolonged developmental periods characteristic of modern humans have
been emphasized in many scenarios concerning the origin of various human
physical, cultural, and behavioral traits. However, recent research suggests
that early than modern humans, comparable to that of modern apes. If so, brains,
tool use, and social organization, will be affected. Rates of human dental
development are well known, but existing standards of ape dental development are
inadequate since the sample size is small, they are not from individuals of
known chronological age, and radiographic information on the anterior dentition
is lacking. The objective of this study is to document the pattern and timing of
deciduous and permanent tooth crown and root formation in a cross-sectional
sample of living chimpanzees of known age and sex in order to provide baseline
data for comparison with human and fossil hominid samples.
