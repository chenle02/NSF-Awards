This project incorporates an integrated microcomputer systems development
configuration into an operating systems laboratory. The laboratory is used to
teach implementation-oriented courses in intrductory operating systems, advanced
operating systems and networks. The equipment that supports this project
includes nine Zenith microcomputer systems, three printers, and network hardware
to connect to an existing VAX computer system. The project provides students
with practical knowledge and experience with operating systems and computer
networks, skills that prepare students to function effectively as systems
software engineers. This award is being matched by an equal sum from the
grantee.
