Among the living primates the genus Lemur is one of the most complicated from
the taxonomic point of view. There are six recognized species and one, Lemur
fulvus, occurs in seven allopatric subspecies. Their relationships to one
another and the mode of their genetic differentiation is not known. The PI will
examine levels of genetic differentiation associated with various stages in the
process of speciation and, using data from the genus Lemur, will examine the
model of allopatric speciation. Specifically, the PI will test the hypothesis
that there is progressively greater genetic differentiation as comparisons are
made among geographic populations, then subspecies, and finally species. These
data will also be used to address the systematics of lemurs, and specifically
whether Lemur fulvus is ancestral to other species in the genus, as has been
proposed.
