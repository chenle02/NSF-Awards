EIA-0131354&lt;br/&gt;Andrew Lumsdaine&lt;br/&gt;University of Notre
Dame&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next Generation Software: Open Compilation for Self-
Optimizing Generic Components&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is to advance
the state-of-the-art in high-performance software specifically related tot he
design and compilation of high-performance scientific libraries. This work will
address two of the most important issues-code complexity and performance
optimization-by applying and extending two emerging programming paradigm:
generic programming and concept-based optimization. The vehicle for this work
will be development of an integrated framework consisting of open compilation
and generic library technologies. By simultaneously developing the compilation
technologies and the library technologies-and by providing mechanism to couple
the two together-the whole will be greater than the sum of its parts
