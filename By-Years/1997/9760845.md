*** 9760845 Aye This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
will develop a Micro-Optic Spectroscopic Imaging Sensor (MOSIS), based on a
polarization sensitive diffractive micro-optic array. MOSIS will be a miniature,
compact, lightweight monolithic device capable of multi-spectral, polarimetric
imaging in real time. Phase I will microminiaturize a conventional
spectrographic system using a refractive-diffractive micro-optic array,
integrated with a high resolution charge-coupled-device (CCD) array to form a
two-dimensional (2-D) imaging sensor. Because of the focusing property of the
refractive element and the high spectral dispersion of the diffractive elements,
the device will perform high resolution (1-10 nanommeters) spectroscopic image
detection in a broad visible-to-mid IR spectral range. This MOSIS is a simple
monolithic focal-plane array consisting of a stack of three basic elements: (1)
a refractive microlens array; (2) a pair of conjugate birefringent diffractive
optics arrays; and (3) a 2-D detector array, which can be a commercial CCD chip.
This approach can be applied to any desired bands of the optical spectrum
without any limitations imposed by materials or fabrication processes as in the
passive (holographic or multilayer) and active (acousto-optic or liquid crystal)
filter-based devices. Applications are expected in compact, low-cost, reliable,
polarimetric imaging, multispectral sensor systems for remote sensing in ocean
monitoring, environmental sensing, mineral identification, agricultural
surveillance, biomedical and chemical spectroscopic imaging, and industrial
inspection. ***
