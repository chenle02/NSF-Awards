. Circuits are a fundamental model of computations. Communication complexity
and polynomial approximation have yielded many advances in the last decade; yet
many important theoretical and practical problems are unsolved. This
investigates the relative power of threshold, mod, and binary gates as
computational devices. This project provides support postdoctoral associates to
work with the PI to address these problems. ***
