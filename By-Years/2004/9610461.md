This project investigates resource-bounded measure and its implications for
central questions in computational complexity. Weak completeness will be further
developed as a tool for proving intractability. Such strong hypotheses as "NP
does not have p- measure 0" (already known to have numerous plausible
consequences) will be studied with particular attention to their reasonableness
and explanatory power. New applications of the resource-bounded probabilistic
method will be sought, and relationships among randomized complexity, circuit-
size complexity, natural proofs, and one-way functions will be carefully
examined. The underlying theory of resource-bounded measure will be extended in
order to apply it to a wider variety of problems and probability measures. This
will include a systematic study of efficient martingales and transformations of
martingales. Applications of the extended theory to algorithmic information,
computational depth, machine learning and prediction, real-and complex-valued
computation, and the computation of higher-type functionals will be
investigated.
