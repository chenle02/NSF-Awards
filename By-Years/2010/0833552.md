A coalition of Carolina universities, school districts, state agencies, and
businesses called the Carolinas Virtual World Consortium are promoting the use
of 3 dimensional technologies in STEM education in middle schools through this
ITEST strategies project. Middle school students attend summer workshops to
learn about 3D modeling and design of virtual worlds, teachers join the students
during the second week of workshops to learn about 3D technologies and how they
can be implemented in the curriculum. Regional experts share real world problems
with teachers and students to generate possibilities for development of a 3D
immersive world. Students serving as technical experts and teachers as
curriculum and instruction experts then team to develop applications of virtual
technologies for STEM instruction over the course of the project. The goals of
the above activities are to engage teachers in continuous STEM learning,
interest students in pursuing STEM careers, and preparing students with the
skills necessary to succeed in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is based
in educational literature and in a pilot study with students in sixth grade
using 3D immersive technology to communicate information on explorers and
exploration. The literature and the findings point to students improving
engagement, communication, collaboration, use of information tools, STEM
knowledge gain, and creating diverse communities of learners working on
solutions to real-life problems. STEM content is expanded in this project by
adding experts in science, technology, and engineering to the leadership team.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Formative and summative evaluation of the objectives of
the project is guided by a series of questions and data and evidence is
collected using both quantitative and qualitative methods. &lt;br/&gt;
