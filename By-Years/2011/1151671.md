The principal investigator will probe the connection between two classes of
"homology-type" invariants of objects in low-dimensional topology: Khovanov
homology, whose (algebraic) construction originates in the higher representation
theory of quantum groups and Heegaard Floer homology, whose (geometric/analytic)
construction arises from ideas in symplectic geometry and gauge theory. This
project builds on, and seeks to re-explain from first principles, foundational
work of Ozsvath-Szabo, who constructed a deformation of the (reduced) Khovanov
homology of a link, thereby connecting it to the Heegaard Floer homology of its
double-branched cover. By understanding the relationship between "open" versions
of the two theories, the P.I. will obtain applications to questions about braids
and tangles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad aim of the present project is to
improve our understanding of the topology of 3- and 4-dimensional spaces, i.e.,
the properties of these spaces that remain unchanged under stretching and
contracting (but not under tearing and gluing). Topological ideas underpin the
development of efficient computer chips and information networks. The shapes of
molecules and proteins determine their electrical properties and biological
functions. Basing quantum computing algorithms on large-scale features of a
quantum system minimizes their susceptibility to random error. Moreover, knot
theory, the study of loops imbedded in 3-dimensional space, has become
increasingly important in our understanding of how DNA behaves in cells.
