In this project,experiments will be conducted to extend the current
understanding of natural convection phenomena in liquids evaporating at sub-
atmospheric pressures, and to establish the extent to which these phenomena can
be exploited in the design of energy-efficient vaporization processes. Special
attention will be focused on conditions which favor convection by differential
vapor recoil, which previously has been shown to increase interfacial heat
transfer rates by more than 20-fold. This mechanism is poorly understood and the
proposed experiments will confirm the role of this phenomenon in vacuum
vaporization processes.
