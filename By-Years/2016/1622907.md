The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to develop an innovative, low-cost light
source for an advanced retinal imaging device capable of early diagnosis and
monitoring of blinding diseases. Blinding diseases, including diabetic
retinopathy and macular degeneration and affect 500 million people worldwide.
The proposed technology is aimed at providing a novel non-invasive imaging
instrument that can rapidly and reliably assesses retinal health, empowering eye
care specialists to better treat and manage blinding diseases. For
ophthalmologists, the proposed tool should enable better care and improves
outcomes. For patients, it should provide a non-invasive, affordable test,
resulting in earlier diagnosis. For payers, it should lower healthcare
expenditures by reducing cost of care associated with blindness and by reducing
unnecessary or ineffective treatments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
project is to develop a low-cost light source that is suitable for our imaging
instrument, which utilize a type of imaging known as optical coherence
tomography (OCT). In order to enable commercial production of this industry
leading instrument, a new low cost light source needs to be engineered that
provides the same type of light as existing lasers, but at a fraction of the
cost. To realize the light source, this project will first design and fabricate
a plasmonic structural coupler that converts a non-spatial coherent visible
light emitted from a low cost LED into a broadband spatial coherent visible
light. Meanwhile, the light spatial coherence will be characterized
experimentally for examination and optimization. With optimized light sources,
the light output will be coupled into visible light optical coherence tomography
system for imaging.
