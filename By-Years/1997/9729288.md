Gregg 9729288 A field experiment will be conducted to measure ocean mixing in
the Indonesian throughflow. An acoustic Doppler current profiler and a high
frequency acoustic backscatter system will be used in conjunction with a
microstructure profiler to link the microstructure to the processes generating
the mixing and to provide a means for parameterizing the results in terms of the
forcing conditions. The study will focus on the Banda Sea as a site of very
intense conversion of barotropic tidal energy to baroclinic energy that can lead
to strong mixing of the water masses.
