9311879 Clore ABSTRACT Across a variety of tasks, recent research has shown a
surprisingly consistent tendency for social information processing to be
affected by background mood states. The experience of positive affect appears to
foster heuristic information processes (reliance on generalizations,
stereotypes, schemata, expectations, but also creative thinking). Negative
affect leads to more systematic processing (attention to detail, use of analytic
thinking and logic). Several explanations for these effects have been advanced.
This research will examine the social and nonsocial information processing
conditions under which these effects occur and test predictions from the major
explanations. Such new information about these pervasive tendencies promises a
clearer picture of the processes by which emotional factors affect everyday
thought and action.
