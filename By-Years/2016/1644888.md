The National Science Foundation uses the Early-concept Grants for Exploratory
Research (EAGER) funding mechanism to support exploratory work in its early
stages on untested, but potentially transformative, research ideas or
approaches. This EAGER project was awarded as a result of the invitation in the
Dear Colleague Letter NSF 16-080 to proposers from Historically Black Colleges
and Universities to submit proposals that would strengthen research capacity of
faculty at the institution. The project at Jackson State University seeks to
collect multi-scale meteorological data with mobile observing systems and
perform the data analysis of atmospheric environments at scales never before
sampled. The project provides research experiences for undergraduate students.
This project is funded by the Division of Integrative and Collaborative
Education and Research in the Directorate for
Geosciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to substantially expand the
realm of applications for mobile observations to geographic and phenomenological
settings that essentially remain "unexplored territory" at scales that are
unsampled by fixed in situ observing systems. Because mobile observations
sampled at high frequency can readily detect spatial variations on scales
ranging from tens of meters to hundreds of kilometers regardless of cloud or
precipitation conditions, they can uniquely fill in gaps between fixed stations
in order to bridge atmospheric scales from microscale to synoptic scale. The
research will conduct and analyze a wide variety of mobile transects in all
seasons and in collaboration with researchers at with University of Missouri at
Columbia. Cases are expected to focus on baroclinic zones, moisture boundaries,
and microscale variability. Primary raw data products will be temperature and
humidity sampled at 2 second intervals. The surface transects will be
supplemented where appropriate with lower tropospheric radiosonde launches.
