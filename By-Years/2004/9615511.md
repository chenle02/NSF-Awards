In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,
Ronald A. Siegel, of the School of Pharmacy of the University of California at
San Francisco will study pulsating polymer gels. This is research destined to
construct a chemical oscillator that could be used as a periodic pulsating
delivery system for compounds such as hormones, antibiotics or cell specific
cancer chemotherapeutic agents. A specific realization is proposed where the
membrane is a copolymer of N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPA) and methacrylic acid,
the substrate is glucose and the enzyme is glucose oxydase, gluconolactonase and
catalase and the product is acidic protons. It is shown that the NIPA/MMA
membranes are very permeable to glucose above a critical pH while below they are
glucose impermeable. This is the essential feature of the pulsating mechanism.
In the proposed work a chemomechanical pulsar will be constructed and the model
predictions will be tested. The effects of gel composition and pH buffers will
be tested, and used in the refinement of the mathematical model. Different
designs will be tested to improve the versatility of the device.
