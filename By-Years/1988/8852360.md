This project will support the establishment of a microcomputer laboratory which
will be an integral part of a program to improve the beginning mathematics
education of undergraduates in science, engineering, and secondary education at
Purdue University. It is being funded under the Instrumentation and Laboratory
Improvement (ILI) Program, which has the stated goal of improving "the quality
of the undergraduate curriculum by supporting projects to develop new or
improved instrument-based undergraduate laboratory and/or field courses in
science, mathematics, or engineering." In particular, this laboratory will be a
key element in the development of a computer-based discrete mathematics course
for pre-service high school teachers and in the design of a calculus sequence
appropriate for large classes. Types of computer activities and approaches will
include the use of symbolic manipulation and graphics and the performance of
tasks designed to encourage cognitive development.
