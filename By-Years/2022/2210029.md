Blockchains and cryptocurrencies have emerged as disruptive technologies with
profound financial and societal impact. This state of affairs makes it
imperative to gain better understanding of the dynamics and resilience of the
underlying peer-to-peer networks on which blockchains operate. To this end, this
project researches novel measurement methodologies, statistical modeling, and
design approaches for distributed consensus on these peer-to-peer networks. The
research aims to empower a broader participation of users worldwide, including
those with limited network access, and to support the decentralization and trust
elements that are key to the continued success of blockchain
technologies.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Blockchains have seen soaring adoption by
large corporations and small investors alike. This project contributes to
educating stakeholders and the general public about the benefits and risks of
these technologies. In a similar vein, the project seeks to leverage the
popularity of blockchains to broaden participation in computing with innovative
engagement of undergraduate and high school students. The methodologies produced
by this project promise to benefit adjacent research areas with similar
challenges, including within the databases and distributed computing
communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
