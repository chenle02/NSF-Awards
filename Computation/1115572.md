In this project, the investigator and his students design new efficient
structured matrix techniques for large linear systems, including fast direct
solvers and robust effective preconditioners. These techniques take advantage of
certain hidden rank structures in linear systems arising from practical
applications. Efficient multi-layer structures and flexible rank requirements
are considered. The methods have nearly linear complexity for linear systems
arising from the discretization of certain partial differential equations. They
can also work as effective preconditioners. Robustness of preconditioning for
positive definite problems is shown. The methods are useful for problems which
have been considered difficult for classical direct or iterative solvers.

This project has broader impacts in many complex numerical problems and
engineering simulations, such as differential equations, seismic imaging,
climate, electromagnetic field simulation, signal processing, and integrated
circuit simulation. The major computational work in these applications is often
to solve large-scale linear systems, which can benefit from the efficient black-
box solvers or preconditioners developed in this project. These methods help
break some classical lower complexity bounds. Students are involved in all
aspects of the project, and are trained in various mathematical and engineering
areas. The investigator's team plan to build a freely available open source
package for both practical applications and education. Minisymposia organized by
the investigator, as well as conferences talks, seminars, and journal articles,
are used to exchange ideas and to disseminate the results.
