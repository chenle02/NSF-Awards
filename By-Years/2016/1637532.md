A common objective in many computer networks is to balance traffic across
multiple paths in order to improve throughput, reduce congestion, and achieve
higher utilization. Although there is an extensive theoretical literature on how
best to route traffic through a capacitated network, most networks today rely on
schemes that are easy to implement but do not always perform well in practice.
This is due, in part, to the gap between the community of theory researchers who
study advanced routing schemes and the community of systems researchers who
design, build, and operate networks. It is also partly due to the lack of high-
level programming languages that make it easy to program advanced routing
functionalities in networks and to reason about the performance of such
programs.

This project will advance the theory and practice of routing by developing
oblivious and semi-oblivious routing algorithms that can be implemented on top
of current network hardware, accompanied by a probabilistic network programming
language and compiler. The intellectual merit of this research lies in
developing new routing algorithms that optimize for objectives such as
minimizing congestion and balancing load, designing new programming languages
based on probabilistic semantics that can be used to express and reason about
these algorithms, and building prototype implementations that can be deployed on
software-defined networking platforms. This project will have broad impact on
society by developing algorithms and tools that could help make networks more
reliable and efficient while simplifying network management. To reinforce this
broad impact, the project incorporates organizing an interdisciplinary workshop
at the intersection between algorithms and networking.
