The focus of this research is the preparation of chiral oxazolidinone
auxiliaries suitable for attachment to polymer supports. These systems will then
be used to induce chiral induction in aldol and Diels-Alder reactions. The ease
of recycling the auxiliaries will offer advantages over current methodology and
the potential for synthesizing small molecule libraries will be exploited. The
research will be carried out with the help of undergraduate participants. With
this Research in Undergraduate Institutions award, the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational
activities of Dr. Brian J. McNelis of the Department of Chemistry at Santa Clara
University. Professor McNelis, with the help of undergraduate coworkers, will
focus his work on developing new methods for solid-phase synthesis. The
methodology has the potential for application in the pharmaceutical industry for
the preparation of compounds with important biological properties.
