&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is for partial support of the Fifth International
Congress of Arctic Social Sciences (ICASSV) to be held at the University of
Alaska Fairbanks from May 19-23, 2004. Other support for the Congress is coming
from the University of Alaska system and participant fees. ICASS V is organized
by the International Arctic Social Sciences Association (IASSA). Beginning in
1992, IASSA has been organizing triennial congresses to bring together scholars
from around the world, including scientists, Arctic residents, and students to
discuss, review and evaluate social science research in the Arctic. The theme of
ICASS V, "Connections; Local and Global Aspects of Arctic Social Systems," has
strong intellectual merit by encouraging the participants to examine how Arctic
social and natural systems are connected to global processes.&lt;br/&gt;
