Biological Sciences (61) Research is an essential part of the Knox College
biology curriculum, with inquiry-based exercises the norm. Developmental biology
represents the junction of many different disciplines: anatomy and physiology
(plant and animal), molecular biology, evolution and ethics. It is a dynamic,
active area of research. This project establishes a research based advanced
laboratory course in developmental biology at Knox, by adopting the curriculum
and laboratory modules developed for undergraduates at Duke University and
Macalester College (DUE 9950879). The end result is an active, student-driven
learning experience. Students investigate major questions in developmental
biology, including determination of cell fate, embryo patterning, gene
regulation and the processes of forming specialized organs and tissues using
classical embryology along with molecular techniques. The course is divided into
two sections, classical embryology and developmental genetics, each with several
different units. Students examine vertebrate (chick, Xenopus), invertebrate (sea
urchin, Drosophila) and plant (Arabidopsis) model systems using techniques
including micromanipulation, microinjection, in situ hybridization,
immunofluorescence, analysis of transgenic organisms, and fate mapping. Students
design and perform experiments. The research grade microscopes and video imaging
systems give students the power to collect, store, and retrieve data with ease,
allowing them to easily compare different stages of development, as well as the
effects of perturbations. By allowing the students the opportunity to master
sophisticated techniques, we advance the level of research in the course. These
skills, as well as the research grade microscopes, provide students an excellent
starting point for independent undergraduate research.
