9312996 Ullman THis project develop a prototype computer based design aid that
give engineering decision support over a project lifecycle based on whatever
incomplte, inconsistent, and interdependent information is available. The system
does not require knowledge beyond that normally used by engineers in their
standard work experience. The resulting prototype supports engineering teams in
reaching a decision about an issue based on current knowledge about alternatives
to solve the issue and arguments supporting or opposing those alternatives. The
level of support improves as the level of knowledge improves. The techniques
developed integrate and support traditional decision making tools such as
optimization, CPM, and decision trees. The decision support philosophy and
system are validated through a set of balanced experiments. ***
