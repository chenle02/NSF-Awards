9401797 Brown Ohio State University requests support from NSF for the connection
of Tiffin University to the Ohio Academic Resources Network (OARnet) which is
the NSF mid-level network that serves the State of Ohio. A primary goal of
OARnet is to facilitate collaborative projects and sharing of resources between
institutions, including those outside the state. OARnet will provide operations
management and information services and it will give the school a 56 thousand
bit per second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per
second) National Backbone network. The school needs greater functionality and
network speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file
transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system.
Students and faculty research will benefit from the link. This is also a unique
opportunity for the schools to explore innovative educational resources.
