The chromaffin vesicles of the adrenal medulla participate in the synthesis,
storage and secretion of catecholamines and are analogous to synaptic vesicles
in catecholaminergic neurons in the central and peripheral nervous system.
Knowledge of the synthesis and factors regulating the synthesis of major
functional or constituitive proteins of the vesicles, namely dopamine-beta-
hydroxylase and chromogranin A, and their incorporation into chromaffin vesicles
will enhance our understanding of the secretory cycle in the adrenal madulla and
sympathetic nerves. The objectives of the proposed research are to characterize
the synthesis of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase and chromogranin A and their
subsequent incorporation into chromaffin vesicles, to determine whether certain
factors affect these processes and to determine whether chromaffin vesicle
membranes are recycled using primary cultures of adrenal medullary cells. The
synthesis of the proteins and their incorporation into chromaffin vesicles will
be determined by labeling cell cultures with ı35S!methionine followed by
quantitative immunoprecipitation of the labeled proteins with monospecific anti-
sera. The radiochemical purity of the immunoprecipitates will be verified by gel
electrophresis and autoradiography. Preliminary studies show that adrenal
medullary cells labeled with ı35S!methionine secrete a highly labeled protein
into the culture medium. This protein is the major labeled protein which appears
in the medium and represents about 5% of the ı35S!methionine incorporated into
total protein. Dr. Kirshner proposes to: 1) further characterize the synthesis
and secretion of the protein; 2) to purify the protein and determine its
molecular weight and subunit structure; 3) to establish its identity either as a
known protein or as a new protein.
