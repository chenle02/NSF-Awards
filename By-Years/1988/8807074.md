The mechanical quality factor (Q) of low-loss metallic alloys and elements will
be studied at temperatures from 50 mK to 4 K and at a frequency of about 1 kHz.
Material selection will be based on anticipated suitability for use for ultralow
temperature Weber-bar gravity wave detectors. The currently favored material for
planned detectors is aluminum 50-56 alloy, but alternate materials exhibit
superior bondability, thermal conductivity and density. There are practically no
ultralow temperature Q-data on these materials, and it is urgently needed to
assess their suitability for constructing large-scale detectors. Qs will be
obtained from the measured time constants of decay of free vibrations of small
mechanical resonators mounted in a dilution refrigerator cryostat. Materials to
be investigated include copper alloys, aluminum alloys, and transition element
metals. Experimental studies will emphasize careful metallurgical
characterization and systematic elimination of extrinsic contributions to
measured quality factors. In addition to supporting gravity wave detector
development, it is expected that the results will contribute to the fundamental
understanding of mechanical loss mechanisms in metals at ultralow temperatures.
