In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Physical Chemistry Program
of the Chemistry Division, Balasubramanian will carry out large-scale
calculations on semiconductor clusters. These calculations will investigate the
energy and structure of these clusters. Multi-configuration self-consistent
field, followed by configuration interaction and relativistic configuration
interaction calculations are proposed for heavy mixed semiconductor clusters
containing gallium, arsenic,indium, antimony, tin, lead, and bismuth atoms. The
energy separations of low-lying electronic states, geometries, ionization
potentials, electron affinities, and binding energies will be investigated as a
function of cluster size.
