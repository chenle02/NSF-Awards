This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
conference "Modern Aspects of Complex Geometry," held May 14-17, 2015, on the
campus of the University of Cincinnati. Conference web site:
www.artsci.uc.edu/departments/math/complex_geometry_conference.html

This is a conference in the general area of geometric function theory. The event
seeks to focus attention on and highlight connections between a variety of
topics, including the theory of quasiconformal mappings, mappings of finite
distortion, potential theory, analysis on metric spaces, and Teichmuller theory.
The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students,
postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.
