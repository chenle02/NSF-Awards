In the brain, the process of sensory-motor integration produces behavioral
outputs that are generated as a result of sensory computation and orchestration
of motor commands. In animals with complex brains, this process can involve
enormously complex neuronal circuits. Although large-scale morphological units
for sensory motor integration are known, little is known about the precise
neuronal circuits mediating sensory-motor integration in vertebrate species
including humans. There are fish species known as 'weakly electric fish' that
emit weak electrical signals into their surrounding environment and use them for
navigation and communication. These fish provide models for the vertebrate brain
in which relatively simple sensory and motor systems can be studied together,
because rather precise sensory processes and their neuronal substrates are
already known, and motor behaviors and their immediate controlling circuits are
also now known. This project is aimed at understanding how individual behavioral
acts are organized in the brain of a species of weakly electric fish.
Electrophysiological and neuroanatomical techniques are used to investigate
activity of nerve cells in the brain that are involved in well-defined
electrical behaviors of the fish. Results will clarify the exact location,
morphology and function of neurons that mediate specific behaviors. &lt;br/&gt;
The expected results from the proposed study will have an impact on our
understanding of both sensory and motor principles underlying behavioral
organization within the brain. The project also involves work spanning the
scales from subcellular to behavioral, and so provides valuable training for
graduate and undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;
