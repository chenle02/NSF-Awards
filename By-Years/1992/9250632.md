The equipment is completing a modernization of the two-quarter Electronic Design
class offered by the Physics Department. A third one-quarter class in computer
interfacing is being developed. It will involve students in using personal
computers to control temperature, and to measure the temperature dependent
optical transmission of a simple Fabry- Perot etalon. They are using a real-time
multitasking UNIX- like operating system, the C programming language, analog to
digital and digital to analog converters, and rudiments of feedback control
theory.
