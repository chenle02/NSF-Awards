9701540 R. Baker Kearfott During the past two decades, understanding of
singularities, bifurcations and related phenomena, and relevance to the physical
world have increased. At the same time, tools for bounding discretization and
roundoff error have improved, to allow automatic result verification based on
classical fixed point theory. Traditionally, such verification proceeds by
linearization, then bounding with interval arithmetic. However, in methods
developed to date, existence and uniqueness verification necessarily must fail
when the system is singular at solutions. Goals of this project are to (1)
develop new, simple and natural modifications to existing verification
techniques, to prove existence and uniqueness when the nonlinear system is
singular; (2) investigate the power of the resulting tools, first for finite-
dimensional problems (algebraic systems), then for infinite-dimensional problems
(differential and integral equations); (3) increase understanding of
singularities. Many complex systems throughout the sciences and engineering,
ranging from load-bearing civil engineering structures to ecological systems to
human heart rythms, are modeled by sets of nonlinear equations that exhibit
singularities and bifurcations. Such bifurcations correspond to changes in
behavior as conditions (the load, a temperature, etc.) change. Understanding of
such phenomena has blossomed in recent years, but analytical problems remain.
This study will provide tools to enable an efficient and automated, yet
mathematically airtight analysis. This in turn will lead to more predictability
in the physical world.
