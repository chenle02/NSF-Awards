Anthropological research from the early 1960s helped educators focus their
attention on teaching and learning as a sociolinguistic process. Teachers were
asked to become more sensitive to the speech style differences of their minority
students. Educational reform initiatives applied the findings from
sociolinguistic research on cross-cultural and multi-ethnic classroom settings
and broadened participation structures to create educational equity among
diverse groups. Similar sociolinguistic assumptions can be found driving the
current reform of mathematics education led by the National council of Teachers
of Mathematics (NCTM. The NCTM standards emphasize communication skills so that
all students can become mathematically literate. This study focuses on how the
NCTM standards attempt to achieve educational equity through a prescribed
restructuring of classroom communication and discourse patterns. However,
critics of the sociolinguistic approach to educational equity have argued that
broader socioeconomic and racial issues prevent some minorities more than others
from full participation in school. This study follows a dual course. Using a
sociolinguistic framework, it approaches language usage within the immediate
setting of the mathematics classroom. Using an ethnographic framework, it
examines the broader historical, political, and economic contexts within which
the classroom and its students are situated. A comprehensive sociolinguistic
model of elementary school mathematics discourse will be constructed which will
expand the anthropological and sociolinguistic notions of context of situation
and functions of language. In addition, this study will address what educators,
teachers, and taxpayers need to know about a.)the cultural and linguistic
diversities of students, b.)the underlying sociolinguistic assumptions used by
the NCTM standards, c.)the feasibility of the NCTM national mathematics
standards, and d.)the efficacy of national educational reforms that aim to
achieve educational by relying on strategies to restructure classroom
communication and discourse patterns.
