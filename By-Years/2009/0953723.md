Graphical models, such as Bayesian networks and influence diagrams, provide
principled approaches to solving reasoning and decision making under uncertainty
problems. However, the adaptability and scalability of existing methods for
these graphical models are often limited. This project aims to address some of
these limitations by developing new and improved approaches to explanation,
decision making, and learning in graphical models. It includes the following
specific objectives: (1) developing new approaches to finding explanations that
only contain the most relevant variables for given observations in Bayesian
networks, (2) developing heuristic search-based methods and algorithms to solve
influence diagrams more efficiently, (3) developing new algorithms for learning
optimal Bayesian networks guided by domain-specific heuristic information so
that only a small fraction of the solution space need to be explored, and (4)
applying the methods developed in this project to real-world applications
including multiple-fault diagnosis, supply chain risk management, and online
collaborative learning.

This project can lead to significantly better approaches to reasoning and
decision making under uncertainty in many disciplines where graphical models
have found successful applications, including medicine, security, planning,
business, economics, education, and many others. This project can also lead to
the development of new and enhanced courses and curricula, the involvement of
students from underrepresented groups in the research, and a wide dissemination
of the research outcomes through free software, publications, and presentations.
