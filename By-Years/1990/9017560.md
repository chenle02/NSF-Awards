The proposed research investigates thermal, species, and hydrodynamic transport
relevant to solidification of liquid metals. These coupled processes occur
within the liquid melt during solidification and modify heat and species
transport rates at the solid-mushy-liquid interfaces, inducing changes in the
solidification rate and, ultimately, variations in the mechanical and electrical
properties of the finished product. %%% The overall objective of this proposal
is to increase our understanding of heat and mass transfer processes relevant to
solidification of liquid metals with a primarily experimental approach. The most
creative feature of this research is the utilization of neutron radiography to
visualize and measure various transport-related processes within the molten
metal during solidification of pure metals or metallic alloys.
