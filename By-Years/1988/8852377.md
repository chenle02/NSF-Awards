A plan for developing a laboratory to accompany two undergraduate courses in
sensors and actuators is described. The principal objectives of this laboratory
are: (1) To provide students with opportunities for investigating the
operational characteristics of a variety of thermo-mechanical sensors and
actuators; (2) To introduce students to methods by which the signals detected by
ideal as well as non-ideal transducers can be processed to recover information
about a point or region in a specimen which may or may not be adjacent to the
measurement point; (3) To provide appropriate software for modeling the response
of a sensor; and (4) To provide students the opportunity for designing,
fabricating and verifying the operation of a sensor meeting specific design
objectives. The principal pieces of equipment necessary to establish this
laboratory include: (a) sensor and actuator systems; (b) signal excitation,
detection, and measuring equipment; and (c) data acquisition and processing
instruments. Experiments are planned for a broad range of transducer
technologies. Students will learn experimental methods for determining a
sensor's spatial and temporal transfer characteristics.
