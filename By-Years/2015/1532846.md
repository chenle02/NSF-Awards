This project aims to develop and test a new conceptual framework for
understanding brain function, and informing biologically based artificial
intelligence systems. The underlying theory holds that the properties of any
neuron and any cortical area are not fixed but undergo state changes with
changing perceptual task, expectation and attention. Because of the multiple
routes by which this top-down information can be conveyed, each neuron is
essentially a microcosm of the brain as a whole. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this
framework, a neuron is viewed as an adaptive processor rather than merely a link
in a labeled line, taking on functions that are required for performing the
current task. The theory accounts for cortical function at the circuit level.
Through an interaction between feedback and intrinsic connections neurons select
inputs that are relevant to a task and suppress inputs that are irrelevant. The
experiments will combine visual psychophysics, fMRI, large scale high density
electrode array recordings and optogenetic manipulation. These techniques will
be used to measure changes in effective connectivity between cortical areas and
the relationship between effective connectivity and the information represented
by neurons at different recording sites as animals perform different visual
recognition tasks. Computational models will be developed to account for how
task-dependent gating of connections can be achieved and will reproduce the
functional dynamics observed experimentally. Though the experiments will focus
on the visual modality, the findings from the work will formulate a general
theory of brain function that is broadly applicable to the brain as a whole.
