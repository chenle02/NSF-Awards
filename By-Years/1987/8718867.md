The Astronomy Department of the University of Virginia intends to acquire a
Perkin.Elmer PDS microdensitometer and accessories. The PDS will be used
primarily in conjunction with the large (over 146,000) collection of astrometric
plates in the files of the Leander McCormick Observatory. The measuring engine
with a laser interferometry coordinate readout will improve accuracy and
productivity in the existing astrometric programs. The astrometric projects
which will benefit most from the PDS include: 1) studies of parallaxes of Hyades
cluster members, white dwarfs and the population II main sequence stars; and 2)
analysis of astrometric binaries. Studies where the PDS system will contribute
to ongoing research in the department include: 1) surface photometry in faint
outlying regions of spiral galaxies; 2) determinations of the luminosity
function for clusters of galaxies; 3) detection and measurement of Hydrogen
alpha from emission line galaxies in clusters; and 4) analysis of ground-based
optical data of interesting ultraviolet (UV) sources found in the Ultraviolet
Imaging Telescope program.
