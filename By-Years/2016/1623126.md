Achieving Competitive Excellence Implementation Projects in the Historically
Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate program provide support to
design, implement, study and assess comprehensive institutional efforts to
increase the numbers of students and the quality of their preparation by
strengthening science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education
and research. This project at the University of the Virgin Islands seeks to
develop a growth mindset and creativity through specific evidence-based
interventions. The project will be validated with a carefully designed
educational research study which focuses on the novel use of growth mindset
training. The project is guided and informed by an on-going
evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific objectives of the project are to:
increase by 15% the retention and persistence rates for those STEM students who
struggle early in their college careers; increase by 10% overall persistence and
graduation rates for STEM students; increase the self-efficacy of STEM students
as measured by validated, reliable instruments; establish a summer bridge
program focused on mathematics for incoming freshmen; have summer and academic
year research experiences; conduct mindset training in the freshman development
seminar; and develop a sustained, comprehensive evidence-based faculty
development program, which will give faculty the skills and tools necessary for
the success of the overall model. This project will provide a validated
replicable model that can be used by other open admissions or low selectivity
universities and community colleges throughout the Nation.
