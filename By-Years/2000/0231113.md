A team of mathematicians and computer scientists is developing curricular
materials, based on original historical sources, for beginning to advanced
undergraduate courses in discrete mathematics, courses which today draw a
significant number of computer science majors. The historical modules offer
excerpts from original source material, together with a sequence of student
exercises designed to illuminate the groundbreaking ideas introduced in the
source. Pilot testing is also underway at a diverse set of institutions,
including the University of the District of Columbia, Northern Kentucky
University, Indiana University of Pennsylvania, the University of Southern
Colorado, and the United States Military Academy. Other institutions are being
added as the project progresses. In addition, the project provides graduate
students at New Mexico State University an opportunity to perform apprentice
teaching, which also generates additional feedback on the materials. Particular
advantages of the historical approach include providing context and direction
for the subject matter, honing students' verbal and deductive skills through
reading original works, and the rediscovery of conceptual roots common to both
discrete mathematics and computer science.
