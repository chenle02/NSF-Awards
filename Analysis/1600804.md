Geometry and analysis have become increasingly important to real world
applications in the last few decades. We are now capable of gathering immense
amounts of data, and so it is a central concern to develop quick and efficient
ways of analyzing this data. In many instances, one can endow the points of a
data set with a notion of distance and weight, thereby giving us a geometric
representation of the data. One can then try to take advantage of this geometry
and leverage this information to speed up computations on the data set. This
project seeks to develop new techniques and theorems for understanding the
geometric and analytic structure of spaces with some notion of distance and
(possibly) weight. Some basic questions the project will address are the
following: Can I represent my space in some other space (e.g. Euclidean space)
so that the geometry is preserved with high fidelity? Does my space exhibit low
dimensional behavior despite living in a possibly high (or infinite) dimensional
space? Is there a calculus available on my space that I can use to analyze
functions on the space?

This project will study analytic and geometric properties of certain classes of
metric measure spaces. In the first part of the project, the PI will study
problems about metric embeddings including whether doubling subsets of Hilbert
space embed into Euclidean spaces and developing biLipschitz metric invariants
to measure uniform smoothness. The second part of the project will focus on
detecting rectifiable behavior in metric measure spaces. Rectifiable spaces
admit parameterizations by simple model spaces (usually Euclidean space) and so
can exhibit low dimensional behavior. The PI will study Carnot notions of
rectifiability and also link these geometric properties to boundedness of
singular integrals. Finally, the PI will continue his study into the nature of
Lipschitz differentiability on metric measure spaces as introduced by Cheeger.
The project will determine whether such differentiation differs between real
valued and RNP Banach space valued functions. If these notions turn out to be
different, the PI will then seek to discover the geometric mechanisms for the
former (the PI has already been geometrically characterized the latter). The PI
will also seek to broaden the differentiability theory to non-Banach space
target.
