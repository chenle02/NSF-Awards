This project is building on prior work (DUE-0735655) that produced OrganicPad, a
free form, interactive, tablet-PC-based chemical structure drawing program. The
PIs are developing SocraticGraphs - a web-based, cross platform system that
recognizes student free-form input and provides tiered levels of contextual,
"Socratic" feedback and support for learners as they construct graphical
representations without the constraints usually imposed by computer based
assessment and tutorial systems. SocraticGraphs provides a unique graphics-based
interactive learning system designed to i) recognize and respond to student
actions in a naturalistic manner and ii) facilitate studies on how students come
to understand of scientific concepts, develop analytical representations and re-
express and interpret data. This system is applicable to a wide range of
disciplines including biology, chemistry, physics, geosciences, mathematics, and
engineering. &lt;br/&gt;The design of each activity is guided by preliminary
research using pencil and paper tutorials, student interviews and direct
observations of students as they work through preliminary versions of the on-
line materials. The PIs are developing a range of activities in chemistry,
physics and molecular biology, each of which will probe and respond with
contextual Socratic feedback. The data from student responses are recorded and
stored in a database for analysis using a number of data-mining techniques
including Hidden Markov Modeling and Artificial Neural Nets. Ultimately, the
project is providing activities that respond to student free-form input "on the
fly" with the aim of developing analytical thinking skills and a robust and
rigorous understanding of scientific phenomena.
