Several behaviors are differentially expressed in male and female mammals as
adults, typically regulated by the levels of steroid hormones that were present
during early postnatal development. A number of differences in the brain also
have been correlated with sex differences in behavior, including differences in
numbers and density of particular nuclei (clusters of nerve cells) in parts of
the brain. Changes in these neural parameters suggest that changes also are
required in the afferent and efferent neural connections of these nuclei. This
project combines hormonal treatments with quantitative neuroanatomy to test the
hypothesis that neonatal steroids regulate male sexual behavior by regulating
the development of the number, density, and interconnections of neurons in the
magnocellular part of the medial preoptic nucleus (MPN mag), which is involved
in olfactory-driven male sexual behavior. This study provides a unique
opportunity to clarify functional roles of neuronal differences in sexually
dimorphic structures in the brain, and will be important for future molecular
studies underlying dimorphic neurogenesis, so the impact will extend to
developmental biology. In addition, the broader impact promotes research by a
woman investigator from an underrepresented group, who is actively involved in
increasing the representation of minority students in scientific research.
