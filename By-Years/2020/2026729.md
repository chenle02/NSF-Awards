The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide a
painless and convenient solution to diabetes patients to help them self-manage
the disease. It will also help pre-diabetic people determine blood glucose
levels at an earlier stage. This project will explore translation mechanisms for
a novel sensor that can be measured with commercial electronic products, such as
a smartphone camera. The system also uses artificial intelligence to help
interpret the results. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project provides an
artificial intelligence-based plasmonic sensing system for gas sensing and
biosensing purposes. The project uses specially designed and fabricated
nanostructures with a plasmonic sensor generating an optical signal at visible
wavelengths. The resulting signal can be measured by a CMOS camera. A neural
network-based data analyzing system is used to study the images and thus
classify and quantify the target analytes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
