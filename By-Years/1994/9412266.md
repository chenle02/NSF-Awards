9412266 Overman The focus of this research will be on the synthesis of
stereochemically complex oxygen and nitrogen heterocycles by new cyclization
methods and on the development of a general method for asymmetric catalysis of
3,3 -sigmatropic rearrangements. Five marine natural products, ptilomycalin A,
crambescidin 800, isocrambescidin 800, manzamine A and (E)-pinnatifidenyne are
the specific synthetic targets. %%% With this renewal award, the Synthetic
Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Larry E. Overman of the
Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Irvine. Professor
Overman will focus his work on the development of economical methods for the
synthesis of complex organic molecules. The approach is expected to impact the
discovery, development and production components of the pharmaceutical,
agricultural and materials industries. ***
