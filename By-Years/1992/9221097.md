Throughout much of the past three hundred years the settlement of New England
has resulted in the destruction and fragmentation of native forest vegetation.
Recently, there has been an increase in forest regeneration in this region. This
study is designed to gather field data from a variety of sites that will be used
to parameterize a model of forest development based on actual starting
conditions measured in the field. Forest dynamics is a function of seed
dispersal, seedling establishment, and differential growth rates of component
species. In this study field experiments will be conducted in a range of forest
habitats to determine the role of seed dispersal and herbivory in effecting
forest regeneration. The results from these experiments will be used to adjust
and improve the forest dynamics model called SORTIE. Models such as SORTIE
provide baseline data under known conditions against which it will be possible
to compare actual patterns of forest regeneration. The mechanisms associated
with the model will dramatically increase our ability to predict changes in
forest vegetation. The ability to predict changes will have important
implications for global climate change and its effects on future biodiversity.
%%% Previous approaches to modelling forest dynamics have relied exclusively on
average response variables and average environmental conditions. The SORTIE
model represents a vast improvement over earlier models because it is truly
spatially explicit. Initial conditions will be derived from positions of
individual trees and saplings measured in the field. In addition, the actual
environmental conditions in different stands will be measured and incorporated
into the model. The role of herbivores in forest regeneration is being measured
and added to the model. Finally, this model represents an advance because it
incorporates environmental heterogeneity.
