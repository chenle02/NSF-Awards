9317031 Varga Accommodation zones facilitate reversals in both the dip
directions of normal fault systems and tilt directions of fault blocks and this
coordinate the large-scale segmentation of continental rifts. This study will
investigate accommodation zones that trend perpendicular to the extension
direction, termed interference accommodation zones. The study will utilize
exposures in the northern part of the Colorado River extensional corridor.
Results will help define the three-dimensional geometry and kinematic evolution
of interference accommodation zones.
