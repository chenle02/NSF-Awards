Lange, Andrew 96-17161 Dr. Lange will use measurements from the Sunyaev-
Zel'dovich Infrared Experiment (SuZIE) at the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory
to survey a large sample of clusters of galaxies over a two- year period. The
goals of the program are to measure the peculiar velocity field of the clusters,
to measure the scale anisotropy of the CMB, to determine a value for the Hubble
constant based on an unbiased sample of clusters, to determine the number
density of high redshift clusters, and to characterize the confusion due to
unresolved sources in the CMB anisotropy measurements.
