The STEM scholarship project is designed to increase the number of students from
underrepresented groups with Bachelor's degrees and well-qualified to
participate in the nation's workforce or to continue their education in graduate
school. To achieve the goal, 10 students per semester are being awarded
scholarships each year, scholarships that are directly offsetting the financial
need that derails many such aspirants at this institution. The focus of the
project is on retention, and as such, is using, in broad terms, the integration
of research and education as the core guiding principle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To
ensure scholars success, the project is engaging them in cutting edge education
opportunities and is encouraging them to participate significantly in
undergraduate research, both on campus during the academic year, and off-campus
during summers. The scholars are receiving educational and research support
through faculty and peer involvement as well as career counseling and advising.
Academic support programs such as supplemental instruction and early warning
signal monitoring are being used to ensure scholar success. Integration of the
scholars with complementary, existing programs such as participation in the
Annual Research and Creative Activity Symposium is being used to contribute to
the growth of the students. Opportunities for travel to professional conferences
are considered as additional motivation for the
scholars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is focusing on recruiting students
from underrepresented groups, including the 92% of ASU's student population that
is African American, desiring to major in molecular biology, immunology,
nanobiotechnology, chemistry, physics, polymer science, computational science,
or mathematics.
