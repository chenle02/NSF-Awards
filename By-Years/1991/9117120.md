This award is for funding of travel support for U.S. participants in the 2nd
International Symposium on Experimental Robotics (ISER), to be held in Toulous,
France on 25-27 June, 1991. The Symposium is an important one in that it draws
attention to the issues in experimental validation of theoretical research in
robotics, and has a wide international participation. The NSF- funded
participants will each prepare a report on the findings of the meeting, and
their conclusions will be summariezed and submitted to a robotics publication.
