The importance of being able to decompose a large-scale engineering system into
smaller subsystems which may be designed independently (yet concurrently) and
integrated into a whole cannot be overemphasized. Many algorithms for the
analysis of decomposed systems require that all variables, constraints,
objectives and linkages between subsystems be precisely identified and
rigorously specified. In practice, this extremely rigorous definition of the
system and subsystems is often unattainable. The objective of this research is
to develop a method of system analysis and synthesis based on the principles
embodied in fuzzy set theory; a mathematical approach that has been developed to
model imprecision rigorously. Specifically, the mathematics of fuzzy set theory
will be incorporated into methods for hierarchical and non-hierarchical
decomposition and resynthesis of problems. The resulting procedures will be
integrated to provide a powerful tool for effecting the design of complex
engineering systems through hierarchic and/or non-hierarchic decomposition in a
fuzzy design environment.
