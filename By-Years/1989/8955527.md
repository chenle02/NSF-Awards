Furman University will initiate a 5-week commuter Young Scholars project for 16
students in grades 10-12 in environmental science. The students will be divided
into four research teams, which will also include a faculty director, high
school science teacher, and Furman undergraduate. A central core of lectures
developing concepts in spectroscopy, chromatography, and electrochemistry will
be reinforced by hands-on use of modern analytical instruments. Each student
will be assigned a specific research problem, and will participate in weekly
group meetings. These studies will be complemented by field trips and lectures
on career planning and ethical issues. Follow-up activities will include a
research symposium and participation in the SC Junior Academy competition and
Westinghouse Science Talent Search.
