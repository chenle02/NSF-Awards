This project will develop a set of tools that will automatically map data and
computation for HPF programs, thereby reducing the programming time and effort
required for producing efficient and portable parallel programs. The system of
tools will use the alignment-distribution graph as the internal representation
of Fortran 90 (and HPF) programs and use graph-theoretic, linear- algebraic and
discrete optimization techniques to determine alignment and distribution of
arrays that minimize program completion time. The system will not be limited to
the `owner- computes` rule often employed by HPF compilers, but will choose the
computation rules that minimize running time of the program. The system will
also provide a back-end for generating code for message passing systems, and a
graphical user interface for debugging and visual feedback. The project will
develop algorithms for inter-procedural layout analysis, and heuristics for
reducing the complexity of analysis algorithms. The educational component of
this project will develop undergraduate courses with laboratory emphasizing
experiment design, measurement and use of statistical analysis.
