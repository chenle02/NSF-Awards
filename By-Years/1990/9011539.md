A conference on mechanical fatigue of advanced materials will be held in
January, 1991 at Santa Barbara, CA. This is a relatively new but increasingly
critical field. The focus will be on structural ceramics and ceramic matrix
composites, including intermetallic matrix composites. It is hoped by the
organizers that the meeting will provide a forum for exchange of ideas among
ceramists, metallurgists, and fatigue specialists.
