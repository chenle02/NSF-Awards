We propose a novel marriage of new fundamentals of data structures and
algorithms with the productive tools of generic programming. Together they
promise tools that could make high performance computing available to any
scientist. The data structure is the Morton-order representation of matrices
(and arrays in general), which admits both row, column, and quadrant
decompositions. Its benefits are grounded in architecture where it solves
problems of locality at all levels of a memory hierarchy. The favored algorithms
use divide- and-conquer recursion-a style associated with functional
programming-because they address the problems of balanced scheduling and
communication of distributed and multiprocessing. Generic programming
contributes, also, to this higher-level algebraic view of program construction.
The anticipated result is a style for parallel programming without requiring
explicit choreography either of memory or of processors. That is, the programmer
can specify computations, and eventually new algorithms, with a high-level
language closer to mathematics. We propose to develop the tools and the
techniques to carry these programs to an efficient parallel
implementation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Products will include a new programming
style, new efficiencies for parallel and Grid computing, tools to carry old
codes into this environment, tools to support the new generation of programs,
support for teaching a new generation of programmers, and new algorithms that
can only be inspired by this high-level perspective on
programming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
