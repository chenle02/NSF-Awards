This award is in support of the second Greenland Ice Sheet Project (GISP II).
The objective of GISP II is the retrieval and analysis of a deep ice core from
central Greenland. Deep ice cores from polar regions provide key paleoclimate
data sets because they bridge the time scale gap between other proxy records
with annual resolution, but relatively short time scales, and those which have a
resolution of hundreds to thousands of years. This award will assure efficient
and timely access to ice core data as they become available, as well as provide
for the safe, long-term, archival of key data through the design and
implementation of a comprehensive data accession and archival system for ice
core data. National Snow and Ice Data Center will provide data management and
archiving services to ensure efficient and centralized access to the total data
set and the permanent retention of key data. Because of the widespread and
increasing interest in paleoclimate and global change, these data sets will be
used not only by GISP II, but there will be an ever increasing demand from
fields outside glaciology for this type of data.
