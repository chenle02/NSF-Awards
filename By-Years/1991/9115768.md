The goal of this project is to develop algorithms and prototype software for
solving large-scale mixed-integer programs and to develop application routines
for solving problems that arise in distribution, manufacturing, production
scheduling and resource allocation. The motivation behind this research is the
tremendous demand for efficient and robust mixed-integer programming algorithms
in the preceding domains. A Mixed-Integer Optimizer (Minto) system was developed
by these researchers in prior projects. The MINTO system allows a researcher to
customize general mixed- integer optimization code through application routines
and concentrate on problem specifics rather that implementation details of tools
like linear programming. The project will research methods to strengthen the
capabilities of MINTO. It will also research the development of the application
routines for generic problems in distribution, scheduling, manufacturing and
resource allocation. Real application data will be used to test the customized
systems.
