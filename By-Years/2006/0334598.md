The P.I. will explore the potential of using leaf waxes in ocean sediments to
quantitatively determine the seasonal strength of winds associated with Asian
monsoon systems in the Holocene. The assumption is that winds carry terrestrial
organic compounds and that the makeup of the compounds is dependent on wind
strength and direction. Thus the organic biomarkers may give an indication of
Austral-Asian Monsoon strength. The proposal asks for funding to do calbration
studies from core tops. This unique proxy may be an improvement on others which
record ocean upwelling or productivity which are often difficult to
interpret.&lt;br/&gt;
