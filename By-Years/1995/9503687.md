This research addresses principles for organizing predictable and flexible
behavior in complex sensorimotor systems operating in unstructured environments.
The central hypothesis of the work is that large classes of correct behavior can
be constructed at run-time through the use of a small set of properly designed
control primitives (the control basis) and that the skillful use of these
sensorimotor primitives generalizes well to other tasks. A control basis is
designed to represent a broad class of tasks, to structure the exploration of
control policies to avoid irrelevant or unsafe alternatives, and to facilitate
adaptive optimal compensation. The Discrete Event Dynamic Systems (DEDS)
framework is used to characterize the control basis and to prune inappropriate
control composition policies. Dynamic programming (DP) techniques are used to
explore safe composition policies in which sensory and motor resources are bound
to elements of the control basis to maximize the expected future payoff. An
adaptive compensation policy is designed to extend the control basis and to
incrementally approximate optimal control policies. A program of theoretical
development and empirical analysis is undertaken to demonstrate the utility of
this approach in robotics and machine learning applications.
