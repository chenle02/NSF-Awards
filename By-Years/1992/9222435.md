RUI: Studies of Gravitation, the Interstellar Medium, and Pulsars. Dr. Weisberg
will continue investigations in three areas. (1) Studies of relativistic
gravitation with the first binary pulsar: Continued observations of this pulsar
will be used for investigation of gravitational radiation emission, geodetic
spin precession, the constancy of G, and constraints on alternatives to general
relativity. (2) Measurements and analyses of pulsar distances and the
interstellar medium; 21-cm--pulsar absorption spectra will be measured. These
data will be used to study pulsar distances and the neutral hydrogen and free
electron distribution and density in the Galaxy. (3) A pulsar polarimetry and
timing survey: Polarization and timing measurements will be made on 120 pulsars
at three-month intervals at the Arecibo Observatory. The output of these
observations will be used for studies of pulsar emission mechanisms, pulse
morphology, glitches, timing noise, and precession; and, via Faraday rotation
measurements, investigations of the galactic magnetic field. This award is made
under the Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) activity at the NSF.
