A multi-institution field experiment is designed to study the spatial and
temporal evolution of North Brazil Current (NBC) retroflection and the
separation of rings from the retroflection. The physical structure of the rings
after separation from the NBC, including their sizes, vertical structure,
horizontal swirl velocities and the volume of South Atlantic water they trap and
transport will be determine. The observations will combine complementary
techniques: an inverted echo sounder array within satellite altimeter
tracklines, current, temperature and salinity mooring, Lagrangian surface
drifters and subsurface floats and shipboard surveys.
