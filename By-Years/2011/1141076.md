This project is creating hands-on activities to improve STEM problem-solving
skills of students who are deaf and hard-of-hearing. Engineering professors
affiliated with Rochester Institute of Technology, the National Technical
Institute for the Deaf and Toyota Production Systems Laboratory are
collaborating to develop three modules to present problem-solving content to
students in a visual and hands-on mode that is closely tied to the type of
problems that engineers solve in different industry settings. A professional
evaluator is helping the investigators understand how the modules are assisting
deaf and hard-of-hearing students' learning. This project is improving training
for deaf and hard-of-hearing students and will ultimately broaden participation
of deaf and hard-of-hearing students in STEM fields including engineering,
mathematics and science. The results are being shared with faculty who serve
students who are deaf and hard-of-hearing at specific institutions, through NSF
Alliances for Students With Disabilities in STEM, and at conferences in
disabilities education and engineering education.
