9411866 Nair This project deals with the development of a high-speed integrated
control station for carrying out fundamental studies in modeling and intelligent
control of nonlinear dynamic systems using neural networks, fuzzy logic, and
neuro-fuzzy architectures. The control station is also equipped to interface
with real-world hardware systems for performing on-line control studies. The
equipment acquired under this grant facilitates real-time implementation and
analytical studies such as parameter convergence, tracking control, learning and
adaptation issues with unmodeled dynamics, high speed operation, disturbance
rejection control and stochastic control. ***
