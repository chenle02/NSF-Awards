This is a Cooperative Agreement between the National Science Foundation's Office
of Experimental Programs to Stimulate Competitive Research and Technomics
International, Inc. of Dublin, Ireland. The purpose of this agreement is to have
Dr. Thomas Higgins, Director of Technomics International, site visit fourteen
EPSCoR States before June 15, 1991 to evaluate opportunities for EPSCoR/EEC
scientific and engineering cooperation, commonalities of interests, methods of
"mapping" state/country scientific strengths/weaknesses, and methods of
evaluation. The agreement provides for a minimum of four international trips to
complete the site visits and present the "findings" at the EPSCoR annual
conference. Seven copies of the final report are required. Dr. Higgins' report
will provide specific actions to be undertaken to enhance EPSCoR/EEC
collaboration and cooperation. Based upon the proposal and excellent reviews,
this cooperative agreement for $50,000 is recommended.
