9631384 Schmid A GOALI award will support a cooperative study with Alcoa
Corporation. The PI will use Alcoa's atomic force microscope to perform
microindentation and microscratch testing of specimens while they are undergoing
plastic deformation. The results will be used to validate a model developed by
Alcoa scientists and this model will then be extended to treat friction and
deformation in rolling contact with high plastic strain rates, such as in cold
rolling of foil and sheet. The collaborating scientist from Alcoa will
subsequently spend a semester at the PI's institution where he will teach a
senior design course. ***
