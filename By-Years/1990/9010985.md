The existence of a universal neural network, AMNIAC, developed by the principal
investigators for theoretical reasons, raises the possibility of implementing a
general purpose neurocomputer, i.e., one which may be "programmed" to behave
like any other neural network. Such general purpose neurocomputers will run
different neural networks on the same hardware like our serial computers run
programs today. A general purpose neurocomputer should include capabilities
beyond those of a universal neural network. Most important among these are
efficient massive storage, rapid retrieval, learning, and sophisticated
input/output. The goal of this project is to simulate AMNIAC on a massively
parallel computer. This simulation will allow the design of adequate massive
storage, learning and input/output capabilities. It will also allow benchmarks
to provide reliable estimates of the feasibility and efficiency of an actual
general purpose neurocomputer.
