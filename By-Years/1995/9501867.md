The focus of this research is the development of methods for allylic oxidation
using chiral Cu(I) complexes and peresters to give chiral non-racemic
allylesters. The focus of the educational plan involves the development of
course content for both undergraduate and graduate students. With this CAREER
award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research and educational
plan of Dr. Merritt B. Andrus of the Department of Chemistry at Purdue
University. Professor Andrus will focus his research efforts on the development
of new methods for the catalytic asymmetric oxidation of olefins. The focus of
Professor Andrus' educational plan involves the development of course content
for both undergraduate and graduate students.
