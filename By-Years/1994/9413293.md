Abstract ATM-9413293 Sui, C.H. University of Maryland Title: Atmospheric
Convection, Surface fluxes and Ocean Mixing During TOGA COARE This is a three
year project to study multi-scale organization of atmospheric convection,
surface fluxes, and ocean mixed layer structure in the TOGA COARE domain during
IOP. The work has two major components. 1) Analysis and integration of TOGA
COARE observations, including ISS/PSS soundings, high solution GMS satellite
data, radar data, air sea fluxes and ocean mixed layer measurements, obtained
during COARE domain during IOP. 2) Utilization of TOGA COARE observations to
simulate convective radiative mixing processes within OSA based on a two
dimensional version of Goddard Cumulus Ensemble Model (GCEM) and an embedded
mixed layer-Ocean circulation model (MLOM). A better understanding of multi-
scale processes achieved by this research project is essential for improving the
physical processes in climate models. The expected achievement of the proposed
research will help to enhance our capability in simulation and prediction of
climate variability.
