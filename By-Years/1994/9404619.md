The goal of this research is the automated analysis of infinite state
concurrent systems for properties like local and global deadlocks, and
conformance against specifications in temporal logic. These analyses will
support the design of protocol validation systems and the semantic analysis
phase of compilers for distributed programming languages. In general, the
problems of interest are undecidable in the context of arbitrary infinite state
systems. Thus, this project investigates subclasses of infinite state systems
where the problems of interest are decidable, and examines the use of flow
analysis as a tool for approximative reasoning.
