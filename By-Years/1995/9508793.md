9508793 Eguchi This project will convene a US- Japan Workshop on Disaster
Prevention for lifeline systems. The objective is to provide a continued
opportunity for researchers, designers, and construction specialists to exchange
ideas on the current state-of-the- art in seismic risk assessment, design and
construction for lifeline. What future directions should be pursued to improve
current methods, and what mutual programs between the U.S. and Japan can be
initiated so that the most effective use of available information is maximized
will also be discussed. The possible areas of collaboration identified for
discussion include: - Planning for urban disaster prevention - Systems approach
to lifeline performance - Soil-Structure interaction - Performance of
underground pipelines and cables - Fire prevention/protection - Geographical
Information Systems (GIS) - Cost-effective ground improvement techniques -
Development and operation (including restarting) of safe shutdown systems. This
workshop is jointly supported by NSF, National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) in the U.S. and Public Works Research Institute (PWRI),
Ministry of Construction, in Japan. ***
