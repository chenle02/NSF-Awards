University&lt;br/&gt;Title: BRACE: Bridging Research and Curriculum
Experience&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hampton University has been awarded a
planning grant to work with Norfolk State University and Virginia State
University to examine why minority students at their three institutions do not
pursue graduate study in information technology (IT). Preliminary graduation and
alumni data of the computer science (CS) and computer information systems (CIS)
majors from the three participating institutions show that there is a
substantial gap in the number of students pursuing graduate study in these
disciplines. Planning activities will include the identification of
interventions addressing specific critical needs, and the creation of a
repository of best practices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of
this project lies in the development of a comprehensive plan for minority
recruitment and retention in IT by incorporating new and known best practices
into a program to prepare, mentor and track African-American IT students
throughout college, graduate school, and initial job placement. The broader
impacts of the project lie in its potential to generate information on how to
increase the number of African-Americans pursuing IT majors and IT
careers.&lt;br/&gt;
