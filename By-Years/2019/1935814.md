Investigating the flow of blood and blood-driven transport of cells and
particles in microchannels of different shapes and degrees of roughness is
critical for fabricating and characterizing a host of medical devices meant for
separating blood components. The objective of this proposal is to employ a
combined computational-experimental framework for studying the fluid dynamics of
blood and blood flow driven transport.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additive
manufacturing techniques will be employed to fabricate straight and spiral
microchannels with varying degree of roughness. The microchannel cross-section
and surface roughness will be quantified using microCT imaging. A computational
geometry representing the rough straight and spiral microchannels will be
constructed by importing the microCT imaging data. In this simulation geometry a
two-phase fluid flow model (plasma representing one phase and red blood cells
another) will be employed to quantify the blood transport as a function of
hematocrit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
