The physical factors which control combustion are many and generally poorly
understood. This is especially true in the context of flammability limits which
are critical in a variety of applications. The research will conduct a
systematic search for the precise mechanisms which produce these limits. This
will be done by varying the gravity environment, the geometry of the combustor
and the gas mixture composition. New insights in this problem will allow for
better fire resistant materials, safer operation procedures for combustors and a
more efficient use of fuels.
