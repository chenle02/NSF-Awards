In the recent years, there have been a lot of interactions between string
theory, differential and algebraic geometry. One main theme of these
interactions is the dualities among the different physics theories as well as
their counterpart in geometry. In the recent work of Minahan, Nemeschansky, Vafa
and Warner, they had predicted a certain family of beautiful power series
encoding the numbers of singular irreducible holomorphic curves on a rational
elliptic surface. It is rather mysterious why the generating functions of the
predicted answers constitute the q expansions of certain modular forms. The
research project is aiming at studying the relationship between their formulas
and the geometric universal formula regarding the reducible holomorphic curves
on the same rational elliptic surface. To fully understand their deep
relationship, one has to study the excess contributions of the multiple
coverings of certain holomorphic curves in the universal formula. The goal is to
understand the inner structure of these enumeration datum as well as the
geometric origin of the modularity behavior.

The super-string theory was originally developed to build up a theory of
everything, a fundamental theory which unifies the rules governing our natural
world. Surprisingly, extensive study leads to some rather un-expected
predictions in the ideal world of mathematics, particularly in geometry. The
last ten years have been a blooming period that these magic ideas and
predictions in modern physics change the way mathematicians think. A lot of new
structures have been discovered which we really do not know too much about.
Despite of the intensive activities in this research area, it is still far away
from having a complete picture toward the full understanding of the mechanism of
duality. The hypothetical string-string duality has led to numerous predictions
which the mathematicians were never aware of. The present research project
attempts to confirm some mathematical predictions string theory has made,
following the previous research program of the author. The confirmation of these
conjectures will give strong mathematical evidences to the consistency of the
original physics theory.
