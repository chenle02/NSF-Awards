Otomanguean language spoken by over 10,000 residents, primarily rural farmers,
of the State of Oaxaca, Mexico. The primary research objective of this project
is to complete the development of a cross indexed Chinantec Spanish English
lexical database and to produce from it (a) a published bilingual Chinantec
Spanish Spanish Chinantec dictionary, for use by both the Palantla Chinantec
speaking and academic communities, and (b) a trilingual, Chinantec Spanish
English electronic version specifically designed for the academic community. The
completed trilingual version of the lexicon will be made available to language
database distribution systems such as are being developed at various
Universities. The provisional markup conventions now being used by the PI will
be made to conform to standard guidelines for lexical markup currently being
designed by the Text Encoding Initiative when they are ready. From the point of
view of scholarship, this research should be done to provide a complete and well
rounded recorded record of an important Native American language. A considerable
quantity of documentation of the language and culture has been assembled, but
lexical information remains scanty. It is important that several of the extant
Chinantec languages receive such documentation while the languages are viable
and experienced scholars are available to assist in documentation . From a
humanitarian point of view, the scholarly community has an obligation to share
its resources in ways that benefit the human subjects they depend upon in the
pursuit of the academic objectives. The provision of a document as valuable as a
bilingual dictionary to a marginalized community such as the Palantla Chinantec,
is in its own right ample motivation to do this work.
