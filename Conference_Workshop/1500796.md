This award provides support for participants in the Sixth Symposium on Analysis
and Partial Differential Equations, to be held at the Purdue University during
June 1-4, 2015. The Symposium will bring together leading experts working in
analysis, partial differential equations, and their applications, at different
stages of their careers, to summarize the most recent progress in these topics,
provide an opportunity to exchange ideas towards the solutions of open problems,
and formulate and develop new directions and avenues of research. The Symposium
will combine two short courses at an introductory level with more advanced
lectures. This structure is designed to introduce prospective and young
researchers to a larger mathematical community, and to help them establish new
professional connections in their areas of interest. The mini-courses will
encourage and enable students to participate in the more specialized parts of
the Symposium and also other research conferences.

The Symposium will focus on recent developments in analysis and partial
differential equations that are at the forefront of current research. The
Symposium features two principal lecturers, each of whom will present four-hour
mini-courses aimed at graduate students and recent doctoral degree recipients.
Approximately ten invited speakers will deliver related one-hour lectures. In
addition, approximately ten graduate students and recent doctoral degree
recipients will present twenty-minute talks. The Symposium?s mini-courses are
"Free Boundaries and Minimal Surfaces," presented by David Jerison of MIT, and
"Extremum Problems for Elliptic Eigenvalues," by Fang-Hua Lin of the Courant
Institute. More information on the symposium will be provided at the web page
