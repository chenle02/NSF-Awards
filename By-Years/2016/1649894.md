Due to increasing cyber-attacks, software developers and analysts need better
tools. Among the most important tools are programs that analyse other programs
to evaluate security and privacy requirements, to detect vulnerabilities, and in
general to predict a program's potential behavior. The theory of computation
says these analysis problems are impossible to solve in their general form.
Effective analyses rely on approximations, that is, simplified models of program
behavior, the theory of which is known as abstract interpretation. This theory
is widely used as basis for the design of analysis algorithms. Most existing
analyses are for so-called trace properties, which pertain to individual program
executions. Security and privacy requirements like confidentiality are about the
flow of information in programs, which pertains to correlations between multiple
executions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses methods of mathematical
semantics and formal logic to develop theory and algorithms for information flow
analysis. The theory of abstract interpretation is being extended beyond trace
properties, to encompass so-called hyperproperties which involve correlations
among multiple behaviors of a program. On this basis, new algorithms are being
created and evaluated. The main impact of this project will be to enable
researchers and commercial tool developers to implement more sophisticated,
comprehensive, and effective analyses for information flow in software. This
will lead to improved software quality and protection against attacks, and
ultimately increased trustworthiness of cyberspace. The theory developed in this
project will contribute to growing science of security which will improve
cybersecurity education and workforce training.
