\Abstract Quigg/Kaliszewski

This is a proposal for the ninth West Coast Operator Algebra Seminar (WCOAS),to
be held at Arizona State University on October 20 -21,2001. The WCOAS is a
decade-long tradition among the operator algebraists in the western United
States. The Seminar provides an invaluable opportunity for these researchers to
stay abreast of their field, fosters and reinforces ties among the western
universities, and provides young researchers with a forum in which to present
their latest results and discuss them with senior mathematicians. The high
concentration of operator algebraists in the western United States and Canada
has been one of the main reasons for the success of the WCOAS.
