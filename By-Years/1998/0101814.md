This research is focused on the investigation of the spin polarization of
ferromagnetic metals and the switching of ferromagnetic components. These
phenomena, occurring on the nanometer scale, are of crucial importance to
magnetoelectronic devices. We propose to use the point-contact Andreev
reflection technique, with appropriate analyses, to measure the intrinsic spin
polarization of a variety of materials, especially CrO2 and the Heusler alloys,
which have been predicted to be 100% spin polarized. We also propose to address
key issues in multilayers with exchange bias, particularly the type of
antiferromagnetic spin structure present, antiferromagnetic domains, and the
switching of exchange-coupled systems using synthetic antiferromagnets. The
graduate students involved in the project receive training in cutting-edge
technology of careers in academe, industry and government.

Magnetoelectronic devices are new devices that manipulate both spin (magnetic
dipole moment) and charge of electrons as opposed to only charge of electrons in
traditional electronic devises. These new devices depend crucially on the
substantial spin polarization of certain ferromagnetic materials (a difference
in the number of resident spin-up and spin-down electrons) through which the
itinerant electrons flow, and the ability to switch the magnetization of the
ferromagnet channels. Example of such devices employing these components include
giant magnetoresistance (GMR) read-heads in virtually all computers manufactured
today, and magnetic random access memories (MRAM) that one day may be replace
the current dynamic random access memory (DRAM) used in current computers. This
work is directed at measuring the intrinsic spin polarization of metals (the
ferromagnetic channels) using the technique of Andreev reflection, which depends
on fundamental properties of superconducting junctions that are employed in the
experiments. The other part of this work is to understand how thin magnetic
layers, which exist in many magnetoelectronic devices, can be made to switch
easily by a small external field, or be designed to resist switching. Students
in this program will receive extensive training in physics, new materials, and
measuring techniques to enable them to pursue careers in academe, as well as in
industrial and government labs.
