This project significantly modernizes the chemical instrumentation that
students use in the instrumental analysis and physical chemistry laboratories at
Bemidji State University. This project introduces the measurement of
fluorescence into quantitative analysis tool and also to determine the
physiochemical properties of molecular excited states. ANother important aspect
of this project is the students use of hands-on experience of the students will
provide them with essential experience in careful sample preparation and valid
data analysis skills. The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal
amount of funds.
