The purpose of this continuing award is to further investigate the relationship
between research and development and economic growth. Earlier work on R&amp;D at
the level of the firm found a high private of rate of return to R&amp;D,
especially to its privately financed and basic research components. This earlier
work was undertaken by the principal investigator and others looking at data for
the U.S., France, and Japan. The research to be undertaken in this project will
extend the international comparative analysis to incorporate parallel data sets
on industrial R&amp;D for Israel and Norway. A comparison of the impact of
R&amp;D at the level of the firm and at the more aggregated industry level will
be undertaken in an effort to measure the discrepancy between the private and
social returns to R&amp;D. The main output of the project will be a volume
tentatively entitled " R&amp;D and Economic Growth". Besides summarizing the
previous work on this topic, it will review the methodology involved in
estimating rates of return from R&amp;D, survey the work of other researchers on
the same and related topics, integrate the results, and evaluate policy
conclusions that emerge from the analysis.
