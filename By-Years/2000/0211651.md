The focus of this research is to develop a methodology for conferring
regioselectivity in organic syntheses through specific binding of substrates to
biological macromolecules. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, two
projects with strong application potential will be undertaken. First, bovine
serum albumin (BSA) will be used to guide the regioselective reduction of
steroids. Second, a lectin (e.g., concanavalin A) will be used to guide the
regioselective modification of disaccharides such as lactose and melibiose.
These regioselectivities are based on the proteins' specific and unique binding
properties. This new method may be useful in the development of new modified
steroids and carbohydrates of commercial importance. Undergraduate students will
be involved at all stages of this research in a team environment, from
experimental design, synthesis, instrumental operation, to data collection and
analysis. This not only trains them technical skills in biochemistry and organic
chemistry, but also boosts their interest in pursuing research careers in these
fields.
