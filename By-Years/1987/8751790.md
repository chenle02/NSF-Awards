This program is designed to provide enhancement training for seventy-two
inservice high school biology teachers in recent discoveries in molecular
biology and biotechnology. This program will provide training at three sites in
northern California, San Francisco State University, University of California,
Santa Cruz and California State University, Sacramento. Teachers will be
involved in a two-week intensive workshop, using materials developed at Cold
Spring Harbor, plus a three day science and society symposium in which issues
arising from the new biotechnology will be discussed with a view toward
inclusion into a high school biology class. Less well prepared teachers will
spend four additional days in a preworkshop at San Francisco State to enable
them to keep pace with their colleagues who have a deeper background in biology.
Curriculm guides will be devloped to facilitate in the integration of this
material into the curriculum in participants, schools. A good follow-up schedule
will provide them with the resources to implement this program.
