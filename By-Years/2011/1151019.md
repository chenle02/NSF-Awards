This engineering education research initiation grant seeks to understand how
engineering student learning experiences in requisite mathematics courses impact
how students learn engineering design. The principle investigator will use a
verbal protocol study, which has been used successfully in understanding design
thinking in past studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and
importance of this project is in the way it can inform both undergraduate
engineering education as well as the national discussion on mathematics at the
K-12 level. The researcher has proposed a strong plan to widely disseminate the
results of the project that includes outreach to K-12 educators through
workshops. Since design is closely tied to innovation, the impact on preparation
of the technical workforce in the United States is potentially important. This
project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers
through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and
expertise. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by
supporting the development of innovative learning systems.
