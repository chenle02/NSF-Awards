The University of the District of Columbia requests NSF support over a five-year
period to implement comprehensive approaches to strengthen the institution's
undergraduate science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education
and research infrastructure. The University proposes to establish a Science,
Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Research and Training Center. The
Center will serve as a focal point for innovative ideas and activities in STEM
disciplines. This Center will enable the University to achieve the following
objectives: (1) increase student enrollment and graduation rates in STEM
disciplines; (2) incorporate research in gate-keeper and sophomore-level STEM
courses; and, (3) provide research experiences in STEM Center laboratories for
undergraduate students. Additional enrichment activities include: distinguished
lecturers, research focus groups, student-research seminar, workshops, and a
science poster session. Resulting from these initiatives, graduation rates,
graduate/professional school-admissions, and employment in the STEM disciplines
are expected to increase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this
project lies in the proposed STEM infrastructure enhancements and their
potential to result in significant and sustainable improvements in the overall
quality of STEM instruction at the institution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact
of the proposed efforts is to broaden the participation of under-represented
minorities in STEM disciplines and the national STEM workforce. &lt;br/&gt;
