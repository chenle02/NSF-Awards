This project investigates the role of information encoding techniques for
reducing energy consumed by various processor components including the fetch
mechanism, on-chip instruction and data caches, functional units, instruction
issue logic, and CPU I/O pins. To address energy consumption by all of the above
processor components, three distinct types of encodings will be investigated in
this project. Data encoding will be used to reduce the activity in data caches
where the data resides and external data bus I/O pins over which data is
transmitted. Instruction encodings in form of 32 bit ARM ISA and 16 bit Thumb
ISA available in the XScale processor will be used to generate compact code
which gives high performance. Finally, compiler or profiler generated hints will
be encoded into the generated code to throttle the energy consumption of a
processor.&lt;br/&gt;
