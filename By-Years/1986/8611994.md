An exploratory effort is underway to develop a quantitative framework for
planning and evaluating automation of manufacturing systems based on information
metrics instead of the traditional economic criteria. Such a framework would
support investigations of information, tolerances, and process performance;
study of relationships of production costs and yields to product and process
information; elucidation of principles relating information to automatability;
and study of the role of information in assembly of parts.
