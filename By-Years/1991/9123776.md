This project supports the ethnographic research of a graduate student from
Harvard University in a rural area of China. The student will interview
community members about their notions of history. The focus will not be on the
accuracy of popular memory, but rather on the social processes that select and
create memory out of the available material. Using participant observation and
in depth interviews the student (a Chinese native fluent in the local language)
will systematically collect images and knowledge of the distant and recent past,
analyzing how individual rationalizations of past behavior have a moral and
social basis. The local community is an apt place to do the research since it
was relocated in 1958, and thus has a specific event of collective suffering to
deal with. This research is important because local communities have long
memories which are often used to justify current action. Understanding of the
social processes which shape these memories can help us understand and deal with
current political and social behavior in similar villages.
