Losos 9318642 The lizard genus Anolis is among the largest vertebrate genera,
with more than 300 described species. Half of these occur in the Caribbean. Of
particular interest are the anole faunas on the islands of the Greater Antilles,
where each island has a set of ecologically and morphologically distinctive
species, called ecomorphs. Comparisons across islands indicate that the sets of
ecomorphs on each island are essentially identical, although they are not
closely related. This study will explore the biological basis for anole
diversification using two approaches. First, laboratory studies of DNA sequences
will be used to determine relationships among species. Second, the processes by
which species have adapted to different habitats will be studied using a
combination of laboratory and field studies. Field observations will determine
how species differ in habitat use. Functional studies will then investigate
whether morphological differences among species have functional consequences
that result in species being best adapted to the habitat they use in nature.
