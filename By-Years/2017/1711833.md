The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project includes
biomedical interventions which harness precise microwave heating patterns from
thin needle- and/or catheter-based applicators. Use examples may include image-
guided thermal ablation of localized tumors via percutaneous, endoluminal, and
endoscopic approaches; localized thermally-mediated drug delivery; and
electrosurgical devices for thermal destruction of benign targets. The microwave
applicators described in this proposal afford, for the first time, directional
control of energy deposition from within thin catheter/needle-based structures.
They will enable precise heating of targets in proximity to critical structures,
thereby considerably expanding the range of patients that can be treated with
low-cost thermal ablation procedures. Furthermore, the proposed microwave
applicators may have application to microwave-assisted chemical reactions for
materials processing.

This I-Corps project will be focused on customer discovery to identify and
understand customer needs in the field of localized microwave heating for
biomedical and other applications. The microwave applicators with directional
control of energy deposition have been extensively evaluated with biophysical
simulations and benchtop experiments in excised tissue, as well as with
preliminary in vivo animal experiments. Proof-of-concept devices have also been
integrated with magnetic resonance imaging to demonstrate feasibility for image-
guided procedures. This I-Corps project will train the team on identifying
potential customers, understanding their needs, and developing technologies to
address these needs. This experience will guide the team?s ongoing and future
technology developments efforts so they are grounded in practical needs.
