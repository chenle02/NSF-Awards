Hewitt, Jacqueline AST 96-17028 Dr. Hewitt will observe and interpret
gravitational lenses. The first part of the planned research is a monitoring
program to measure the difference in propagation time associated with multiple
images of a back ground source. The second part is to distinguish variability of
the background source from that due to propagation effects. The third part is to
measure the imaging properties of the gravitational lenses to model the mass
distributions in the lenses. The fourth and final part is to study strong
lensing of extended radio lobes to measure the mass distribution in galaxies.
