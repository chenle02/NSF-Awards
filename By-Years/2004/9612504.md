ABSTRACT EEC-9612504 El-Aasser This award provides funding to cover a second
five years of NSF support for the Industry/University Cooperative Research
Center for Polymer Interfaces at Lehigh University. The Center's mission is
directed to the development of molecular-level understanding of the structural,
dynamic, kinetic and energetic behavior of the interphase region between
polymers and substrates. The research program is organized in three interactive
themes: 1) the adsorption/characterization; 2) the wetting/adhesion; and 3)
mechanical behavior. Research results in these themes will be applicable to
advanced engineering plastics, coatings, and composites. Currently ten
industrial firms provide the bulk of funds assisting in research planning,
selection, and review of projects.
