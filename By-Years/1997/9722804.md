PI: Erskine, Mary S. Proposal Number: IBN-9722804 Advances in molecular biology
have led to the understanding that certain genes, called "immediate early genes"
become expressed when cells become active. Techniques have been developed to
mark the cells expressing these genes, including the cells of the central
nervous system. This symposium presents the work of scientists in several areas
of behavior and neuroscience as examples of the use of this technique to mark
systems in the brain that are responsive to different types of sensory signals
or are involved in controlling a variety of behaviors. By holding the symposium
in conjunction with a national scientific meeting, the organizers make
information about this technique and its use in behavioral research available to
researchers and their students in a wide range fields.
