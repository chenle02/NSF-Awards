The crust-mantle boundary, or the Moho, is an ubiquitous structural
discontinuity of the Earth. Lateral variations in Moho geometry, especially Moho
offsets, are important to understand the origin and evolution of the crust, and
have been the target of many regional and global studies. However, previous
methods offer only either spot illumination of the crust or a smoothed Moho
topography. Here we propose a scattering-based method to systematically map Moho
offsets. Taking advantage of the dense data coverage from the USArray, this work
will provide a complete map of Moho offsets over the contiguous United States.
The results will shed light on the tectonic evolution of the North American
Continent and provide information on the material properties of the lower crust.
This project will also support the training of a postdoctoral
scholar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed new method relies on surface waves
scattered from incident teleseismic body waves. When teleseismic body waves hit
a Moho offset, the latter serves as a strong secondary source. As a result, the
surface waves are radiated horizontally away from the Moho offset. By back
propagating the scattered surface waves with a proper velocity model, the Moho
offset can be detected and located. The result of this work can potentially
resolve the debate of whether Moho offsets are widespread or not. Regional
differences (or not) in the distribution of Moho offsets will provide valuable
information on the thick-skinned vs. thin-skinned deformation mechanisms and the
effects of lower crust ductile flow in smoothing out Moho offsets. The new
method will be applied to USArray data to map Moho topography beneath the United
States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
