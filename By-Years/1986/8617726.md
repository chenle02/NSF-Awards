Abstract Narrative The Sino-Tibetan language family is one of the most important
on earth, by various measures: number of speakers, depth of historical
documentation, influence on other languages. There have been Western scholars
interested in Chinese and the other members of the family for about a century
now, and they have gathered a great deal of information about the various
languages in the family, adding that to the store of information accumulated by
generations of Chinese scholars. This body of scholarship is however widely
scattered, and of very uneven quality, which has been a major hindrance to
further progress in reconstructing the history of the language family. The
project proposed here is an extremely ambitious one: to bring together a major
portion of the entire body of scholarly documentation of the Sino-Tibetan
languages, and synthesize from it a coherent and accurate etymological
dictionary and thesaurus of the entire family. A successful completion of this
project will bring Sino-Tibetan linguistic study much closer to the current
level of accomplishment enjoyed by Indo-European linguistic research, and in so
doing will constitute a major advance in linguistics generally. The Principal
Investigator proposing this project is arguably the only scholar in the world in
a position to carry it out successfully, because of his vast erudition in the
existing body of Sino-Tibetan scholarship and his brilliant abilities at
historical analysis and argumentation. He is now at the point in his career at
which he feels prepared to undertake the mammoth task, and it is the good
fortune of the field that he is willing and able to make this contribution.
