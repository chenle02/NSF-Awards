This grant provides partial funding for the AWM Research Symposium 2015,
organized by the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM), to be held April
11-12, 2015, at the University of Maryland in College Park, MD. The Symposium is
aimed at helping to increase participation of women in the mathematical sciences
in academia, government, and industry. It is part of a series of interconnected
conferences and workshops designed to create ongoing networks, encourage
research collaborations, and build a stronger sense of community among women in
the mathematical sciences. The conference is expected to draw about 200
participants from all over the country, including many women in the early stages
of their career. While the speakers and funded participants will all be women,
the conference will be open to the whole mathematical community, both men and
women. Located in the greater Washington area, the Symposium will also provide a
unique opportunity for local businesses and government agencies to reach out to
a talented pool of graduate students and recent PhD recipients.

The 2015 Symposium will feature four plenary lectures by distinguished women
mathematicians, thirteen special sessions on a broad spectrum of mathematical
topics, poster sessions for graduate students and recent PhDs, and a networking
event. The plenary speakers are leaders in the fields of symplectic geometry,
harmonic analysis, graph theory, and wavelets. Accompanying the plenary talks
are special sessions in related areas. Nine other special sessions will cover a
wide range of topics including algebraic geometry, number theory, topology and
geometry, probability theory, and mathematics education. One session will
feature work by under-represented minorities from the EDGE program. Events of
this kind are essential for building community among women in the field,
decreasing the sense of isolation, and establishing new research and mentoring
relations. In addition, connections made at these events lead to future speaking
invitations, increased participation at other research conferences, and hence
better integration into the broader mathematics community. For more information
