9709199 Kolen The objective of this project is to develop a system based on
magnetic sensors for real-time, high-resolution kinematics imaging of human
motion. The system would utilize the earth's magnetic field as a common frame of
reference. It is proposed that during the first two years of this research a
16-sensor system utilizing surface mount technology would be assembled and
tested. In addition to hardware, software would concurrently be developed to
support real-time data acquisition and sensor array linearization, compensation
and error correction. The third year of the research would be directed towards
the construction of at least three complete systems incorporating multichip
modules for additional miniaturization. ***
