The Orton Geological Museum, located on the campus of The Ohio State
University, is nationally recognized and is listed as a major paleontology
museum (one of the top 25) in North America. A significant component of the
Orton holdings is a major collection of fossil plants from Antarctica. This
important collection is unique and requires organization and proper storage
facilities to insure that it will be available to researchers in subsequent
years. This project will provide funds for the purchase of geology cases for the
proper storage of the fossils and one year of curatorial support so that the
specimens can be organized and numbered.
