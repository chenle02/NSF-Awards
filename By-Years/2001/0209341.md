Allen University HBCU-UP supported planning efforts will focus on three aspects
of the institution's science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)
instructional and research infrastructure: (1) STEM teaching and learning; (2)
undergraduate and faculty research opportunities; and, (3) partnerships with
industry and other institutions of higher learning.

The assessment plan includes evaluations of student performance and progress
toward STEM degree completion. Impediments to student successful completion of
core STEM courses and participation in research will be identified and remedied.
Particular emphasis will be placed on (1) enhancing teaching strategies; (2)
increasing undergraduate research opportunities; (3) faculty development; (4)
curriculum reform; (5) infusion of technology to enhance instruction; and, (6)
the adaptation of best practices to broaden the participation of
underrepresented minorities in STEM fields and the STEM workforce.
