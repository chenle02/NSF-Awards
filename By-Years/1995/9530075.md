AST 9530075 Abstract Thinned CCDs for the UH 8192 x 8192 mosaic camera The
University of Hawaii has built a CCD mosaic camera with 8192x8192 pixels. The
mosaic is a close-packed 4x2 array of 3-edge-buttable 2048x2048 CCDs with 15
micrometer pixels. The camera was designed primarily for use at the prime focus
of the Canada France Hawaii Telescope, but can be used with other telescopes as
well. The CCDs which were available for use in this instrument are prototypes of
rather low quality with several serious limitations. This project will replace
the original CCDs in the existing camera with high-quality, high sensitivity
(peak QE &gt; 80%), thinned CCDs. Improved CCDs will increase the sensitivity of
the instrument by at least a factor of two in the red and by a factor of many in
the blue. Furthermore, the new CCDs will be of superior cosmetic quality, and
the reduced dark current and resulting low noise will make low background
imaging projects possible.
