The molecular machinery underlying development is remarkably similar among
animals, and this provides a powerful tool for suqqesting body part homologies
between distantly related animals. Dr. Holland comparing vertebrates with the
cephalochordate, amphioxus-which, in many ways, approximates the invertebrate
body plan from which the vertebrates evolved. Developmental genes of amphioxus
are isolated and identified on the basis of sequence similarities with
homologous genes of other animals, and the expression domains of these genes are
used as phenotypic characters to indicate body part homologies. Hox genes and
Engrailed gene are establishing the limits of the amphioxus hindbrain, and
several genes (e.g. Wnts, Distal-less, PAX7, and NK2) are being used to map the
regions of the amphioxus forebrain and midbrain. A similar rationale underlies
comparison between vertebrate eyes and amphioxus photoreceptors (Pax6), between
vertebrate nephrons and amphioxus nephridia (Pax2), and between the vertebrate
thyroid and the amphioxus endostyle (Pax8, TTFL). In addition, developmental
gene expression patterns after teratogen administration or microsurgery are
identifying epigenetic networks common to vertebrates and amphioxus.
