Quantum information science is based on the science of 'entanglement', where the
quantum states of two or more objects have to be described with reference to
each other, even though the individual objects are spatially separated. Despite
being identified nearly a century ago, much is not understood regarding the
relationship between the resources in a quantum system and the level of
entanglement that can be achieved. This project seeks to answer some fundamental
questions in the resource theory of entanglement for quantum channels. How much
entanglement is required to prepare a quantum state or to simulate a quantum
channel? How much entanglement can one distill from these same resources? How
many "magic quantum states" are required to perform a given quantum computation?
How much "non-Gaussianity" is required to achieve a quantum advantage in
communication over quantum channels? How distinguishable are two quantum states
or channels? The questions that this project addresses are of particular
interest for the many applications of quantum information processing, such as
solving computationally hard problems and enabling secure and covert
communications. The project will also train an inter-disciplinary cadre of
students in this domain through extensive education and curriculum development
activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will address foundational
questions concerning resource theories of quantum channels. The traditional
perspective in quantum resource theories concerns how to use free operations to
convert one resourceful quantum state to another one. For example, a fundamental
and well known question in entanglement theory is to determine the distillable
entanglement of a bipartite state, which is equal to the maximum rate at which
fresh Bell states can be distilled from many copies of a given bipartite state
by employing local operations and classical communication for free. It is the
aim of this research project to take this kind of question to the next level,
with the main question being: What is the best way of using free channels to
convert one resourceful quantum channel to another? The project seeks to
identify measures of entanglement for quantum channels that allow for addressing
the above questions while being efficiently computable, and also to understand
dynamical processes in other resource theories, such as magic states and
channels, distinguishability, purity, thermodynamics, non-Gaussianity,
etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
