The Minnesota Zoological Garden will initiate a twelve-week, commuter Young
Scholars project in behavioral research and conservation biology for 10 students
entering grades 11,12. Students will attend classes focusing on animal behavior,
conservation biology, zoo biology and research methodology. Each student
develops and executes an independent research study with guidance from program
senior staff and individual zoo staff mentors. Students present their study
findings through oral slide presentations to family, teachers, and zoo staff and
also prepare research papers published in the Zooschool Journal.
