9550372 Gutstein The University of California, Davis will use this planning
grant "Planning an Informal Science Education Program at the University of
California, Davis" to redefine its relationship with and responsibilities toward
the public. Outreach for them is being viewed as a interaction between public
needs and interests and the university. Leadership will be provided by a
committee of university faculty and an advisory board consisting of external
university museum and science education professsionals will meet with project
directors twice during the year. Together they will examine the regional science
education needs, the existing public education activities at UCD, and
investigate the potential for establishing a comprehensive informal science
program. Among other things this will include the coalescing of various
scientific collections (geology, entomology, anthropology, the botanical and
arboretum collections) and their respective independent educational programming
into a regional science education network. Advisors will include members of the
UCD faculty and administrators as well as individuals representing external
university museum and science education experts.
