Professor Strauss is supported by a grant from the Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to study the structure and dynamics of molecules in condensed
phases in the presence of large amplitude motions. The principal experimental
techniques employed in this research are high resolution Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy and infrared laser diode spectroscopy. Vibrational
spectroscopy, vibrational excitation methods, and theoretical analysis will be
used to explore the structure and dynamics of condensed phases. Emphasis will be
on chemical systems that illustrate important general methods or elucidate
important intermolecular interactions. The effect of very fast reactions on
observed vibrational frequencies will be studied with the intention of
developing techniques for determining reaction rates directly from spectra.
Infrared excitation or "holeburning" in crystals will also be used to provide
information on various dynamical processes such as molecular rotation and return
to equilibrium by quantum mechanical tunneling. Investigation of holeburning at
high resolution will be used to determine homogeneous/inhomogeneous linewidths
and the relationship between spectra, structure and strain.
