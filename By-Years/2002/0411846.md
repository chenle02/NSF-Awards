his project continues work to build a multi-user virtual
environment,&lt;br/&gt;known as Quest Atlantis, that is academically valuable,
game like, and&lt;br/&gt;that engages elementary students in socially-responsive
practices. This&lt;br/&gt;grant will undertake a series of naturalistic studies
and experimental&lt;br/&gt;manipulations that will advance theoretical and
practical knowledge with&lt;br/&gt;respect to the design of multi-user virtual
environments for supporting&lt;br/&gt;science learning. Specifically, the
project will test three hypotheses:&lt;br/&gt;First, that students learning
academic content within a&lt;br/&gt;socially-responsive gaming context will
learn more and be more engaged&lt;br/&gt;than those learning through teaching
methods that do not explicitly have&lt;br/&gt;a gaming component. This portion
of the study will also examine if the&lt;br/&gt;gaming context works will work
equally well if the academic tasks vary&lt;br/&gt;in difficulty or if there is
some necessary balance between the amount&lt;br/&gt;of learning and playing.
Second, participants, especially girls, will&lt;br/&gt;achieve and learn more
and be more engaged when their participation is&lt;br/&gt;situated in a gender-
balanced, socially-responsive gaming context as&lt;br/&gt;opposed to a male-
dominated one, or simply a gaming context without an&lt;br/&gt;explicit social
agenda. Third, students participating in a gaming&lt;br/&gt;environment will
achieve, learn and be more engaged if the environment&lt;br/&gt;leverages a
community-based element than if it just supports single-
user&lt;br/&gt;participation. The project will also produce qualitative accounts
of&lt;br/&gt;participation in all conditions, but especially the socially-
responsive&lt;br/&gt;gaming condition so as to understand how children from
different&lt;br/&gt;socio-economic groups and of different genders come to
participate in&lt;br/&gt;and make sense of the collective experience of the
meta-game context. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
