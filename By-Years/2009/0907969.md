This research program will examine the reionization of the Universe in both
hydrogen and helium, combining analytical and numerical approaches to elucidate
the physics underlying reionization and how it is influenced by the nature and
abundance of the ionizing sources and the properties of the intergalactic medium
(IGM). The analysis will be further employed to consider the impact of
reionization on observable signatures of this process, including fluctuations in
21 cm radiation from hydrogen at high redshifts, surveys of Ly-alpha emitting
galaxies, spectra of gamma-ray bursts, and the statistical properties of the
Lyman-alpha forest. The results of this investigation will be used to guide
optimal observing strategies for ongoing and future experiments to investigate
emission from high-redshift galaxies, quasars, and diffuse gas in the
IGM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this work include training of
underrepresented students, and public outreach through visualizations and
simulations accessible through the web. &lt;br/&gt;
