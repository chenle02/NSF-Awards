For many decades, management theorists have stressed the value of planned
action. In contrast, emergent theories of organizational action have stressed
the presence and even potential benefit of unplanned action in organizations.
This research defines organizational improvisation as unplanned but deliberate
organizational action, and explores its presence and impact on organizational
performance during new product development and introduction activities. Grounded
in a framework of organizational learning, the study seeks to go beyond popular
admonitions urging managerial flexibility. Instead, it seeks to provide
systematic insight into the weaknesses and potential of improvisation as a tool
for escalating the speed of new product actions, increasing the short-term
financial effectiveness of these actions, and permitting long-term
organizational learning. The research develops theory regarding the role of
various antecedent factors on the degree of organizational improvisation and the
role of a number of moderating factors on whether organizational improvisation
translates into the above noted performance outcomes. Analysis will involve
careful collection of observational, self-report, and interview data on twenty
new product development action phases (e.g., actions to fund the new product
idea or actions to build and design a commercially relevant prototype) within
product-development projects in four firms. The study also provides an empirical
analysis of specific learning subprocesses. This type of work is fundamental to
generate a solid empirical literature on organizational learning.
