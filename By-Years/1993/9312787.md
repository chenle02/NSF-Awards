ABSTRACT P.I.Glenn Goodfriend SBR-9312787 A number of new dating techniques for
use in archaeology are currently in the development stages. Of these, aspartic
acid racemization on shell of various sorts (particluarly ostrich egg shell) is
the most exciting and reliable, covering new ranges of dates that other
techniques are inadequate for. The current small project will be the first
application of this technique to especially recent excavations from Lake
Titicaca around the time of colonization. It will allow for a more detailed
understanding of the dynamics surrounding a number of events, including
environmental alteration/degradation, that happened around that time. It will
also allow refinement of the dating techniques themselves. ***
