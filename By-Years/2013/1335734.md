1335734&lt;br/&gt;PI: Wu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field of colloidal suspensions
consisting of sub-micron sized anisotropic particles, i.e., particles whose
surface is asymmetrically functionalized or whose shape is non-spherical, has
seen a rapid growth in recent years. These colloids are interesting both from
fundamental point of view and from their potential in new applications to health
care, energy, or consumer products industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
will provide partial support towards travel to attend American Chemical Society
(ACS) Symposium ?Anisotropic Colloids.? to be held at Indianapolis on September
8-12, 2013. The symposium is expected to attract scientists from diverse
disciplines (Chemistry, Materials Science, Engineers, and Physicists) and will
cover wide range of topics, from the synthesis to new physical phenomena, to new
applications of anisotropic colloids.
