This grant if for the purchase of an ultra-violet spectroscopy system for
research on the chemistry and thermodynamics of epitaxial growth by chemical
beam epitaxy in-situ and in real time. UV spectroscopy is a powerful scientific
tool that is best suited for the study of growth processes by chemical beam
epitaxy. The equipment described in this proposal will create the capability for
UV absorption spectroscopy and laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy. These
two techniques will be used for the investigation of epitaxial growth of III-V
semiconductor and alloy microstructures. In contrast to molecular beam epitaxy
in which elemental sources are used, gas sources (metal- organics and hydrides)
are used in chemical beam epitaxy. Consequently the chemical dynamics of
epitaxial growth are more complex, but easier to measure than is the case in
MBE. With the equipment requested in this proposal, it will be possible to
obtain quantitative chemical information by probing the region just above the
substrate. This equipment can provide information about the concentrations and
electronic states of molecular and atomic species. The type of equipment needed
for the UV spectroscopy described in this proposal is not available as a single
unit from any supplier, and in order to perform such studies, it is necessary to
assemble appropriate individual components.
