This project is directed towards the study of infinite dimensional balanced
realizations, both from the point of view of improving the basic understanding
of these realizations and of providing further tools for model reductions of
infinite dimensional systems. The project will focus on the specific questions
of asymptotic and exponential stability of the balanced systems and the
boundedness properties of the system operators. A further important point which
will be addressed is the issue of whether general Trotter-Kato type convergence
results can be proved for the balanced approximation scheme. Many engineering
systems, such as highly flexible mechanical systems, inherently contain
infinitely many degrees of freedom and therefore any accurate mathematical
description of such a system must necessarily be infinite dimensional. There are
several ways to achieve such a mathematical description. One recent approach is
based on models of finite complexity. This method of "balanced realizations" has
proved very successful in practice.
