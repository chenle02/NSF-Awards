Scorpion venom is a complex mixture that contains a large number of small basic
proteins which are responsible for the neurotoxic effects of the venom. A broad
range of receptive excitable cells, e.g., synoptic neurons and muscle. are
depolarized and in the case of nerve ending, depolarized with release of
neurotansmitters. The venom from Centruoides sculpturatus Ewing (CsE) like that
from other species of scorpions is unique in that the various toxins present in
the venom can differ markedly in their toxicity to a given species, despite
their closely related chemical properties and similar modes of action. These
toxins offer an excellent opportunity to study structure-function relationships
within a class of closely related proteins that display widely different toxin
effects. Also, because of their varying activities on sodium current in
excitable membranes, the can serve as excellent probes for studying the sodium
channel. Dr. Krishna will use NMR spectroscopy to determine the solution
structure of varies homologous toxins from CsE and compare them to the
crystallographic conformation available. A diverse number of mutually
complementay NMR techniques as well as distance geometry computational methods
will be employed in the study. This project will ultimately provide the
background information necessary to use the neurotoxins as structural probes of
sodium channels.
