Queuing network models have become increasingly important tools to architects
and engineers in the planning and design of facilities, since the optimal
configuration of activities, routing of customers, and composition of resources
(space, staff, and equipment) can be analyzed with queuing network models. In
this study, the scope and limitations of queuing network decomposition
techniques for modeling the optimal topology, routing, and resource allocation
problems within facilities will be explored. Focus will be on finite open and
closed queuing network models of this problem using the Generalized Expansion
methodology. The robustness of the analytical approach will be compared with
simulation experiments of example facility networks.
