Professor Greenberg will work on several problems connected with a generalized
Iwasawa theory. He intends to study the Selmer group in certain infinite
extensions of the rational numbers and in certain families of p-adic
representations. This project falls into the general area of arithmetic geometry
- a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: number theory
and geometry. This combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful - having
recently solved problems that withstood generations. Among its many consequences
are new error correcting codes. Such codes are essential for both modern
computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
