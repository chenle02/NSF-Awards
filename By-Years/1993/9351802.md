The aim of this project is to advance student training and experience in
investigative molecular biology. Specifically, the requested equipment,
consisting of a high speed centrifuge and rotors, thermocycler, electroporator,
nucleotide sequencing and agarose gel electrophoresis equipment and related
accessories, will support a new research-intensive advanced investigative
molecular biology course in which students will characterize algal mitochondrial
and chloroplast genome architecture and gene structure. The proposed equipment
will be used to increase the sophistication of strategies used for nucleic acid
analysis including the isolation of purified organellar DNA, DNA library
construction, genome mapping, and nucleotide sequence analysis of selected
genes. Fundamental principles of DNA structure and function and basic techniques
are presented in existing intorductory courses. Investigative Molecular Biology
will offer opportunities that (1) provide for advanced study of DNA organization
and function; (2) serve as an avenue for student participation in investigative
research; and (3) for biology majors, function to train and focus those students
who anticipate entering into molecular biology related honors research projects.
