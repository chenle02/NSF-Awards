This is a renewal support of NCCE, the National Center for Computational
Electronics, previously supported under NSF grant ECS-8809023. There are three
major components: research, education and computational services. Research focus
is electron transport in solid-state semiconductors. The specific used in Monte
Carlo Simulation for the solution to the Boltzman Transport Equation; up-grade
standard drift- diffusion simulators by including full band-structure in a Monte
Carlo add-on package; higher-order moment closure (hydrodynamic) models for
parallel implementation; include lattice temperature effects for high
current/voltage regimes; coupling of device performance to circuit and thermal
boundary conditions (mixed-mode simulation). Educational activities includes the
support of post-doctoral visitors at the Beckman Institute and NCSA, the
National Center for Supercomputing Applications, regular workshop and tutorials
for graduate students, and developing stronger ties to the SRC Technology
Transfer Courses (TTC's). Creation of a board environment for the students in
device modeling which will include not only electrical engineering but also
applied mathematicians, aeronautical and mechanical engineers, computer
scientists all of whom have similar computational difficulties. NCCE will
continue to be the node for computational resources for device modeling
community. It will coordinate with NCSA for block time on a mix of platforms,
vector, massively parallel, high-eng graphics, etc. Furthermore, NCCE will
continue to provide software consultation to the community on improving code
efficiency on the supercomputers. Finally, NCCE will continue the development
and expansion of cross-disciplinary groups and collaboration between academic
institutions and industrial laboratories.
