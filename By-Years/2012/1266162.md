The University of North Carolina at Charlotte's site for the Safety, Security
and Rescue Research I/UCRC intends to contribute to the mission of the existing
center to conduct integrative, multi-disciplinary research in autonomous systems
to improve homeland security and emergency response. The site plans to extend
the scope of SSR to healthcare, energy, material handling, and manufacturing, by
focusing on human safety, injury prevention, and patient care. The new SSR
I/UCRC site intends to address areas including autonomous and guided robot
actions for both sensing and manipulation under high-level human control, multi-
agent, integration of real-time multi-modal sensory data, secure real-time
computational analysis of safety critical SSR
scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SSR Technologies are having world-
wide impact in both the private and government sector. Moreover, application of
these technologies is having impact that touches individual citizens. The
University of North Carolina at Charlotte's Site of the SSR I/UCRC intends to
extend the research outcomes it brings to the center to a new set of industries
both regionally and nationally not currently represented in the center drawing
upon complementary research domains. The site intends to leverage its I/UCRC
site and strong NSF-funded programs on broadening participation in computing
(e.g., the STARS Alliance) and REU Site by providing opportunities to engage
undergraduate students from underrepresented groups and encourage them to enter
graduate study.
