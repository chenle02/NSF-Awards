This proposal represents an investigation into the feasibility of developing a
smart structural composite which has a self-healing capability whenever and
wherever cracks are generated as a result of seismic overloads, cyclic loading
or other mechanical or environmental loads. A major focus of this research will
be on the timed release of chemicals from hollow fibers which results in (1)
crack sealing, and (2) rebonding of debonded/ruptured fibers from the matrix.
Candidate chemicals include adhesive, crystallizing rehydrater Xypex, and
crosslinking or air curing polymer chemicals. Issues in specific fiber types
acting as passive sensors and actuators, in a control system involving
fiber/matrix interfacial bond, pseudo strain-hardening and crack width control,
in repair mechanisms, real time process visualization, post-event properties,
and structural control are addressed in this research.
