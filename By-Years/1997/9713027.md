This experimental and theoretical study will focus on plasma waves arising in
sporadic ionization layers in the ionospheric E region at midlatitudes. The
researchers will investigate: (1) the significance of the quasi-periodic
structures observed by ground-based radar, (2) how well the standard model of E
region plasma waves developed to explain electrojet radar echoes account for
midlatitude HF observations, (3) the source of streaming instabilities at
midlatitudes, and any revelation about fundamental E region plasma physics, and
(4) the storm-time behavior of plasma waves in the midlatitude E region.
