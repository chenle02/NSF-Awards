The focus of this research proposal is to develop tool support to provide the
ability for scientific programmers to inquire about scalability problems and
correlate this information back to source code. Furthermore, we believe that
tools should be able to suggest and evaluate optimizing transformations to
alleviate these problems. This would constitute a significant improvement over
current performance analysis practice.&lt;br/&gt;The key intellectual merit is
in providing an automatic framework for detecting scalability problems
and&lt;br/&gt;correlating them back to source code. We will experiment with our
framework on the ASCI codes, which&lt;br/&gt;is intended to stress high-
performance clusters.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this work is in three main
areas. First, both PIs are working to create an interdisciplinary educational
and research program. Second, students will be educated in high-
performance&lt;br/&gt;computing. Finally, the proposed work allows for
technology transfer to a wide arena of emerging fields,&lt;br/&gt;such as
cluster computing as well as the established areas of SMPs and massively
parallel computing.&lt;br/&gt;The developed framework and tools will be made
generally available to the research community and high-performance computing
labs.
