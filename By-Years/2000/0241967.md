The series of annual summer activities of the Center for Game Theory in
Economics is designed to stimulate and disseminate new advances in research on
game theory and its applications, and to make conceptual and methodological
developments in game theory available to an expanding group of scientists in
economics and other disciplines. Each summer there are research-oriented
conferences and workshops and, upon occasion, an intensive course of instruction
on a topic of major significance, complemented by a further period of informal
research activities. This series brings together a large international group of
researchers--a mix of established scholars, junior faculty, and graduate
students--whose interests represent a diverse array of theoretical and applied
aspects of game theory. The programs for 2003-2005 are a continuation of the
series of summer activities held at Stony Brook from 1990 to 2002, each of which
attracted about 120 participants on average. Formal activities normally include
a five-day conference with plenary and parallel sessions, and invited and
contributed papers; two workshops on selected themes; and from time to time one
to two weeks of intensive instruction on selected topics. The value of this
format and approach is evidenced by the success of the previous programs.
