This project uses in-house interactive instructional teaching systems (ITT/V),
augmented by an experimental multimedia remote teaching system (MRTS) and
Centels videopath network. The system also uses in-house computer-assisted
teaching workstations to support the program. Some of the systems, as noted, are
already in use in the support of the off-campus teaching endeavors. For year 1,
the program is applied to 4 courses; for year 2, to 12 courses. This project
serves as a pilot project to test the university/industry team teaching concept
in a major metropolitan area, using advanced video techniques and multi-media
workstations. The areas of instruction in the first year deal with computer
science and engineering and microelectronics in engineering practice.
