This project will test a new idea related to the prediction of seasonal to
interannual climate using coupled atmosphere-ocean General Circulation Models
(AGCM and OGCM, respectively). The methodology builds on the notion that
ensembles of AGCM realizations (probabilistic predictions) can be used to reduce
the model "noise" or non-meaningful signal in the predicted fields, and isolate
and improve the climate signal at the air-sea interface. The multiple
realizations, or solutions, of a particular AGCM, or multiple realizations from
different AGCMs, will be coupled to a single OGCM and the ensemble mean
atmospheric fluxes will be used to drive the ocean model and make the coupled
climate probabilistic predictions. If successful, this project could
significantly improve climate predictions at extended range to interannual time
scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
