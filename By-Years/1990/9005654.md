This research addresses the following critical issues related to high-
productivity tooling for automated machine tools: (1) development of a data base
on existing NC tooling systems and performance of an analytical survey; (2)
comparative analysis of commercially-available tooling systems; (3) conceptual
development of advanced tooling systems with enhanced structural and joint
stiffness and damping; (4) conceptual development of improved tooling (and other
machine tool-related) structures using anisotropic elastomeric composites; and
(5) conceptual development of automatic continuous balancing of high-rpm
tooling. The research effort is expected to result both in solution of important
specific problems and contribute to the establishment of a tooling/machine tool
research center to facilitate technology transfer to industry.
