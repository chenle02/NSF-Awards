This mathematics and science education conference is designed to bring together
representatives from a large number of professional societies and other
organizations within the applied sciences and engineering, in order to share
knowledge, report on activities, and reflect on recent experiences. Many of
these professional organizations have already committed substantial resources to
their K-12 projects and even produced materials, held curriculum workshops, and
begun school and school system partnerships. This conference will begin the
coordination among such efforts and should stimulate others to increase their
involvement with precollege science education. The first conference will be held
in February of 1992 and will be followed by a smaller conference in April of
that same year. The April follow-up conference will involve representatives from
twelve applied science and engineering societies to discuss plans for on going
cooperation in the effort to improve mathematics, science, and engineering
education at the precollege level.
