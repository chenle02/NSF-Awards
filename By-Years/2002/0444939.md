RUI: Inducible Defenses and Community Ecology: An Integrated
Approach&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Andrew M. Turner&lt;br/&gt;Clarion University
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Predators play a key role in maintaining the structure and
function of ecological communities, but the mechanism by which they do so is not
clear. Predation has traditionally been studied in terms of how predators alter
prey population size, but predators also induce shifts in prey behavior,
morphology, and life-history. The non-lethal effects of predators may cascade
through ecological systems, altering populations and communities. If true, a
full understanding of community structure would depend on a detailed knowledge
of not just predator diets, but also how predators alter prey traits. The work
outlined in this proposal is aimed at integrating an understanding of prey trait
shifts into the larger realm of community ecology. The studies employ freshwater
snails and their predators in laboratory experiments, field experiments, and
field surveys in order to determine if predator-induced trait shifts alter
community organization. Freshwater snails are an ideal model system with which
to address the role of trait shifts in ecological systems because their traits
are quite plastic, their short generation times facilitate study of the
population level effects of trait shifts, they are readily reared in captivity,
and they are key players in many aquatic ecosystems. The results of these
studies will further our understanding of how natural communities function,
thereby enhancing our ability to manage natural resources and conserve
biological diversity. The research program places a large emphasis on
undergraduate training and integration with teaching and teacher training.
