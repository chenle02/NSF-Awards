9303534 Davis This grant will cover travel expenses for US scientists to attend
the 'Molecular Neurobiology of Drosophila Conference' at Cold Spring Harbor to
be held October, 1993. This is an important meeting to the Neuroscience field in
that it has over the years catalyzed the interests of geneticists and molecular
biologists to investigate the Drosophila nervous system. The Drosophila nervous
system has provided a powerful tool for neuroscience research and has had a
significant impact on our understanding of how all nervous systems function. The
ability to mutate the Drosophila has allowed a number of genes to be identified
that are important to all species. This meeting has developed and grown through
continuous NSF support to be the most important meeting for this field of
Neuroscience. ***
