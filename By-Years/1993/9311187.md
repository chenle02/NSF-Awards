9311187 Graham, J. Research in Marine Biology at the Scripps Institution of
Oceanography involves study of the physiology, cell biology, neurobiology,
biochemistry, genetics, and molecular biology of marine organisms. Research
facilities are generally excellent, but the seawater aquarium facility in Hubbs
Hall is badly in need of repair and upgrading in order to meet the demands of
its multiple users. This project will assist with this essential renovation
which will include the replacement of several aquaria and water tables,
replacement of the dilapidated heat exchange system now used to generate
insufficient volumes of cool water, and the purchase of a new exchanger to be
used in conjunction with a "heated seawater" supply system. These improvements
will enhance local research and that of visitors as well as that of the numerous
other scientific agencies in San Diego dependent upon the seawater system. ***
