ABSTRACT CTS-9733310 Paul R. Van Tassel/ Wayne State U. This grant is awarded
through the Interfacial, Transport and Separations Program of the Chemical and
Transport Systems Division. The principal investigator is Dr. Paul Van Tassel of
Wayne State University. An objective of the research is the elucidation of
protein adsorption onto affinity surfaces, including the effects of kinetics,
ligand density and ligand spacer length on protein orientation. A second
objective is to develop technology to control protein placement on a surface
using electric fields and specific ligand placement. The educational aspects of
the PI's career development seek to integrate course development with laboratory
experiments through web based interactive modules. An outreach program seeks to
team up undergraduates with high school students to provide an enhanced
educational experience to potential scientists and engineers. The immobilization
of protein molecules at a liquid-solid interface is an important aspect of
enzyme catalysis, bioseparations and biomaterials coatings. Understanding how
proteins adsorb onto surfaces and developing new techniques to manipulate this
adsorption process has significant implications to the biotechnology industry.
