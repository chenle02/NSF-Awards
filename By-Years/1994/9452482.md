9452482 Pai Instrumentation for the enhancement of research training of students
allows the department to incorporate semester-long research projects in courses
for both undergraduate majors and non-majors. Students explore different aspects
of original research approaching a problem from many directions. Drosophila
melanogaster is the experimental model of choice for both scientific and
practical reasons. The new equipment includes incubators to provide controlled
environments; microscopes and a micromanipulation system with video capabilities
to analyze embryos and teach up-to-date techniques. Projects are carried out in
a variety of upper division courses: a contrast of natural selection and
artificial selection in a non-major course in the context of evolution; crosses
to induce the excision of plasmids from transformed flies in Genetics; in situ
hybridization experiments for Experimental Molecular Biology (EMB);
microinjection of protoplasts and embryos in EMB and Embryology. Experiments and
analyses based on these projects serve as projects for Honors and Independent
Research Projects. ***
