9712436 Husain The majority of the global sulfur dioxide oxidation is believed
to occur in clouds. The primary mechanisms are oxidation by ozone, hydrogen
peroxide, and molecular oxygen in the presence of trace metals, such as iron and
manganese. Recent measurements and cloud chemistry models indicate that cloud
drop composition varies with drop size. This chemical heterogeneity among cloud
drop populations has the potential to significantly influence the rate of
aqueous phase sulfur oxidation, resulting in faster sulfate production in large
drops. The average oxidation rate in a chemically heterogeneous cloud drop
population could significantly exceed the rate expected from the average drop
composition. This project, to be conducted jointly by groups at Colorado State
University and at the State University of New York at Albany/ New York State
Department of Health, will test the hypothesis that sulfate production does not
vary with drop size when hydrogen peroxide is the dominant oxidant, but can vary
significantly with drop size when oxidation by ozone or trace metal catalyzed
oxidation are dominant. The study will apply a tracer technique which was
recently developed by L. Husain to measure sulfate production in cloud drops.
The ratios of sulfate to a conservative aerosol tracer (Se, As, or Sb) will be
measured both in pre-cloud aerosol and cloud water, indicating the proportion of
the sulfate that was produced in the cloud. Large and small cloud drops will be
collected using a size-fractionating cloud collector. Measurements of droplet
composition and gas phase concentrations of sulfur dioxide, ozone, and hydrogen
peroxide will also be made to permit prediction of sulfur oxidation rates as a
function of drop size for comparison with rates determined by the tracer
technique. Two environments (Whiteface Mountain, New York, and Bakersfield,
California) have been selected for study to ensure that conditions will be
encountered where hydrogen peroxide both is and is not the dominant oxidan t.
