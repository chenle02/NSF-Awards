Sanders 9700750 This award provides funds for a joint research project involving
Daniel Sanders and Yue Zhao. The objective of the research proposed here is to
attempt to solve several problems which are related to graphs embedded in
surfaces using a relatively new and unexploited technique, aalled the
Discharging Method. These problems include: (i) Vizing's Planar Graph
Conjecture; (ii) the Total Coloring Conjecture for planar graphs; (iii) the
Entire Coloring Conjecture; (iv) the Cyclic Coloring Conjecture; (v) the Nine
Color Conjecture; (vi) further investigation on the k-Walk Conjecture, which the
principal investigators solved in 1996; (vii) vertex reconstruction of
4-connected planar graphs, which is a special case of the Vertex Reconstruction
Conjecture; (viii) edge reconstruction of triangulations of surfaces, which is a
special case of the Edge Reconstruction Conjecture. Some of these problems have
been around for more than thirty years, but still remain unsolved. Recently, the
principal investigators have successfully solved several problems related to
(i)--(vi) by using the Discharging Method. It seems that other methods which
were used to attack several of the problems mentioned above have stalled, and
that the Discharging Method indeed provides a far more general and powerful tool
for various problems. The principal investigators also intend to continue their
search for new areas of graph theory where the Discharging Method can be
applied. This research is in the area of combinatorics. One of the goals of
combinatorics is to find efficient methods of studying how discrete collections
of objects can be arranged. The behavior of discrete systems is extremely
important to modern communications. For example, the design of large networks,
such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the design of algorithms in
computer science deal with discrete sets of objects, and this makes use of
combinatorial research.
