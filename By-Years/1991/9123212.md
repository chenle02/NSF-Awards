Minorities are not well represented in careers in science, particularly the
marine sciences. Considerable effort is being made to increase the participation
of underrepresented minorities in marine science. This renewal is a two-year
training program in marine sciences at the Duke University Marine Laboratory. It
includes a semester-in-residence program for undergraduates in their junior or
senior year of college, which provides a comprehensive educational and research
experience for the students. This is combined with a mentor-in-residence and
instructional assistant, who will function as tutors and role models. It also
includes a visiting-scholar program in which each year four minority scientists
will spend several days on campus interacting with the students.
