ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;A decline in the annual retention and graduation rates of
LeTourneau University's School of Engineering and Engineering Technology to
significantly subpar levels motivated a study of the underlying causes. An
analysis of performance and predictor data, as well as surveys of the literature
and of students leaving the school, produced several recommended corrective
actions based on documented best practices. The project initiatives to increase
retention include the development of a coordinated faculty-peer-industry
mentoring program for first-year students, and a new two-course sequence whose
primary aim is to stimulate first-year student interest and engagement through
early exposure to real-world engineering practice. These multifaceted
initiatives include several best-practice components, namely:&lt;br/&gt;. the
development of the faculty mentoring program for first-year
students;&lt;br/&gt;. the development of a peer mentoring program for first-year
students;&lt;br/&gt;. the development of an industrial contact mentoring program
for first-year students;&lt;br/&gt;. the formation of student clusters in key
first-year courses;&lt;br/&gt;. exposure to engineering practice through two new
courses employing multidisciplinary projects, presentations by practicing
engineers, presentations by students involved in co-op education, and
presentations by senior capstone design project
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most specific and immediate goal of this
project is to increase the School's graduation rate from its present five-year
average of 42% to an improved five-year average of 65%. Based on the current
average annual first-year cohort size of 120 students, the total number of
engineering and engineering technology graduates will increase from 50 to over
75 per year. Over the five-year period comprising the project, more than 125
additional graduates will be queued to join the ranks of the engineering
profession. The School's retention improvement efforts focus on "first time in
any college" (FTIAC) freshmen. To achieve the target graduation rate of 65%,
1-year retention of new students will be increased to 85% from its present level
of 68%. Implementing these best practices will not only increase first-year
retention, but will positively impact retention in subsequent years, as well,
since students will carry forward their improved study habits, academic support
network, and higher level of commitment to pursue engineering.
