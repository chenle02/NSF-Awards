This proposal is for support of student travel for the 2nd International
Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC) Conference on Cyber-Physical and Human
Systems being held in Miami, Florida. The conference is sponsored by the
Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers. The focus on integration of
Human and Cyber-Physical Systems is an area of great importance and direct
applicability to NSF's Cyber-Physical Systems and Smart and Connected
Communities Programs. The award will provide travel support for approximately 10
graduate students to attend, present papers, and participate in conference
activities.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This conference will provide the students with
the opportunity to attend presentations of cutting-edge research results
representing the state-of-the-art in cyber physical systems and their
integration with humans. The attendees are offered a diversity of interactive
forums, technical sessions, targeted workshops, interesting poster sessions, and
exciting demonstrations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
