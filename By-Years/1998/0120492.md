Middle Tennessee State University is using a planning grant to design a
demonstration program, WISUP@MTSU, (Women in SMET Undergraduate Programs @
MTSU). The project team is investigating and identifying the best practices to
attract and to retain women in all fields of science, mathematics, engineering,
and technology and to to build on successful programs already in place at MTSU.
The goal is to design a technology intensive and supportive program to attract
and to retain high school senior and undergraduate freshmen women into SMET
disciplines at MTSU. The experience, technical and scientific talents of the
WISUP Team and the strong support from the College of Basic and Applied Sciences
and the university will result in a successful planning grant and the submission
of a full demonstration proposal in the next NSF/PGE funding
cycle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MTSU is currently graduating slightly less than the
national percentage of women in the SMET disciplines, yet university-wide the
majority of both undergraduate and graduate students are female (54%). The
institution is uniquely situated to serve rural and urban, low-income, and first
generation students. MTSU also graduates more teachers than any university in
Tennessee (more than 25% of all teachers in the entire state). The full program
to be proposed should reach not only potential SMET students but also public
school teachers who can encourage their student to consider SMET majors and
careers.&lt;br/&gt;
