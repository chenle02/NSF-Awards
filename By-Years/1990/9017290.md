The goal of this project is to establish a series of one-day workshops for
researchers in theoretically oriented fields of computer science in the Midwest
United States. The plan is to hold the meeting twice a year in the Midwest to
discuss latest results in theoretical aspects of computer science and
methodologies to transfer them to applied fields.
