The research proposed focuses on an apparent interaction between two
chloroplast enzymes, an interaction that may play significant roles in
regulation of carbon dioxide fixation in photosynthesis. The studies will assess
whether interactions between one of these enymes and others in the reductive
pentose-phosphate pathway occur; kinetic analyses and phase partition
experiments, and effects of putative modulators will be employed to explore
potential interactions. The findings will be pertinent to understanding
regulation of key events in photosynthesis. The role of possible interactions
between different enzymes involved in the chloroplast's metabolism of carbon
dioxide during the latter's conversion to organic compounds will be examined in
this research; an enlarged understanding of the regulation of carbon dioxide
fixation in photosynthetic organisms should result.
