Linfield College is establishing a connection to NSFNET via a 56,000 bits per
second line through the NorthWestNet mid-level network. The connection enables
the school's faculty and students to communicate and collaborate with the
national scientific and educational community, and to access network resources.
Areas of science and education addressed over the Internet by Linfield include
biology, mathematics, physics, chemistry and computer science. The library also
benefits from access to other libraries and data bases. This award funds part of
the costs for two years.***
