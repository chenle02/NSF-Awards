This proposal focuses on several important problems in representation theory of
finite groups and its applications. Many of these problems come up naturally --
some long-standing and playing a central role -- in group representation theory,
and others are motivated by various applications. The proposal ties together
different areas of mathematics, such as finite groups and algebraic groups,
finite permutation group theory, group cohomology, combinatorics, operator
algebras, and algebraic geometry, with the main unifying ingredient being the
representation theory. The PI will study several problems along the lines of the
local-global principle, including the Alperin weight conjecture, Brauer's height
zero conjecture, and some further conjectures concerning rationality and
divisibility properties of complex and Brauer characters of finite groups. The
PI will also continue his long-term project to classify modular representations
of finite quasisimple groups of low dimension. He will then apply his results to
achieve significant progress on a number of applications, including Waring-type
problems for quasisimple groups, Aschbacher's conjecture on subgroup lattices,
the Kollar-Larsen problem on exterior powers (with application in algebraic
geometry), and the Guralnick-Holt conjecture on second cohomology groups for
finite groups and their presentations, and representations of finite quasisimple
groups with special properties (with application in the subgroup structure of
finite simple groups).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main area of research in this
proposal is group representation theory. The concept of a group in mathematics
grew out ofthe notion of symmetry. The symmetries of an object in nature or
science are encoded by a group, and this group carries a lot of important
information about the structure of the object itself. The representation theory
allows one to study groups via their actions on vector spaces which model the
ways they arise in the real world. It has fascinated mathematicians for more
than a century and has many important applications in physics and chemistry,
particularly in quantum mechanics and in the theory of elementary particles.
Finite groups and their representations have already proved valuable in coding
theory and cryptography, and are expected to continue to play an important role
in the modern world of computers and digital communications. The investigator's
research will lead to important advances in understanding the representation
theory of finite groups and help achieve significant progress in a number of its
applications.
