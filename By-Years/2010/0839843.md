The stratosphere is increasingly recognized as an important component of the
climate system. Observational and modeling studies show that stratospheric
conditions may be able to influence both weather and climate. Under previous
National Science Foundation support, the researcher has worked on several fronts
to elucidate the influences of the stratosphere on the tropospheric circulation.
In this project, the research will further investigate the stratospheric impacts
on weather and climate by focusing on idealized modeling studies.

These studies are intended to complement work done with state-of-the art climate
models. Idealized climate models differ from comprehensive climate models in
that the physical parameterizations have been highly simplified; this permits
explorations of parameter space sensitivities and establishes the numerical
robustness of the computed results. These idealized models will be used to study
the impact of stratospheric ozone and greenhouse gases on the circulation of the
coupled stratosphere-troposphere system, including their effects on the Brewer-
Dobson circulation, and to investigate the dynamics and predictability of
stratospheric sudden warmings and their impacts on the tropospheric circulation
and weather forecasts.

The broader impacts of this project include contributions to the important task
of attributing climate change, specifically, the stratospheric role, the
possible improvement of extended-range weather forecasts from using knowledge of
stratospheric conditions, contributions to the development and improvement of
comprehensive climate models, links to international research efforts, and the
training of postdoctoral scientists and graduate and undergraduate students.
