year period, Bethune Cookman College (BCC) will implement comprehensive
approaches to strengthen the institution's undergraduate science, technology,

college will increase STEM offerings, improve STEM teaching and learning,
increase the number of students earning baccalaureate degrees in STEM
disciplines, and improve the quality of preparation and learning for STEM
students. Curriculum enhancement activities include the establishment of a new
Baccalaureate Degree program in Computer Engineering, development of an
interdisciplinary Minor in Environmental Science, offering interdisciplinary
courses in Instrumentation, Bioinformatics &amp; Applied Calculus, and infusing
technology in classroom teaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research experiences will
be provided for STEM undergraduate students and faculty via university and
industry partnerships. In order to increase the pool of applicants for science-
related careers, the Bethune Cookman College HBCU-Undergraduate Program includes
K-12 outreach efforts geared toward making high school students aware and better
prepared for science-related study and careers.&lt;br/&gt;
