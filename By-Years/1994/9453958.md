9453958 Walter: In this Local Systemic Change Through Teacher Enhancement
Project, the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), proposes a project
in partnership with the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD), whose
purpose is to enable all of the city's elementary schools to accomplish
effective, site-based science education reform. UCSF's City Science program will
provide an intensive hands-on science program for 400 SFUSD teachers who have
taught less than seven years and a less intensive program for 600 more
experienced teachers in order to broaden the base of teachers with hands-on
science in a cooperative learning environment. It will also provide new
opportunities for a subset of the 100 teachers who are current City Science
participants to expand their capacity as science teachers while serving to
further develop in their role as leaders. They will support specific aspects of
the district-wide science education reform and mentor new leadership that will
sustain the reform process in their schools.
