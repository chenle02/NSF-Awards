Schlegel 9318995 This projects supports the Research of a cultural
anthropologist from the University of Arizona. the project tests a hypothesis of
adolescent behavior: that adolescents who spend more time with adults differ in
measurable ways (display less aggressiveness, competitiveness, and anti-social
behavior) from those who spend more time with peers. The project will study
adolescent apprentices in Germany, a country with a well-developed system of
apprenticeship. A sample of industrial apprentices will be compared with a
matched sample of school attenders in relations with family, peers and unrelated
adults for various aspects of adolescent behavior. The subjects will be observed
in their natural settings, the classroom and workplace. Questionnaires and tests
to measure their relationships and attitudes will be administered. This research
is important because adolescent violence is a major problem in contemporary
society, and increases in our understanding of its causes will help us control
it. In addition the project is timely since the German in American. This study
should help us assess its applicability for our nation. ! ! ! F E Times New
