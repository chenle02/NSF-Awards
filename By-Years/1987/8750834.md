The quality of the chemistry program at Rosemont College has been enhanced by
the recent acquisition of a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. The
availability of this instrument is providing undergraduate students a broader
experience with chemical phenomena and a realization of the potential of NMR as
a powerful tool for further investigation. Implementation of these goals is
accomplished in three steps: (a) introduction of the basic concepts of NMR
spectrometry through experimentation followed by qualitative application to
organic structure determination; (b) remodeling of the advanced laboratory
sequence to include a series of comparative experimental projects using NMR and
other complimentary techniques, and (c) development of applications to
undergraduate research projects.
