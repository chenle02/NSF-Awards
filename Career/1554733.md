The rapid developments in technology and the widespread use of mobile devices
have led to an explosive amount of data whose complexity is such that it becomes
very challenging to extract any useful information in a reasonable amount of
time and resources. The data are complex in size, dimension, and structure. The
technology for rapidly processing such massive amounts of data is still in its
infancy. One of the main goals of this project is to take advantage of some
recent mathematical advances to develop and implement fast algorithms for
fitting data by smooth functions. This could have many practical applications,
for example in the design of automated systems that guide airplanes and unmanned
aerial vehicles through complex terrains avoiding obstacles of arbitrary shapes.
The proposed research carries the hope of advancing obstacle avoidance
algorithms -- fast algorithms that can plan an optimal path under various
constraints. The project will open new research directions for students and
researchers; and it also will enhance our understanding of mathematical theories
such as harmonic analysis, differential geometry, partial differential
equations, and nonlinear programming.

This 5-year integrated research and education project focuses on solving
variational problems with boundary and/or obstacle constraints on arbitrary
subsets in Euclidean space. The approach that the PI proposes is unorthodox:
Rather than seeking exact minimizers of energy functionals, the PI will look for
functions that minimize the energy functionals up to universal constant
multiples. In contrast to the conventional approach to solving variational
problems, which involves the solution of a partial differential equation, the PI
will construct the solutions directly. The ultimate goal is to develop a
complete theory revolving around the belief that any variational problem that
can be solved using PDE theory can also be dealt with using extension theory.
The special problems the PI will focus on are the obstacle problem, which
requires the minimizers to lie above a certain barrier; and the Plateau problem,
which seeks a surface of least area with prescribed boundary. Solving
variational problems using PDE methods often requires the boundary of the set to
have some kind of smoothness. In practice, this is a severe limitation. The
novelty of the proposed approach is that there is no need to make any assumption
on the geometry or the regularity of the set on which the PI prescribes the
boundary conditions or constraints.
