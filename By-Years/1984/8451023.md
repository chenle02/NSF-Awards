The investigation of triple mode-locking mechanisms is continued, including new
dye combinations. In addition, fabrication of a colliding-pulse mode-locked
laser, with the purchase of a copper vapor laser amplifier system is also
anticipated. The use of a fibre:grating-pair compressor is being considered to
generate five optical cycle pulses. Research is continuing in the acousto-optic
interaction area. Various anomalous effects involving the polarization and
wavelength of light incident onto y-cut, z-propagating L;iiN;ibO;i3 surface
acoustic wave (SAW) devices have been theoretically investigated, both in the
Bragg and Raman-Nath regimes. Experiments will be conducted on both SAW and bulk
devices. A careful study of the diffraction efficiency dependence on p-polarized
and s-polarized incident light (at various wavelengths) is being undertaken,
especially as a function of deviation from Bragg angle and the internal confocal
gaussian beam parameter.
