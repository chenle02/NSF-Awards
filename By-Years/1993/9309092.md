This project relates to sustained interarea oscillations. The elimination of
these oscillations, when they occur, is of great practical importance. The
analysis proposed here extends the notion of linear analysis by including
second-order nonlinear terms, which, with sinusoidal modes gives rise to an
array of added frequencies. The analysis is to be validated using standard
simulation techniques.
