This collaborative research project aims to develop advanced sensing and
control methodologies for hexapod machining cells. Process parameters will be
identified and characterized, and used to develop the advanced process model-
based controller for the hexapod machining cell. Information from force,
temperature and position sensors will be fused, before being used by the
position control algorithm created for the machine for error compensation. The
research will be conducted by the University of Florida in collaboration with
the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Sandia National
Laboratory, using the hexapod machining cells available at the NIST and Sandia
Laboratories, as well as the micro-manipulator hexapod developed by the Systems
Automation and Mobility in Manufacturing Laboratory at the University of
Florida. The research project will contribute toward improving the accuracy of
hexapod machining cells via advanced control techniques. It synergizes the
research efforts of the University and its collaborative partners.
