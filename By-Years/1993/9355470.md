9355470 Westgate The Frontiers in Education Conference has become one of the
leading forums for the dissemination of information on engineering education. It
consistently attracts strong participation from engineering faculty directly
involved in classroom and laboratory instruction, from department chairs and
deans of engineering and allied sciences, and from research organizations and
government agencies supporting educational programs. This conference is the
ideal forum for the direct dissemination of results from NSF-sponsored
engineering curriculum developments to the faculty who can adapt these
developments in their own programs. Among the major presenters at the conference
are members of the NSF-sponsored Engineering Coalitions. This project will 1)
expand the distribution of program announcements to faculty in all engineering
disciplines, 2) provide travel grants to allow principal investigators of
particularly compelling projects to present their work at the conference, and 3)
provide travel grants to allow allow up to 50 K-12 teachers to attend the
conference and lend their expertise in teaching to the conference participants
while they gain increased understanding of the engineering disciplines. ***
