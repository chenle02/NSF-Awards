Sage Days Duluth workshop will be held at the University of Minnesota Duluth,
June 6-9, 2022. This workshop will bring together a diverse group of
mathematicians to focus on increasing the functionality of essential low-
dimensional topology software, and also on training new users in development of
this software. The workshop will follow a format used in recent Sage Days
conferences, which is very effective in terms of both education and software
development. The participants will be brought up to speed on the current state-
of-the-art for three-manifold computations in SageMath, after which much of the
time will be spent in small groups, working on development and training. To
supplement this, the workshop will also feature talks about software
development, usage, and best practices, as well as lightning talks about current
research. Participants from from a wide range of mathematicians, including early
career researchers and researchers from liberal arts and regional institutions
will be invited to attend the workshop.

After introductory sessions introducing the software, the workshop will center
upon group work in SageMath and SnapPy development. A key goal of the workshop
will be to restore functionality found in the original snap program as
verifiable exact computations. The workshop will also aim to add the ability for
SnapPy to perform computations with orbifolds, and implement better methods in
SnapPy for identification of non-hyperbolic manifolds. The increased
functionality in SageMath and SnapPy will be a valuable research tool for
mathematicians around the world doing research in low-dimensional topology and
is also an excellent tool for undergraduate research projects. Information about
