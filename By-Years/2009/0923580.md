This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award funds the acquisition of a fast
protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) biomolecule purification system to support
an interdisciplinary consortium of Seattle University faculty, their programs in
undergraduate student-faculty research, interdepartmental collaboration, and
scientific community outreach. Faculty research enabled by the FPLC will be
translated back into the classroom in support of Seattle University's
educational mission. The instrument will provide research training to students
on the industry-standard purification system and supply practical experience for
undergraduates continuing on to graduate school or obtaining technical positions
in the biotechnology industry.

Faculty members from the Biology, Chemistry, Nursing, and Mechanical Engineering
departments will utilize the FPLC across a wide range of scientific research
areas including pharmacology/toxicology, biological chemistry, microbiology,
evolutionary biology, toxicology, and bioengineering; all of which focus on
essential questions of biological significance while promoting the training of
future scientists and professionals. Student-faculty research and the
technological innovation of the FPLC will be directly incorporated into advanced
courses, and all faculty research projects are substantially conducted by
undergraduate researchers. Additionally, Service-learning partnerships with
local middle school science classes will lead to increased interest and
appreciation for the biological sciences, and continued scientific exploration
for participating middle school students. Project outcomes will be available
through the Seattle University Interdisciplinary Life Sciences Research Lab
website.
