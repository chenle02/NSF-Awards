The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary cooperative research project between
Dr. Eugene Stanley of Boston University and Dr. Janos Kertesz of the Hungarian
Academy of Sciences' Research Institute for Technical Physics is to examine the
fundamental properties of random media. The reseachers' intend improve our
understanding of the basic physical laws of transport as they are modified in
media possessing macroscopic heterogentics.Efforts will focus on transport
phenomena that arise from different types of disorder, including random
substitutional (percolation) disorder and spatially correlated disorder. Results
should provide more information on principles of universality and on probability
distributions associated with such kinetic phenomena. This project in condensed
matter theory fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge
by enabling leading experts in the United states and Eastern Europe to combine
complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual
interest and competence.
