No evidence currently exists to support the contention that the psychometric
differences between performance (portfolio) assessment and multiple-choice
assessment can be reconciled and that different performance assessments
administered to different groups of students can ever be combined and summarized
in educationally meaningful ways. The proposed study represents a multi-year
investigation of the ability of elementary and middle school science and
mathematics teachers, students, parents, and evaluators to develop and reach
consensus on portfolio assessments to produce aggregate data within individual
schools and across which exhibit diversity along key dimensions (size, location,
racial/ethnic makeup of student population, etc). Formative and summative
measures (ranging from low-inference to high-inference) will be used to evaluate
the proposed activities in terms of four targets: utility of the model,
feasibility of the consensus-building process, meaningfulness - for multiple
users - of the data, and extent to which the project was implemented as
proposed.
