9618867 London This grant provides $34,230 as partial support of the costs of
upgrading the experimental petrology laboratory at the University of Oklahoma.
Specifically, funds will be used to purchase raw materials and to fund the in-
house fabrication of approximately 20 cold-seal reaction vessels and furnaces to
augment and/or replace 18 aging cold-seal vessels that have been and continue to
be heavily used by both departmental and external faculty and students.
Additionally, temperature controllers, pressure transducers and other ancillary
lab equipment needed for hydrothermal experimentation will be purchased.
Renovation of this laboratory will allow continued research on the geochemistry
of incompatible elements in granitic pegmatites and other silicic magmatic
systems. ***
