9405051 Jenkins This award provides 60% of the funds required for the
acquisition of a powder x-ray diffractometer to be installed and operated in the
Department of Geological Sciences at the State University of New York in
Binghamton. The University is committed to providing the remaining funds
necessary for the acquisition. Use of the modern x-ray diffractometer will be
mainly devoted to the research and teaching projects of the Principal
Investigator and colleagues in the Department of Geological Sciences and also by
members of the Department of Physics. Examples of current research projects
include: (1) Studies of cation disorder in natural and synthetic amphiboles, (2)
Mineralogy of low-grade metamorphic reactions in layered silicates, (3)
petrologic studies of mineral distribution in layered igneous rocks, (4) Studies
of the mineralogy of salt minerals from evaporite deposits, and (5) X-ray
studies of stacking sequences in transition- metal/graphite intercalation
compounds to determine the stacking sequence influence on their magnetic
properties. ***
