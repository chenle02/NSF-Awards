Dr. Moore will compare soil webs from nine established and three proposed paired
native and disturbed sites to detect pattern in the effects of anthropogenic
disturbance of food web structure and function. The research will be coupled
with a program where primary and secondary school teachers from U.S. school
districts near the sites and student teachers at the University of Northern
Colorado will be given summer research experience to augment their curricula.
