The objective of this research is to engineer thin film spintronic devices based
on a dynamic magnetic proximity effect. A non-zero spin-polarization will be
induced in a non-magnetic material by reflection of conduction electrons off the
interface of an insulating magnetic material. The approach is to fabricate non-
magnetic-conductor/magnetic-insulator structures completely in situ, then probe
the resulting spin-polarized current via three complementary techniques:
tunneling magnetoresistance, tunneling spin polarization, and x-ray magnetic
circular dichroism. Trilayer device structures with independently addressable
magnetic layers will also be explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:
This project may spearhead a paradigm shift for all-electrical spintronics.
Present efforts focus on injecting spins from ferromagnets into non-magnetic
materials. However, spin-injection has crippled progress, particularly for
semiconductor-based devices. The proposed devices induce a spin-polarization in
a non-magnetic conduction channel by reflection off an insulating magnetic gate,
thereby obviating the difficulties of injection. This project will develop the
building blocks for a series of more complex device architectures able to
deliver electrically tunable spin-polarized
currents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This transformational research
may ease the integration of spintronics with existing back-end semiconductor
processing, thereby substantially reducing barriers to commercial spintronics.
This program integrates teaching and multidisciplinary training of undergraduate
and graduate students, including those from under-represented groups, by
unifying physics, engineering, and materials concepts, and by developing hands-
on spintronics experiments for high school and undergraduate laboratories. This
work enhances infrastructure via a new collaboration between the University of
South Florida and the Advanced Light Source. &lt;br/&gt;
