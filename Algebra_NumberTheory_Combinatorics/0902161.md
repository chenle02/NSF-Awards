ABSTRACT

Principal Investigator: Lorenzini, Dino Proposal Number: DMS - 0902161
Institution: University of Georgia Research Foundation Inc Title: Critical
groups of graphs and generalizations

There is a vast body of mathematical knowledge concerning matrices and, in
particular, two sets of invariants are widely used to study any integer matrix:
the eigenvalues of the matrix, and the invariant factors of the matrix. The
Picard group of a graph is an object that can be completely described in terms
of the second set of invariants of the Laplacian of the graph. Its study was
independently initiated almost 20 years ago by several researchers with widely
different points of views, such as physicists, arithmetic geometers, and graph
theorists. This research will investigate how the eigenvalues of the Laplacian
affect the structure of the Picard group, and whether the recent Riemann-Roch
theorem for graphs can be extended to a larger class of integer lattices.

Graphs are used to model many different phenomenons naturally occurring in
practical life, such as telephone networks, or electrical circuits. Naturally
associated to a graph is a array called the Laplacian of the graph, from which
the graph can be completely recovered. Finding relationships between the
algebraic properties of this array and the combinatorial properties of the graph
is one of the main theme of this research.
