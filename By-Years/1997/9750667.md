This proposal requests funds to purchase a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to
support, improve and enhance undergraduate education at the University of
Dayton. The SEM will be used by undergraduate students enrolled in seven
interdisciplinary, seventeen upper level and six introductory courses in
Biology, Chemistry and Geology, and for B.S. thesis research in each department.
The SEM will provide students hands-on experience in obtaining valuable three-
dimensional information about the external features of specimens and to thereby
increase understanding of microstructure. A fully automated, user friendly SEM
will permit the following changes to be incorporated into the Biology, Chemistry
and Geology Department undergraduate curricula: 1) addition of a new, team-
taught, interdisciplinary and innovative electron microscopy course with a
student research component focusing of technique in microstructure, 2) enhanced
hands-on experience for students in upper level laboratories in each department,
3) opportunity for all students in introductory science majors courses to gain
first-hand operation of the SEM, 4) use of the SEM in exercises for students in
introductory non-science majors laboratories in an effort to instill greater
interest in and understanding of science, and 5) ability to use the SEM for
undergraduate research in each department. Students will acquire knowledge in
data analysis, instrumental "know-how," and state-of-the-art training needed to
enter the job market as competitive, productive scientists.
