9407190 BROWN This project provides funding for the study of five natural
species groups of flies in the genus Apocephalus (Insecta: Diptera: Phoridae)
that are parasites of ants. There are 110 described species in this genus,
mostly from coastal Brazil, but many more species await discovery and
description from throughout the western hemisphere. Massive collecting efforts
utilizing Malaise traps will be conducted, supplemented by careful hand
collecting to establish which ant species are the hosts of the parasites.
Phylogenetic relationships among these flies will be deduced from
characteristics of the external body structure and the pattern of ant host
selection will be explored in light of these relationships. %%% The study of
this genus of parasitic flies will include description of many new species and
keys for their identification. It will provide information on a large group of
little-known flies and contribute to our knowledge of insect biodiversity,
especially for the South American tropics. Studies of the biology of these flies
and their interaction with ant hosts could yield information that might be used
to control pest ant species, such as the imported or introduced fire ant in the
southeastern United States. ***
