This project aims to develop a theoretical foundation for a rigorous research
program on robust and efficient paradigms for parallel algorithm design. The
project addresses a broad spectrum of paradigms: - general paradigms, including
innovative methods for exploiting treestructured computations, for designing
parallel data structures, and for parallelizing recursive specifications - high-
level design techniques for systolic architectures, including general methods
for designing schemes that are topology independent - parallel design schemes
for computational geometry, including novel methods for utilizing an output-
sensitive number of processors and for traversing geometric structures in
parallel - techniques for artificial intelligence, including efficient parallel
solutions of symbolic constraint satisfaction networks and parallel inference in
semantic networks - studies in robustness of parallel computations, including
highly efficient testing/modifying schemes and fast parallel acceptance testing
In addition, the PIs intend to verify experimentally overhead inherent in
algorithms, by implementing them in a high-level parallel programming language.
