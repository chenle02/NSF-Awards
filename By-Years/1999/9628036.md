The overall objective of the project is to identify sets of core competencies
and skills in mathematics, science, engineering and technology that are required
by industries that hire two-year college graduates with technical degrees. the
project will investigate 5 technology based industries, interview technicians
and supervisors in five companies in each of these industries, and also
interview a sample of graduates of community colleges. the project will produce
research papers on the measurement of the integration of community college
curriculum with industrial needs and will provide a basis for future study of
technical education. It will provide some of the first detailed workplace
ethnography's of the use of mathematics and science in industrial jobs of
technicians. No other study of colleges has developed a similar curriculum study
of community colleges and a match with industrial uses of those graduates.
