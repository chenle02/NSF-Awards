ABSTRACT



The Department of Mathematics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
will purchase a cluster of 16 dual processor PCs connected by gigabit network
connections. The computer equipment will be dedicated as a powerful distributed
computing resource to the support of research in the mathematical sciences. In
particular, it will support the project Computational Aspects of Secure
Cryptosystems.

Public-key cryptosystems occur in applications such as digital signatures,
message encryption, user authentication, online payments, and others. The
equipment provides an adequate and up-to-date testing environment for
implementing cryptosystems and for simulating attacks.
