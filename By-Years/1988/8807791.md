This project studies a new social movement in Palermo, Italy. The project will
allow two researchers, an anthropologist and a social psychologist who have
studied community institutions and local history in Southern Italy for over
twenty years, to assess the importance of factors such as conscience or
grievance in individual involvement with the antimafia movement, organized
around criticism of this Sicilian institution, and to analyze the movement as an
agent of cultural change. The project will also study the reaction of the
"Sicilianist" movement, which objects to any criticism of an indigenous
phenomenon as calling critical attention to Sicily and focusing on negative
aspects of local culture. The methods include interviews with activists on all
sides of the movement, surveys of documentary resources, and participant
observation over two summers.
