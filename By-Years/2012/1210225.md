This action funds Mallory Barkdull of Stanford University to conduct a research
project, entitled "Studying transport between a coral reef system and the
coastal ocean through numerical modeling and field experiments" during the
summer of 2012 at University of Western Australia in Perth, Western Australia,
Australia. The host scientist is Ryan Lowe.

Intellectual merit of the research project is generate new fundamental
understandings of the hydrodynamics (i.e. waves, tides, and longshore current)
governing transport between coral reefs and the coastal ocean. The hydrodynamics
of the system govern biogeochemical cycles of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous
in benthic systems and determine the fate of contaminants in reef communities.
Research questions are being answered using two approaches: numerical modeling
of Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii and field work on coral reefs around Western Australia.

Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
