A study will be made of the physics of solid surfaces and interfaces which
possess unique bonding configurations and electronic properties. A combination
of surface sensitive techniques, including photoemission, inverse photoemission
and optical properties will be used to probe the kinetics of interface
formation, the nature of bonding between different materials and the atomic and
electronic structure of interfaces between semiconductors, metals and
insulators. A novel photothermal displacement spectroscopy will be employed to
obtain information not accessible with electron spectroscopies. This work is of
importance for the microelectronics industry.
