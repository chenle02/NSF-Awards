The problems of ignition and propagation of a thermal front in a catalytic
converter will be studied theoretically and experimentally in order to gain a
better understanding of the factors controlling these phenomena. A preliminary
theoretical analysis utilizing non-linear dynamics and bifurcation theory will
be extended to analysis of more complex models. Experimentally, macroscopic
thermal wave propagation will be investigated via infrared thermography studies
on unsupported model substrates, studies on supported model catalysts, and
studies on a section of a catalytic converter. In addition, the issue of
communication between two reactive spots (communications between individual
catalyst particles) will be similarly experimentally investigated. Finally, a
new radial catalytic converter design which is predicted on the basis of
preliminary analysis to have particularly desirable characteristics as regards
fast ignition and thermal front propagation will be studied further. Evolving
air pollution regulations for automobiles have the effect of requiring that
catalytic converters come up to full effective operation with a minimal time
delay subsequent to engine startup, making the development of catalytic
converters with minimal ignition delay and rapid thermal front propagation
highly important. Accordingly, a major goal of this program is development of an
understanding of the critical phenomena (fundamental mechanisms) which will lead
to design of more efficient fast-igniting catalytic converters without the
onerous requirement of external heating sources (an alternative approach to
"fixing" the cold startup emissions problem.
