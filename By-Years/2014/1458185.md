This project at Midwestern State University (MSU) entitled Scholarship
Opportunities for Academic Recognition (SOAR) will help to meet the demand in
Texas for science and technology well-prepared employees. It will focus on
strategies designed to increase retention in science, technology, engineering,
and mathematics (STEM) majors such increased peer and faculty supports, programs
to facilitate transition to the college environment, and the development of
student identity as scientists. These activities have been shown to be
particularly effective for underrepresented student populations. Because a high
percentage of students at the university are lower-income first-generation and
minority students, these strategies will increase retention in those populations
and contribute to the diversity of the local workforce. SOAR will serve to
strengthen university connections with local high schools during recruitment
activities while networking activities with employers improve career preparation
and cultivate student interest in the regional STEM industry. SOAR will lead to
sustained improvements at the university, in particular the institutionalization
of living/learning communities and the science orientation programs.

In addition to providing financial support, SOAR will implement student success
strategies to improve retention and graduation for student populations that,
despite academic talent and initial motivation, have difficulty persevering in
college when confronted with early struggles. The student support model will
strengthen science skills early and enable students to develop personal assets
that allow them to overcome the challenges of college. This will be accomplished
through first-year transition supports, early research experiences in science, a
living/learning community, stronger faculty and peer interactions and mentoring,
and professional experiences such as internships. These activities will
introduce students to scientific thinking, the college environment, and
expectations. The university will evaluate the effects of these strategies on
retention, graduation, and the success of the scholars post-graduation.
