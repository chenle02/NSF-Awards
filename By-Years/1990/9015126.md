This action is for support of the Second International Conference on Recent
Advances in Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering and Soil Dynamics, to be held in
St. Louis, Missouri, March 11-15, 1991. The first conference was held April
26-May 2, 1981. During the intervening 10 years, impressive advances have taken
place in geotechnical earthquake engineering, and major earthquakes have
occurred around the world (such as the 1985 earthquakes in Chile and Mexico);
and the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989 highlighted the destruction that can
occur in a major metropolis as a result of a moderate earthquake. This
conference is co-sponsored by eleven major and international organizations with
a strong interest in geotechnical earthquake engineering. The themes for the
conference cover all aspects of the subject, from structures on land to offshore
structures (especially those used in oil exploration); the safety of dams,
retaining walls, hazardous waste and sanitary landfills; the performance of
building foundations; the use of geotextiles for earthquake hazard mitigation;
the performance of lifelines; landslides and the stability of slopes. Thirteen
internationally recognized speakers will present state-of-the-art presentations
and many members of the Steering Committee and the Organizing Committee are
internationally recognized earthquake engineers. A special session addresses
lessons learned from the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. The proceedings from this
conference will present the state of the art in geotechnical earthquake
engineering and will contribute to research and implementation of earthquake
hazard mitigation. This conference will be an important early contribution to
the International Decade of Natural Disaster Reduction (1990 - 2000).
