A nineteen-node parallel processor will be provided in the Department of
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. This equipment is provided under
the Instrumentation Grants for Research in Computer and Information Science and
Engineering program. The research for which the equipment is to be used will be
in the areas of, 1) development of parallel iterative solution techniques for
those linear systems that exploit massively parallel systems, 2) Algorithms for
massively parallel processors capable of reliable simulation multiphase flow, 3)
The distributed ray tracing process to make use of massive parallelism, 4)
Parallel algorithms for the approximate solution of highly structured linear
systems, and 5) A software tool for the parallelization of dynamic programming
algorithms.
