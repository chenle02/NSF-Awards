PI: Jenson IBN: 9634409 The development of mathematical and numerical models
plays a vital role in summarizing, interpreting and disseminating neuroscience
data for the form and function of the nervous system. These modeling efforts
attempt to describe neurophysiological processes at every level of description
from the conformational changes of single ion-channel proteins, to the
electrical properties of the dendrites and axons of single neurons, to the data
processing of large-scale neural networks. Two key features of these various
levels of description are that these processes are dynamic and the interaction
within and between levels is nonlinear due to a wide variety of feedback
mechanisms. Recent mathematical and numerical methods for analyzing such
nonlinear dynamical systems offers great promise for studying the models for
these neurophysiological processes- not only to provide new ways to organize and
understand experimental data in the neurosciences but most importantly to
suggest new ways of looking at complex phenomena and to suggest new experiments.
To this end the purpose of this proposal is to develop and strengthen a research
collaboration that integrates the new theoretical and numerical tools of
nonlinear dynamical systems with state of the art experimental measurments of
neurophysiological processes. The proposed collaboration combines the talents
and resources of a theoretical physicist with specific expertise in nonlinear
dynamics, Prof. R.V. Jensen at Wesleyan University, with an outstanding group of
neuroscientists headed by Prof. G.M. Shepherd at Yale University.
