This is an award to support research on the occurrence of chelating agents in
surface waters and the role they play in determining the quality of natural
surface waters. The investigator plans to obtain direct experimental data on the
role played by phytochelatins, newly discovered, water soluble, metal
sequestering compounds, naturally occurring in phytoplankton that may provide
the dominant source of strong chelating agents in natural waters that in turn
influence water quality. Following development and application of the analytical
techniques, the project will involve field studies of sources and sinks of
chelating agents, and systematic determination of their thermodynamic and
kinetic properties. Results of this project are expected to provide a basis for
determining the role of natural chelating agents in affecting the fate and
biological effects of trace metals such as copper, zinc and cadmium in natural
waters. Knowledge of this may have a significant effect on engineering design
and location of wastewater treatment facilities to minimize their undesirable
impact on water quality such as initiation of algal blooms.
