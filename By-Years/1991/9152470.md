Gustavus Adolphus College is enhancing the genetics program within the biology
department's curriculum by including current nucleic acid and protein analyses.
Recombinant DNA techniques have revolutionized the discipline of genetics, and
the College has made a major commitment to teach these methodologies to the
scientists it prepares. At the advanced level, DNA sequencing and sequence
analysis will be taught in Molecular Genetics, as well as other methods of gene
analysis. Bacterial transformation, plasmid isolation, and DNA restriction
analysis by electrophoresis will be taught in Genetics, a required course for
majors. In addition, DNA isolation and electrophoretic techniques will be
included at the introductory level in General Biology. Funds are sought from NSF
to aid in the acquisition of DNA sequencing units, power supplies, gel
electrophoresis units, and other support equipment that will allow students the
opportunity to practice these methodologies.
