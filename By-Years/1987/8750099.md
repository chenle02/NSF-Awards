Under this project, Carleton College will develop a computer graphics laboratory
using a MicroVAX II computer, a high resolution display and five low resolution
terminals. The laboratory will support both computer graphics courses and
independent student study in this emerging area. Two student research projects
are contemplated. One is to produce three dimensional images from two
dimensional representing cross-sectional slices of biological specimens. The
other is to produce three- dimensional, animated sequences. Emphasis in the
courses and laboratory will be on the mathematics, physics, and computer science
theories that form the basis of modern computer graphics.
