EIA-0103645&lt;br/&gt;Laxmikant V. Kale&lt;br/&gt;University of
Illinois&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Performance Modeling and Programming Environments
for PetaFlop Computers and the Blue Gene Machine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
objective of the proposal is to develop performance simulation capabilities to
allow system level analysis and prediction of performance of the next generation
complex PetaFlop machines that include multiple levels of memory hierarchy and
interconnects. The performance simulator that will be developed will be used to
test parallel data structures and algorithms implemented in programming
environments used in these machines, as well as frameworks to enable the
development of applications for these machine classes. A number of important
applications will be used to test and validate the CS technology
advances.&lt;br/&gt;
