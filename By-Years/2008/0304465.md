This Nanotechnology in Undergraduate Education (NUE) award, funded by the
Division of Materials Research, supports Dr. Wayne Jones and Dr. M. Stanley
Whittingham in Chemistry and Materials Science at the State University of New
York at Binghamton to lead an interdisciplinary effort in Chemistry, Biology,
Physics, and Materials Science and Engineering and create a series of on-line
modules describing concepts and techniques related to nanotechnology. These
course materials are introduced in a number of existing undergraduate courses in
order to integrate nanotechnology concepts into the core discipline.

Advanced instrumentation is available to provide remote Internet access to
characterization on the nanometer length scale for undergraduate students both
on campus and across the country using Internet 2. The project includes a
capstone experience for students interested in exploring nanotechnology in more
depth. This two-credit University-wide course brings together students in their
senior year to explore in more detail the science underlying nanotechnology.
