Varieties are geometric objects as common solutions of multivariable polynomial
equations. Varieties can vary by changing the coefficients of polynomials, and
it is an important question on when their geometric shapes will remain in a nice
way. When the varieties are positively curved called Fano varieties, a natural
approach is to look at those with Einstein structures, a notion originated from
general relativity. The Einstein structures are deeply related to K-stability, a
stability theory in algebraic geometry. The PI will study Fano varieties with
Einstein structures, and how they degenerate and develop singularities. The
problems are foundational and have deep connections among different areas of
mathematics, such as algebraic geometry, differential geometry, commutative
algebra, and mathematical physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will investigate
K-stability of Fano varieties, their moduli spaces, and geometry of
singularities. The PI aims to show that moduli spaces of K-polystable Fano
varieties are compact, which is related to finding a Harder-Narasimhan
filtration on K-unstable Fano varieties. The PI will study explicit moduli
spaces of log Fano pairs and their wall crossings, and estabilish connections to
moduli spaces of curves and K3 surfaces. The PI will study distribution of local
volumes of Kawamata log terminal singularities, where he aims to show that 0 is
the only accumulation point. The proposed projects above will use classical
techniques from the Minimal Model Program and Geometric Invariant Theory, as
well as new tools from algebraic theory of K-stability, K-moduli spaces, and
normalized volumes developed by the PI and
collaborators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
