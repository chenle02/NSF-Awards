This research investigates the relation of pricing policies for international
telecommunications services to U.S. competitiveness, capacity utilization, and
technological development of telecommunications facilities. The research is
empirical, but is based on theoretical modeling of international trade,
econometric analysis and case studies. The study uses pooled time-series and
cross-section data for prices, international traffic, and other variables to
examine (a) the demand for telecommunications services by country of origin in
the U.S. and 17 Western European countries, (b) the determinants of current
pricing policy, (c) determinants of the division of revenues between U.S.
carriers and foreign carriers, (d) the effects of alternative pricing structures
on economic efficiency and on the distribution of gains and costs to users, and
(e) the effects of pricing and revenue sharing arrangements on future net dollar
outflows (in 1985 over $900 million were paid by U.S. carriers in net
settlements with worldwide foreign counterparts). The research is significant
and timely in that it examines a number of issues that will affect information
technology development and use. The research results will provide a foundation
on which important policy decisions can be based.
