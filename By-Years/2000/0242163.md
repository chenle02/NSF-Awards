The PIs will construct and apply a relatively complex numerical model for the
formation and dissociation of gas hydrate in marine sediments. Utility of the
model will include: understanding several geological observations, such as
anomalous freshening below the BSR; BSR offsets across faults; and assessing
potential expectations of a perturbed gas hydrate system, such as methane
release and crack propagation The PIs will modify earlier models by including a
number of new factors, such as, latent heat and salinity, and incorporating
feedbacks among gas hydrate dissociation and changes in pressure, temperature
and salinity. They will also attempt to test their models against empirical
observations of the gas hydrate system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
