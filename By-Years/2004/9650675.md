Supercritical fluids are gaining increasing importance as chromatographic
mobile phases and extraction solvent systems. In response to the expanding use
of supercritical fluids, the incorporation of the extensive study of
supercritical fluids in the chemistry laboratory curriculum is an important and
novel aspect of this project. So that the potential of this study of
supercritical fluids can be fully realized, students are given training on
equipment that is ubiquitous in industrial, governmental, and academic
laboratories, a supercritical fluid extractor is being connected on-line with a
gas chromatograph-mass selective detector. Another goal of this project is to
improve upon the scientific reasoning skills of science graduates by
administering five labs beyond general chemistry that utilize the discovery
approach. Unlike traditional verification laboratories, the discovery approach
requires that students devise hypotheses, formulate predictions, design
experiments, and reach conclusions, thereby participating fully in the
scientific method. Additionally, environmental samples (air, water, and soil)
can be analyzed such that the full utility of the equipment is demonstrated. The
environmental samples give the students experience with complex, real-world
samples, experience that is not gained with the more traditional `unknown`
samples that are typically analyzed in undergraduate laboratories. This project
influences chemical education by introducing the developed laboratories at the
regional and national level by way of publications and presentations. Primarily,
the target audiences are chemistry, biology, environmental science, and natural
science (with and without certification in education) majors. Also, public
school teachers can benefit from the project through collaboration with the
regional office of Project Discovery (housed on campus), and general chemistry
students can benefit from the project by receiving an introduction to this
equipment.
