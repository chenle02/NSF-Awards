This project in Organic Chemmistry will significantly contribute to our
understanding of the relationship that exists between the chemical composition
and structure of a cell and the function of cell surfaces. Insights into the
molecular basis of cell-cell recognition using will be gained through use of
supported planar lipid films (SPLF's) as cell surface probes. This research
focuses on the preparation of a new class of supported planar lipid films
(SPLF's), based on the spontaneous assembly of sulfur-bearing phospholipids on
gold. Resulting surfaces are intended to provide an opportunity for studying
surface structure-bioactivity relationships that would be difficult or
impossible to examine using conventional SPLF's. Immediate chemical objectives
of this program include: (1) defining the compactness, uniformity and
orientation of a series of thiol- bearing phospholipid monolayers on planar gold
surfaces, (2) exploring the feasibility of polymerizing adsorbed thiol- and
disulfide-based phospholipids on gold, (3) preparing polymeric phospholipid
monolayers on gold from preformed lipid polymers and (4) defining the stability
of each of the above phospholipid monolayers with regard to lateral migration,
and displacement by thiol-containing agents and organic solvents.
