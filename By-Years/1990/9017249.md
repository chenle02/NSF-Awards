The Texas A&amp;M University program plans to fund eight GEE Scholars yearly in
such engineering Ph.D. programs as aerospace, chemical, civil, computer science,
electrical, industrial, interdisciplinary, mechanical, nuclear, ocean, and
petroleum. A Program Development Officer will be assigned to the GEE program to
arrange industry support that will allow the program to be institutionalized
within the College and funded entirely from an A&amp;M/industry partnership by
the end of the grant period.
