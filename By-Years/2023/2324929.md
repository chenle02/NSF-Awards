This award provides support for participants of the "Women in Commutative
Algebra II‚Äù (WICA II) workshop to be held at CIRM (Centro Internazionale per la
Ricerca Matematica) in Trento, Italy, on October 16-20, 2023. Commutative
algebra is an extremely vibrant field of mathematical research, with fundamental
connections to many other disciplines, and has an influential female
mathematician, Emmy Noether, as one of its founders. The workshop will feature
research on seven different topics within commutative algebra, with fourteen
group co-leaders suggesting problems of study and guiding the lines of inquiry.
WICA II will expand the research portfolio and collaborative networks of the
approximately forty-two participants in attendance. This workshop will create
leadership opportunities and provide mentorship for early-career mathematicians,
while also making a positive impact on those who are geographically isolated at
their home institutions.

The topics to be investigated at this conference include Lefschetz properties of
graded algebras, tensor decompositions, Waldschmidt constants and resurgence,
Rees algebras of determinantal ideals, probabilistic models in commutative
algebra, commutative algebra aspects of Schubert Calculus, and free resolutions.
These are themes of current interest in the field and the workshops will advance
commutative algebra by making scientific advances on each of these topics. More
information can be found at the workshop website

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
