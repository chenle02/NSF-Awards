EIA- 0326582&lt;br/&gt;Brewer, Eric&lt;br/&gt;University of California-
Berkeley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: ITR: A Scalable Enabling IT Infrastructure
for Developing Countries&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; We propose to initiate a program,
ICT4B (Information and Communication Technology for Billions), aimed at making
the benefits of ICT available and useful for all areas of the world. Our
interdisciplinary team will focus on developing a hardware/software
infrastructure explicitly designed for the physical, political and economic
realities of developing areas.&lt;br/&gt; The transformative potential of ICT
creates new kinds of opportunities to gain leverage on development problems that
have been intransigent. The potential lies within the tools that ICT provides to
all economic and political sectors. These tools can affect every activity in
which organization, can be achieved across a wide range of industries and public
enterprises. Most important, they drive economies in the broadest sense of that
term. Using ICT to challenge suboptimal institutions and particularly corrupt
and inefficient "markets" provides a rare chance to fashion new, socially
beneficial equilibria that contribute to the broader development goals of
countries and goals.
