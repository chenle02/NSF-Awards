The principal investigator will continue a program to investigate the
fundamental physicochemical properties of rock-forming minerals and mineral
assemblages. He will measure free energies and enthalpies of formation of end-
member silicates, free energies and enthalpies of mixing in solid solution
series, mutual stabilities of important rock-forming mineral assemblages, and
stabilities with respect to melting (especially under mixed volatile atmosphere,
vapor-undersaturated conditions). Methods to be utilized include oxide melt
solution calorimetry, displacement of experimentally determined phase
equilibria, determination of cation-exchange equilibria, and both aqueous and
other solubility measurements. This research should add significantly to the
data base for important rock-forming minerals, both in thermodynamic and phase
equilibrium terms, and lead to a better understanding of both mineral-mineral
and mineral-liquid equilibria. These data are critical to geologists who use
minerals and mineral assemblages to determine the conditions within the earth
under which certain rocks form.
