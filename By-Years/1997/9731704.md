The investigators continue studying ionospheric electrodynamics from equatorial
to midlatitudes using incoherent scatter radar and Fabry-Perot interferometer
measurements, as well as global convection, thermospheric, and ionospheric
numerical models. They attempt to understand electrodynamic and neutral
atmospheric transport processes, test global convection and ionospheric
circulation models, and develop global predictive storm-time dependent self-
consistent ionospheric electric field and thermospheric neutral wind models. The
project consists of two components: (1) studying storm-time dependent response
of ionospheric and thermospheric transport processes using extensive incoherent
scatter radar observations and nighttime Fabry-Perot interferometer data, and
(2) studying the variability of electrodynamic processes using new radar and
Fabry-Perot data with largely enhanced data taking and analysis techniques.
