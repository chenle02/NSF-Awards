This is the first year of funding of a 4-year continuing award. The PI will
focus on the development of a biologically plausible framework for sensor-based
machine olfaction (SBMO), with an emphasis on computation, analysis and
instrumentation. The specific objectives are: (1) To develop a computational
architecture based on neuro-morphic models of the biological olfactory system in
order to improve the signal-processing and cognitive capabilities of SBMO; (2)
To validate the perceptual plausibility ofthe computational architecture through
comparative studies with the "gold standard" for olfactory perception - human-
panel sensory analysis; (3) To develop advanced sensor interrogation techniques
in order to improve selectivity, sensitivity and robustness of commercial
conductivity-based gas sensor arrays. The results will lay the foundations fora
new generation of SBMO systems by helping bridge the gap between multivariate
chemical sensing and human olfactory perception. Improved analytical
capabilities, as a result of advances in both signal processing and sensor
instrumentation, will broaden the range of applications for SBM0.&lt;br/&gt;
