This is mathematical research in pursuit of two famous open problems having to
do with pure states on operator algebras. The term state comes from quantum
mechanics. In some formulations thereof, observables are represented by
selfadjoint operators in an appropriate algebra of operators, and states are
certain linear functionals on the operator algebra; thus, specifying a state
assigns a numerical value to each of the observables. The pure states are those
not given as convex combinations of other states. In principal, they determine
everything about the algebra, but pinning down the connection more precisely has
led to daunting difficulties. One of the problems the present project will
address is that of extending the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, which may be thought
of as a result about commutative operator algebras, to the general,
noncommutative situation. The other problem is to show the uniqueness of pure
state extensions from maximal diagonal subalgebras of the algebra of all bounded
operators on a Hilbert space.
