9314480 Rossby An experimental study of Lagrangian potential Vorticity will be
conducted in the Gulf Stream for two distinct cases: One, for particles in the
center of the Stream, to evaluate quantitatively the hypothesis of a "frozen"
velocity structure and, two for particles that are entrained and expelled at the
northern edge of the Stream to study the conservation of potential vorticity.
Two cruises to the Gulf Stream in late summer and in late winter will take
place. During these cruises floats will be launched and CTD and ADCP sections
will be obtained.
