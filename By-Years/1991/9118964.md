This project is an investigation of the factors that influence the insertion of
membrane proteins into membranes. Three areas of interest are being pursued.
First, the alkaline phosphatase (AP) fusion technique is being applied to
determine the topology of the E. coli MalG protein. The topology of a membrane
protein is a description specifying which parts are on which side of the
membrane and which parts lie within the membrane. The AP protein fusion method
for studying topology is based of the inactivity of cytoplasmically localized
AP. Since AP behaves as if it were part of the membrane protein in fusions, its
activity indicates which side of the membrane it is on. Second, a further
analysis of cytoplasmic localization signals in the E. coli integral membrane
protein, MalF, is being carried out. Third a preliminary study designed to
determine whether or not there is a cellular machinery that inserts membrane
proteins into membranes and determines their orientation will be initiated.
