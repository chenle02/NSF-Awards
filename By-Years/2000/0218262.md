University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Decision-Making Deoxyribozyme
Networks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, silicomimetic networks of enzymes
are being developed. These networks will reproduce the functionality of
individual silicon devices to perform Boolean algebra functions with analytical
inputs and decision outputs and they represent first artificial autonomous
decision-making sets of molecules with potential for incorporation into drug
delivery or analytical systems. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The computation
components of these networks (i.e. "circuits") are being made modularly from
deoxyribozyme-based logic gates (YESA, NOTA, AANDB, YESANOTB), which have
oligonucleotides as inputs and outputs. Communication between individual
molecular gates is being developed through connections in which an output
oligonucleotide, formed or degraded by a catalytic action of an upstream gate,
is an input allosteric effector of a downstream gate. This type of communication
allows serial connection or tiling of individual elements. Computer program is
being developed, which would aid in the construction of any decision-making tree
from custom-made materials and then coupled to deoxyribozyme-based sensor
arrays. For example, one analytical network under construction senses the
presence of an oligonucleotide, a small molecule and a protein, and makes a
decision to release or not a fluorescent signal. &lt;br/&gt;
