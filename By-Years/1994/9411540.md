9411540 Lewontin A basic assumption of biology is that there are trade-offs
between the three competing demands of growth, reproduction, and survival.
Resources diverted from reproduction are predicted to increase growth and/or
survivorship, such that there is some "cost" to maintaining the reproductive
system, This research tests that prediction by measuring the variety and
severity of pathological lesions in aged animals. Reproduction will be
suppressed experimentally in house mice. Reallocation of resources to growth and
survivorship will be evaluated over the entire life span, by monitoring growth
and by utilizing a number of behavioral, biochemical, and pathological measures.
