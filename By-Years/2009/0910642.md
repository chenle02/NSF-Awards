Maize is an important biological research system with a long and rich history.
Over the past century, an active research community has grown up around the
available extensive genetic tools and diverse germplasm. In this time, maize has
become a leading system for addressing fundamental questions in genetics such as
the impact of domestication on genome structure, the molecular basis of
heterosis (hybrid vigor), and role of transposons in genome evolution. Research
on maize has led to major advances in our understanding of fundamental life
processes in plants such as reproduction, seed formation, germination,
photosynthesis, and biosynthesis of primary metabolites including amino acids,
carbohydrates and fatty acids. A genome sequence is a logical next step to
enable the best use of maize as an experimental system and in order to translate
research advances into improved crops. A draft sequence of the maize genome was
generated, funded as part of the Maize Genome Sequencing Project: An
NSF/DOE/USDA Joint Program, and released in February 2008. This project seeks to
provide additional analysis and annotation information and provide the research
community with a continuous, annotated reference genome sequence for maize. The
specific aims of the project are to: 1) sequence and finish 500 fosmid clones;
2) produce an eight-fold (8X) whole genome shotgun sequence using a 454
platform; and 2) increase the scope of the genome assembly, analysis and
annotation.

The early impact of the current version of the maize genome sequence has been
considerable. This project will provide the additional information and
annotation to the reference sequence that will enable continued use of maize as
an experimental system for advancing fundamental biology as well as the
development of new and improved maize varieties in the public and private
sector. Project information and data will be available through a web site
accessible through the Washington University Genome Sequencing Center
(http://www.genome.wustl.edu). Maize sequence assemblies and maize genetic
resources will be incorporated into Gramene (http://www.gramene.org) and
MaizeGDB (http://www.maizegdb.org).
