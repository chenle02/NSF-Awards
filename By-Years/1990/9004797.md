This award provides one-third of the funding needed to acquire a thermal
ionization mass spectrometer that will be installed and operated in the
Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Washington University in St.
Louis. Washington University is committed to providing the remaining funds
needed. Acquisition of a mass spectrometer will allow terrestrial isotopic and
geochronological studies to be conducted by the Principal Investigator and
colleagues in the Earth and Planetary Sciences Department. Primary applications
will be (1) uranium- lead zircon dating and neodymium and lead isotopic studies
of orogenic belts such as the Archean Slave Province, the Proterozoic Wopmay
Orogen, and the Proterozoic of the southwestern U.S., (2) Isotopic studies of
continental rift magmatism in Baikal(USSR) and Rio Grande (US) rifts.
