9725627 Roberts The recent simulations of the geodynamo by Kuang and Bloxham,
and earlier by Glatzmaier and the P.I., Roberts, have been in good agreement
with the observed characteristics of the observed geomagnetic field, including
polarity reversals. They have also provided new targets, as with the prediction
by Glatzmaier and Roberts that the inner core should rotate eastwards relative
to the mantle, which was subsequently supported by two independent seismological
investigations. In this grant, the PI and collaborator Glatzmaier plan to add
further realism to the model by reducing viscous diffusion and by including core
turbulence, and to improve the numerical resolution and accuracy of the
computational techniques. They shall also investigate the geodynamo in past
geological epochs, and extend their studies to dynamos operating in Jupiter's
Galilean satellites. ***
