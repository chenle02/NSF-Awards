Lindle The Advanced Light Source (ALS) is a third-generation synchrotron-
radiation facility that offers unprecedented opportunities for research in
atomic and molecular science. The new source will produce tunable radiation of
high intensity and uniquely high brightness in a continuous wavelength range
from the ultraviolet to hard x-rays. This proposal is for construction of an end
station on an ALS beamline specifically designed for x-ray spectroscopy research
on free atoms and molecules. The proposal is presented by a research team of 16
investigators from 12 universities and 4 national laboratories, who plan to use
x- rays in a diverse program of fundamental investigations of chemical and
physical phenomena that are of primary importance to the understanding of core-
level processes in atoms and molecules.
