9317810 Gruenhage A joint conference on topology and dynamical systems will be
held at Auburn University on March 24-27, 1994. This is one of a series of
annual conferences dating back to 1967 (for the topology part), and well over
200 mathematicians are expected to attend. There will be seven major one-hour
addresses and about twenty invited half-hour talks. There will be additional
sessions of fifteen-minute talks, and students will be encouraged to
participate. Those giving major addresses will include John L. Bryant (Florida
State), Robert D. Edwards (U.C.L.A.), Charles L. Hagopian (Cal State at
Sacramento), Greg Swiatek (SUNY at Stony Brook and Princeton), Stevo Todorcevic
(U of Toronto), and Jeff Xia (Georgia Tech). ***
