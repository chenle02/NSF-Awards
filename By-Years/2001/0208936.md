The project aims at developing an evaluation methodology for content-based
&lt;br/&gt;image retrieval. The research involves: (1) Measurement of the
complexity of &lt;br/&gt;image testbeds which can be used to quantitatively
determine the degree of &lt;br/&gt;difficulty in retrieving images from the
image testbeds, and (2) Comparison &lt;br/&gt;of the performance of different
retrieval approaches which can quantitatively &lt;br/&gt;give an objective
ranking of the performance of the retrieval approaches. &lt;br/&gt;The project
designs a general framework of image feature representations &lt;br/&gt;which
can be used as a vehicle to conduct statistical analysis on images and
&lt;br/&gt;forms a basis for establishing the evaluation methodology. Using this
framework,&lt;br/&gt;the evaluation method can measure the complexity of the
image databases by &lt;br/&gt;their cross entropy and rank the retrieval
approaches by their cross entropy &lt;br/&gt;with respect to a particular
testbed. The image testbeds can thus be compared &lt;br/&gt;with each other on
their complexity in supporting image querying. Furthermore, &lt;br/&gt;the
retrieval techniques can be compared with each other without using queries
&lt;br/&gt;so the human subjectivity is avoided. The algorithms developed in
this project &lt;br/&gt;will be a valuable asset for the community to eventually
establish a general &lt;br/&gt;theory of the evaluation methodology for content-
based image retrieval research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
