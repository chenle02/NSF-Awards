Dr. Doeleman and his group will develop new software that links currently
operating millimeter and sub-millimeter telescope arrays together to form a
single 'telescope' operating at 230GHz or 1.3mm. Using Very Long Baseline
Interferometry, this set of arrays will be used to observe the Galactic center
with 20 micro-arcsecond resolution, corresponding to only one-fifth of the
Earth's distance from the Sun. Dr. Doeleman's group will probe the region around
the central black hole, which has roughly 4 million times the Sun's mass, to
within a few times its Schwarzschild radius. They will measure the rapid motions
of orbiting gas, and search for signatures of blobs of material as they are
swallowed the black hole. The group will also map in great detail the bright jet
of radio-emitting material produced by the black hole, testing theoretical
models for its production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Very Long Baseline
Interferometery is a fundamental technique, and the software developed for this
problem is potentially transformative, opening up previously impossible
observations at extraordinary resolution. The proposal addresses fundamental
questions of the physics around black holes, which lies at the intersection of
astronomy and physics. Postdoctoral researchers and graduate students will be
trained as they participate in both technical and scientific aspects of the
research. Undergraduate students in the Haystack Observatory's summer Research
Experience for Undergraduates program, and K-12 science teachers in the Research
Experience for Teachers program, will also have the opportunity to learn from
the project.
