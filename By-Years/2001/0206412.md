Students in grades 6-9 will be recruited to participate in the "Corps of
Rediscovery," conducted by the Portland State University in partnership with the
Oregon Historical Society, the Center for Columbia River History, the Metro
Regional Greenspaces &amp; US Forest Service and the Jackson Bottom Wetland
Preserve. Students will gain a cultural, historical and ecological understanding
of the impact of the settlement of the lower Columbia River, beginning with the
time of the Lewis and Clark expedition. Students will study the environment
using past and current techniques and technologies. Activities include studies
of plant and animal species, navigation and mapping using GPS, in addition to
land use practices. It is anticipated that up to 72 students will participate in
years 1-2 of the project meeting bi-weekly after school, supplemented by a
monthly field day and a summer institute. During the final year of the project,
Leadership Teams will be formed with a subset of 24 students who participate in
advanced ecological studies and site planning while developing products for use
in dissemination. A CD ROM showcasing student products and a website will be
produced, as well as student posters and mapping data.
