Influence of cell-cell signaling on microbial colonization of alternate hosts

Vector-transmitted microbes cause many diseases that threaten human health and
agricultural production. Vector transmitted microbes have complex but poorly
understood density dependent cell-cell communication signals that alter trait
expression to increase survival in different environments and to switch between
hosts. To address this shortcoming, this project investigates the production of
cell-cell communication signals by Xylella fastidiosa, an obligately insect
transmitted plant pathogen, in response to host-specific chemical cues from
plants and insects, and characterizes induced changes in microbial phenotype and
consequences for insect vector and host plant colonization. X. fastidiosa has a
reduced genome (~2.5Mb) and is only known to persist in plant xylem and
leafhopper vector foregut, two environments composed of polysaccharides that are
replicable in the lab. These factors make this natural system an ideal model for
understanding regulation of complex microbial traits in alternate hosts and how
these relate to transmission dynamics and broader disease epidemiology.

Training objectives are to learn experimental methods for characterizing induced
microbial phenotypes and computational methods to describe the underlying
transcriptional changes. The project aims to increase participation in biology
in the affected agricultural community, on the UC Berkeley campus, and with K-12
students at local schools. Locally, on-farm presentations will focus on
biological factors mediating pathogen transmission and how to minimize the
amount of conventional pesticides used. Undergraduate researchers will be
recruited through the Cal Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) program and
trained in methods in microbiology, insect biology, and genomics. Curricula will
be developed and presented at local schools focused on evaluating microbial
biology issues in health and agriculture. The results generated from this
project will be summarized in accessible language on the Xylella fastidiosa
website (http://www.cnr.berkeley.edu/xylella/) which is freely accessible to the
public.
