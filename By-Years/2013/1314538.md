This project will develop foundational principles for hierarchical wireless
network design by leveraging full-duplex transmissions in both access and
wireless backhaul. Full-duplex is most promising at shorter ranges, and hence is
fortuitously aligned with the predicted dominant access range in future
networks. Furthermore, larger full-duplex ranges are feasible in infrastructure-
to-infrastructure links, and hence are well suited for backhaul links. While
full-duplex is well-aligned with the key elements of hierarchical networks, our
current design principles are largely developed for half-duplex transmissions
which is the basis for all current networks. With that in mind, this project
will address both theory and protocols for hierarchical full-duplex networks by
looking at: (1) data-driven signal models for self-interference caused by the
node's own transmission to its own receiver, (2) theoretical foundations for
scheduling and routing that leverage both self-interference and multi-hop
interference cancellation; and (3) protocols and prototypes for network scale
full-duplex resource management.

Full-duplex breaks one of the basic design constraints in current wireless
networks, all of which are either half-duplex in time or frequency; it will
therefore rewrite wireless networking fundamentals. Further, with emphasis on
realizable networks using extensive Rice University's programmable testbeds, the
project will impact the next-generation of wireless networks via its corporate
partners. Finally, the project team will establish a unique inter-university
education and research program, which will include joint advising and
collaborative advising and leverage the team's complementary expertise.
