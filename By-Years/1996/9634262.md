9634262 Benner In this project, the development and testing of a diffusion
denuder sulfur chemiluminescence detector (D/SCD) for sub-part-per-billion
levels of sulfur dioxide in ambient air will be continued. The performance of
this technique will be tested in a double-blind intercomparison at the South
Dakota School of Mines and Technology. During a previous double-blind evaluation
of this technique, problems were encountered with measuring sulfur dioxide at
part-per-trillion levels, and a second evaluation was recommended by the Gaseous
Sulfur Intercomparison Study (GASIE) planning committee. Interference issues
have been identified and will be remedied. ***
