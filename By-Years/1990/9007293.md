Dr. Thomas Givnish and Kenneth Systma at the University of Wisconsin, Madison
are researching evolutionary relationships in Brocchinia and other genera of the
most primitive subfamily of the pineapple family (Bromeliaceae). Additional
monocot families (lilies, orchids, grasses, etc.) will be surveyed for a unique
genetic marker discovered in bromeliads, in order to determine levels of
phylogenetic relatedness within the monocotyledon plants. Brocchinia is of
interest because it lies close to the base of the pineapple family, is
transitional between the most primitive and most advanced subfamilies, is native
to the most ancient part of South America, and has evolved a remarkable range of
mechanisms for capturing nutrients, including carnivory, nitrogen fixation, and
feeding by ants. Data for the phylogenetic study will be derived by directly
sequencing chloroplast genes. Goals of the research are to develop an
understanding of how various groups of bromeliads evolved, how patterns of
shared ancestry relate to their current distribution in specific regions of
North and South America, and how they have adapted to conditions of extreme soil
infertility and/or aridity.
