There are several components of the scientific process that are difficult to
convey in the classroom. These include experimental design, testing of
hypotheses, analysis and interpretation of data and the excitement of discovery.
The department is preparing a model semester-long laboratory program in
developmental biology which incorporates these components and in addition
fulfills four specific teaching goals. That is, 1) to "demystify" science by
allowing students to use state of the art technologies 2) to provide an
opportunity for real discovery by addressing an actual research question 3) to
illustrate the interdisciplinary nature of science by using a variety of
techniques to answer specific questions and 4) to learn to communicate ideas and
to think critically by organizing results in a final research paper. The
department is requesting equipment to complete four workstations for
investigation of cellular structure and function in neurons of leech ganglia by
dye iontophoresis, immunocytochemical localization of neurotransmittors and
electrophysiological characterization of neurons. Included in these workstations
are dissecting stereomicroscopes, micromanipulators, audio speakers,
oscilloscopes and MacLab A/D - D/A hardware and software for data collection on
Mac SE computers. Other pieces of the workstations are presently on hand - DC
amplifiers, air tables and computers. The pieces of equipment also are for use
by several other courses in the biology curriculum and will enhance the
potential experiments possible for student independent research projects, honors
research, and suffer research opportunities which include students from other
institutions. This proposal will significantly enhance the advanced training of
more than 100 young women scientists per year, many of whom can be expected to
continue study at the graduate level.
