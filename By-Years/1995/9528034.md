9528034 Narsimhan This conference will provide forum to help determine future
research directions for the field of food process engineering. Many important
technological advances are occurring in the biophysical understanding of foods.
This conference will help to consider these advances by combining engineering
fundamentals with the basic principles of food science. This will be
accomplished by inviting leading researchers in different areas, including both
industry and academia. The program includes sessions on: (1) the physical
chemistry of foods, covering the topics of emulsions and foams, protein
adsorption, physical/chemical properties, and moisture relations in foods; (2)
transport processes and unit operations, covering the topics of rheology,
frying/dehydration, extrusion, thermal and non- thermal processing, and
separations/packaging; and (3) innovative food manufacturing processes, covering
the topics of pilot plants and scale-up, research in food engineering,
innovative concepts in food processing and manufacturing processes, and
engineering issues in food manufacture. Participation at this conference will be
international and will include food engineers, food scientists, chemical and
biochemical engineers, food chemists, and food microbiologists. ***
