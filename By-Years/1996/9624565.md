The purpose of this research is to analyze the dynamics of competition in the
hard disk industry using a structural model of differentiated demand for the
industry and detailed product-level data on price, quantity, and product
characteristics. The model will be used to estimate cross price elasticities
between products and markups over marginal cost. The marginal cost estimates
will then be used to observe the rate of decline of monopoly markups. This will
allow the investigators to see whether declining prices due to increased
productivity is due to learning by doing or reduced markups due to competition.
The cross price elasticities will be used to analyze "spillovers": the effects
on each firm's productivity of R&D activity by other firms. By putting all these
estimates together the investigators can compare the social rate of return with
the private rate of return to R&D.
