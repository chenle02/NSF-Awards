The Iowa State REU gives students research experience by participating in
projects in microelectronics and photonics. These students work along side
students supported by the Department of Education Undergraduate Research
Opportunities for Minorities as well as the NSF Minority Scholars Program, and
the NASA supported Iowa Space Grants Program. Specifically, these students work
on continuing and new projects in a) advanced silicon processing for devices and
integrated circuits, b) high power and high frequency bipolar transistors and
other microwave devices, c) III-V compound quantum nanostructures, d) non-
crystalline silicon structures for energy conversion, and e) basic semiconductor
material studies. A microelectronics fabrication course is offered each summer
of the program.
