This project is organized around six Interventions, each with implementation
strategies targeted at the various administrative and teaching levels.
Superintendents, school board members, and principals will participate in
Leadership Institutes that will enhance the leaders' abilities to support the
resource, policy, and instructional alignments and revisions necessary to
accomplish the reform. Math and science specialists will provide guidance and
technical assistance in the development and implementation of standards-based
programs in math and science, and will assist district personnel to review and
analyze data and other information necessary to gauge progress. They will work
with and through the district and school improvement plans, and will help
develop collaborations with higher education institutions and other reform
projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
