This research project, which treats three specific computational methods in
molecular electronic structure theory, is supported by the NSF Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program. Topic (1) extends Pulay's current Unrestricted
Natural Orbital Complete Active Space method (UNO-CAS) to large molecules (e.g.
molecules with 24 nonhydrogen atoms) and provides a more accurate description of
excited electronic states. Topic (2) effectively includes higher-order
corrections in low-order Generalized Moller Plesset perturbation theory by
relaxing the reference function. Topic (3) employs gauge-invariant atomic
orbitals for ab initio quantum mechanical calculation of NMR properties, and
explores the use of similar techniques in density functional theory. Laboratory
experiments and theoretical predictions, using computer models based on the
quantum mechanical equations of motion of the electrons, today contribute as
equal partners to the understanding of chemical behavior. The evolution of
modern methods for molecular electronic structure computation has had a major
impact on virtually every field of chemistry from the study of small molecules
in the earth's atmosphere to large molecules of biochemical importance. The
development of these mathematical methods and their implementation into large
scale computer programs is the result of hundreds of man years of effort. This
project continues this tradition of developing practical, widely applicable,
theoretical tools. The goal of this project is to improve the speed and accuracy
of molecular electronic structure computations, to extend these to larger
molecules, to treat excited electronic states (important for optical properties
and certain classes of chemical reactions), and to better understand fundamental
relationships between molecular structure and observed nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectra.
