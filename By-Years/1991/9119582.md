This research will explore an approach to the engineering of structural
composite materials with enhanced intrinsic passive damping, and to develop
appropriate modeling techniques and design guidelines. The approach is based on
the use of integrally-shunted piezoceramic rods as reinforcing elements of a
composite material. Because of high electroelastic coupling, straining produces
voltage gradients along the rods. By shunting the electroded rod ends through an
integral resistor, current is allowed to flow and dissipate energy through joule
heating, Very high peak damping loss factors are theoretically attainable even
at low fiber volume fractions (20%) in epoxy.
