9508180 Peacor This grant provides $125,000 as partial support for the
acquisition of a powder diffractometer system and ancillary equipment including
high and low-temperature attachments, a monochromator, a position-sensitive
detector, and controlling hardware and software. This system will be housed in
the X-ray Mineralogy Laboratory of the Department of Geological Sciences. The
university will provide 44% of the total cost of this system. This equipment
will replace an antiquated and presently inadequate powder X-ray diffraction
unit. The present instrument has heretofore served as the only powder
diffractometer servicing the entire Central Campus of the University of
Michigan. In addition to its use in the principal investigator's highly regarded
research in clay mineralogy, the new facility will be available to qualified
students and faculty of other departments including members of the Departments
of Geological Sciences, Chemistry, Physics and the College of Pharmacy and
Dentistry. ***
