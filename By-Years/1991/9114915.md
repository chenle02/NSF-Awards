The conference objective is to gather the proper mix of professionals, chosen
among the leading scientists in the world, who represent various disciplines of
science that combine to form molecular electronics. This gathering will review
the state of those arts from the perspective of molecular electronics. Such a
gathering can provide cross-fertilization of ideas and (if possible) create
actual collaborations. Yet another object of the conference is to publicly
discuss recent scientific advances related to molecular electronics.
