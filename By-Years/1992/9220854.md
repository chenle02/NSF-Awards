This award supports an integrated seismic, sedimentologic, and paleontologic
investigation of glacio-marine stratigraphy of the Ross Sea continental shelf.
The purpose of this work is to acquire seismic images and sediment cores of the
glacial sediments toward a better understanding of the Cenozoic history of
glaciation in the Ross Sea region. This investigation will utilize high
resolution seismic profiling data to locate regions where the Pleistocene
glacial till is thin or perhaps absent. Piston coring at these locations, if the
till is penetrated, will provide sedimentary records of Cenozoic depositional
environments and could provide important clues to fluctuations of the Antarctic
Ice Sheets. The seismic profiling will provide a direct record of the grounding
history of the Ross Ice Shelf during the Pleistocene and it will also allow
first order correlations of Cenozoic sedimentary units that are represented by
sediments recovered in the piston cores. This work will provide important proxy
records of the history of both the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and the East
Antarctic Ice Sheet and this, in turn, will provide important constraints to
climate models.
