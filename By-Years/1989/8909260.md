Sulfur compounds in the atmosphere are known to contribute to acid rain. More
recently, the chemical sulfur cycle has been suggested to influence the
reflectivity of the Earth and, hence, the global climate. A primary step in this
mechanism is the production of dimethylsulfide (DMS) by marine organisms. The
DMS enters the atmosphere and eventually produces particles that may promote
cloud formation. The details of this process are not well understood. A region
where this mechanism is thought to be particularly important is the northern
extremes of the Pacific Ocean. This project initiates an investigation into the
role of biologically produced sulfur in the Gulf of Alaska. Methodologies for
the measurement of non-sea salt sulfate and methanesulfonic acid in marine
aerosols, as well as DMS in air and seawater, are to be developed. The long-term
objectives are to quantify the temporal and spatial distribution and flux of DMS
in the Gulf of Alaska and to determine reaction pathways for DMS.
