Auger electron spectroscopy is probably the most popular method for analysis of
the composition of a solid surface. A modified system has been designed that
promises both better spectral resolution (permitting determination of oxidation
state) and finer spatial resolution than the conventional approach. This system
may also prove less expensive than standard systems when it is fully
implemented. Preliminary results look promising. This grant will enable the
purchase of a specially designed electron energy analyzer and necessaary
electronic components to fully test this new experimental design.
