Moore's work in infinite combinatorics concerns classification and basis
problems for uncountable structures and their connection with cardinal
exponentiation. On one hand, strong axioms such as the Proper Forcing Axiom and
Woodin's Pmax axiom are invoked to build embeddings and morphisms between
structures such as linear orders and topological spaces. Since these strong
axioms themselves imply that the cardinality of the real line is the second
uncountable cardinal, it is natural to ask whether the classification theorems
which follow from them already fix the cardinality of the continuum. The
research supported by this grant aims to prove new classification results from
these strong axioms, to better understand the relationship between these
classification results and the value of the continuum, and to improve our
understanding of the strong axioms themselves.

The oldest results in set theory concern the rigorous development of the "size"
of an infinite set. The cardinal numbers provide a linear scale with which one
can measure the number of elements a set has --- also known as its cardinality.
One of the earliest questions in set theory was Cantor's Continuum Problem:
Determine the cardinality of the real number line. In the 1960s, this problem
was shown to be independent of the usual axioms of mathematics. Still, it is
unclear whether some other compelling mathematical statement, also undecidable,
might settle the Continuum Problem. Moore's research aims to both establish the
independence of new classification results for infinite mathematical structures
and to relate these results to the Continuum Problem.
