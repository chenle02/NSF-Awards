Among the most dramatic effects of global climate change of the next two
centuries may be the increased frequency and/or intensity of fires in temperate
forests. Natural fire regimes are largely unknown, making it difficult to
speculate on the response of fire regimes to rapid climate change. The influence
of fire on forest composition and structure might have important feedback
effects on climate through its effects on the cycling of greenhouse gases. The
last 1000 years provides an example of rapid climate change in eastern North
America that can serve as a basis for understanding the role of fire when
climate changes. Forest transitions may have occurred as a consequence of
changes in the fire regime or changes in the climate. The null hypothesis that
the fire regime has not changed across the ecotone of deciduous and mixed
conifer forest in eastern North America during the last 2500 years will be
tested. A new method of obtaining long-term fire histories will be used in this
research. Individual fires in the stratigraphic record will be determined using
petrographic thin sections of annually laminated (varved) lake sediments to
produce long-term fire frequencies. The method will be applied to a network of
small lakes with varved sediments across our study area. The individual sites
will provide a means for assessing the role of fire for influencing forest
changes in different climatic and vegetation settings. The combined data set
will establish the broad spatial and temporal patterns of fire regimes and
forest composition that attend climate change at a subcontinental scale. Results
will facilitate evaluation of future climate change on natural ecosystems.
