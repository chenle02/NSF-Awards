This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2001. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Molecular characterization of
microbial nitrite reductase genes from a permanently ice covered Antarctic
lake." Lake Bonney is a permanently ice-covered, chemically-stratified Antarctic
lake that is unusual in that denitrification occurs in the deep anoxic waters of
the east but not the west lobe. The goal of this project is to compare the
distribution, diversity, and expression of denitrification genes (nitrite
reductase) from microorganisms in the two lobes in an attempt to explain this
mystery.
