Collaborative Research Proposal Buettner/Cassimeris The aim of this research is
to develop a quantitative framework for characterizing microtubule dynamics and
assessing their contribution to neurite extension and growth cone motility. The
experiments to be done will combine both an experimental and theoretical
approach. Taking advantage of the expertise of Dr. Cassimeris in imaging
fluorescently labelled tubulin in growth cones, the first series of experiments
will generate a time series of video images of the assembly of microtubules from
labelled tubulin and this will be compared with a similar analysis of the
dynamic patterns of microtubule behavior in living growth cones. The theoretical
expertise of Dr. Buettner will then allow for the construction of a quantitative
theoretical model of the contribution of microtubule assembly to neurite growth
and motility. This particular combination of an engineering approach to
modelling with state of the art cell biological experiments will yield
significant insights into our understanding of the relationships between
microtubule dynamics and growth cone mobility during the developement of the
nervous system.
