With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr.
Peter A. Jacobi of the Department of Chemistry at Wesleyan University. The focus
of this research is the development of synthetic methodology involving the
electrocyclic chemistry of cross-conjugated enynones and the use of homochiral
acetylenic acid derivatives as natural products precursors. Professor Jacobi
will focus his work on the synthesis of natural products possesing interesting
biological properties. Targets for preparation include a number of antibiotics,
antifungals and prostanoids.
