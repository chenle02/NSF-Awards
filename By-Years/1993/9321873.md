9321873 Sengupta This is an award to support research on a control method for
improving the stability of anaerobic biological processes used to treat
wastewaters. The method is based on neutralizing the effect that intermediate
biorespiratory products have on the alkalinity of the fluid being treated and
providing for selective removal of heavy metals that have a toxicity effect on
the biological species in the reactor. The porous composite membranes are
suspended in the bioreactor. The membranes consist of entrapped, polymeric ion-
exchange microbeads with covalently attached functional groups having a high
buffer capacity and selectivity for heavy metals. Results of this project are
expected to provide the basis for engineering design of anaerobic biological
reactors that are amenable for treatment of industrial wastewaters characterized
by large fluctuations of organic load, heavy metal content and alkalinity.
Besides improved stability, the operating costs of treatment plants are expected
to be significantly reduced from present levels by elimination of need for
addition of buffer salts and regeneration of the composite membrane.
