A full understanding of the flow and dynamics of an ice sheet will require
knowledge of the state of its subglacial interface. While the topography of the
Greenland Ice Sheet bed has been studied by radio echo sounding, its state in
terms of melting and freezing, which itself affects its future evolution, has
been inferred from numerical models, rather than from direct evidence.

This project is for analysis of existing radar echo data gathered under the
PARCA and CReSIS programs, with the objective of generating direct evidence of
the extent of subglacial water in Greenland and providing the glaciological
community with maps of its extent.

Previous echo analysis has found the variability of the received signal too
great to extract the component due to variation of the bed material. Now, a
method has been developed, validated and reported, based on further analysis of
radio echo signal intensities, which allows the state of the bed to be
determined reliably. This work will apply this method to all the available radio
echo data, to generate maps of the extent of basal melting throughout Greenland.
The procedure relies on a more precise assessment of radio echoes from the bed
of the ice sheet than has previously been provided. It allows the variability of
echo intensity to be reduced, and the variation of the bed material to be
detected. It has been tested with data from a number of flights over Greenland
during the 1999 field season, and is validated by tests of self-consistency, of
echo intensity statistics, of interface smoothness, and of the relation between
measured surface and interface slopes. The team will process data from flights
undertaken between 1998 and 2005. Appropriate tests of self-consistency and
statistical behavior will be applied.

The presence or absence of water will be determined throughout. Results will be
interpreted and maps compiled illustrating these results. The continuity and
topographical context of each major water feature will be investigated and
compared.
