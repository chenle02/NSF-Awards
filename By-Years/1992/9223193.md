The Principal Investigators (PIs) propose to develop solid-phase heterogenous
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). The proposed approach is to use
phospholipid-based vesicles (liposomes) whose outer surfaces have been modified
by the covalent attachment of 100 to 200 enzyme molecules as well as a variable,
but smaller, number of specific analyte or antibody molecules. The potential
signal enhancement that could be achieved by hundreds of attached enzyme
molecules, rather than one or a few, to the analyte or antibody could result in
a reduction of the limit of sensitivity of an ELISA by two orders of magnitude
relative to current technology.
