We propose to develop two new operational modes of x-ray microscopes which will
make use of phase contrast for imaging thick, hydrated biological specimens with
60 nm or better resolution. Compared to current to current x-ray microscopes
which use absorption contrast, phase contrast microscopes offer the promise of
higher intrinsic contrast at certain wavelengths and thus reduced radiation
dose, plus the possibility of improved penetration and depth of field for thick
specimens. A Holographic Phase Contrast X-ray Microscope will be developed which
will use a photoresist detector to record with high spatial resolution the
interference pattern between a reference wave and a wave which has undergone
amplitude and phase changes by passage through the specimen; the complex
specimen wave will be recovered by numerical hologram reconstruction. A
Differential Phase Contrast X-ray Microscope will be developed which will use a
Fresnel zone plate to form a focusses x-ray spot through which a sample is
scanned, and which will use an optical lever detector to measure refractive
index gradients as well as x-ray absorption in the sample. Operation of these
microscopes will be verified by imaging test objects, and then their operation
will be demonstrated using a variety of hydrated and unsectioned biological
specimens.
