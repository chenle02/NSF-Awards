9722533 Madey The neutron and the proton are the two basic building blocks of
matter. Knowledge of the charge structure of the neutron is essential to
understanding the structure of matter. This knowledge is needed for detailed
microscopic calculations of electromagnetic nuclear structure, for testing
evolving constituent quark models of particle structure, and for extraction of
the strange quark content of the proton from parity-violating electron
scattering experiments. Current knowledge of the neutron charge structure is
insufficient to meet these needs. Jefferson Laboratory (JLab) Experiment 93-038
addresses this fundamental question regarding the nature of the charge structure
of the neutron: What is the spatial distribution of the constituent quarks
within the neutron? In this experiment, longitudinally polarized electrons
scatter quasielastically from a neutron in deuterium. JLab E93-038 will utilize
a neutron polarimeter detector designed specifically for the measurement of the
scattering asymmetry from the sideways polarization component of the neutron.
Another advantage of quasielastic scattering from deuterium is that the
interpretation of the results is insensitive to theoretical models involving the
structure of the deuteron. JLab E93-038 has the scientific potential for
achieving smaller statistical and systematic uncertainties than other techniques
at this time.
