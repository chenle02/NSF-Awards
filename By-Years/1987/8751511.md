This study will explore alternative testing methods to meet the demands of the
hands-on approach to science teaching. Because of the critical importance of
early science education, the grantee will work with fifth grade students. The
investigative technique will be observation of a hands-on scientific
investigation, scored by scientists and science teachers. The investigation will
compare four surrogates with this method: (1) computer simulation of a hands-on
test, (2) hands-on test with written responses, (3) free response pencil and
paper test, and (4) multiple choice test. The data may prove to be of great
value in designing cost-effective, practical tests that closely approximate the
expensive, logistically difficult, hands-on tests with scientists as observers.
