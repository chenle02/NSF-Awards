The goal of this NUE in Engineering program entitled, "NUE: Integrative
Biomedical Nanotechnology Laboratory Course", at the Ohio State University
(OSU), under the direction of Dr. Yi Zhao, is to develop a laboratory course for
biomedical engineering undergraduates which synergistically integrates discrete
pieces of nanotechnology education in traditional engineering disciplines and
offers hands-on experience to students in this highly multidisciplinary field.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the immediate benefits to biomedical engineering
undergraduates at OSU, the outcome of this educational development will be
applicable to a wider public audience. Dissemination to other BME educators will
be through Big 10 BME exchange talk, educational conferences, publications in
educational journals and global educational collaborations. The laboratory
course emphasizing connections between hands-on experience and fundamental
knowledge/principles of nanotechnology will provide a paradigm for undergraduate
education in other multidisciplinary fields. Moreover, the dissemination to K-12
students will be implemented through the established Engineers in Motion program
where grade appropriate versions of the experimental modules will be designed to
match the educational background of the K-12 students involved. The proposed
integrative biomedical nanotechnology laboratory course is expected to enhance
work force development and create new opportunities for biomedical engineering
undergraduates.
