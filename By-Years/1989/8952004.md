This project enhances the effectiveness of the Electrical and Magnetic Fields
course: Calculations, Measurements, and Hazard Assessment, offered at New York
Institute of Technology. This is a popular course for seniors majoring in
electrical engineering at the Metropolitan Campus of this institution. This
course provides students the opportunity to measure and assess the effects of
low level non-ionizing fields in order to evaluate standards for safe levels of
exposure. The students work independently, investigating current standards,
identifying health issues, and, most importantly, determining exposure
assessments. With the instruments acquired under this grant, students gain a
scientific appraisal of actual conditions and do significant research that
contributes to improving this critical database. The ultimate goal is to prepare
engineers to serve as the source of and interpreters of scientific information
that will guide policy-makers and the general public to make wise decisions on
this environmental issue. This award is being matched by an equal amount from
the principal investigator's institution.
