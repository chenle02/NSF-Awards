New theoretical methods are developed, within the framework of relativistic
many-body theory, to treat parity nonconservation (PNC) in heavy atoms. The goal
of this research is to improve the accuracy of PNC amplitudes in atoms and ions
of experimental interest. Reducing the error in PNC calculations leads to more
accurate experimental weak charges QW, quantities that depend on atomic theory
and in turn provide valuable tests of the standard electroweak model. Precise
calculations of the nuclear spin-dependent PNC amplitudes provide data needed to
extract accurate anapole moments from PNC experiments. These in turn shed light
on inconsistencies between constraints on weak nucleon-nucleon coupling
constants obtained from the experimental anapole moment of cesium and those
obtained from other nuclear PNC measurements. To improve calculations of PNC
matrix elements, an indirect method that eliminates truncation errors is
developed to perform sums over intermediate states. This method leads to a large
set of inhomogeneous linear equations, similar to the singles-doubles (SD)
equations developed earlier by this group.
