This project relates to the enhancement of the stability of large electric power
systems. The emphasis is on the stability and control of large systems. The
methodology used is that of singular perturbation theory. It is expected that
the results will be directly applicable in power system controls both as
software and hardware. Also, it is expected that a better understanding of
inter-area oscillations in interconnected power systems will be obtained.
