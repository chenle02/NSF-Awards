This project is for the acquisition of a pair of advanced, special-purpose
computers to be used in N-body simulations of the dynamics and evolution of the
center of the Milky Way galaxy. The computers, called GRAPE-6Pros, contain
massively parallel pipelines that can compute inverse-square gravitational
forces between as many as one million particles at a speed of approximately 1
trillion floating point operations per second. Combined with sophisticated
N-body code that was recently developed at RIT, which efficiently integrates
stellar orbits near the supermassive black hole, the GRAPE computers will enable
researchers and students at RIT to carry out the most sophisticated simulations
to date of the nuclear star cluster at the center of the Milky Way galaxy.
