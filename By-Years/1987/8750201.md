Computer-based technology in areas of data collection, storage, retrieval,
display, manipulation, and interpetation is growing rapidly. Use of such
technology provides an excellent learning environment/program in an introductory
Human Physiology laboratory. For some years, students have collected and
interpreted data related to physiological concepts by using transducers,
monitors and bioamplifiers. By combining an IBM XT computer and Coulbourn's
physiology research system, students now are able to store the data and to
develop simulations based upon them. Use of such models permits them for
example, to observe the effects of an experimental intervention without actually
putting the subject at risk. The system is bridging concepts in physiology and
computer information management, allowing students to further advance their
science education as well as to develop their skills with computer applications.
