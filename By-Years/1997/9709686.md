9709686 Keigwin This study will characterize Holocene variability in the western
North Atlantic by collection and analysis of sediment cores from the Bermuda
Rise, Laurentian Fan, and continental slopes of the Carolinas and the mid-
Atlantic Bight. Geochemical, sedimentological and microfossil analysis will be
used to test whether (1) production of the lower component of North Atlantic
Deep Water diminished during the Little Ice Age and (2) warming and cooling
intervals such as the Little Ice Age and the Medieval Warm period were
widespread in the mid-latitude western Atlantic. The project is funded under the
Earth System History component of the US GLOBAL Change Research Program.
