0454552&lt;br/&gt;Amelung&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An InSAR ground
velocity field for the Western Basin and Range &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Falk
Amelung and Tim Dixon, University of Miami &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In
this project SAR data acquired by the European Remote Sensing satellites (ERS)
is analyzed to derive a new, high spatial resolution, high accuracy, surface
velocity field of the Western Basin and Range Province during the 1992-2004 time
period. The European Space Agency provides 2000 SAR images in support of this
project. The InSAR velocity field can be interpreted as the vertical velocity
field because InSAR measures velocities in direction of the line-of-sight of the
radar satellite which is nearly vertical. High precision measurements are
achieved using new stacking and time series analysis methods.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The InSAR velocity field serves to detect areas of
increased ground deformation in the Western Basin and Range that can be targeted
using detailed, multi-disciplinary measurements campaigns by EarthScope.
Comparison of this pre-Earthscope velocity field with the velocity field of the
Earthscope era will provide new insights into the nature of transient
deformation in the Western Basin and Range. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
