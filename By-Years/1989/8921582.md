This grant supports the organization of a symposium on the topic of
computational approaches to concept formation, bringing together researches from
cognitive psychology, machine learning, and connectionism to exchange ideas and
report recent progress. The meeting will be held in Palo Alto, California,
during January, 1989, and the speakers will be top researchers from these
disciplines in the area of concept formation. A number of additional
participants will be invited based upon submitted summaries of their research.
Graduate Student participation is encouraged. The symposium will contribute
significantly to communication and cooperation among researchers in the
different fields, and will advance our understanding of the processes underlying
the acquisition of conceptual knowledge.
