This award is for funding of dendroclimatic research at the Tree-ring Laboratory
of Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory at Columbia University. Research will
concentrate on the derivation of climatic information from trees at sites
located in North American high latitudes (primarily temperature sensitive) and
at sites in the eastern United States (primarily moisture sensitive). The main
objectives of the research are: (1) to expanded the analyses of the boreal tree-
ring series and derived climatic reconstructions, (2) expand, in a north-south
direction, the sampling density of trees for this region, (3) continue
development of X-ray densitometric techniques (4) study C02/climate/biosphere
relations using correlations between tree- ring indices and normalized
differences vegetation index derived from satellite data, and (5) undertake
limited development of tree-ring series from South America. This work will allow
quantitative reconstruction of the climate system behavior through various tree-
ring analyses techniques. The resulting data would be the basis against which
numerical models of the climate system can be calibrated and scientific
hypotheses regarding climatic changes on decadal-to-century time scales be
tested.
