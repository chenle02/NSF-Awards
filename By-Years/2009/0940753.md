Certain animals can regrow (regenerate) lost body parts, whereas others cannot.
This is a fascinating and important area of biology, but why only some animals
have this ability is still poorly understood. The purpose of this conference
symposium is to bring together researchers working on regeneration from a
variety of research perspectives in order to foster integrative approaches to
studying this question. Ten researchers working from different perspectives in
regeneration biology, ranging from molecular and cell biology to ecology, will
present current research findings and participants will discuss the state of the
field and needed areas for future research. Additional researchers, including
early-career scientists, will present their findings in short talks. Educators
and scientists will also share novel approaches on teaching principles of
regeneration biology in classroom and laboratory settings. Women, minorities,
and early career scientists are well represented among the symposium presenters
and participants. It is anticipated that this symposium will help foster needed
crosstalk between different sub-disciplines of regeneration biology and enhance
future research efforts.
