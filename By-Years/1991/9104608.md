This award will provide half of the funding to make it possible for Caltech to
acquire a new four-crystal spectrometer for their electron microprobe. This new
four-crystal spectrometer contains state-of-the-art layered dispersion element
pseudocrystals that enable analysis of very light elements (beryllium through
carbon) with high efficiency. Caltech is committed to provide the additional
funds needed for this acquisition. The acquisition of this state-of-the-art
spectrometer/crystal system will (1) significantly improve the PIs capability to
analyze Be, B, and C which will be of importance for a variety of geologic
investigations such as determining the carbon dioxide content of glasses and B
substitution in silicates; and (2) enable these investigators to develop
superior quantitative analysis correction procedures for the very light elements
and soft X-ray lines. As in the past, these investigators indicate that they
plan to make these correction procedures widely available to other interested
investigators.
