Experts in informal science education, citizen science, bats, and computer
science are developing and evaluating, at Mammoth Cave National Park, a hybrid
onsite/online proof-of-concept program for citizen scientists to observe and
record (tag) roosting behaviors of Rafinesque's big-eared bats via streaming
video. Participants are helping bat researchers document bat behaviors that
provide insights into the benefits of communal roosting and interactions that
serve to create or maintain social bonds and spread disease. The project is also
developing a proof-of-concept mobile kiosk that links the citizen science bat
study program to other exhibits at Mammoth Cave.

Project personnel are conducting evaluation studies to identify best practices
for engaging underserved populations and professional scientists in the study of
bat behavior, and developing plans for scaling up the program to include video
and educational resources from other bat sites around the country. Lessons
learned from the project will inform development of a new, nationwide, online
citizen science program focused on bat behavior.
