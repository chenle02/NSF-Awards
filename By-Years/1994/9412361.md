9412361 Spontak This Research Equipment Grant will make it possible for the
Departments of Materials Science and Engineering and Chemical Engineering at
North Carolina State University to purchase cryomicroscopy instrumentation that
is needed for examination of the morphologies of polymer and furfactant
aggregate structures. This equipment will improve the capabilities of existing
electron microscopes and it is critical for the ultimate success of
morphological studies addressing fundamental research in areas dealing with
solvated polymers and surfactants. **
