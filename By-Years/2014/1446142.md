This workshop is to foster discussions among the leading researchers toward a
roadmap for foundational research in cybersecurity and cyberspace over the next
ten years with a broad perspective, taking into consideration relevant science,
technology, and policy issues, and with an emphasis on the social sciences and
education. The previous ten years has seen cyberspace become ubiquitous and
essential for modern life. It has also seen the emergence of a criminal cyber-
underground and exfiltration of corporate and personal information on a massive
scale. The next ten years will likely see equally dramatic change too.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is for support of this workshop, for travel,
and for post-workshop report preparation and publication.
