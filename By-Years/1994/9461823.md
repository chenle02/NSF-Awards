Heavy metal contamination is quickly becoming a major threat to our quality of
life. Heavy metal analysis has consequently become a necessary procedure in
field settings, remote from the well-equipped laboratory, for example in
environmental cleanup efforts or in screening children for lead poisoning in
public health clinics. Currently most heavy metal determinations are made by
graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy (GFAA) or anodic stripping
voltammetry (ASV). At present, however, the application of GFAA and ASV to metal
analysis is largely limited to bench-top laboratory settings, carried out under
the supervision of skilled professionals. ANDCARE proposes the development of a
rugged, disposable, ASV electrode; ideal for use in the field and the small-
laboratory. ANDCARE will utilize a new approach: screen printing methods
combined with spotting, air spray, or electrodeposition of colloidal gold for
the cost-effective production of single-use ASV electrodes with reproducible
operational characteristics. The expected result of this Phase I project is to
demonstrate high performance, printed, single-use ASV electrodes for the
analysis of trace heavy metals
