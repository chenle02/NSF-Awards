Dr. Price and his colleages at the University of Wisconsin's Laboratory for
Archaeological Chemistry will develop and test a number of methods for
reconstructing past human activities which are reflected in living surfaces from
excavated archaeological sites. They will apply a series of physical and
chemical analyses on materials collected from a present day settlement in Oaxaca
Mexico. A large series of soil samples were excavated under controlled
conditions in earthern floor houses where the actual activities carried out were
directly observed. The team will now conduct physical analysis to determine
micromorphology and particle size. They will also search for phytoliths and
other organic inclusions. On a chemical level they will determine element
concentrations and and attempt to identify organic materials, especially fatty
acids. They will use this situation to determine the relationship between
specific human behavior and the subtle physical and chemical indications left on
the ground. The results will then be evaluated through application in a series
of "true" archaeological contexts. Unfortunately many activities which take
place at a simple technological level leave little if any evident archaeological
debris. Many others leave traces which rapidly disintegrate and thus escape
archaeological attention. By studying archaeological sites at a chemical and
fine scale physical level, Dr. Price and his colleagues hope to develop
techniques which will help in the reconstruction of prehistoric behavior. If
successful these approaches can be employed by archaeologists in many parts of
the world and serve to increase our understanding of the past.
