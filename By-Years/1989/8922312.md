Although the physical principles of motion are generally well understood,
adequate methods for controlling motion in computer simulations to achieve
specified goals or to satisfy general constraints do not exist. The primary
objective of this research project is to develop means that will allow
scientists to exercise a high level of control over dynamic models. This is
achieved by generalizing the formulation, generation, and satisfaction of
constraint equations to create an intuitive interface between the user and the
computer. An abstract definition of constraints will encompass force
constraints, explicit motion requirements, energy minimization, and style
considerations. Assemblies of rigid or flexible bodies, representing forms
ranging from human figures to mechnical linkages, form the domain of the
geometric models studied. The underlying description of the assemblies
encompasses both simplified polygonal representations for prototyping and exact
B- spline sculptured surfaces to represent mechanical and other figures.
Numerical methods found within Finite Element Analysis, particularly the method
of weighted residuals, are studied as a basis for permitting interactive
teamwork between the scientist and the machine.
