The primary purpose of the research proposed here is to examine variation in
the shape of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) among anthropoid primates in
relation to function by evaluating the hypothesis that the shape of the TMJ is
correlated with both the movements of the mandibular condyle and diet. In order
to test this general hypothesis the investigators will dissect the TMJ in a
broad range of primates. Cineradiographic analysis of condylar movements in 4
anthropoid genera (Ateles, Macaca, Papio, and Pan), development of a mechanical
model of the TMJ, and quantitative shape analyses that examine the model in
relation to dietary and evolutionary influences in living monkeys and apes will
also be carried out. This is the first study to incorporate in vivo and
morphometric results to interpret the functional significance of TMJ shape among
extant anthropoids as well as to describe and quantify condylar movements in a
New World monkey (Ateles) and a great ape (Pan). This study will result in a
model and data base of anthropoid TMJ kinematics that may be applied to
functional, evolutionary, and adaptive explanations of the anatomy of the TMJ
region in fossil anthropoids, including early human ancestors.
