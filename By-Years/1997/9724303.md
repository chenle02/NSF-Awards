9724303 Landman A parallel processing computer system will be acquired by the
Georgia Institute of Technology. The computer system will support research in
modeling and simulation of physical and chemical processes in complex materials
systems, including tribology, elastohydrodynamics, lubrication, chemical
dynamics, clusters and nanostructured materials. The computer system will be
part of the Computational Materials Science Center at Georgia Tech, where it
will be available to students as part of formal courses that incorporate a
"hands-on" experience in computational activities. The Center also organizes a
seminar series and an annual workshop where topics pertaining to the use of
computers in solving challenging scientific problems are discussed. %%% The
investigations proposed address fundamental issues which are often of relevance
for the development of new technologies. The complex nature of the phenomena
investigated requires large-scale simulations and calculations, involving a
large number of degrees of freedom and prolonged time scales in order to model
reliably the systems being studied. The parallel computer system will enhance
current capabilities at Georgia Tech and open new, and otherwise inaccessible,
avenues of research. ***
