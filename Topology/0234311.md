The proposal deals invariants for three- and four-dimensional manifolds,
specifically those which the proposer constructed in collaboration Zoltan Szabo.
These invariants appear to be closely related to gauge-theoretic (Donaldson and
Seiberg-Witten) invariants, except that they have the advantage of being more
combinatorial in nature than their gauge-theoretic predecessors, and hence
easier to calculate. To illustrate their strength, one can reprove some results
in four-dimensional differential topology which were obtained previously using
gauge theory. These invariants also have new topological applications which go
beyond gauge theory. For instance, they can be used to give new restrictions on
knots whose surgeries give lens spaces. The author hopes to further extend this
theory, to see what further insight they may give to topology in dimensions
three and four.

The proposal deals with studying the intrinsic structure of three- and four-
dimensional spaces. The study of four-dimensional spaces was revolutionized by
Simon Donaldson in the early 80's by his introduction of "gauge-theoretic
techniques". These techniques associate to a space the space of solutions of
certain partial differential equations (which come from mathematical physics).
Course properties of these solution spaces are then used to give insight into
the finer structure of the underlying spaces on which the equations are defined.
The proposal deals with efforts at circumventing these (often difficult to
identify) auxiliary spaces of solutions, to give more directly combinatorial
approaches to understanding the way three- and four-dimensional spaces fit
together.
