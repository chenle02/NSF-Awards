Dynamic visualizations - interactive, computer based models, simulations, and
virtual experiments of scientific phenomena - provide alternative pathways for
students to understand science concepts. Of special interest are those
visualizations that make unseen processes visible and those that support inquiry
around complex phenomena. Research concerning the educational values of dynamic
visualizations has been contradictory and inconclusive. This study provides
modules and assessments to obtain evidence for how students process dynamic
visual data and integrate what they see with what they know. The project
proceeds in three phases. The first 18 month phase is to study how
visualizations can improve science learning for students with a wide range of
disciplinary knowledge, background, beliefs, and spatial experience. The second
phase lasting 24 months investigates successful strategies to embed
visualizations, combined with hands-on activities, in curriculum materials to
enable all students to learn complex science topics. The last phase of 18 months
works to show how practices and cyberlearning tools can be generalized to be
more easily used in different environments by developing visualizations for new
topics and curricula. Forty middle and high school science teachers and their
students in five diverse districts participate in the study of visualizations
applied to the learning of physical science. The studies build on existing work
and tools, but new tools and materials are to be developed as needed.
