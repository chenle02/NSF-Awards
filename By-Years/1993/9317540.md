9317540 Guy The various physical components of the natural environment are
rarely optimal with respect to growth and development over the life cycle of any
given organism. Because terrestrial environments are dynamic, most plants have
evolved mechanisms to cope with marginally unfavorable conditions that may
otherwise be deleterious. While physically different environmental conditions
may injure plants in quite unique ways, certain cellular consequences of injury
may be common to what would be viewed as rather divergent environmental
stresses. The work outlined in this proposal continues to focus attention on the
fundamental role of a class of molecular chaperones, the stress 70 family, in
the basic functioning of the plant cell and in the organism as a whole during
normal growth and development, as well as when subjected to suboptimal and
deleterious environmental condition. It has been demonstrated that one of the
responses of spinach to low nonfreezing temperture exposure involves an
increased level of expression for one or more members of the heat shock 70
family. The objectives of the research are to: 1, determine the expression
responses for all members of this family to both short and long term exposure to
low temperature; 2, define the expression patterns for all the members of the
family in response to the complement of environmental parameters of significance
to plants; 3, examine the phenotypic consequences resulting from over-and under-
expression in transgenic plants; and 4, continue the biochemical analyses of the
purified proteins with respect to peptide binding and its role in protein
assembly. Together the aggregate of this work will be to not only examine the
molecular chaperone function of HSP/C70s, but to test the hypothesis that this
family of proteins plays an important role in protein assembly and disassembly
in plants at low temperatures. ***
