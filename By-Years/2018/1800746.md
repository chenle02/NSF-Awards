This research project examines several important problems in Ramsey theory and
discrete geometry. These are problems arising from both combinatorics and
geometry, with the common theme of determining how large or small a certain
finite set can be under certain restrictions. For example, given a set of n
points in the plane, how often can the unit distance occur among them? Many of
these problems have fascinated mathematicians for decades, while others are
fueled by the more recent development of computational geometry. The PI will
tackle these problems using a wide range of mathematical tools and techniques
from probability, topology, algebraic geometry, and combinatorics. One of the
main goals of this project is to study the interplay between combinatorial and
algebraic methods, and to further develop these methods by studying some of the
most central open problems in the field. The PI will also continue to encourage
high school, undergraduate, and graduate students to work in combinatorial
research, and continue to teach courses which cover the latest results and
methods used in combinatorics and discrete geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
first area in this project examines Ramsey-type problems in combinatorics and
geometry. One of the major goals of this project is to obtain new bounds for
classical hypergraph Ramsey numbers. The PI will also continue a sequence of
recent works on Ramsey-type problems for hypergraphs arising in geometry, which
include the Erdos-Szekeres convex polygon problem in higher dimensions, and
finding large independent sets in intersection graphs of geometric objects. The
second area of this project explores various extensions of the famous Szemeredi-
Trotter theorem, and its applications in additive number theory. Specific
problems include characterizing dense point-line arrangements, and estimating
the number of incidences between points and curves in the plane.
