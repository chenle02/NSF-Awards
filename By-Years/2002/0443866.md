EAR-0443866&lt;br/&gt;Bowring&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the past five years, the
precision of both 40Ar/39Ar and U-Pb geochronology has steadily improved with
recent advances potentially allowing us to address questions previously out of
reach. There is great potential for the application of these techniques to
determining accurate and precise absolute ages thus yielding previously
unattainable insights into rates of geological processes and the development of
a fully consistent, robust and highly resolved geological timescale. It is now
common in modern laboratories to determine both 40Ar/39Ar and U-Pb dates to 0.1%
precision or better when not considering external sources of error. However,
given the significantly improved analysis, interlaboratory and inter-decay-
scheme differences are now clearly apparent, in some cases being more than 1%,
e.g., several million years in the mid-Paleozoic. These discrepancies can lead
to major uncertainties when comparing dates obtained using the two systems,
which in turn can lead to incorrect geological inferences, for example the
potential linking of extinction events with geological events or bolide
impacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will fund a two-day workshop to be held
at MIT the weekend of October 15th or 22nd 2004 that will bring together
representatives of the major laboratories worldwide involved in both 40Ar/39Ar
and U-Pb geochronology to discuss problems and solutions to interlaboratory
differences and to develop further a plan to move forward with increased
precision and accuracy in geochronology. This will include having participants
analyze and report both U-Pb and 40Ar/39Ar standard data at this meeting. The
joining of both the U-Pb and 40Ar/39Ar communities at this workshop will provide
a foundation for a focused effort toward understanding and resolving the issue
of inter-decay system bias and allowing confident application of both
chronometers to the calibration of the geological
timescale.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
