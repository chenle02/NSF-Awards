A Varian SpectrAA-10B Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer and an accompanying
computer-based data station is being used to introduce the principles and
techniques of atomic absorption spectrophotometry into the curriculum at a
number of levels. Specific course improvements being made include: Introduction
of the atomic absorption method into introductory chemistry as a technique for
the determination of the sodium content of over- the-counter medications and for
the determination of the lead content of solutions of lead iodide; Demonstration
of the principles of operation of an atomic absorption spectrophotometer and its
analytical applications in an instrumental analysis course; and Use of atomic
absorption spectrophotometry in independednt study and in summer research
programs. The equipment is also being used in the annual summer chemistry
program for advanced high school students. The grantee is matching the award
from non-Federal sources.
