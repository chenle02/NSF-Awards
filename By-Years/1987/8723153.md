One of the most interesting and challenging problems in evolutionary biology is
understanding the extent to which functional design and past evolutionary
history effect the evolution of specialized morphological adaptations. The
proposed study will investigate these factors in a highly specialized group of
organisms -- nectar-feeding Old World fruit bats. This group is ideal for the
study of feeding mechanisms in several significant ways. The family includes
species that specialize on eating a variety of diverse foods and previous work
has helped develop a hypothesis of their evolutionary history. The proposed
study will critically test the factors that appear to constrain the form,
function, and evolution of the feeding mechanism in this group of nectar-feeding
bats. The research will include collection of data on the structure and function
of the tongue using a variety of microscopic and computer-assisted imaging
technology. A predictive model of how functional design is effected by evolution
will be developed.
