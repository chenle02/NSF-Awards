The scholarship program in the College of Engineering at the University of
Massachusetts Amherst will increase the number of community college students
with demonstrated academic talent and financial need who transfer, complete
baccalaureate degrees in engineering, and enter the STEM workforce. The project
will begin with the recruitment of a group of 22 new community college transfer
students. The selected students, to be known as S-STEM Scholars, will receive up
to $6,000 per year in scholarships and participate in a comprehensive program of
academic, professional and personal support. Nearly half of the students who
earn baccalaureate degrees in science and engineering in the US complete part of
their education at a community college. Programs designed to support community
college students to transition to, and graduate from, four-year engineering
programs will increase the number of engineering graduates entering the
workforce. Scholarships for academically strong engineering students, who may
not otherwise be able to afford college, will increase the number of engineering
graduates prepared to promote innovation and competiveness in national and
regional technology-intensive industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The enrichment
and support programs build upon effective practices known to help increase
retention and degree completion among community college students that transfer
to four-year baccalaureate degree programs. The program will include activities
to promote faculty-student interaction, offer both peer-to-peer and industry
mentoring through a Connect for Success Mentoring Network, provide several
workshops focused on academic success, and deliver a suite of career development
workshops customized for the S-STEM Scholars. This program design will help to
overcome known barriers to persistence of transfer students from community
college. These barriers are lack of engagement on campus, underdeveloped
professional identity and career goals, incomplete study habits, fewer
opportunities to gain practical competence, and the need to earn money through
non-academically related work. Assessment and evaluation will provide insight
into the retention benefits of student scholarships, learning communities,
career development activities, and faculty mentoring/advising. Lessons learned
and effective practices that emerge from the program evaluation data will be
disseminated widely to the engineering education community and help enlarge the
knowledge base regarding attributes and practices of successful scholarship
programs of this type.
