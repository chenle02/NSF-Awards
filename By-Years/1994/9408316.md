9408316 Good The collection of amphibians and reptiles in the Louisiana State
Universitiy Museum of Natural Science currently contains approximately 56,000
specimens and is recognized internationally as a significant research resource
largely because of its important neotropical holdings and because of its
particular strength in snake skeletal and hemipenial material. Funds will permit
movement of two "orphaned" collections, from the University of Southwestern
Louisiana and Southeastern Louisiana Universitiy, totaling some 21,300 specimens
to LSU Museum of Natural Science. This will result in a 38% increase in the
overall size of the LSU collection. Incorporation of this new material will
involve cataloguing and installing the specimens, entering their ancillary data
into the Museum's computer database system, and checking the database for
accuracy against the individual specimen tags. Funds will also support several
non recurring needs resulting from the acquisition of these specimens, including
the purchase and installation of additional shelving to house the influx of new
specimens and temporary support for a collection manager to handle this new
material.
