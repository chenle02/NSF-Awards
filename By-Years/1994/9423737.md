9423737 An experimental and theoretical study of the properties of noise in
mode-locked fiber lasers, will be conducted. It is likely that these lasers can
be made to operate at the quantum limit, at least within certain spectral
windows, where classical sources of noise are suppressed to an extent that
quantum noise is predominant noise source. ***
