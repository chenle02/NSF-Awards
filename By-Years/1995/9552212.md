The Scientific Visualization and Virtual Design Environment Laboratory enhances
undergraduate courses in science, mathematics, and engineering. It also improves
the preparation of undergraduates who plan to pursue a career in teaching
science and mathematics. This project funds six Silicon Graphics INDIGO
workstations, CrystalEyes VR, and software packages by Alias Research
Incorporated and Sense8 Corporation. This laboratory is being used by
undergraduates to develop maintainable graphics programs and to visualize
scientific data. Students learn about using visualization as a tool for
discovering and understanding complex phenomena. In addition, students use the
proposed laboratory to analyze, synthesize, and evaluate potential design
solutions. Students easily develop virtual worlds, animate them with realistic
properties, and experience them in partially immersive mode. Finally, the new
laboratory provides students with hands-on experience of software packages that
are widely used in the field. This project injects a component into our
curriculum that heretofore has not been widely applied in the science and
engineering disciplines.
