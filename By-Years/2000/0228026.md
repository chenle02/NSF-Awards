The atmospheric tides are global scale oscillations in the basic state of the
Earths atmosphere (winds, temperature and density) that are forced in the lower-
atmosphere and propagate vertically into the upper atmosphere and ionosphere.
Over the past decade basic understanding of the migrating atmospheric tides has
emerged, largely from an increase in the number of ground-based observatories
across the globe making wind and temperature measurements of the mesosphere- and
lower-thermosphere (MLT) roughly between 70 and 120km. The continuing increase
in the availability of observational data from ground and space based
instruments is providing atmospheric scientists with the opportunity to improve
their theoretical understanding of the mechanisms that drive atmospheric tides.
This is accomplished through a process that includes both numerical models and
observational data. The basic approach for this research is to use the Whole
Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) that has been under development at
the National Center for Atmospheric Research. WACCM is a fully nonlinear, four-
dimensional global circulation model of the atmosphere spanning from the surface
to an altitude of 140km. Analysis of WACCM results will be compared with the
global network of MLT observations, including those from the recently launched
TIMED spacecraft, to validate the tidal and planetary wave structure simulated
by the model. Once validated, the model will be utilized to estimate the affect
of global scale planetary waves on the structure of the atmospheric tides.
