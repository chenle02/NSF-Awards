The goal of this project is to improve the effectiveness and relevance of the
undergraduate microprocessor project laboratory. This will be accomplished by
improving the laboratory facilities which are essential to support design
projects involving microprocessor applications. A unique feature of the
laboratory is its emphasis on a design team approach to the use of
microprocessors and microcontrollers in real applications. These applications
are often in areas in which conventional sources of funds are not available. For
example, a design team is currently implementing computer controlled educational
displays for the Paul Jensen Arctic Museum, a non-profit museum located in
Monmouth, Oregon. To accomplish these goals, the laboratory is in need of modern
design instruments and computer facilities, including a graphics work station,
personal computers, oscilloscopes, instrumentation controllers, and numerous
hardware and software support packages for microprocessor and microcontroller
system implementation. A significant portion of the expenses for providing these
facilities will be provided by local industry including Tektronix.
