Prop #: 0308846 Institution: Oregon State University (OSU) PI: Fred Jones

Oregon State University operates the R/V WECOMA as a general-purpose
oceanographic vessel in support of National Science Foundation (NSF) and other
federal agency sponsored programs. The vessel is owned by NSF and operated
through a five hear Cooperative Agreement. The ship is scheduled for 223
operational days in 2003 of which 130 support NSF programs. The proposal
requests funds to install a replacement emergency electrical generator on board
the vessel. The installation will require structural modifications to the
vessel. The installation will be done during the winter shipyard period in
accordance with 46 DFR 28.375 for ship's service generators. The new system will
provide power for steering, bilge pumps, running lights, navigation and
communication equipment, fire protection systems and emergency lighting during a
main power outage.

The proposal requests funds for an architectural design, structural
modifications, and installation of an automatic transfer switch and related
electrical panel, installation of a fire suppression system and alarms and
modifications to the ships electrical system. The NSF inspection team inspected
the vessel in March 2002 and recommended the installation of the larger
emergency generator and associated modifications. ***
