An isotope ratio mass spectrometer will be acquired as the basis of a regional
facility for instrumentation in anthropology. The instrument will support a wide
range of studies, particularly exploiting the new technology to determine
important landmarks in anthropological studies of American Indians using diet
and nutritional information determined by this technique. The facility will also
serve to introduce new technology to the community at large and enhance a strong
program at the Institution.
