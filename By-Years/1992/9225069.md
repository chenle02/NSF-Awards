Dr. Geraldine L. Richmond and other members of the Chemistry and Physics
Departments who are also members of the Chemical Physics Institute of the
University of Oregon are being supported to continue a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1993-5, ten undergraduate
students from the Chemistry and Physics Departments will spend ten weeks each
summer actively engaged in a variety of research projects. Projects cover the
areas of physical chemistry and chemical physics. A unique feature of this
program is the interaction between students and faculty from the two
departments.
