A one-week summer school in Computational Number Theory will be held at the
University of North Carolina Greensboro in May of 2013, 2014, and 2015. The
first summer school is scheduled for May 20-24, 2013. The subjects for each of
the upcoming summer schools to be held at the University of North Carolina
Greensboro are the following: - May 2013: Computational Algebraic Number Theory
- May 2014: Geometry and Modular Forms - May 2015: Computational aspects of
Hilbert's 12th Problem The aim of the one-week summer school is to complement
the traditional training that graduate students receive by exposing them to a
constructive and computational approach to many objects in number theory. This
will further their knowledge and give the students additional tools for their
research. Furthermore, the school will allow the students to have the
opportunity to work closely with experts in the field.

The summer school will help create research communities. By meeting and working
with other graduate students in their field the students will lay the foundation
for future collaboration. In the years after the summer school they will meet
again at one of the regional conferences: Palmetto Number Theory Series or South
Eastern Meeting on Numbers. The PIs will encourage student participation in
these conferences, which will be valuable for their careers as researchers and
in their post-doctoral lives. By introducing the students to a computational
approach to number theory, this project will enhance the next generation of
mathematicians by increasing their ability to use computing technology in their
research. More information can be found at the website for the summer school:
