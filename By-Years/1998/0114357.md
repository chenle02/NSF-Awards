The project is a pilot study of the Tjornes fracture zone offshore northern
Iceland with the goal of demonstrating the feasibility of mapping Holocene
faulting and volcanic activity in the tectonically complex fracture zone system.
The project will use a SUBSCAN chirp sonar system and a high-resolution
multicchannel seismic acquisition system, together with conventional bathymetric
mapping. Specific objectives are to determine the current location and history
of strike-slip movement along the offshore portion of the fracture system, to
estimate the amount of extension of the Eyjafjardarall graben over the past 1-2
Ma, and to examine how the north-south graben structures terminate near the
fracture zone. If successful, a joint Iceland-US investigation of the Tjornes
fracture zone and other portions of Iceland's insular shelf are planned. The
overaching goal of this research is to define strain partitioning in the Tjornes
fracture zone in order to reconstruct the onshore-offshore deformation history
of the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
