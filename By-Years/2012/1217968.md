The goal of this project is to develop a systematic framework to enable "robust"
query processing in presence of data uncertainties that arise naturally in a
wide variety of application domains. Data uncertainties may take the form of
missing or incomplete data, inherent noise in the data, trust or reputation
scores assigned to data based on their sources of origin, or confidences in
predictions made using automated modeling tools. The input uncertainties
naturally lead to uncertainties in the results of any queries or analyses
performed on such data. To enable robust and systematic reasoning over such
uncertain query results, efficient algorithms and practical tools are developed
to: (a) identify the input uncertainties to which query results are most
sensitive, (b) decide how to use scarce resources like subject matter experts to
resolve uncertainties in query results, and (c) incorporate user feedback to
improve the robustness of the input uncertainty parameters themselves. The tools
have the potential to make it easy and intuitive to process and analyze
uncertain data and extract useful information from it in a wide range of real-
world application domains including social media analysis, scientific and
biological data management, sensor data management, web data integration, and
information extraction. This project provides research opportunities for
graduate and undergraduate students, and is aligned with several advanced
graduate courses offered by the PIs. The prototype implementation of the
framework, publications, and experimental data, will be disseminated via the
project web site: http://www.cs.umd.edu/~amol/RPrDB.
