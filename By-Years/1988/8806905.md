Since the time of Plato, it has been observed that joining groups leads
individuals to think and act more poorly, often in destructive ways. By the 20th
century, such prominent social scientists as LeBon (1893), McDougall (1920), and
Freud (1922) debated the causes of why decent persons behave badly when banded
together. During the past two decades, research has increasingly focused on
between group interactions. It has shown that interacting groups consistently
act in more competitive ways than do interacting individuals, even when
cooperation would be more productive. This phenomenon has been shown even in the
most minimal social situations, when temporary groups have been formed for
dealing with inconsequential matters. The present research will test whether the
primary reason that interacting groups behave destructively toward one another
is that the presence of an "outgroup" raises negative expectations about
exploitation and thus produces lack of trust. To explore these questions,
experiments will systematically lower threat and reasons for mistrust; for
example, alternatives that assure non- exploitation and the maintenance of own-
group power will be explored. It is expected that such manipulations will
decrease the frequency of destructive behavior. If this occurs, the research has
important implications for understanding cross-group hostility and rejection of
outgroups, both within and between cultures.
