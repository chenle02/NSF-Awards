Creating Synergy in Science and Education (CSSE) will build on previous phases
of TCUP Magakata Woslolye Oaye (Cultivating Science into the Future), which
built an infrastructure of intellectual merit, faculty resources, facilities,
scientific equipment and connections to the tribes and communities. Our vision
continues to be to develop a model to strengthen science leadership at Tribal
Colleges. The Cultivating Synergy in Science and Education program would expand
on prior TCUP initiatives by cultivating scientific curiosity through
collaborative undergraduate research and educational initiatives between
mainstream Universities, Tribal Agencies and the K12 classroom. The project
goals are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;Goal 1: Improve the quality of undergraduate
STEM education through developing OLC faculty and educational resources with the
purpose of delivering hands-on, place-based STEM instruction for undergraduate
students&lt;br/&gt;Goal 2: Strengthen partnerships in within OLC, Tribal
resource programs, and outside academic institutions&lt;br/&gt;Goal 3: Broaden
the pipeline of future STEM undergraduates at OLC
