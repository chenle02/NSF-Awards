Recently Drs. Wyatt and Stoneburner have provided the first molecular evidence
for the probable hybrid origin of a natural species of moss, Plagiomnium medium.
Using methods of isozyme analysis, widely employed in studies of flowering
plants but only recently adapted to mosses, these scientists found protein
composition in the moss to reflect additive components of two presumed parental
species in the northern United States. The hybrid has double the number of
chromosomes found in the two parents, and is fully fertile. This mechanism of
species formation, by hybridization followed by chromosome doubling, has been
amply documented in flowering plants, but not in mosses heretofore. Drs. Wyatt
and Stoneburner will continue to sample more populations of these moss species
and will extend the project to analyses of additional presumptive cases, where
known chromosome counts suggest a probable hybrid origin. In the laboratory the
investigators will attempt to cross-fertilize the presumptive parents in order
to duplicate experimentally the hybrid species. Despite differences in the basic
biology of mosses, with their dominant haploid life-cycle, this new work
demonstrates fundamental similarity in a mechanism of evolution operating in all
other land plants.
