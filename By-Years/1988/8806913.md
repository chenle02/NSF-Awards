In the past several years, the mathematical objects known as feature structures
have been employed by numerous research traditions in theoretical and
computational linguistics (collectively referred to as "unification-based
grammar") for modeling a wide range of phenomena in the domain of natural
language. The principal investigator will explore the thesis that the formalism
of feature structures, appropriately extended, is capable of serving as the
foundation for mathematically precise and computationally tractable theories of
natural language structure that have determinate empirical consequences. The
researcher would then apply such extensions to the formalization of explicit
"principle-based" linguistic theories and to the construction of practical NLP
programs, focussing upon such centrally important linguistic phenomena as word
order, binding, long-distance dependencies ("A-bar movement"), and discourse
structure. Extensions to be investigated include, inter alia, the following: (1)
different varieties of negative constraints (classical negation, intuitionistic
negation, and apartness); (2) different varieties of type regiments (via the
logic, via structural constraints on graphs, via sorting of algebraic models)
and associated inheritance schemes (inclusion polymorphism); (3) realization of
such notions as list value and set value (parametric polymorphism); (4)
predicates other than equality (e.g. inequality, append, subset, union) and
"building-in" of equational theories (generalized unification); (5) methods for
introducing recursion; (6) infinitary methods (e.g. "functional uncertainty);
and (7) dynamic interpretation.
