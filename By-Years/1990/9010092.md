This research will investigate the mechanism of wetting induced collapse in
unsaturated soils. Certain soils stable in the dry or partially dry state,
collapse when sufficient water is added. A better understanding of this
phenomenon could allow better prediction of the stability and settlement
performance of embankments and foundations.
