For several years the research of this project has been aimed at clarifying the
nature of the information in single and multiple radiographs, development of
methods to make effective use of it, and discovery of results of mathematical
significance in the process. This aim will continue, but for the next year the
primary aim will be the application of project formulas for sharpening single
radiographs and for a new kind of computed tomography. The applications under
current study include: quality control and failure analysis of atomic fuel
elements, silicon integrated circuit wafers, metallic hip joints, and firearm
combustion; rock porosity - in regard to the safety of waste disposal and to the
flow of oil; normal vs. diseased bone; and normal vs. maligant soft tissue. This
research involves use of mathematical methods to process data from radiography
and is important for improving techniques in cat-scan and imaging.
