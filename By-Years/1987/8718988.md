This grant is for the use of ultra-sensitive imaging systems to record and
interpret the rapidly changing patterns of auroral luminosity. The data is taken
with a modified TV camera, so that changes of color and shape in a fraction of s
second can be later analyzed in detail. The complex shapes arise as current
paths move in the earth's magnetic field under the influence of electric fields
and changes in conductivity caused in part by the currents themselves. Phenomena
such as spirals and pulsating aurorae are examples of plasma instabilities that
are ubiquitous throughout the cosmos, but which can be studied in some detail
with ground based imaging and spectrographic and other equipment from the Poker
Flat and Svalbad Auroral Observatories. Videotape recordings of these images are
being made available as educational material, and have been widely enjoyed as
demonstrating the beauty of the natural environment.
