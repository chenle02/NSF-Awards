Proposal Number: NSF-0430450&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Cryptographic
Foundations of Cyber Trust&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Shafi
Goldwasser&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Protecting the electronic information world is
paramount to the success and stability of modern society. This includes
protecting the integrity and privacy of stored and communicated data,
guaranteeing security of complex electronic transactions, and maintaining
availability of the existing infrastructure. At the core of any trustworthy and
resilient solution to these problems lies a set of cryptographic protocols that
are guaranteed to preserve explicitly stated security requirements under some
cryptographic hardness assumptions in the face of malicious attacks. The design
of cryptographic protocols is a complex endeavor, which must be accompanied by a
security analysis which rests on sound theoretical foundations. This research
will address challenges that arise in the the design of cryptograhic protocols
at multiple levels, from the mathematical underpinnings of computational
difficulty, through modeling and analysis of protocols, to deployment and run-
time issues. The following objectives will be pursued: diversifing cryptographic
hardness assumptions; adequate modeling and analysis of cryptographic protocols
in complex environments; analyzing the security of current practices; and
designing new cryptographic protocols which achieve stronger levels of security.
The diversity of the challenges addressed will have a significant impact on the
design and practice of cryptographic protocols in the
future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
