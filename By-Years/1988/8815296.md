This award will support cooperative research between Dr. George Sigel, Rutgers
University and Professor Jacques Lucas, University of Rennes-Beaulieu, France.
The objective of this project is to develop new glasses and fiber optics
waveguides based on halide compositions. The joint program will include work on
the new chalcohalide glasses for use in the extended infrared, as well as new
approaches for preparation of the more well-known heavy metal halides. The
investigators will also focus on the assessment of potential waveguide materials
for use in the 8 to 14um range with specific interest at 10.6um, as well as the
evaluation of these materials for specialized applications, such as laser hosts
with selected rare earth dopants for glass activation. Both the U.S. and French
laboratories have significant expertise in the proposed research area. The
University of Rennes carried out leading work in the areas of halide glass
chemistry, as well as in glass synthesis and characterization. Rutgers has
strong capabilities in the areas of the fiber drawing of non-oxide glasses, the
optical characterization of these waveguides and their use in newly emerging
applications. The results of this joint work should make an important
contribution to optical glass fiber research.
