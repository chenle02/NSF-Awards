This project provides funds for the purchase of equipment to automate a coherent
optical processing grid technique for the full field measurement of strain. The
equipment includes a Helium-Neon laser, high resolution video camera,
microcomputer with frame store firmware and monitors. The technique to be
developed promises to provide a significant new tool for the study of problems
such as fracture and deformation under multiaxial states of stress.
