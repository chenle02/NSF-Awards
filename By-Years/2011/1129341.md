This engineering education research project builds from previous research on how
computer-aided feedback to students improves how the students learn drawing-
related concepts in engineering statics. By researching how to integrate rapid
feedback between instructor and student, this project will enable computer-
assisted drawing tools to be utilized in introductory engineering statics
courses to improve student learning&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
significance and importance of this project will be to overcome barriers for
integrating effective software tools into critical, large enrollment engineering
courses early in the curriculum. The collaborative project engages two
universities with different educational missions to ensure that the results are
widely applicable. The needs of students typically under-represented in
engineering are addressed in the proposed research project. This project
overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers by enhancing
research infrastructure and data access to broaden research capabilities.
Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by supporting the
development of innovative learning systems.
