The gene sequence coding for several portions of the 18S and 28S ribosomal RNAs
will be determined for two frogs, a salamander, a caecilian, a bird, an
alligator and representative reptiles. These sequences, together with published
data on mammals, will be aligned and analyzed to produce a phylogeny for the
Tetrapoda.
