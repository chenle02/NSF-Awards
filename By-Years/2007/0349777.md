This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project proposes to
continue the development and refinement of a novel membrane protein expression
system utilizing a unique group of bacteria capable of synthesizing a vast
amount of membrane proteins and supporting extensive internal membrane
structures. Membrane proteins are of significant medicinal importance. However,
efforts to study membrane proteins are often hampered by their low level of
biosynthesis. An efficient membrane protein overexpression system will
facilitate their biochemical and biophysical characterization. This will allow
for the economical mass production of membrane proteins essential for large-
scale structural genomics effort as well as for industrial applications.

The commercial impact of the project will be on drug discovery work by
biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Additional impact will be in areas
of biology and physiology where processes are modulated by membrane proteins
(for example, in agriculture).
