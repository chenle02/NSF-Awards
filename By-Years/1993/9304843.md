9304843 Edmond Unrestricted access and sampling is currently possible in the
great rivers of the Russian Far East. Two very successful expeditions have taken
place to the Aldan, the major tributary of the Upper Lena (1991), and to the
Kolyma (1992). All significant tributaries were sampled for water chemistry and
for their suspended and bed material. The data now available for the Aldan
system clearly show the effects of frost cracking in accelerating weathering in
this periglacial environment. The Archean Aldan Shield appears to weather at
rates at least an order of magnitude faster than its Tropical analogue, The
Guayana Shield in the Orinoco drainage. Similarily the rates of weathering of
the platform carbonates of the Lena Plateau are not inhibited by the low
temperatures. Concentration levels during the period of summer flow are
comparable to those of the Yangtze, which drains geologically similar terrain.
These comparison give insight on the effects of climatic deterioration on the
geochemical cycle, a topic of much general interest at the present time. It is
planned to extend this work to the main stem of the Upper Lena and to the other
large rivers of the region, the Indigrika, Yana, Anadyr and Amur. ***
