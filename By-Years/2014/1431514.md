The investigator, a post-doctoral researcher, will work under the guidance of
his faculty mentor to investigate the history of systems biology in the post
World-War-II period, from 1945 to 1975 . The project will focus on models and
projections of global population growth and resource utilization using the
systems approach. The results of this project will enable further research and
evaluation of particular systems applications and indicate whether the systems
approach will be useful in these conditions.

There is a strong potential for broad impact on our understanding and
implementation of contemporary systems thinking in other areas such as climate
change and genomics. One potential source of improvement derives from
understanding the causes of the apparent failures of systems biology in the
period under investigation; an analysis of these apparent failures could be
useful to current systems scholars. The results of this research will have
practical value to policy planners and managers.
