This research is aimed at continuation of a study on 3-dimensional (3D) motion
analysis with current emphasis on performance analysis and evaluation. Two new
problems with regard to motion will be pursued. The first problem is the
matching of corresponding regions in consecutive images and the generation of a
3D object model from the image sequence. The model and the matching will take
into consideration occlusion, hidden faces and shape changes of object faces
caused by 3D rotation. The second problem is the computation of velocity field
(optical flow) using linear or nonlinear shape change constraints instead of the
conventional smoothness constaints. On a more practical level, rule-based system
for 3D shape recovery and orientation determination from a single perspective
view will be developed. The system is expected to have possibly 100 heuristic
rules dealing with parallel lines, perpendicular lines, right corners, junction
interpretations, geometric configurations, skewed symmetry, etc. Certainty
factors will be assigned to the rules and evidences, control strategies will be
devised, and the rule-based system will be implemented and tested on fairly
complex 3D objects.
