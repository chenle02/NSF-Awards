9357424 Scherer In this National Science Foundation Young Investigator project
in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,
Norbert Scherer of the University of Pennsylvania will use time-domain
spectroscopic techniques to study the role of solvents on chemical reaction
dynamics in dense media and at interfaces. New solvent-selective optical and
far-infrared (FIR) time-domain techniques will be developed to elucidate solvent
involvement in chemical reactions on a molecular level in liquid, supercritical
fluid, glass, and biological media. Scanning tunneling microscopy will be used
in combination with femtosecond multiple-pulse techniques for the atomic
specific detection of chemical processes at interfaces. %%% Through the results
of experiments conducted under this research program Scherer will obtain a
better understanding on a microscopic level of how molecules collide, exchange
energy, and undergo chemical reaction in liquid and fluid media and at
interfaces. The information and broader perspective obtained from these studies
have the potential for directly observing and controlling chemical processes at
the atomic level. This in turn has implications in such diverse areas as
nanoscale fabrication of materials and destruction of toxic wastes. ***
