9708107 Datta This FRG project is multidisciplinary, involving elements of
Chemistry, Physics, Engineering and Materials Science, to address research on
Linked Cluster Networks-2D lattices consisting of nm-sized gold clusters
electronically linked by pi-conjugated organic molecules. The project includes
research to explore and exploit unique properties of LCN's for device
applications such as interconnects, opto-electronic devices and sensors. Three
areas will be emphasized(i)self-assembled LCN's that can form the interconnect
networks for high density integrated circuits, (ii)programmable LCN's whereby
the conductivity in selected regions can be increased by orders of magnitude by
doping and controlled with an external optical signal, (iii)exploration of a new
class of nanoscale LCN-based chemical sensors whose conductivity can be changed
by orders of magnitude in the presence of particular chemical species--because
of their high surface to volume ratio these chemical sensors are anticipated to
be have speed and sensitivity advantages. The project is co-supported by five
NSF programs, and the MPS OMA(Office of Multidisciplinary Activities). %%% This
project addresses forefront research issues in an interdisciplinary area of
science and engineering having high technological relevance. The research will
contribute basic knowledge at a fundamental level to important aspects of
materials and devices, and will provide improved understanding and a basis for
designing and producing improved materials and structures for devices of the
future. An important feature of the program is the integration of research and
education through the training of students in a fundamentally and
technologically significant area. ***
