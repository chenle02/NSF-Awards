This collaborative investigation with J. D. Walker of University of Kansas will
study structural and geochronological events on the eastern side of the Sierra
Nevada in east-central California. The research will address the chronology of
formation of the Sierran Arc during the Mesozoic and the timing of major
deformation episodes in the eastern Sierran thrust system. U/Pb dating of
zircons from selected volcanic and intrusive rocks in the region will provide
the time constraints. The results of this study will have broad implication for
the evaluation of continental margin magmatic arcs in this and other tectonic
settings.
