Developing the conceptual foundations for conserving biological diversity in a
rapidly changing and uncertain world requires understanding of the linkages
among the drivers of species distributions, ecological systems, economic
activities, and land-use change. Despite common objectives and recognition of
the need for this integration, research in each of these areas commonly proceeds
independently. Support for the Biodiversity Conservation in Dynamic Landscapes
(BCDL) Research Coordination Network will enable a 5-year interdisciplinary
program of collaboration directed towards coordinating research in ecology,
economics, policy, land-use, and operations research needed to catalyze the
development of an interdisciplinary conceptual framework for biodiversity
conservation. The BCDL Network will: (1) identify important gaps in theory and
data that limit our ability to plan for new biological reserves and anticipate
future patterns of habitat distribution in human-dominated landscapes; (2)
coordinate the development of new tools and methods that link ecological,
economic and land-use change dynamics, and incorporate key uncertainties into
conservation decisions; (3) develop a successful clearing house for tools and
other resources needed to advance the scientific basis for biodiversity
conservation; and (4) train a cadre of graduate students and early career
scientists in quantitative interdisciplinary methods relevant to understanding
and conserving complex ecological systems within a dynamic framework.

The BCDL Network addresses a fundamental limitation of current conservation and
development approaches and will bridge the gap between conservation and land use
change theory and practice. The Network will provide interdisciplinary training
opportunities for graduate students and early career scientists and is committed
to increasing participation in the Network by under-represented communities.
