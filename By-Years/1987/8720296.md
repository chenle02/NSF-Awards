This is the final phase of a project involving texts, a substantial dictionary,
and a grammar of Penobscot, an Eastern Algonquian language still spoken in
Maine. Preparation of the source texts has been completed under a previous
grant, a preliminary version of the dictionary is already in existence, and a
substantial part of the grammar has been written. This project will bring the
dictionary and grammar to completion. This work is important to linguists
dealing with American Indian languages, because no such dictionary and grammar
exists for an Eastern Algonquian language. The project has also been fruitful
for speakers of Penobscot, who have participated in the preparation of these
materials. In addition to the reference materials about their language, a side-
product of this project has been the preparation of a two-volume spelling book
for Penobscot children.
