9723830 Downs The biosynthesis of thiamine in Salmonella typhimurium serves as
a good model system to address pathway integration since several metabolic
pathways impinge on thiamine synthesis and several pathway redundancies have
been discovered. These redundancies include the THI pathway for formation of the
pyrimidine moiety of thiamine that is the focus of this work. This project seeks
to genetically and biochemically characterize steps in the THI pathway for the
conversion of aminoimidazole ribotide to hydroxymethyl pyrimidine by: i)
identifying mutants defective in this pathway, ii) sequencing the loci affected
by these mutations, and iii) initiating studies to address the biochemical role
of the respective gene products. The inhibition of this pathway that occurs when
cells are grown with fructose as a sole carbon source will also be addressed. To
accomplish these objectives, modern chemical, biochemical, molecular biological
and genetic techniques will be employed. Results of this comprehensive study of
the biochemical, genetic, and regulatory components of the THI pathway will
provide insights into a number of areas related to pathway integration. A
fundamental question in cell biology is how metabolic pathways are integrated
and controlled to produce a balanced, efficient metabolism. The long term goal
of this research is to gain a molecular understanding of regulatory and
metabolic interactions amongst pathways using thiamine synthesis in the
bacteruim Salmonella typhimurium as a model system. Understanding of such
metabolic integration underlies efforts to predict the response of cells to
environmental change and developmental switches, efforts to develop metabolic
modeling systems and efforts targeting metabolism for rational drug design
and/or production of small molecules. Ultimately this work will contribute to
the understanding of global metabolic strategies that S. typhimurium uses to
survive in its natural environment. These strategies are expected to be
representativ e of those used by other cells to respond to developmental and
environmental stimuli.
