The principal investigator will continue his work relating various measures of
dimension (e.g. Hausdorff and packing measures) to fractal objects of
probabilistic origin (specific stochastic processes). The investigator wishes to
extend the theory in two directions: firstly, to subsets of the d dimensional
lattice and random walks on this lattice; and secondly, to the study of the
sample paths of measure valued diffusions. Since recent developments in physics
in which ideas involving fractals and their dimension play a prominent role, the
work could have important implications for physicists.
