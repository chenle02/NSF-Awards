Dr. Charles G. Riordan, Chemistry Department, University of Delaware is
supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program to develop
develop homogeneous, coordination complexes of nickel that activate dioxygen
under mild conditions. A series of monovalent nickel complexes supported by
poly(thioether)borato ligands will be allowed to react with O2 to generate
thermally-sensitive, reduced oxygen intermediates. The molecular and electronic
structure of these intermediates will be studied using low temperature
spectroscopic techniques including UV-visible, resonance Raman, X-ray absorption
and X-ray diffraction analyses. These results will be interpreted using density
functional theory to define the reaction landscape of the nickel-oxygen species
to establish geometric- and electronic-structure function correlations.
Concomitant experiments will explore nickel-based activation of
relatedsubstrates, e.g. elemental sulfur, phosphorous and diazenes,
RN=NR.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Selective oxidation of organic substrates generally
increases their utility in the chemical and pharmaceutical arenas. Oxidations
employing O2 represent attractive and environmentally responsible approaches.
The approach is inspired by an appreciation of the activity and chemical
selectivity with which metalloproteins utilize dioxygen to synthesize new
molecules. Outcomes from the studies will have broad implications to industrial
and biological oxidation processes. The breadth of the research experience will
provide excellent intellectual and technical training for students in organic
and inorganic synthesis, physical measurements and kinetic and mechanistic
aspects of inorganic chemistry. The experience will prepare students for careers
in either industry or academia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
