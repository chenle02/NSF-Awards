This project represents a continuation of research previously supported by NSF
Grant EAR84-08421, involving detailed structural studies of geological materials
using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry. Specific objectives of the
project include: (1) continued studies of structurally complex crystalline
phases such as feldspars (particularly e-plagioclase and alkali feld- spars) and
mixed-layer clays; (2) studies of structures and phase transitions in silicate
minerals at elevated temperatures (up to 700>C); and (3) studies of structural
states of aluminosilicate glasses quenched from high pressures. The results of
these studies will enhance our understanding of the fundamental properties and
behavior of geological materials.
