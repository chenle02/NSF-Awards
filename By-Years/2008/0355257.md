This research focuses on the manipulation of two-electron interactions within
atoms and coherent collisions between atoms. The project is part of a larger
effort within the PI's group that focuses on using lasers to control and observe
quantum dynamics in atoms and molecules, an area of considerable current
interest in fundamental physics research. In one set of experiments, electronic
wavepacket control techniques will be used to investigate electron dynamics in a
three-body Coulomb system, a long-standing problem in quantum and classical
physics with no known general solution. A second line of experiments will test
the general applicability of a variant of frequency-domain scaled-energy
spectroscopy for investigating complex multi-configurational two-electron
dynamics in the presence of strong static electric fields. In a third group of
experiments, the transfer of atomic coherence via resonant Rydberg-Rydberg atom
collisions will be explored. The broader impact involves the education of both
graduate and undergraduate students.
