9314313 Witten This award will partially support participation junior
researchers and postdocs in the First World Congress on Computational Medicine,
Public Health and Biotechnology, to be held in Austin, Texas, April 24-28. This
congress is being organized by the Center for High Performance Computing at the
University of Texas. The objective of this conference is to bring together a
transdisciplinary group of both junior and senior researchers in the field of
computational biology and medicine to present their work. The performance of
current high performance computing systems allows researchers to begin to model
biological complexity with more realistic models. ***
