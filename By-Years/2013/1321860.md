This project will quantify the temporal and spatial variation of the global
reconnection rates for a large range of solar wind conditions. The reconnection
rate will be calculated by using the change in the magnetic flux that crosses
the open-to-closed field line boundary. The calculation will make use of
satellite images to determine the polar cap boundary and its changes while
SuperDARN observations and the AMIE technique will be used to calculate polar
cap convection. The AMIE technique uses ground magnetic observations. The
calculations will give the reconnection rates for both magnetopause and
magnetotail reconnection. They will be carried out for a wide range of
magnetospheric activity including steady magnetospheric convection events,
substorms and CME and CIR storms. They will create in SuperMAG a repository of
the observations and code that will allow calculations of reconnection
potentials for any solar wind and magnetospheric conditions.

The work will support a graduate student and the team at APL will continue to be
active in STEM education at all levels.
