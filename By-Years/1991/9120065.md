This proposal focuses on interactions between ponderosa pine and four species
that feed upon it. These include the Abert squirrel, the porcupine, the dwarf-
mistletoe and the bark beetle. All four species feed on pine phloem, thereby
causing severe loss of vigor and mortality in this pine. We test the hypothesis
that each species selects different ponderosa pine phenotypes. Results will
provide a clearer understanding of the complex consequences of multi-species
interactions natural communities. In addition, they will allow forest managers
throughout the western USA to better protect these commercially important
forests from damage by these species.
