Dr. Floyd D. McDaniel of North Texas State University will visit Dr. Valeriu
Zoran of the Central Institute for Physics, Bucharest, Romania to develop plans
for a joint research effort involving both the experiment and theoretical
calculations associated with various ion-atom collision mechanisms and the
resulting production of x-rays and Auger electrons. The resulting proposal is
intended for consideration under the National Science Foundation's U.S.-Romania
Cooperative Science Program.
