AST 9530397 Globular Cluster Evolution. The goal of Dr. Chernoff's theoretical
research program is to find plausible evolutionary models for globular clusters,
incorporating the most important physical processes with sufficient accuracy to
make meaningful comparisons with observations. Dr. Chernoff will model the
evolution of globular clusters including the effects of 1) collisional
relaxation; 2) a stellar mass spectrum; 3) stellar evolution; 4) Galactic tides;
and 5) binary stars. The main tool for the modeling is a Monte- Carlo code which
follows particles through a global potential and approximates the effects of
collisions via random forces. ========================================
