This project includes two national surveys of science and mathematics teachers.
In the first survey, teachers who participated in the 1985-86 National Survey of
Science and Mathematics Education but have since left the teaching profession
will be interviewed by telephone about attitudes toward teaching, and salary and
working conditions while teaching and in their current occupation. For
comparison purposes, a subsample of those who are still teaching will also be
interviewed. As a result of this research, a better understanding of the
relative importance of various factors in decisions to leave teaching will be
gained, and potentially effective strategies for decreasing the attrition rates
of science and mathematics teachers will be identified. The second survey will
be conducted in conjunction with the National Assessment of Educational Progress
(NAEP). NAEP already plans to collect data from the mathematics teachers of each
eighth grade student included in the 1990 mathematics national assessment. This
project will enable NAEP to collect data from eighth grade science teachers as
well, allowing investigation of the relationship between teacher and classroom
characteristics and student performance in science. In addition, after adjusting
the teacher weights appropriately, this project will provide estimates of the
course background preparation and other characteristics of science and
mathematics teachers in the nation as a whole.
