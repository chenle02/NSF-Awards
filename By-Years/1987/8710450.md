This researcher plans to develop a group of studies exploring the role of
similarity, reciprocity, and proximity in black adolescent friendships. She will
prepare to study personality and attitudinal similarity of reciprocal, non-
reciprocal and non-friend dyads. Research questions to be addressed include:
what types of similarities result in stable relationships? do these qualities
change from early to late adolescence? She will also study cross-race and cross-
sex friendships to see if they differ from same race and same sex relationships.
Other studies will be concerned with ethnic and gender patterns in adolescent
use of friends as social support. During the period of the planning grant, she
will develop and refine existing measures of friendship and will consult with
social interaction researchers.
