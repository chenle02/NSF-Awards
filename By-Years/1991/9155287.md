The Bakken, A Library and Museum of Electricity in Life, will offer a four-year
enhancement program for twenty (20) under- prepared science teachers in physics
and physical sciences, grades 8-12. The program covers optics, acoustics, and
electricity in a series of five-week institutes conducted at The Bakken in
Minneapolis, Minnesota, followed by a year of independent study by the teachers
and results in graduate credits from the University of Minnesota. The program
focus is designed to increase hands-on experimentation and to stress the
investigative nature of the experiments through an historical approach. Students
will repeat famous discoveries using inexpensive copies of historical
instruments and explore links between physics, mathematics, biology, and art. As
a follow-up to the project, teachers will continue to be supplied with
instructional materials and samples of new instruments, and receive issues of a
newsletter in which teachers share information and experiences.
