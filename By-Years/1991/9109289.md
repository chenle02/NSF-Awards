Although powerful tools for numerical, statistical, and symbolic computation are
readily available, there has not emerged a comprehensive and widely used
environment for combinatorial computing of comparable influence. The goal of
this project is to meet this need. The system Combinatorica was developed as a
combinatorial computing environment, comprising over 230 functions for
manipulating graphs and other combinatorial objects such as permutations,
partitions, and Young tableaux. Combinatorica has already been applied to
research in algorithms, biology, graph theory, number theory and engineering, as
well as education. However, it is but a prototype for the ultimate combinatorial
computing environment. Three significant research issures will be addressed
which are fundamental to the development of future combinatorial computing
environments. First, a method will be investigated to effectively compute NP-
complete graph invariants through graph recognition and inversion, by
identifying special classes graphs for which there exist efficient algorithms.
Second, efficient combinatorial search techniques will be developed for sub-
graph isomorphism, graph minors, and graph homeomorphism - fundamental
primitives which have not been implemented in full generality in any existing
combinatorial computing environment. Finally, graph algorithms will be developed
for applicative or write-once machines, which experience shows to be a more
accurate computational model for term-rewriting systems than random access
machines. These algorithms will form the heart of the proposed next version of
Combinatorica to be written in C++ and X-windows and comprising both a workbench
and library for combinatorial computing.
