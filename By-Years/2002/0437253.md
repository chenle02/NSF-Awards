This project will examine the influence of the Madden Julian Oscillation on the
warm-season precipitation of Central and North America, will develop a dynamical
framework for understanding this relationship, and will make a preliminary
assessment of the degree to which the Madden Julian Oscillation may provide
predictability to precipitation over the Americas. This forecasting problem
covers the time-scales between synoptic and seasonal. Three sets of analyses
will be conducted: empirical analysis of the Madden Julian Oscillation during
the course of its life cycle; diagnostic analysis of dynamics and
thermodynamics; and an assessment of the potential predictability based on its
phase propagation. Predictability of regional precipitation at and beyond two
weeks based on the Madden-Julian-Oscillation is expected to result in
economically and societally relevant impacts for Central and North America. This
ranges from flood and fire risks to air quality.
