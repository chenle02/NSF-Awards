This project involves two important classes of Kac-Moody algebras, the affine
and the hyperbolic. The principal investigator will study the multiplicities in
hyperbolic algebras, as well as, work on constructing the remaining exceptional
algebras. The research is in the general area of Lie algebras. Fruitful
connections have been found between the Kac-Moody Lie algebras and other areas
of mathematics and physics which makes this a particularly attractive area. The
proposed research deals with many central issues in this active and exciting
area.
