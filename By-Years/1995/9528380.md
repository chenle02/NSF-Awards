ABSTRACT CTS-9528380 Flow visualization and heat transfer studies of gas-liquid-
solid fluidization at pressure up to 22 MPa and temperature up to 200( C will be
conducted. The effect of changing the pressure and temperature in three-phase
fluidized beds will be investigated. An experimental apparatus has been built to
enable PIV visualization and thermal transport experiments. Bubble motion,
coalescence and break-up processes will be analyzed based on the measurements.
Regime transitions, incipient fluidization, phase holdups and bed
expansion/contraction phenomena will be determined for the fluidization system.
The local heat transfer characteristics in three-phase flow will be measured
using a microfoil heal flow sensor. This project is proposed to be conducted in
collaboration with four industrial units (Shell Development Co., Amoco Oil Co.,
Hydrocarbon Research Inc., and Exxon R&D Co.), under the Grant Opportunities for
Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) initiative. The project will lead to new
knowledge for three-phase flow, with application to design and operation of
hydrocarbon processing in fluidized bed reactors of relevance in oil industry.
