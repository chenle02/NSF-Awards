ABSTRACT OPP-9422070 HUNTINGTON This research project will document traditional
ecological wisdom of beluga whales in native villages in NW Alaska, and in
Chukotka, Russia. The objectives are to gather information on the natural
history of beluga whales, including aspects of human use and interaction. A
primary focus will be to examine patterns and changes over time, providing a
temporal depth that is unavailable in the scientific literature. While
traditional knowledge is often discussed, little research of this kind has been
done in Alaska and Chukotka. This is also a pilot project of the Arctic
Environmental Protection Strategy and is intended to demonstrate how indigenous
knowledge can be documented and incorporated into this and other management and
conservation programs. ??
