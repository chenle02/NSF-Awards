9305630 Kimia This is the first year of a three-year continuing award. The
research addresses the problem of shape description to support the recognition
of objects from their two-dimensional profiles. Classically, object recognition
is plagued with problems due to variations of the projected objects from the
ideal model due to partial occlusion, movement of object parts, degradation due
to noise, changes in viewpoint and viewing direction, shadows, and other
effects. This project addresses these problems with a general purpose
representation for shape which embeds these variations in the form of
deformations and is derived from first principles. An object recognition system
will be implemented based on this framework. The theoretical effort is focused
on extending the framework to the analysis and representation of surfaces in
three-dimensions. The final result should support object recognition for the
complex problems that arise in industrial applications in addition to those that
arise in more general machine vision.
