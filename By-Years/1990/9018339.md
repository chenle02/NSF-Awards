This award provides 50% funding for the acquisition of a specialized
temperature control system to be incorporated in the high-temperature-pressure
laboratory in the Department of Geology and Geophysics at the University of
Wisconsin. The system will automatically control the temperature of 20 pressure
vessels during long-term experiments. The laboratory is devoted primarily to the
investigation of the aqueous solubility of minerals under temperature and
pressure conditions comparable to those existing in the Earth's crust.
