The project is concerned with developing problem-solving software that is based
on genetic algorithms (GA) and classifier- systems (CS). This software models
adaptive systems that operate in complex non-linear environments in the
following manner: (1) Goal-directed action involves the construction, testing,
and use of internal, forward-predicting models of the environment, and the
constant adaptation of such models to the changes of the environment. (2) A tag
on a classifier give it a recognizable identity, so classifiers can learn to
cooperate, as in a forward- predicting model. //
