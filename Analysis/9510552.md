The investigator and his colleagues organize the second Mississippi State
Conference on Differential Equations and Computational Simulations. Nine invited
lectures will be delivered by Professors K. J. Brown from Heriot-Watt
University, Scotland, (Title: Nonlinear boundary value problems involving an
indefinite weight function); Luis Caffarelli from Princeton University, (Title:
Volume and rotation in Lagrangian coordinates); David Caughey from Cornell
University, (Title: Iterative convergence and accuracy of numerical solutions of
the Euler equations); Jerome Eisenfeld from University of Texas, (Title:
Structural identification of compartmental models); Jack Hale from Georgia Tech,
(Title: Convergence of Invariant Manifolds); Peter D. Lax from NYU-Courant
(Title: Positive schemes for solving multi-dimensional hyperbolic systems of
conversation laws); Robert MacCormack from Stanford University, (Title: Solution
of the Navier-Stokes' equations on block grids for aerodynamic configurations;
John Mallet-Paret from Brown University, (Title: Dynamics of lattice
differential equations) and Helen Yee from NASA Ames Research Center, (Title: On
the fundamental of dynamics of numerics for CFD). In addition, about 75
contributed papers are expected. The Journal of Applied Mathematics and
Computation, is devoting a special issue to the publication of the proceedings
of this conference. This multidisciplinary conference brings together
mathematicians, scientists and engineers from both academia and industry for the
purpose of exchanging research developments in the theory and application of
differential equations and computer simulations. Central themes include
materials-related phenomena and computational fluid dynamics, with an emphasis
on numerical methods applicable to practical problems arising in engineering.
