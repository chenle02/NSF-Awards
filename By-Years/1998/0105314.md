The discrete spectrum of the Laplacian on the modular surface and the
associated eigenfunctions (called Maass wave forms) are an interesting and basic
class of functions which nevertheless remain mysteriously elusive fifty years
after their discovery. While numerical approximations exist, concrete analytic
information is somewhat scarce; in particular, at present no explicit
constructions exist for any of these eigenfunctions. These mathematical objects
are of interest in such seemingly diverse fields as number theory in mathematics
and dynamical systems, statistical mechanics, and quantum chaos in theoretical
physics. The starting point for this project is a new class of functions
equivalent to the Maass forms, called period functions in analogy with the
period polynomials associated to the classical modular forms of integral weight.
These functions, discovered by the investigator and developed individually and
more recently in collaboration with D. Zagier, are holomorphic and satisfy a
simple functional equation, and so appear to be simpler class of mathematical
objects than the Maass forms themselves. For this reason, and because the
development of their algebraic structure leads in a number of different
interrelated and intriguing directions, they show promise to continue to shed
new light on this basic problem. Their further development and the extension of
these results to general subgroups, using representation theory and cohomology
of groups, are the main goals of this project. In addition, connections between
period functions and certain equations which arise both in the study of transfer
operators for dynamical systems and in the study of spin-chain partition
functions in statistical mechanics are already under study by several
researchers, including one working group in Germany which is specifically
investigating these questions. The applications of Maass period functions to
these related areas of theoretical physics is thus also a focus of this work, to
be pursued including discussions with researchers working on these problems.

Research in mathematics and related theoretical physics will use methods
developed by the investigator and his colleagues to gain more concrete and
explicit information about Maass wave forms. These functions are one type in a
class called "modular forms" which has many applications in such diverse fields
as number theory, physics, and cryptography (or code making and breaking). Maass
wave forms in particular are the non-Euclidean version of the sine waves (or
pure tones - the wave form produced by striking a tuning fork) in ordinary
space, which are the basic components out of which all shapes are built. The
study of geometry and physics in this non- Euclidean "parallel universe" has
provided science with a rich source of new ideas, as well as a contrasting
proving ground on which to sharpen ideas in the geometry and physics of the
space we live in. For example, the study of the behavior of Maass forms provides
very useful insights in the quest to gain a deeper understanding of the
conditions under which a physical system will exhibit regular or chaotic
behavior, an important and pervasive question in physics. Maass forms have
proven mysteriously hard to construct explicitly, and continue to be under
active investigation fifty years after their discovery.
