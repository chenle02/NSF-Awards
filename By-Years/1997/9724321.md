This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will assist the
Department of Chemistry at Bowdoin College to acquire a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number
of areas which include enantioselective catalysis, b-amino acid synthesis,
organometallic synthesis, organic photochemistry, and oxidative phosphorylation.
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms
within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in
solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists
who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are
useful in the areas such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
