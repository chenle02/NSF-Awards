This theoretical modelling study is on the fluid mechanics which govern the
motion of sensory receptor elements in the inner ear. The inner ear has auditory
organs for hearing, and vestibular organs for postural equilibrium. All the
receptor cells of the ear (and of the lateral-line organs of aquatic
vertebrates) are hair cells, named for their microscopically small bundles of
hairlike structures called cilia that extend into the fluid of the ear. In
hearing, when sound enters the ear, mechanical linkages convert the sound
pressure to displacement of fluids and membranes in chambers of the inner ear.
Interaction of the fluid with the ciliary tufts involves mechanical forces that
are important to understand at the microscopic level, to relate these forces and
displacements to the activation of the sensory receptor cells. These theoretical
studies will assess how motion of the hair bundles is affected by 1) fluids of
the inner ear; 2) hydro- dynamic coupling to nearby structures such as
membranes; 3) hydrodynamic interactions between neighboring hair bundles; 4) the
shape of the hair bundles; and 5) mechanical properties of hair bundles and the
nearby membranes. The proposed theoretical studies will involve both
mathematical analysis and numerical studies using a variety of digital computers
(including personal computers, minicomputers, and supercomputers). The approach
is to examine solutions of the euqations of fluid motion for a succession of
geometries, each designed to reveal the role of a key structural feature of hair
cell organs. The goal is to understand the motions of hair bundles in terms of
the underlying physical mechanisms, and so understand the role of mechanics in
the sensory reception necessary for hearing and equilibrium.
