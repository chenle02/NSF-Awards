An earlier model for a new mode of wave propagation in a saturated porous medium
is to be extended to explore an interior singular region of focussed pressure,
which is postulated to represent a local region of liquefaction (loss of
solidity) of the porous medium. A mathematical model of this interior region
will be developed and matched to the previously obtained exterior solution. An
experimental demonstration that pressure focusing and liquefaction is possible
in the new propagating wave mode is included in the investigation. The mechanism
of pressure focusing in a propagating wave to produce local liquefaction has
possible importance in earthquake diaqnostics and failure mechanism.
