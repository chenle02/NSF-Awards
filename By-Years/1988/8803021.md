The proposed National Engineering Design Competition (NEDC) will provide an
engineering design experience for high school students working in teams. The
purpose of this activity is to encourage and support students who are interested
in pursuing careers in engineering, technology, science, and mathematics. State
and local level competitions will be held and will focus on the application of
knowledge to real problems. Professional engineers will provide mentoring, using
tutorial seminars, for techers and students. The competition will provide
information and an experience to help the student gain a better understanding
and appreciation for engineering.
