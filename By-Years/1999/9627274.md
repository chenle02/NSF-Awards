9627274 Wilkinson The proposed conference is on the fundamental science that
will enable materials with predetermined properties to be designed from a
quantitative understanding of the relationship between microstructure and
properties. The conference format involves primarily invited speakers with
approximately one-half of each session devoted to an in-depth discussion. In
addition, a poster session will be held that will enable other attendees to
present their work. %%% The proposed conference is on the fundamental science
