The focus of this research is to develop methodology for the preparation of
porphyrins with fused pyrene rings and to test the potential for using pyrene as
a platform for connecting fused porphyrin rings. In parallel studies, the
synthesis, characterization and chemistry of carbaporphyrins will be
investigated. Other macrocyclic systems, including tropiporphyrin, will be
synthesized using "3+1" methodology and "4+1" methodology will be used to
prepare carba-analogues of expanded porphyrins. Undergraduate students will be
involved at all stages of the research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this renewal
Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) award, the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research efforts of Dr.
Timothy D. Lash of the Department of Chemistry at Illinois State University. Dr.
Lash will focus his work on the preparation of porphyrin-like chromophores and
related dimeric or oligomeric systems. Porphyrins are a class of brightly
colored heterocycles that serve a variety of functions in nature and the
synthesis of analogues opens new avenues for the preparation of compounds with
potentially interesting properties. The work will be carried out with the
collaboration of undergraduate and masters level graduate students.
