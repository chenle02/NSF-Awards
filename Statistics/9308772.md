Three research projects that explore some recent and innovative methodologies
of active interest in time series analysis are investigated. The first focuses
on the problem of obtaining robust recursive estimates for ARMA models, and will
initially address a number of important issues that arise when redescending
robust criteria are employed in the recursive procedure. In the second project,
applications and finite sample properties associated with the spectral envelope
methodology for analyzing categorical time series are investigated. The
extension of this methodology to real-valued time series is also explored. The
development and integration of exploratory time series analysis methods within
the dynamic graphical environment is considered in the final project, and
provides an effective means to perform the research involved in each project
concurrently. The development of new procedures for analyzing time series data
is an important and active area of research across a variety of disciplines.
Typically, time series analysis is equated with data that is observed
sequentially over time (eg. stock market prices, temperature), but in other
disciplines "time" may simply be a positional index that defines, for example,
the order of the base-pair codings (a,t,g,c) in DNA sequences. In this project,
three innovative approaches to time series analysis are investigated. The first
concerns the problem of retaining the ability to obtain useful information about
a time series process when aberrant observations may be present. The second
approach deals with the concept of a "spectral envelope" which provides an
objective criterion for assessing periodic patterns in qualitative series such
as DNA sequences. A large component of the research involved in both these
approaches will be incorporated into the last project where the development of
highly interactive exploratory graphical methods for time series analysis is
pursued.
