The Paleocene was an important interval in the evolution of modern families of
angiosperms and in the rapid spread of deciduous dicotyledons in the Northern
Hemisphere following the terminal Cretaceous event. This study will improve the
systematic and stratigraphic resolution of key genera shared between the
Paleocene of mid-latitude Asia and western North America. In cooperation with
the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology, selected Paleocene floras in
northwestern and northeastern China will be described with particular attention
to leaf and pollen taxa that are shared with the Paleocene of North America.
Stratigraphic sections in Wyoming that have already provided useful
palynostratigraphic sequences will be recollected for leaves, fruits and flowers
in order to link megafossils with the palynological zonation. Special attention
will be given to families of the Hamamelidae that were undergoing evolutionary
radiations through the Paleocene, including Juglandacea, Betulaceae, Ulmacea,
and Platanaceae. In addition, attempts will be made to calibrate palynological
and megafloral zones with land mammal stages and/or radiometrically dated units.
