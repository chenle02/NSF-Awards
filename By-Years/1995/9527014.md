9527014 Watson The objective of the proposed research is to increase our
understanding of accessory minerals (particularly zircon) in the physiochemical
environment of the mid- to lower-crust. This project will include a combination
of experiments, analyses of natural materials and numerical modeling. Several
sub-projects are planned, including: (1) continuation of lattice diffusion
measurements by Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy on the parent and
daughter isotopes of key isotopic systems (U-Pb, Sm-Nd, Lu-Hf); (2) calibration
of geothermometers involving zircon coexisting with a phosphate mineral; (3)
numerical modeling of crystal growth and dissolution and the processes that lead
to chemical zoning; (4) imaging of internal structures (e.g. zoning,
overgrowths) and correlation of these features with in situ isotopic analyses;
and (5) development of cathodluminescence spectroscopy (CL) in combination with
electron microprobe analysis as a means of identifying and distinguishing the
origin of various growth regions within individual zircons. The proposed work
will provide the tools and insights needed to take full advantage of accessory
minerals as recorders of the timing and temperature of crustal events.
