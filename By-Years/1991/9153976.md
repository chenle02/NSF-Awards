Children's Television Workshop is embaring on a ground- breaking experiment in
informal science education: the production of an entertaining animated series of
13 half- hour programs for Saturday morning commercial television, based on
David Macaulay's bestselling book, The Way Things Work. The audience will be
six- to eleven-year olds, with special focus on minority and economically
disadvantaged children. The series' primary goal will be to entertain children
with lively and appealing characters in a dramatic storyline, while stimulating
children's interest in the scientific principles behind the workings of familiar
machines and illustrating the action of their parts. NSF support will enable CTW
to adapt the CTW Model -- the collaborative process used in earlier NSF-
supported programs, 3-2-1 Contact and Square One Tv -- to the opportunities of
the animation format and the realities of the partnership with a commercial
network. Through a development agreement with CBS, CTW has begun the process of
developing the series concept, characters, and storylines. Upon successful
completion of this phase, production will follow with an anticipated broadcast
premiere in fall 1992. NSF's $2.36 million support will allow this project to be
possible by completing the series' funding; it will allow CTW to conduct
significant formative research and summative analyses of educational impact, and
to reach large minority and economically disadvantaged audiences through wider
promotion and the creation and distribution of complementary print materials.
