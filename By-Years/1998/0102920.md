The purpose of this proposal is to enhance the partnership between the National
Science Foundation (NSF) and the graduate community by creating a new mechanism
for ongoing and substantive communications between senior administrators at our
universities providing graduate education and the NSF. Based on the model of the
Council of Graduate Schools (CGS) Dean in Residence Program, we propose to
establish a NSF/CGS Dean in Residence. Selected through a national competition
developed and administered by the Council of Graduate Schools, the NSF-CGS Dean
in Residence, would interact with program officers in the Division of Graduate
Education (DGE) and in other divisions of the Directorate for Eduction and Human
Resources, with program officers and managers in the research directorates at
NSF, as well as with senior officials at the National Science Foundation.
Working though CGS the dean would, in turn, share with the graduate dean
community and with the broader science and engineering faculty NSF's perspective
on graduate education, particularly but not exclusively those aspects of
graduate education that NSF is attempting to strengthen or redirect through its
portfolio. The program will serve as a national model that could be adopted by
other federal agencies in the future.
