This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
continues support for research on homogeneous catalysis by Dr. George G. Stanley
of the Chemistry Department, Louisiana State University. The goal of the work is
to understand cooperativity in bimetallic catalysis by studying a dirhodium
complex that is active and selective in hydroformylation. This dicationic
complex contains a binucleating tetraphosphine ligand. The nature of the binding
site will be elucidated with the aid of molecular modeling, in addition to
experimental approaches, including kinetic, spectroscopic and isotopic labeling
studies. The results will be used to make improvements in the regio- and
enantioselectivty of the catalyst. After this stage of the research, attempts
will be made to extend bimetallic cooperativity to other catalytic reactions,
such as hydrosilylation, silylformylation, hydrocyanation, and C-C bond coupling
reactions with alkenes and alkynes. In some catalytic systems, the cooperative
action of two different metal sites has been suggested to be effective in
promoting reactions not only more quickly, but also shape-specifically. In this
project, the potential of cooperativity in catalyst design will be determined.
The ability to control reaction rates and products is very important in many
areas of chemical manufacturing, such as production of pharmaceuticals,
polymers, and fine chemicals.
