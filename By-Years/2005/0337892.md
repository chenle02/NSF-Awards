This proposal requests funding for two moorings designed to provide an
observational mesoscale context for oceanic turbulence measurements to be
obtained during the low-wind component of the Coupled Boundary Layers and Air-
Sea Transfer (CBLAST-low) experiment, which will occur during the summer and
fall of 2003 at the Martha's Vineyard Coastal Observatory (MVCO). During CBLAST-
low, direct oceanic measurements of turbulent fluxes and dissipation rates,
together with measurements of velocity, temperature, and salinity, will be
obtained at an Air-Sea Interaction Tower (ASIT), at a water depth of 15 m. The
proposed additional moorings will be placed along-isobath from the ASIT, at
separations of approximately 5 and 10 km, and will support bottom pressure
sensors and temperature-salinity sensors at mid-depth and near the surface. The
purpose of the proposed moorings is to determine the alongshore barotropic and
baroclinic pressure gradients, which will permit direct estimation of the
dominant terms in the along-isobath momentum equation.
