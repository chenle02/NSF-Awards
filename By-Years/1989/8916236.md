This award supports the measurement of the terrestrial ages of Antarctic
meteorites using chlorine-36. The work will interface with ongoing studies of
cosmogenic nuclides in extraterrestrial materials and of the exposure history of
terrestrial surface rocks. These terrestrial ages give vital information not
only on Antarctic meteorites, but also on Antarctic glaciology and geology. The
studies involve the influx rate of meteorites, the history of ice sheets, and
the pairing of meteorites. Development of the calcium-41 terrestrial age method
will also be attempted.
