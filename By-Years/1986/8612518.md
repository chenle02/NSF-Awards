This project initiates a cooperative teaching effort between the Mechanical
Engineering Department of the University and an industry. It is to enhance the
relevance and timeliness of design courses. It brings practicing design
engineers into the classroom as lecturers and takes the students into the
facilities of the industry. The students get hands-on experience with the latest
technology. Specific areas of interaction include provision for design projects
and instruction in computer-aided design. Practical experiences and case studies
are concerned with welding technology, non-standard structural materials, and
quality engineering.
