>National Leadership Institute for Teachers of Physics> is a two year project
for 30 well.prepared high school physics teachers from all regions of the United
States. The program is designed to help these teachers become familiar with
several aspects of modern physics. This is done through the use of modules which
emphasize areas of modern physics with widespread technological applications.
The four physics modules . Lasers and the Nature of Light, Lightwave
Communication, Magnetism and Magnetic Recording, and Semiconductors and
Transistors . have been developed in collaboration with scientists from AT&amp;T
Bell Laboratories and Bell Communication Research (with partial support from a
prior NSF grant). University and industrial scientists will provide background
lectures to increase the depth of teacher understanding of the modules.
Participants will be selected from among the best high school teachers in
country. Each will be required to provide assurances from local school officials
that they will be able to carry out the in.service activities needed to help
other physics teachers to become familiar with the new modules. The program
includes academic year support and second year follow.up for the leadership
teachers.
