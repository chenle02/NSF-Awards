Conference consisting of three workshops on biomedical engineering proposed by
Dr. Van Mow, Columbia University and Professor Zonglai Jian, Shanghai Jiao-Tong
University, China. The workshops are entitled the 2004 multisited Sino-American
Educational Workshops on Biomedical Engineering to be held in Beijing, Chengdu
and Shanghai, China, June 20-July 2, 2004. This is an important meeting in that
the U.S. bioengineering participants would interact with colleagues in China who
are among the best in the world. The success of this project will benefit the
U.S. and Chinese biomedical engineering communities. This conference will be
jointly supported by the NSF and the National Natural Science Foundation of
China.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
