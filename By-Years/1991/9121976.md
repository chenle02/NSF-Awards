This award is to purchase two 80386 and two i860 nodes, two disk drives, I/O
controller and 16MB memory to upgrade an Intel iPSC/2 hypercube. The equipment
will support the development of a test-bed environment to support research
projects including the verification of highly-complex protocols, the
exploitation of parallelism with an integrated relational textual and image
database, the development of a hardware design functional simulator, and the
characterization of background clutter in natural scenes. George Mason
University plans to upgrade an existing Intel iPSC/2 hypercube facility to
enable research in heterogeneous, tightly-coupled multicomputing. The proposed
equipment will be used to develop algorithms for applications requiring large
data transfer.
