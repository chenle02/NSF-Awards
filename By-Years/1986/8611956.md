The PI has proposed to conduct numerical simulation modeling of a novel scheme
to produce a high temperature, high density plasma in a configuration suitable
for x-ray lasing. His approach which is based upon implosion of concentric thin-
metal foils offers a good shot at the tantalizing goal of obtaining x-ray lasing
without requiring a national laser facility source as driver. Support through
the expedited grant will enable modeling of the various complex stages of the
excitation process, including such parameters as optimum electron temperature
for soft x-ray generation, optimum gas density for shock wave production,
ablative pressure for compression of the core cylinder, and estimate of energy
storage requirements.
