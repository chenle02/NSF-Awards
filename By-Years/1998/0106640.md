It is well established that long-range autocorrelation and heavy-tailed inter-
packet time distributions are dominant characteristics of modern multimedia high
speed network traffic, determining limits to performance and radically
influencing policies for management. Incorporating such characteristics in
parametric performance models has so far been difficult. This project will
center about the development of powerful and efficient models to capture network
behavior for varying levels of abstraction while incorporating approximations to
long-range dependence and heavy tails. The model does not solely rely on steady
state results, but rather on a finite horizon that can be used for online
monitoring and early detection of rare events. In particular, this means that
time dependent threads can be modeled which are the root cause of such
dependency related problems. Decomposability techniques will be used to decrease
the granularity if possible and to scale the model to time scales suitable for
online analysis and control. The approach will be to extend the successful and
innovative model developed for a high-speed network. Highly correlated arrival
processes can be viewed as nearly-completely decomposable processes, which in
turn impose a nearly-completely decomposable structure on the system as a whole.
Each of these nearly decomposed systems can be solved separately and in parallel
and their solutions combined to accurately evaluate the performance of the
system. Theoretical work must be done to determine error bounds and robust
algorithms for solutions in a wide range of applications, to allow flexible
approximation of measured correlations, and to broaden the classes of results
that can be computed. Additionally, experimental work must be done to exercise
models and compare them with published and other artifactual data. Finally, a
prototype software package will be developed that demonstrates the viability of
placing this tool in the hands of practicing network engineers and equipment
designers.
