Research in theoretical physics will cover a wide variety of topics, including
superstring and supersymmetry theory, lattice field theory, perturbative quantum
chromodynamics, collisions involving elementary particles, collisions involving
nuclei, statistical mechanics, and problems at the interface between classical
and quantum mechanics. This broad research program includes efforts to unify our
description of all the forces, attempts to better understand the behavior of the
elementary particles, and studies which illuminate basic physical principles by
revealing their consequences in interesting physical situations.
