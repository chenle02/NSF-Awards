The Student Mentoring to Achieve Retention: Triads in Science program (SMARTS)
at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) has as its primary goals to
encourage more underrepresented and financially disadvantaged students to
persist as science majors, complete their degrees in a timely manner, enhance
their interest in pursuing advanced degrees, and provide them with the tools
necessary to become skilled scientists and educators, so that they are able to
compete effectively in the global academic and technical workforce. To realize
these goals, the program uses an innovative approach that involves the formation
of mentoring teams consisting of one faculty member, one graduate student and
one undergraduate student (junior or senior level), who form a mentoring triad.
The program has three main objectives: 1) achieve full retention of talented but
financially disadvantaged undergraduate students (juniors and seniors) majoring
in the sciences, while significantly reducing their time to graduation; 2)
increase the number of undergraduates, particularly members of underrepresented
minorities, who elect and are well-prepared to pursue advanced degrees in the
sciences; and 3) recruit more graduate students to become educators and research
mentors in the sciences. Through the triad approach, undergraduates learn to
work effectively in teams and learn from practitioners what to expect in future
years. Graduate students hone their team-building and mentoring skills, which is
valuable as they pursue educational, leadership and managerial roles in STEM
fields. The program also enriches the professional training of graduate students
through several of the program workshops.
