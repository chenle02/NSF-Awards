This award supports the research program of the Principal Investigator in the
area of optimal design of composite materials, which are important structural
materials in manufacturing (for example). Modern technological capabilities such
as 3d-printing, micro- and nano-fabrication, allow a huge variety of material
structures to be manufactured, and one wants to know the "best" structure, or
how composite microstructures can be optimized. This project develops methods of
structural optimization of multimaterial composites. Optimal composites lead to
metamaterials that utilize the extreme properties. Optimal composites are
crucial to structural optimization because optimal designs are made from
specially tailored composites. Numerous applications call for optimal design of
multimaterial composites, but so far the vast majority of related results deals
only with two-material optimal composites because of limitations of existing
theory. This project fills this gap. Optimal microstructures of multiphase
composites drastically differ from the structures of optimal two-phase
composites. The latter have an intuitively expected topology: a strong material
always surrounds weak inclusions. In contrast, optimal three-material structures
show a large variety of patterns: they may contain a strong envelope, "hubs" of
intermediate material connected by anisotropic "pathways", and other
configurations that reveal a geometrical essence of optimality. The topologies
of optimal structures cannot be easily guessed, and the proposed research
develops a regular way to construct them.

Optimal structures and bounds for effective properties of composites are studied
by methods of convex analysis. The problem of optimal multimaterial composite
structure is formulated as a problem of constructing a quasiconvex envelope of a
multi-well Lagrangian. Two methods will be developed: a novel method of bounds
derivation that accounts for inequalities due to ordering of gradient fields in
optimal structures (weaker fields corresponding to stronger materials) and a
complementary method for building minimizing sequences that realize the bounds
to determine the structure of an optimal composite. It is assumed that fields in
the materials are known from optimality requirements derived from the bounds,
and the geometry is chosen so that these fields are compatible. Special
attention is paid to optimal 3d structures of multiphase composites; the
developed methods for structures can be used for constructing metamaterials.
