A study of the behavior of fluids in porous solids emphasizing interactions
between the walls and fluids in the micro- and meso-pore ranges. The work will
encompass statistical mechanical theory, computer simulation, and experimental
verification. The principal goals are: (1) basis understanding of the role of
slate conditions, pore material, and pore morphology on typical properties as
phase transitions, layerigtransitions, adsorption, wetting, and diffusion, and
(2) the application of the newly developed theory to suggest specificity of
adsorbent species for particular applications. Initial studies will be with
polycarbonate materials followed by experiments and theoretical studies on well
characterized ceramic materials.
