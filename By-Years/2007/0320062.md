This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop innovative
miniature con-focal laser scanning sensors for semiconductor packaging processes
by using diode laser detector array chips. There are no moving parts in this
sensor for scanning, unlike other con-focal devices. This sensor with a fast
imaging rate will be integrated with chip IC placement robot machines, to
inspect solder bump co-planarity of Flip Chip Bonding (FCB) and the ball of Ball
Grid Arrays (BGA) before packaging. BGA and FCB are used in mission critical
devices in airplanes and medical devices. To ensure quality of the packaging,
semiconductor-packaging companies demand lower cost, smaller, fast imaging
optical sensors in the automatic optical co-planarity inspection instruments to
ensure the reliability and quality of package assembly.

The electronics industry's demands for increasing circuit density, higher levels
of integration and improved cost/performance capabilities have led to the
proliferation of the use of BGA and FCB. This will reduce chip failures and
system failures. These high reliability devices may eventually save lives and
improve the quality of life.
