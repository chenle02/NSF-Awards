Abstract for award DMS-0400449 of Goncharov

Professor Goncharov continues his study of the arithmetic aspects of
polylogarithms and their generalizations, such as multiple polylogarithms and
quantum polylogarithms, special values of L-functions of algebraic varieties,
motivic fundamental groups, moduli spaces and higher quantum Teichmuller theory.
Professor Goncharov investigates the structure of the motivic fundamental group
of the projective line punctured at zero, infinity and all N-th roots of unity
and its surprising relationship with the geometry and topology of modular
varieties and mathematical physics. The arithmetic, side of the problem concerns
the action of the absolute Galois group on the pro-l completion of the
fundamental group of the projective line punctured as above. The analytic aspect
of the story concerns the properties of multiple zeta values and their
generalizations, multiple polylogarithms evaluated at N-th roots of unity. The
relationship with the geometry of modular varieties as well as with mathematical
physics are new tools to study this problem. Professor Goncharov investigates
the higher quantum Teichmuller theory, which studies some new moduli spaces of
G-local systems on a surface S, where G is a split reductive group, and its non-
commutative deformations. This theory unites many different aspects of the
representation theory which appear when S is simple but the group is general,
and the classical Teichmuller theory corresponding to the case when G is the
simplest possible, that is the group of two by two matrices, while S is general.
The quantisation of these moduli spaces is governed by the motivic and quantum
dilogarithms, and thus provides an example of fruitful relationship between
mixed motives and mathematical physics.

This research is in the area of arithmetic algebraic geometry, which is the
branch of mathematics that is concerned with questions about the integers, but
approaches them using the ideas coming from investigation of geometric shapes.
It is a modern version of number theory, which is a very old subject, but is
full of difficult problems and significant conjectures. The theory of systems of
polynomial equations with integer coefficients is important for many
applications including questions in cryptography and coding theory. Just
recently, ideas from physics started to influence the subject. The proposer will
use the latest techniques in number theory, algebraic geometry and mathematical
physics to study the L-functions and their special values at integer points.
