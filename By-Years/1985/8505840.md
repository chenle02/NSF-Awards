This research develops further the Shah correlation for boiling heat transfer in
vertical tubes. Numerous attempts have been made in the past to develop
correlations but only two have been demonstrated to agree with data for a wide
variety of fluids and conditions. The proposed study is aimed at improving the
Shah correlation to extend its range and give increased confidence in its use.
