Wheeler, J. Craig AST 94-17083 This program of research is directed at
understanding the non-linear effects of tidal interaction of stars. Mixing of
stellar interiors and non-linear excitation of various modes of stellar
oscillations and surface waves will be studied using a three-dimensional, high
resolution, finite-difference numerical technique. Excitation, stripping and
disruption of stars passing by massive Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes will
be simulated, taking into account relativistic effects, realistic equation of
state and nuclear reactions. Disruption limits for various kinds of stars will
be obtained, including multiple encounters of captured stars with the black hole
and the disruption of white dwarfs and neutron stars on circular orbits.
Implications for fueling of massive black holes, supernova scale explosions
triggered by tidal interaction, and gravitation wave radiation will be
considered. ***
