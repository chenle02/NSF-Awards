The project deals with the processing of high Tc ternary oxide superconducting
material into wire. Yba2Cu3O7 powder will be used as the starting material. It
will be consolidated in a metal sleeve (preferably a noble metal or an alloy of
the same) and hydrostatically extruded into a wire. The resulting wire will be
characterized for structure, chemistry, and mechanical and superconducting
properties.
