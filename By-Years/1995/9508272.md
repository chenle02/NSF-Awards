Dissertation Research: Reconstruction of Later Quaternary Paleoclimates of the
Central Great Plains Using Magnetic and Non-Magnetic Parameters This
dissertation-improvement award supports rock-magnetic analysis, radiocarbon
dating, and carbon isotope analysis of materials extracted from two sites in
south-central Nebraska. The purpose of the analysis is to reconstruct climate
and climate change during the late Quaternary period. The central Great Plains
has experienced major climatic and associated environmental change during this
period. Little high-resolution climatic proxy record exists for the region,
largely reflecting a lack of traditional information sources (such as peat bogs
or natural lakes for botanical micro- and macro-fossil analysis). An alternative
source of proxy information is available in the nearly continuous loess and
paleosol sequences in the region. These will be the sources of the material to
be analyzed in the dissertation research. The results will include a high-
resolution climatic reconstruction where none currently exists, better
parameterization of rock-magnetic measurements, and combination of contrasting
proxies in a single climatic record.
