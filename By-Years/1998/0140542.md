The investigator has discovered that, for extremely large input&lt;br/&gt;
sizes, modern factorization algorithms such as the number-field sieve&lt;br/&gt;
can be carried out with far less memory per processor than was&lt;br/&gt;
previously believed. Consequently, for extremely large values of d,&lt;br/&gt;
the number-field sieve can factor 3d-digit numbers at the same cost&lt;br/&gt;
that was previously believed to be required for d-digit numbers. The&lt;br/&gt;
investigator is studying the practical effectiveness of this&lt;br/&gt;
discovery for small input sizes, such as 1024 bits and 1536 bits. The&lt;br/&gt;
investigator is also continuing his research into the fundamental&lt;br/&gt;
computational tools in commutative rings of Krull dimension
1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The number-field sieve is the best known attack on many
public-key&lt;br/&gt; cryptosystems used to protect the secrecy and authenticity
of&lt;br/&gt; Internet communications. Understanding the power of this algorithm
is&lt;br/&gt; essential in choosing safe key sizes for the cryptosystems. If,
for&lt;br/&gt; example, criminals can factor integers as large as 1024 bits,
then&lt;br/&gt; users must choose key sizes larger than 1024
bits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This award is being cofunded by the Algebra, Number
Theory, and &lt;br/&gt; Combinatorics Program and the Numeric, Symbolic, and
Geometric&lt;br/&gt; Computation Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
