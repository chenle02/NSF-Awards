Geometry plays a fundamental role in different areas of mathematics, physics,
and other scientific disciplines. A central and deeply studied concept in our
modern approach to geometry is that of `curvature.’ Uncovering the modern
definition of curvature played a key role in the development of Einstein’s
theory of relativity over a century ago. On the other hand, the idea of
`torsion,’ is a less understood, though no less important, part of geometry.
This project will support fundamental research into geometric structures which
naturally incorporate torsion, aiming at new applications in mathematics and
physics. In addition to supporting research this award will support various
training initiatives for undergraduates and graduate students. This includes
mentorship of undergraduates to prepare them for graduate study, and
professional training and guidance for graduate students. As UC Irvine is
nationally recognized as having a diverse student body, this training will
support goals of inclusive excellence across at all higher educational
levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ricci curvature, Einstein metrics, and Ricci
flow play a central, essential, role in our understanding of geometry and
analysis, deeply influencing our understanding of a diverse array of subjects
such as heat kernels, Brownian motion, partial differential equations, low-
dimensional topology, complex geometry, algebraic geometry, and more. Taking
inspiration from a variety of new developments in topology, Riemannian geometry,
mathematical physics, and complex geometry, a natural extension of Ricci
curvature has emerged which incorporates torsion. Attendant to this are natural
generalizations of Einstein metrics and Ricci flow. The research project aims at
uncovering fundamental geometric and analytic aspects of the generalized Ricci
curvature, generalized Einstein metrics, and generalized Ricci flow, ultimately
building towards uniformization and classification results with further
applications to differential geometry, PDE, complex manifolds, and mathematical
physics. The award will aid the training of students at the undergraduate and
graduate levels, through outreach activities, by incorporating them in research
projects, and through professional training programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
