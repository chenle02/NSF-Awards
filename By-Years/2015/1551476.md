This project aims to explain how non-profit organizations, advocacy groups,
social movement organizations and other civil society organizations attract
public attention via social media. Though hundreds of thousands of organizations
produce social media messages each day, only a small fraction of these "go
viral" and reach broad segments of social media users beyond their core
audience. To explain this process, this project develops a novel theory that
combines insights from cultural sociology, social psychology, and social network
theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project develops an innovative app-based
technology in order to examine this theory. Organizations will be recruited to
use this new technology to study traffic to their Facebook pages. This project
produces an aggregate database that enables civil society organizations to learn
from the successes and failures of their peers in attracting visitors. The
organizations will share their data in order to produce what will be the largest
study of how organizations reach new audiences via social media to date. This
new methodology will enable, safe, efficient transmission of very large amounts
of high quality social science data and provides a cost effective mechanism to
address declining survey response rates that also provides a public
good.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study's unique research design will directly
benefit civil society organizations that participate by providing them with
analysis of how they might reach new audiences online. The project will also
produce a very large dataset of multiple years of interaction between hundreds
of organizations and hundreds of millions of people that will enable analysis of
a broad range of variables related to collective behavior, cultural sociology,
social psychology, and social networks. And the study will provide mentorship
and professional opportunities and training for graduate student research
assistants.
