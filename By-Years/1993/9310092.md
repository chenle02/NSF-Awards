This grant in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program is in the area of
mass spectrometry of biomolecules. Professor Lebrilla and his students will use
an external source Fourier transform mass spectrometer, FTMS, to measure gas-
phase basicities of protonated biomolecules. Semi-empirical molecular orbital
calculations will be used to determine the sites of protonation in
oligosaccharides. In addition, hydrogen/deuterium exchange reactions with chiral
alcohols will be used to determine the exact configuration of different exchange
sites on the oligosaccharides. The goal of the proposed research is to increase
our understanding of intramolecular interactions and proton migration pathways
in gas-phase biomolecules. %%% Professor Lebrilla proposes to use Fourier
transform mass spectrometry to elucidate the structure of gas-phase
biomolecules. The research involves mass spectrometry, molecular orbital
calculations and hydrogen/deuterium exchange reactions.
