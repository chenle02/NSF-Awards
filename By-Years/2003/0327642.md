This project develops a multi-scale, fluctuation-averaged, asymptotic theory for
the evolution and interaction of currents and surface gravity waves, typical of
stratified coastal shelf waters. The theory will provide a picture of how waves,
currents, and materials interact on large spatio-temporal scales. The theory
will also yield a practical three-dimensional model with which shelf dynamics
may be computationally simulated without the necessity of resolving features of
the flow on the short space and time scales typical of the primary gravity-wave
oscillations. The model aims to improve on the current computationally intensive
near-shore small-scale circulation codes, while being founded more rigorously
than large-scale models that attempt to parameterize wave effects through ad hoc
closure hypotheses.

The long term goal of this line of research is the creation of a realistic
numerical simulator the geoscience community can use to study geophysical
problems typical of the coastal and shelf environments: wave/current
climatology; the evolution and transport of sea floor beds; the transport of
pollutants; the dispersal or retention of living populations; the circulation of
heat and ocean water constituents; the intrusion of a fresh water river plume
into the ocean; and the dynamics of man-made structures.
