9304077 Howe This quantitative transmission electron microscope (TEM) at the
University of Virginia (UVa) will contain a 200 kV field emission gun (FEG),
energy dispersive x-ray spectrometer (EDS) and imaging filter (IF), with a slow-
scan charge-coupled divide (CCD) camera and parallel electron energy loss,
(PEELS) capability. This instrument will enable quantitative imaging,
diffraction and compositional analyses to be performed on all types of materials
with high spatial and energy resolution. It is essential for many materials
programs within the School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS) at UVa. UVa
has faculty and staff with sufficient expertise in TEM techniques to ensure that
the quantitative TEM is utilized for the highest quality materials research and
that it is maintained at an optimum level of performance. ***
