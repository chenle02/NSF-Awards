This Phase 1 study consists of two components: the Curriculum Research and
Development Group (CRDG) at University of Hawaii at Manoa will prepare a one
week introductory teacher institute and an expanded and improved version of
long-term support. In the second component the CRDB will develop and validate
instruments needed for a Phase 2 study. The Phase 2 study will compare the new
professional development program, using a randomized clinical trial approach, to
the existing Foundational Approaches in Science Teaching program to test for
both teacher improvement and student achievement scores.
