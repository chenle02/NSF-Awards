This conference will bring together past and present mentors of the successful
undergraduate Akamai Internship Program in Hawai'i. The Akamai Internship
Program has supported undergraduate research projects in Hawai'i to increase
participation in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) fields by
local Hawai'ians. At the conference, approximately 50 attendees consisting of
mentors and interested colleagues will distill years of experience and practice
of mentoring students and disseminate a model for mentoring that focuses on the
project an intern does as a cornerstone for providing a productive experience in
STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will produce practical mentoring tools
that can be used by the astronomy community. These tools will advance the
translation of research on learning, equity, inclusion, and persistence.
Participants will highlight the ways that they use the literature on STEM
persistence and inclusive education to design a project for their intern. The
conference will generate products that can be disseminated to the general
astronomy community. The tools will be available through the Akamai website,
presentations, and Akamai's extensive network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
