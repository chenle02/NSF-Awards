This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2). The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to advance a technology that can provide
residual antimicrobial activity against viruses, bacteria, and fungi. The
COVID-19 pandemic has heightened concerns about microorganisms of all kinds and
the limitations of current disinfecting products. The proposed project advances
translation of a spray-on technology that, when dried, leaves a thin transparent
film sticking both to the surface and to chlorine, thus enabling the surface to
be disinfected for up to a month. The film essentially extends the useful life
of chlorine-based disinfectants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will
continue development of a novel antimicrobial coating that has proven efficacy
against viruses, bacteria, and fungi. This project will optimize the product
formulation for the film and a complementary solution with reproducible residual
sanitation performance. The project will further advance the manufacturing
scale-up to ensure large volume cost-effective production capabilities for the
product and conduct field trials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
