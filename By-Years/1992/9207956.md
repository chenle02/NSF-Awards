We propose experimental and theoretical work on (1) tunnel junctions, (2)
arrays of Josephson junctions, and (3) high- temperature superconductivity. The
objectives are, respectively, (1) to understand the competition between the
pairing forces and the Coulomb energy; (2) to better understand the behavior of
arrays in the presence of quantum vortices enclosing magnetic flux; and (3) to
gain insight into the phenomena of flux motion and dissipa- tion by comparing
measurements with model calculations.
