&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Human-Computer Interaction for
Direct Brain-Computer
Interfaces&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a the
first year funding of a 3-year continuing award. Recent developments in medical
technology have brought closer the possibility of direct control of a computer
by the human brain, e.g. using recordings from electrodes placed on the scalp or
a neurotrophic electrode that is implanted in the brain. Although advances in
these biometric interface device technologies hold much promise, there are many
aspects yet to be researched. For the half-million people with locked-in
syndrome (completely paralyzed and unable to speak), and for many others with
severe and progressive disabilities such as quadriplegia or ALS, the potential
impact of BCI technology are staggering; preliminary results achieved by the PI
encourage vigorous pursuit of refinements and improvements in BCI technology. In
this project the PI's objectives will be: to establish a theoretical framework
for the field of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) research; to investigate the
effectiveness of various user interaction styles for existing brain-computer
interface device technologies; and to validate various interaction styles in two
quality-of-life application domains, a basic communications application and an
environmental control application.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
