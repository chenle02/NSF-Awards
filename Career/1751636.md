One of the most transformative technologies of our time is deep learning, a form
of machine learning that uses neural networks containing many hidden layers.
Recent success has led to breakthroughs in applications such as speech and image
recognition, nourishing public interest. However, more theoretical insight is
needed to create a rigorous scientific basis for designing and training deep
neural networks, increasing their scalability, and providing insight into their
reasoning. This project develops a new mathematical framework that simplifies
designing, training, and analyzing deep neural networks. Due to the broad
applicability of deep learning, advances made in this project will benefit a
wide range of technologies of high economic and societal impact, e.g.,
driverless cars, drug discoveries, and web searches. The mathematical theory
supporting the new algorithms will increase the acceptance of deep learning for
delicate tasks, e.g., cancer prediction and cyber-security.

This project develops a new mathematical framework for deep learning based on
the interpretation of deep learning as a dynamic optimal control problem
involving nonlinear time-dependent differential equations. This interpretation
offers a new way to analyze the successes and failures of deep learning.
Advances in deep learning will be made by adapting the wide array of tools
available for related optimal control problems, including numerical
optimization, partial and ordinary differential equations, inverse problems
theory, and parallel processing. Using these currently untapped resources
provides rigorous new ways to design and train very deep neural networks that
generalize well. Advances in optimal control will be achieved through new hybrid
regularization methods, adaptive time discretizations, and large-scale
splitting-based optimization.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
