This award will support collaborative research in algebra and number theory
between Dr. Henri Gillet, University of Illinois at Chicago, and Dr. Christian
Soule, Director of Research at the French National Center for Scientific
Research and presently at the Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques, Bures-
sur-Yvette, France. Drs. Gillet and Soule propose to investigate the
relationship between analytic and algebraic constructions which occur in
arithmetic geometry. In particular they will pursue the applications of their
previous work on arithmetic intersection theory and the arithmetic Riemann-Roch
theorem to problems in geometry and number theory. Specific areas to be studied
include the inequalities in Arakelov geometry, the Adelic Arakelov theory. Dr.
Gillet is one of the leading experts on the relationships between K-theory and
algebraic geometry, as well as on the Arakelov theory. This award will allow him
to continue a highly fruitful collaboration with an outstanding French
mathematician with complementary expertise.
