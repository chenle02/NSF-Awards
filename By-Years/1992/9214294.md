This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Nevada at Reno acquire a 500 MHz
NMR spectrometer which will be used in research investigations in the following
areas: synthetic and mechanistic aspects of artificial enzymes; sterochemistry
and chiral recognition; the bioorganic chemistry of bilirubin; homoaromaticity;
thermal rearrangements of aromatic compounds; the preparation, characterization
and reactivity of carbenes, biradicals, and nitrenes; asymmetric homogeneous
catalysis; pheromone biosynthesis; synthetic and mechanistic organometallic
chemistry. %%% Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most
powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific
arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interations
between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is
essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
