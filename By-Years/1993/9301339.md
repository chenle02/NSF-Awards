Various aspects of machine learning have been under empirical investigation for
quite some time. And, more recently, theoretical studies have become popular.
This research contributes towards the goal of understanding how a computer can
be programmed to learn by isolating features of incremental learning algorithms
that theoretically enhance their learning potential. In addition to pursuing
lines of research that have already been established with a firm base,
investigations of other topics in machine learning are initiated; for example,
investigating learning algorithms with a limited ability to remember observed
data and other information. Inductive inference is in some sense the dual of
program testing. For the inference problem, one must generalize from a finite
set of examples to an entire function or concept. The testing problem requires
the formulation of a finite test set that distinguishes a given function from
all the others in a given class. The program testing problem is more difficult
than the program equivalence problem, hence it is highly unsolvable.
Consequently, practitioners are doomed to ad hoc techniques. However, it is
possible to discuss testing strategies that give an indication of how confident
we are that the program being tested is reliable. In another vein, the
complexity of certain problems is studied. Some of the earlier work in recursive
graph theory has now been applied to the complexity of NP-hard problems. This
work is extended to problems in P. The complexity of Boolean functions is also
investigated.
