ATM-9357862 Trumbore This new National Science Foundation Young Investigator
will use measurements of 14C in detrital, soil and dissolved organic matter to
quantify the rates of carbon input, accumulation and turnover in terrestrial
ecosystems. The understanding of ecosystem carbon cycling developed from and
constrained by this data will be used to assess the effects of climate and land
use changes on terrestrial carbon storage. ***
