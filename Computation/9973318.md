The main goal of this project is to address the numerical solution of the
Navier-Stokes equations modeling the flow of incompressible Newtonian and non-
Newtonian viscous fluids and to combine the resulting methodology with
appropriate domain embedding methods to investigate the simulation of
particulate incompressible viscous fluid flows, e.g., flow of mixtures of
incompressible fluids and solid particles moving, typically, under the effect of
gravity and hydrodynamical forces. The numerical methodology will rely on the
following basic basic ingredients:

(1) Time discretization by operator splitting, (2) Treatment of advection by the
method of characteristics or reduction to a second order wave-like equation, (3)
Space approximation by finite elements, (4) Use of a distributed Lagrange
multiplier/fictitious (embedding) domain methodology to localize the solid
particles and force their rigid body motion.

Typical non-Newtonian fluids to be investigated include Maxwell and Oldroyd B.

Our goal in this project is to develop efficient methods, able to achieve the
numerical simulation of three-dimensional flow of mixtures of incompressible
viscous fluids with several hundreds to thousands of solid particles. Such large
scale simulations have the characteristics of a Grand Challenge in Scientific
Computing and success will rely on advanced computational methods implemented on
powerful parallel computers. With these simulation tools the scientific
community will be able to better understand the complicated mechanisms taking
place for example in chemical reactors and in fractured oil reservoirs. Among
the consequences of these investigations we can expect for example improved
manufacturing techniques for rubber materials and pharmaceutical drugs, and also
improved efficiency for drilling techniques used in oil Industry.
