Wireless data traffic has surged in recent years due to a change in the way
society today creates, shares, and consumes information. Accompanying this
change is an increasing demand for faster, more ubiquitous wireless
communication networks. As a result, wireless Terabit-per-second (Tbps) links
are expected to become a necessity within the next five to ten years. Terahertz
(THz)-band (0.1 to 10 THz) communication is envisioned as a key technology to
meet this demand. For many years, the lack of compact and efficient ways to
generate and detect THz-band signals limited the feasibility of such
communication systems. Ongoing advances in THz generation and detection schemes
are making sources and detectors more readily available, but no platform
currently exists to experimentally demonstrate wireless communication at true
THz frequencies. The objective of this TeraNova project is to develop the first
integrated testbed specific to ultra-broadband communication networks at true
terahertz frequencies (i.e., 1 THz and above).

The main components of the testbed are as follows. In transmission, a Schottky-
diode-based frequency multiplier and amplifier is used to generate a THz carrier
signal in the first absorption-defined transmission window above 1 THz, i.e.,
between 1 and 1.075 THz. A sub-harmonic mixer based on the same technology is
used to modulate the THz carrier signal with the broadband signal to be
transmitted, which is generated by means of a broadband arbitrary-waveform
generator. The waveform generator has two parallel channels with an analog
bandwidth of 32 Gigahertz (GHz) per channel and high sampling rate with 8-bit
resolution. Each waveform can be defined allowing precise control of baseband
signals. In reception, the same setup is used to down-convert the modulated THz
signal and recover the transmitted symbols. The downconverted signal is
displayed and stored, prior to demodulation and signal processing, by means of a
high performance digital oscilloscope, which has up to 63 GHz of analog
bandwidth for one channel or 33 GHz per channel with two channels. The described
TeraNova testbed enables new CISE-related research opportunities, including
development and validation of (i) accurate THz channel models, (ii) ultra-
broadband modulation and demodulation techniques, and (iii) ultra-massive MIMO
communication schemes, among others. In addition, the TeraNova testbed serves as
a unique platform to test and benchmark novel plasmonic THz devices for
communications.
