This research is concerned with the problem of recovery, representation, and
recognition of two and three-dimensional shape from real images. Building on the
results of previous NSF- funded research on deriving a representation for
segmented shape that is robust to variations in the visual scene, the current
effort focuses on deriving such representations directly from real images of
appreciable complexity, involving partial occlusion, gaps, spurious edges, and
noise. Two key complementary approaches are proposed. The first relies on a
local formulation of deformation and shock formation by propagating local,
labeled waves directly from edge elements and detecting, classifying, grouping,
and labeling the formed singularities (shocks) to recover partial shock segments
from partial contour segments, shock-based partitioning of shapes in grey-scale
images prior to segmentation, and completion of missing contours. Secondary
(interpenetrating) waves and a set of shock transformations are proposed to deal
with alterations due to partial occlusion, gaps, and spurious edge elements. The
second approach is complementary to the first and captures regional continuity
by randomly initializing object hypotheses as fourth-order shocks (seeds), which
then grow based on the output of low-level processes. The research is motivated
by segmentation and registration problems in 3D and will focus on two key areas:
1) the formalization of a classification of 3D shocks, the development of a
shock grammar, and the implementation of robust numerical schemes for their
detection; and 2) the development of a geometric notion of scale in 3D by
devising a surface evolution scheme of diffusion, thus generalizing the
reaction-diffusion space to 3D. The overall approach reflects visual modeling by
sets of coupled systems of PDEs, a paradigm which allows for simultaneous
interaction of boundary and regio n processes as well as bottom-up/top-down
communication.
