A grant has been awarded to Dr. Stephen Sulkin at the Shannon Point Marine
Center (SPMC), Western Washington University (WWU) to renovate a current lecture
hall into a training and research laboratory. The goal of SPMC is to develop a
facilities base that can support the research of resident and visiting
scientists; can promote a focused, sophisticated instructional opportunity for
students; and can contribute scientific information to marine resource agencies.
The new facility will meet a critical need at SPMC for appropriately designed
space that can support the maintenance of marine organisms in laboratory
culture. The marine plants and animals cultured in this facility will be used to
train undergraduates and Masters of Science students. These cultured species are
used extensively by resident and visiting scientists and form the basis of
collaborative scientific efforts among scientists and students at SPMC and
between SPMC and other institutions nationwide.

The space to be renovated has become available with the completion of a lecture
hall in a new building. Project renovations will include installation of a
glassware wash sink, laboratory preparation area, and laboratory benches,
replacement of carpeting with tile flooring, addition of ventilation to an
adjacent microscope room, provision of seawater to the main lab room, and
extension of emergency standby electrical power to support temperature control
cabinets.

Research and training of undergraduates are closely linked at SPMC. Students
from around the nation participating in a Research Experience for Undergraduates
(REU) Site and Minorities in Marine Science Undergraduate Program will use the
new facility, as will WWU undergraduates and graduate students. The renovated
facility will support student research on the role of climate change on food
webs and coral reef biology, the use of chemical defenses by prey to avoid
predation (and thus influence food web dynamics), and the importance of early
life stages in the population dynamics of ecologically and commercially
important fisheries species (such as the Dungeness crab and Pacific herring).
