This program at Iowa State develops a symbiotic relationship with other similar
programs to enlarge the scope of the effort. The students work with students
supported by the Department of Education Undergraduate Research Opportunities
for Minorities as well as the NSF Minority Scholars program. These students work
on continuing and new projects in a) Advanced silicon processing for devices and
integrated circuits, b) High-power and high-frequency bipolar transistors and
other microwave devices, c) III-V compound quantum nanostructures, d) Non-
crystalline silicon structures for energy conversion, e) Basic semiconductor
material studies and f) ASIC design for high-frequency circuits and systems.
They work on these projects full time during the summer and, if Iowa State
University students, part time during the academic year. The program cooperates
with State University of New York - New Paltz, Lincoln University, and North
Carolina A &amp; T. A microelectronics fabrication course is offered each summer
with teaching responsibilities shared by all four participating faculty. Non-
ISU students are able to transfer the course credits to their home institutions.
It is expected that a number of the research-trained and motivated students will
continue into graduate studies at ISU and elsewhere; consequently there is an
active recruitment for graduate students interested in microelectronics and
photonics from the program participants.
