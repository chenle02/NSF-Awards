9725518 Chapin This research project will develop a plan to analyze data
collected in an urban school system over a six-year period for teachers of
kindergarten through eighth grade students. This school system has been the site
of systemic change efforts over the entire period in which this information was
collected. Sources of data included interviews; classroom observations;
teachers' responses to surveys on their beliefs, attitudes, and content and
pedagogical knowledge; teachers' written reflections; and field notes on all
professional development activities. Both quantitative and qualitative methods
to analyze this data will be developed. The project will advance knowledge about
the evolution of teachers' beliefs, knowledge, and practices while engaged in a
process of systemic reform and will cast light on how various professional
development activities influence that evolution.
