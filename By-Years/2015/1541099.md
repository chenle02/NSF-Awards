Stochastic optimization offers a general framework to study many fundamental
statistical problems related to prediction such as regression, classification
and density estimation. Furthermore, it is a natural framework to import
powerful algorithms from numerical optimization, especially for large scale
problems. The broad goal of this project is to understand the fundamental
interactions between statistics and stochastic optimization. To accomplish this
task the investigator (a) identifies new problems from statistics, especially
with complex structure, that can be recast as stochastic optimization problems;
(b) develops new algorithms that optimally and efficiently solve large scale
problems; (c) determines essential characteristics of the problems that govern
the performance of algorithms and their fundamental limitations; and (d)
explores peripheral problems of stochastic optimization including stochastic
optimization with stochastic constraints and stochastic optimization with
limited feedback.

The information era has witnessed an explosion in the collection of data and
large scale data sets are ubiquitous in a wide range of applications including
biology, networks, environmental science, sociology and marketing. This results
in an acute need of new statistical methods to analyze these data sets of
unprecedented size. While techniques from numerical optimization can be used in
several scenarios, their analysis remains largely dissociated from that of the
statistical task at hand. This research aims at providing a unified treatment of
a number of large scale problems emerging from statistical learning and from
optimization under uncertainty in general. Therefore, the project will not only
result in new and effective algorithms, but also in a novel theoretical
framework that supports the analysis of stochastic optimization problems and
enables further improvements of said algorithms.
