9308276 Kaufman Technical Narrative: This proposal represents a collaborative
research project involving the New England Aquarium, Moi University in Kenya,
and the Uganda Freshwater Fisheries Research Organization (UFFRO) in Jinja,
Uganda. The objective of this study is to better understand the Lake Victoria
ecosystem and the processes that are presently causing dramatic declines in
stocks of native fishes. Dr. Les Kaufman and his team from the New England
Aquarium will work in conjunction with Mr. Richard Ogutu-Ohwayo and his team
from the UFFRO. Also included in the research team is a doctoral student from
Moi University, Mr. Peter Ochumba. By continuing a faunal survey of Lake
Victoria, these investigators will obtain data to help elucidate the processes
that are currently operating to structure the ecosystem. Specifically, they will
consider a series of predictions that relate to the patterns of species
survivorship among the indigenous fish species, the identification of refugia,
and the template of selective forces experienced by these species. More
generally, the study will produce a collection of archival fish specimens, more
firmly assess the current extent of extinctions, establish a working team of in-
country scientists, and build the necessary infrastructure to continue such work
in the future. This project in environmental biology fulfills the program
objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the
United States, Kenya, and Uganda to combine complementary talents and conduct
research in areas of strong mutual interest and competence. This project will
also enable U.S. and African scientists, who are early in their careers, to work
together conducting fieldwork, and collecting and analyzing data. Partnerships
created through this project could lead to future, collaborative activities. ***
