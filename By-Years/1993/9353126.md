9353126 Maclin The proposed research will focus on combining the emitter,
detector and passive modes electrically rather than geometrically in electro-
optical materials. The research will involve modeling and fabricating SiC and Ge
materials for devices to serve as active optical fibers and to achieve large-
scale integration of optical switching. The effects of radiation on the
operational characteristics of fiber optical-electronic systems will also be
investigated. In a parallel study, electronic, band structure calculations will
be developed to explain magnetism in semimagnetic semiconductors by using and
extending the principle, band theory techniques used in metal systems. ***
