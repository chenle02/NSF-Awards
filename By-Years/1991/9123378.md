Psychological researchers often administer more than one measure during the
same research session in order to test hypothesized relationships among
contructs. However, initial measures might influence subjects in ways that
affect their responses to subsequent measures. Demonstrations of such "context
effects" have important methodological implications, since correlations obtained
in studies that fail to control for context effects may significantly differ
from those obtained with proper controls. Three studies are proposed in order to
demonstrate that the phenomenon is robust and should be of general concern in
research on personality and individual differences. Two basic conditions will be
employed: In the Same Context condition, measures will be administered together
in one research session, so that subjects may infer an association. In the
Separate Context condition, scales will be administered in separate sessions, as
parts of independent studies. Thus, subjects will be unlikely to perceive any
connection among them. Three established relationships will be investigated to
determine whether relationships have been confounded by context effects: a)
hypnotizability and absorption; b) depression and attributional style; and c)
childhood traumata and adult personality. Professor Council is an
internationally known scholar in the area of hypnosis research. His proposal to
test for the presence of context effects in several different substantive areas
is of considerable importance. Much work on personality, social psychology, and
psychopathology consists of studying relationships between measures obtained
from subjects on a single occasion. Thus, if context effects are shown to
contribute significantly to relationships between measures, many well-known
facts may turn out to be artifactual. Likewise, the experimental results may
lead to a change in the methodologies customarily employed to collect
information in these fields and may spur new theoretical investigations.
