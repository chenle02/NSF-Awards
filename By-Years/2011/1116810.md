The algorithms and techniques used to find useful patterns in large sets of
data, collectively known as data mining and information visualization, have
become vital to researchers making discoveries in diverse fields. The goals of
data mining (and computing in general) at the Exascale have introduced
fundamental challenges at the architectural level, and even though the evolution
of GPU architecture has partly been driven by these challenges, overall
computing system performance is not increasing at an equal rate as that of data
generation and collection, thus widening the gap between the capabilities of
mining algorithms and the performance of real-world data mining systems. This
project investigates the design of new hardware/software platforms that will
enable existing data mining algorithms to scale with increasingly large and
complex datasets. In doing so, this project builds upon current understanding of
the characteristics of data mining applications that differ from those for which
modern processors are currently designed, similar to what already has been done
in the signal processing and network processing domains. This project also
studies a variety of design methodologies and models of computation that could
lead to performance improvements. Finally, this project analyzes the inherent
tradeoffs between algorithmic accuracy and architecture overhead in an attempt
to generalize the accuracy and performance tradeoff. The expected impact is that
these research tasks will contribute to the growing body of work in embedded
system design at the hardware/software interface, and will help to develop a
part of future hybrid multi-core computing platforms.
