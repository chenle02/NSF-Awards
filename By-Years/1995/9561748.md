This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I proposal utilizes two emerging
technologies to produce a high resolution, tunable spectrometer with no moving
parts. A small, solid state high resolution spectrometer with the unique imaging
capabilities provided by a CID is a perfect solution to many problems ranging
from process spectroscopy, where a spectroscopic analyzer is used on a
production line to `remote sense` an industrial process. To the problems facing
the space sciences, in particular NASA's initiatives to develop lower budget
spacecraft capable of answering unresolved questions while fiscally and
educationally benefiting the greatest number of Americans. As well as uses in
ground-based optical aeronomy, where smaller budgets are forcing new
instrumentation. Instruments with expanded capabilities that are fully automated
and capable of surviving in harsh environments. The LC-FPS design capitalizes on
the technology of a major liquid crystal vendor to grow precision nematic
crystals onto the surface of traditional etalon plates and to control etalon
resonant wavelength by application of a controllable electric field. The
innovative spectrometer proposed features the highest spectral resolution and
throughput of any instrument in its class, permitting not only abundance
measurements but also dynamically measurements. so important to ongoing research
in planetary and cometary atmospheres. The LC-FPS is an ideal tool for problems
ranging from: 1) The remote sensing of regulated environmental pollutants 2)
Augmenting current aeronomical instrumentation at major national facilities. 3.)
A replacement for current laboratory FTIR spectroscopy systems commonly used in
molecular biology and biochemistry. 4.) An essential tool in any field that
utilizes spectroscopic remote sensing or process spectroscopy.
