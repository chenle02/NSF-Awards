The proposed project is an empirical study of the effects of MSP projects on
student achievement, and it includes providing technical assistance to
approximately 15 MSP evaluators regarding MSP evaluation challenges and the use
of appropriate analytic tools and techniques for studying the impacts of MSPs.
The proposed three-year project has three goals: 1) to increase the knowledge of
MSP evaluators about design, indicators, and conditions needed to successfully
measure change in student learning over time, 2) to develop useful tools for
evaluators to attribute outcomes to MSP activities, and 3) to apply different
techniques for analyzing the relationship between student achievement and MSP
project activities in order to evaluate the success of MSP projects.
