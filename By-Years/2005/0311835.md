The project will study how teachers, schools, and districts use evidence to plan
their science curriculum in response to new assessments in the context of how
state science tests require students to learn topics and design investigations.
Partnerships of forms of professional development will be established that
produce evidence to guide curriculum customization. The project will include an
investigation of how schools incorporate evidence-based planning by contrasting
two districts that have incorporated standards-aligned technology-enhanced
inquiry projects. The objective is to learn how teachers, schools, and districts
plan programs and how they can be transferred to new districts by specifying how
teachers add learning technology to their science curriculum. The study will
include understanding how technology materials improve student outcomes, whether
they offer advantages for students at risk, and whether they improve curriculum
materials that impact performance on state science
assessments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
