This project continues the Bio-Grid REU Site offering undergraduate students to
participate in the research activities associated with the Bio-Grid initiatives
conducted at the University of Connecticut. The initiative will advance the
application of modern computing infrastructures and information technology to
research and practice in various life-science disciplines. Specific research
activities include several collaborative projects led by researchers at UConn. A
campus-wide computational and data Grid is configured to support the
collaborative projects and is available for use by summer students. Training
seminars by the project staff will introduce to students concepts about modern
grid computing infrastructure and related information technology, as well as
some ongoing life-science research projects currently being grid-enabled. Joint
seminars with all UConn REU Sites on research ethics and research diversity are
designed for students. Participants will have the opportunity to participate in
the International Bio-Grid Workshop, hosted annually by the PI.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU work, as part of a collaborative action with REU
site 1156859, will recruit a diverse group of undergraduate students to engage
in research that will broaden their interest in academic careers and professions
and help develop a globally competitive engineering workforce equipped with
innovative cyber-aquatic technologies. Through integrated research, education
and outreach programs, this REU site will better prepare these undergraduate
participants for future careers in academia or industry.&lt;br/&gt;
