0453339&lt;br/&gt;Richard L. Goldberg&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a
continuation of the successful NSF-supported project (award #9981867) in which
undergraduate students designed and built some 15 custom devices for people with
disabilities. The objectives of the proposed activities are to enhance
engineering education, provide students with insight into careers in biomedical
engineering, improve the quality of life of people with disabilities, and serve
the community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to the success of the previous effort,
a new design class was created in 2003, called Rehabilitation Engineering
Design. Assistive technology projects are now developed as part of this new
class, which also covers important issues in engineering design, communication,
ethics, and rehabilitation engineering. Students will spend the semester
designing and building the device, and at the end of the semester, the students
are to give the device to the disabled individual(s) and their therapists. The
class is to be supported with lectures by the instructor and guests, as well as
field trips, writing assignments, and oral
presentations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigator is to provide an
annual report that includes a description of the projects successfully completed
during the previous academic year. The report will be combined with similar
accounts from other NSF-supported Design Projects and published in a book for
general distribution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;
