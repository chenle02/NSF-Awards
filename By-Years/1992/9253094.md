The second in a series of Coalition for Education in the Life Sciences
conferences will be held at the Wingspread Conference Center from February
21-23, 1992. 30 participants representing a number of different professional
societies in the life sciences will gather to create a framework of principles
and concepts in the life sciences, with an initial emphasis on serving teachers
at the undergraduate education level. The conference will also focus on how to
advance an improved life sciences education agenda at the national, state, and
local levels.
