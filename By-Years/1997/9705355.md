w:\awards\awards96\num.doc 9705355 Mitra This grant supports an Information
Center on High Tc Superconductivity whose primary service is a twice-monthly
newsletter which contains lists of preprints in this very active research area.
It also provides a short analysis section which highlights information in the
preprint listings which is judged to be particularly important. Other current
information on technological advances, meetings, requests for proposals is
provided. The service is subscribed to by about 2500 researchers by mail or
e-mail, and an additional 4000 visits are made per month to the Web site that
the Information Center also supports. %%% This Information Center on High Tc
Superconductivity helps researchers worldwide in the active area of high
temperature superconductors keep abreast of the latest research results. The
newsletter and Web site which are supported make the progress of research in the
area of superconductivity more rapid and less expensive, by helping researchers
avoid duplication of efforts, and keeping them up to date on the latest
developments in their field of research. ***
