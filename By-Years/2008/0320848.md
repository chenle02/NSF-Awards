With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at San Diego State University will acquire an X-ray
diffractometer with CCD detector. This equipment will enhance research in a
number of areas including the following: a) inorganic site directed mutagenesis;
b) ketene-carbene chemistry and applications; c) biologically inspired
organometallic chemistry - proton transfer and hydrogen bonding; and d) water-
soluble N-donor ligands and corresponding complexes.

The X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full
three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles,
and it provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of the
molecule relative to the neighboring molecules. These studies will have an
impact in a number of areas, especially biochemistry.
