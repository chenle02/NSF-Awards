9604460 Phinney The overall research goal of this laboratory is to understand
the biochemical, genetic and molecular basis for gibberellin (GA)-dependent
shoot growth in maize. The program is important to the advancement of science in
that the results define control elements for the growth of maize, an important
economic plant for the welfare of society. Gibberellins are plant hormones that
are controllers of shoot growth. They are present throughout the plant kingdom.
The Principal Investigator (PI) has pioneered the use of single gene mutants to
unravel the details of the GA-biosynthetic pathway; these mutants have also been
used to evaluate the biological significance of specific gibberellins in their
control of growth. The projected program will continue studies on the
gibberellins of maize which will (i) define the biosynthetic origin and
metabolism of specific maize gibberellins, (ii) locate specific steps in the
pathway that are blocked by dwarf mutants (GA-mutants) and (iii) screen for
transposon tagged GA-dwarf mutants with a goal of cloning and expressing the
genes that control steps in the maize biosynthetic pathway. This project
addresses the biological routes for synthesis of gibberellins, plant hormones
that regulate shoot growth. The way gibberellins are made in corn will be
studied using combination of chemical and genetic experimental approaches. The
work is important because it will lead to a greater understanding of how plant
growth is controlled. This work has both basic and practical importance and may
eventually lead to increased crop productivity and an increase in the world's
food supplies.
