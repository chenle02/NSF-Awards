9706140 Phillips The proposed work will broaden our understanding of the
relationship between the structure and dynamics of the continental lithosphere
inferred from simple elastic plate flexure models by employing more realistic,
inelastic, finite element representations. Crust-mantle decoupling in convergent
settings, which is inferred from anomalously low elastic plate thicknesses at
some foreland basins, will be investigated. Finite element models of the
lithosphere incorporating elastic-plastic and elasto-visco-plastic rheologies
will be applied to this problem to determine under what conditions flexure
produces crust-mantle decoupling. Finite element modeling will also be used to
evaluate the importance of ostensibly second-order processes such as heat
transfer within underthrust lithosphere, loading history, spatially variable
strain rates, and a gravitational body force. The ultimate test of these models
will be compatibility with observations at foreland basins where low elastic
thicknesses are found. Crust-mantle decoupling in these environments may provide
constraints on the strength and/or viscosity, and perhaps composition, of the
lower crust. The end-product of this study will be a comprehensive and
physically robust model of lithospheric thermal-mechanical behavior at zones of
continental underthrusting. ***
