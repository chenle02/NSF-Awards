Understanding of the mechanisms by which central pattern generating networks
are formed during development requires the study of model systems in which both
the motor responses and the behavioral patterns can be studied simultaneously.
One important invertebrate model system, which has been studied extensively, is
the stomatogastric ganglion of the adult lobster; this structure controls
stomach movements. In this award, Dr. Joseph Ayers will study the development
feeding behavior and how it is coordinated with the development of the motor
patterns of the muscles controlled by the stomatogastric ganglion nerve cells.
The basic hypothesis is that early larval motor patterns are simple and that the
more complex patterns and adaptive reflexes characteristc of adult specimens are
elaborated in these larval stages as the motor apparatus takes form. The video
motion analysis system and correlated electromyographic recordings will be used
to determine the overall temporal organization of feeding behavior in the larvae
and how it changes from stage to stage, as well as how the motor patterns are
affected by the type of food. This research will contribute fundamental
knowledge about the development and generation of motor patterns that control
important functions such as feeding behavior.
