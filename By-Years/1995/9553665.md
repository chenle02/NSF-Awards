The purpose of this NSF proposal is to develop a new and innovative curriculum
for introductory college physics to be known as Introductory College Physics
2000 (ICP/2). This algebra-based course will be modular since its genesis is the
Principle of Technology Modules developed in the 1970's. ICP/2 will be available
in hard copy, but IBM and MAC versions on CD-ROM will be emphasized since it
will allow the instructor using the material to edit it before printing for
classroom use. The new curriculum will incorporate what is now known, through
studies in cognitive science, about teaching strategies that will improve
student learning. The modules will be developed to introduce activities designed
to enhance a student's conceptual understanding and ability to make connections
to related ideas. Introductory College Physics 2000 will target the students in
technology courses, although it will be suitable for all college students. With
the introduction of TechPrep and similar programs, more technology students are
taking college physics. Each module in the new curriculum will use modern
technological devices to introduce the physics concepts. This will motivate the
technological students and help them see the connections between physics and
their chosen fields. This college physics course will maintain a rigor that will
make it highly transferrable to universities. It will emphasize a hands on
approach and will introduce all the major concepts of introductory physics.
However, it will be the philosophy of ICP/2 that it is more important for
students to fully understand fewer basic concepts and have confidence in
applying them to new situations than it is for them to be exposed to more ideas
that are neither understood nor remembered. Project ICP/2 will involve
consultants and two other community colleges in Washington and Pennsylvania
During the first year, advisory boards and other writing centers would be
formed.
