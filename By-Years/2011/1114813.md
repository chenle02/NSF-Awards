The 7th triennial IUPAP meeting, International Conference on Biological Physics
(ICBP 2011) will take place June 19-24, 2011 at the University of California,
San Diego. A quantitative description of Biology is rapidly emerging as a major
new frontier for science in the 21st century. This field involves the cross-
fertilization of ideas and methods from biology and biochemistry on the one hand
and the physics of complex systems on the other. The theoretical and
experimental collaboration needed for continued expansion of this field has been
established, and this conference provides one of a few venues to facilitate
cross-fertilization between the disciplines of mathematics, biology, physics,
and chemistry. The ICBP2011 meeting is the only meeting of its genre that
focuses specifically on facilitating interactions between "biological physics"
researchers from both developing and industrialized nations, with an additional
emphasis on the involvement of junior researchers (graduate students and post-
doctoral scholars). The 2011 meeting will engage 500-600 junior and senior
researchers from over 40 different countries.
