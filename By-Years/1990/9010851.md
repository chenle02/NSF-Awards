This proposal is to utilize the renormalization group (RNG) method in studies
of physical oceanographic processes. The RNG method consists of parameterizing
small scale effects so their influence is present, but their explicit
calculation need not be done. In the ocean context, the method will be applied
to internal wave dynamics, particularly the Garrett-Munk spectrum. Additional
modeling of rotating and stratified flows pertinent to physical oceanography
will be done.
