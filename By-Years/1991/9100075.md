Optical instruments for performing linewidth measurement or for finding the
geometry of small features are limited by the resolution associated with the
wavelength of light. Basic optical theory states that features smaller than one-
half of the illumination wavelength are unresolvable. However, information is
present in the image about higher spatial frequencies than given by the optical
resolution. By measuring phase rather than intensity, 0.3 to 0.5 um features can
be measured with an interferometric optical microscope. Information about higher
spatial frequencies may be extracted by applying image processing techniques
such as simulated annealing, linear and nonlinear least-squares estimation, and
the Gerchberg algorithm. The aim of this research is to apply these techniques
in an interferometric optical profiler to extend the range of submicron
linewidth measurements down to 0.1 um. An applicable technique would be useful
in a commercial product. Possible applications include the measurement of
integrated circuit or integrated optical device geometries as well as
measurement of pits in compact disk masters, and magnetic recording head
geometry.
