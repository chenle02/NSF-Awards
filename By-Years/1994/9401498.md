9401498 Wilson This award supports mathematical research focusing on the
development of integral inequalities which give precise information on how the
interior smoothness of solutions of elliptic partial differential equations is
controlled by the size of their boundary functions. Specifically, the project
concerns efforts to find necessary and sufficient conditions on pairs of weights
so that inequalities between derivatives of solutions of partial differential
equations and their boundary values hold. That is, between the integral of
various powers of these functions. These are usually referred to as two-norm
inequalities and are useful for several reasons. One is that they give
information on how approximate solutions can be expected to converge to the
correct one. In this work, the underlying domains will have relatively course
boundaries, forcing the geometry of the domain to play a fundamental role in the
analysis. Expansion of these inequalities to what are called biharmonic
operators is also expected. Integral inequalities have traditionally played a
central role in the study of differential equations. They give
criticalinformation about average values of solutions and derivatives, often
providing existence results where no concrete form (except for numerical
estimates) is possible. ***
