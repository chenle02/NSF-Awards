Reactions to Nanotechnology: Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent surveys
indicate that religious beliefs will be very influential in shaping lay public
reactions to nanotechnology in the U.S.; in fact religious beliefs will be more
influential than scientific knowledge about nanotechnology. Unfortunately, there
is very little information currently available about religious reactions to
nanotechnology. This project will convene a series of Dialogue Seminars on
nanotechnology at a group of local faith communities. In these seminars, members
of the faith communities will receive information about nanotech, and then will
react to that information within religious settings. Interviews and surveys will
capture these religious reactions to nanotechnology so that this form of lay
public thinking about science and technology can be better compared with other
work on public understandings.
