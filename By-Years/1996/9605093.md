*** Desrosiers SURFing the Physics Lab is a NIST-NSF partnership to encourage
outstanding physics students by providing research opportunities with the world-
class atomic, molecular, optical and radiation physicists in the NIST Physics
Laboratory. To strengthen undergraduate AMO physics curricula, the program
director will work with department chairs and directors of centers of excellence
to identify two or three undergraduates from each institution who are prepared
for, and would benefit from, off-campus summer research in AMO physics. The
selected students will spend 12 weeks engaged one-on-one with NIST physicists in
projects combining quests for fundamental knowledge with direct applications to
problems of national importance. Student and advisor will be paired based on
background and interests. The students will live in a nearby furnished apartment
complex and participate in the many NIST seminars and in a weekly SURFing the
Physics Lab summer seminar series. The students will present their research in a
seminar at NIST and be encouraged to participate in a scientific conference
during the following year. NIST, NSF and the participating schools will share
the costs for this program. Given the significant lack of diversity in the
present physics work force, this program will actively seek out competitive
students from under-represented groups. ***
