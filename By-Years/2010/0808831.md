The role of annular modes in the dynamics of climate variability will be
investigated, focusing especially on (i) the dynamical mechanisms by which
changes in the structure and circulation of the stratosphere can affect the
tropospheric zonal flow, and thence surface climate, (ii) the role that
tropospheric and stratospheric eddy feedback processes play in the dynamics of
this interaction, and (iii) the applicability of the fluctuation-dissipation
theorem to the understanding of the response of the zonal flow to external
perturbations. While this investigation is part theoretical analysis, the bulk
of the research will comprise suites of experiments in a simplified
stratosphere-troposphere general circulation model. Future experiments will
include surface topography, in order to ensure a realistic level of
stratospheric Rossby wave activity, as well as a realistic degree of non-
zonality in the model climate. These studies will further understanding of
atmospheric annular modes, and identify the processes that may provide
sufficient coupling to lead to significant stratospheric influences on the
troposphere.

Broader impacts of this research are for the practice of climate modeling: if
modeling the stratosphere correctly is an important prerequisite to modeling
surface climate, there are important implications for climate models. Further,
this work will have implications for the understanding of the dynamical impact
of imposed perturbations, especially of increasing greenhouse gases and ozone
depletion on climate.
