The objective of the proposed research is the investigation and the
implementation of partial differential equation solvers using analog VLSI
circuits, specifically the design, fabrication and evaluation of a programmable
analog laplace equation solvers. The main advantages of the proposed approach
include speed improvement, robustness and fault tolerance. This research
demonstrates the feasibility of analog VLSI partial differential equation
solvers. It will have an impact on engineering disciplines where a real time
solution of these types of equations are required.
