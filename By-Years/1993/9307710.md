9307710 Button-Shafer This award supports participation in several approved and
proposed experiments which will utilize polarized and unpolarized electron beams
at SLAC directed onto targets at End Station A. An approved experiment,
anticipated for the fall of 1993, involves longitudinally polarized electrons at
22.6 GeV and polarized nucleon targets. This experiment (E143) will be the first
deep-inelastic scattering experiment in the United States to study the spin-
dependent structure functions of both proton and neutron; the data will be used
to probe the quark contributions to nucleon spin (to elucidate the so-call "spin
crisis"). ***
