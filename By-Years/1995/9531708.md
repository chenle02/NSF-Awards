Abstract 9531708 Tansel The REU Site at Florida International University is
designed to stimulate and promote interest curiosity, creative and critical
thinking of undergraduate students in environmental science and engineering. The
research projects will involve movement and dispersion of contaminants and
treatment of contaminated media (air, water and soil) to minimize potential
damage to the environment. The REU Site program is designed as a collaborative
effort with the university research faculty and local environmental agencies to
engage students in the different areas of environmental engineering. Students
will work in interactive research teams. The research experience will also
include environmental ethics.
