This international travel award will allow six researchers from the US network
science and engineering community to travel to Madrid, Spain in early December
2008 to participate with their European Union counterparts in the 1st FIRE-GENI
Workshop, which is hosted by the European Commission. The goal of the meeting is
to discuss possible interconnection of the control planes of the various suites
of infrastructure (e.g., GENI, DANTE, GEANT, FEDERICA, etc.) It is now clear
that there could be substantial benefit to both the US and the European Union to
work out interconnections issues now. NSF and the EC have each agreed to host a
number of meetings in order to achieve this interconnection. Bringing together
researchers from multiple technical communities in the US and Europe will
contribute to identifying opportunities for international collaboration and
coordination. This meeting (and any subsequent ones on this topic) will improve
the capabilities of future network research infrastructure through increased
commonality, sharing and community building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
