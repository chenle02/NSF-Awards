This proposal is to collect and analyze sea water samples for CFMs (Freon-11
and Freon-12), Helium-3 and tritium on a section across the Indian Ocean at
32>S. The information given by these tracers will complement the hydrographic
measurements planned for the cruise, will help identify water masses, and will
give additional constraints in water mass and heat flow calculations. The
results will be highly relevant to climatic studies.
