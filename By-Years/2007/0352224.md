This award supports the development of a stand-alone aberration-corrected
photoelectron microscope (PEM), capable of 2 nm spatial resolution.
Photoelectron microscopes combine the advantages of sample exposure by light and
the high-resolution capabilities of imaging with electrons. These unique
features are of particular interest in biology since they allow the damage-free
study of soft organic matter at very high resolution. The resolution of the
proposed microscope will be comparable to the best attainable with scanning
electron microscopes. Yet the ultraviolet (uv)-excitation of photoelectron
microscopes is considerably less damaging than the electron exposure in scanning
electron microscopes, particularly when a narrow electron beam is used as in
high-resolution work. Photoelectron microscopy also allows a number of imaging
modes, which are not accessible with scanning electron microscopes. These
imaging modes include specific chemical, physical, and topographical contrast
modes as well as advanced operation with incorporated markers. These features
can be used to obtain strong functional contrast in tissues of similar atomic
composition. At present no other light-optical excitation technique is capable
of better resolution. The physical design of the instrument will incorporate a
hyperbolic electrostatic mirror to correct the spherical and chromatic
aberrations of an electrostatic lens system. A Y-shaped beam line with symmetric
small-angle deflections will allow a compact design, compatible with typical
laboratory dimensions. This work will bring together an interdisciplinary team
of engineers, technicians, and scientists from within the university and from
industry. Students at all levels (high-school, undergraduate, graduate,
postgraduate) will be involved in and/or exposed to the technology development
effort.
