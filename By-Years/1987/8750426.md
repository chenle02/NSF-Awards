An interdisciplinary program in aquatic science focused on the Great Lakes
ecosystem is being improved by this project. Using a 37 ft. research vessel,
smaller boats and a field station on 3.5 acres of land at the mouth of Lake Erie
a group of faculty from the Biology and Geoscience, Physics and
Interdisciplinary Science (GPIS) Departments are teaching undergraduates how to
conduct modern scientific research on freshwater aquatic systems. Both formal
course work and independent student research projects are involved. Scientific
equipment acquired is being used for quantitative experiments in aquatic
ecology, microbiology and sedimentology. Unique research and instructional
opportunities are being provided for undergraduates and high school teachers.
Major items of equipment include a portable photosynthesis system for measuring
primary productivity of emergent aquatic plants, an epifluorescence microscope
for enumerating aquatic microorganisms, and a SediGraph 5000ET for textural
analysis of fine grained sediments.
