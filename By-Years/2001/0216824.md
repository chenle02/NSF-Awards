College&lt;br/&gt;$31,350&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is to
perform research collaboration with researchers in Korea on a research project
investigating the liquid-glass transition in several sugars and physical aging
following a rapid temparture quench from avobe the glass-transition temperature
to below it.&lt;br/&gt;
