There are numerous basic plasma processes which are of fundamental importance
in solar-terrestrial physics. Among these, the expansion of the solar wind in
solar corona is an outstanding example which has attracted a great deal of
theoretical interest during the past many years. In the last several decades,
many researchers have made important and valuable contributions to the
understanding of this process. In this research, there are several relevant
problems which will be addressed. Since the first theoretical model of coronal
expansion proposed by Parker (1958), there have been many discussions (e.g.,
Whang and Chang, 1965; Hartle and Sturrock, 1968; Nishida, 1969; Hozer and
Axford, 1970; Geiss et al., 1970; Lemaire and Schere, 1971; Leer and Axford,
1972; Lemaire and Scherer, 1971) utilized on a kinetic approach. All other
discussions are based on hydrodynamic theory, whether one-fluid theory or two-
fluid theory was used. Furthermore, most of them have imposed the assumption of
thermal isotropy which seems to be justifiable by observational results but is
actually not. Of course, there are other publications in the literature in which
both kinetic models and effects of thermal anisotropy have been considered, but
these discussions may not emphasize the coronal region. This work builds on the
view of Fichtner and Fahr (1990) who remarked that their results can be
important for the discussion of waves, because thermal anisotropy can result in
a variety of instabilities which should in turn lead to significant
consequences. It is in this context that the studies should complement the
existing theories. This study does not directly address the coronal expansion.
Rather, it will pay special attention to the effects of plasma turbulence on the
dynamic process.
