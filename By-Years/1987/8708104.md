This proposal requests a computer image processing system for the Department of
Geology at the University of Texas- Arlington. The image processing system is to
be used for extracting and analyzing data on volcanic eruption clouds as
archived in satellite records on digital tape kept by NOAA and NASA. The tapes
have not yet been analyzed by volcanologists, and there is good reason to
believe that they will yield information on the physics and chemistry of
volcanic eruption clouds and also lead to a world-wide volcanic eruption warning
system for the many eruptions occurring in remote locations and not normally
witnessed by volcanologists.
