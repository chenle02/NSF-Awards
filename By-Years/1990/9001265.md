This dissertation will examine the contribution Catholic pastoral agents make to
socioeconomic development in Latin America through a case study of the Diocese
of Cuenca in the highland province of Azuay, Ecuador. The study will explore the
development strategies of pastoral agents and the outcomes of efforts to promote
social change. Special focus is on how and why pastoral agents adopt different
methods of working in their parishes, and do so with varying rates of success
and failure. Seven variables will be studied: ideology, the background and
knowledge of pastoral agents, resource availability and mobilization, social
networks, access and use of organizations, and parish structure.
