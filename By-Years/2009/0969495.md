The main aim of this proposal is to investigate a few questions in birational
geometry. The first parts intends to study rationally connected varieties, which
are the simplest algebraic varieties from many points of view. For non-proper
varieties, there are various definitions of rational connectedness. The proposer
will study their relations. He will also continue his study on the arithmetic
property of rationally connected varieties. The other parts focus on the
boundedness type questions of varieties or pairs. Especially, when the pair is
of log general type, the PI investigator is trying to establish the uniform
properties of their volumes.

Algebraic varieties are roughly speaking the figures described by the solutions
of polynomials. Algebraic geometry is a subject which aims to classify all
algebraic varieties. In the birational sense, algebraic varieties are built up
by some specific types of varieties. Rationally connected varieties and general
type varieties are such fundamental building blocks. To understand them will
largely improve our understanding of all algebraic varieties.
