The proposed research covers the fields of gravitational physics, Quantum Fields
and String Theory. The PI proposes to use cosmic ray data that will soon be
available to see if TeV scale gravity is a viable theory. If so he intends to
extract information about the extra dimensions, as well as the Hawking
temperature from the data. The PI hopes to improve on the current semi-classical
theory of Black Hole formation and evaporation. In this vein, he intends to
investigate whether the black hole formation can be extracted from current ideas
from string theory concerning D-brane collapse. The PI also intends to study
antisymmetric tensor fields in four dimensions as well as solitons in N=2 gauge
theories. Finally the PI hopes to extend to string theory language the idea that
the smallness of the cosmological constant might be due to the instability of de
Sitter space due to particle production.
