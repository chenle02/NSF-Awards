This award supports the dissertation research of a cultural anthropologist who
will study the negotiation of social power through the shaping of traditional
Black music styles in the South African music industry. The student will study
the production process in the recording studio, where engineers and music
producers contest and negotiate the content and cultural qualities of the music
being recorded. The basic issues to be examined are the sources of control over
the content of the music. Methods include ethnographic participant observation
of several studios in Johannesburg; recording and transcription of the work in
progress, open ended interviews with participants, observation of talent
scouting trips into the rural areas, and observation of live performances. The
power of popular music to define the cultural position of people in their
society is striking throughout the world. Understanding how the cultural content
of music gets produced in this particular case (as more or less traditional in a
context where tradition is related to race in a complex way) can aid
understanding of the function of music in multi-ethnic society in general.
