Diamond micromachining systems based on ultraviolet laser etching and optical
sensing of surface morphology will be investigated for precision fabrication of
complex structures in diamond and diamond-like carbon. The research addresses
demonstration of ablation using a small waveguide excimer laser, investigation
of cutting speeds, demonstration of a optical surface height probe, and
investigation of techniques for graphite removal. Successful development of such
a system would allow the generation of complex shapes in diamond, a material
that is extremely difficult to shape because of its high hardness.
