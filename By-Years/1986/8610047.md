This research is a fundamental biochemical engineering study on recombinant
fermentation processes. It seeks to quantitatively study recombinant population
kinetics, develop a methodology for the estimation of key parameters, and
develop basic principles for recombinant reactor design. The ultimate objectives
of the research are to maximize the productivity of gene products and to
optimize the fermentation processes which utilize relatively unstable
genetically engineered recombinant microorganisms.
