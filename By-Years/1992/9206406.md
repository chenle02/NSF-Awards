It is proposed to investigate the effects of continental shelf/slope, bottom
topography and friction on the dynamical balance of western boundary currents
with a semi-primitive equation model (SPEM). High-resolution idealized
calculations will be conducted and the momentum, vorticity and energy balances
in these simulations will be compared with observations from the Gulf Stream.
Comparisons will include the lateral and vertical structure of the model
boundary current, the strength of the recirculation, the location of the
separation point and the eddy dynamics of the separated current.
