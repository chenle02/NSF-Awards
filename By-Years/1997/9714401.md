9714401 Kunreuther The project will examine the role of the private and public
sectors in managing catastrophe risks from natural hazards. The goal is to
develop a feasible program for minimizing future losses from natural hazards
through mitigation while enhancing the availability and reliability of financial
protection against damage from natural hazards. Alternative incentive programs
for encouraging property owners to adopt cost-effective mitigation measures will
be designed and evaluated. Also, new private capital market initiatives, as well
as the public sector as sources of funds when large-scale earthquakes or
hurricanes occur, will be examined. The aggregate impact of both loss reduction
initiatives and risk bearing and pooling policies will be evaluated using
science-based micro-modeling approaches. This research will further the
understanding of decision making processes and strategies related to risk
reduction. ***
