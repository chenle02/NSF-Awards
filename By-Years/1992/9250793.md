The object-oriented paradigm (OOP) is having a significant effect on software
development and use. Through this project, Lawrence University will integrate
OOP into a core of four introductory and intermediate computer science offerings
taken by the math/computer science majors and other students who choose to
supplement their major with a strong background in computer science. A key to
this integration is switching from Pascal to C++ as the programming language
used in these courses. By providing students early exposure to object- oriented
programming, instructing them how to make the most effective use of programming
tools, exposing them to issues in abstraction and portability, and teaching them
how to use already developed code libraries, the project will insure that the
students' growth in computer science is in step with the most recent trends in
the discipline. To assist in achieving these goals, through this project the
institution will acquire workstations which support a rich C++ environment for
developing and using class libraries.
