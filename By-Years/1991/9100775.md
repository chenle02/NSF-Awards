This U.S.-Morroco collaborative research project involving Oklahoma State
University and Mohammed V Universite is in the general area of solid state
structural chemistry of inorganic phosphates. Project funding will allow the
team from Mohammed V Universite to work for various periods of time in the
laboratory of Dr. Elizabeth Holt at Oklahoma State University and also allow Dr.
Holt a research visit to Mohammed V Universite. The collaborative research will
focus on the problem of synthesis and characterization of mixed metal
phosphates. The expected theoretical results will yield access to single crystal
diffraction and emission equipment for investigators from the laboratory in
Morocco and enhance the expertise of the principal investigator in dielectric
and high temperature synthesis. This project in phosphate structures fulfills
the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading
experts in the United States and Morocco to combine complementary talents and
pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
