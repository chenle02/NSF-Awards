0303536&lt;br/&gt;Taya&lt;br/&gt;An SGER award supports research on the design
of mechanically active surfaces using ferromagnetic shape memory alloys. The
FePd alloy can be made to switch surface morphology between flat, corresponding
to the austenite phase and the magnetic field turned off, and sawtooth form,
corresponding to the martensite phase and the magnetic field turned on. The
morphology change may potentially be useful in design of brakes or propulsion
systems for miniature systems. The work will entail development of suitable
single crystal plates with optimal martensite twin morphology, testing for
durability and speed of switching, and initial tryouts in miniature
mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the work is that it could result in
development of a new method for providing miniature movement, or braking for a
large number of industrially important MEMS and other miniature systems and
devices.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
