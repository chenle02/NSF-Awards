Bayesian Networks that Contain both Discrete and Continuous Variables
Probabilistic belief networks are increasingly being used to model belief in a
great variety of domains in knowledge-based systems. Some of the most extensive
work has been done in the area of medical knowledge and beliefs, and this
project continues previous work in that domain. One of the problems that has
continued to bedevil probabilistic network knowledge bases, as well as other
knowledge bases, is knowledge acquisition. The goal in this work is to enable
the use of medical and other types of databases and Bayesian learning methods to
develop probabilistic networks. The particular type of probabilistic network
structure being used here is called a Bayesian belief network. The method being
investigated uses two stages. The first stage is a relatively generic technique
for learning the qualitative, structural relationships among the model
variables; and the second stage uses distribution- specific techniques for
quantifying the relationships among the model variables. The hypothesis, to be
tested on a variety of simulated and real-world databases, is that this method
will produce more predictively accurate Bayesian belief network models.
