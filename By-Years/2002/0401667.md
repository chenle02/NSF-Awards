Research will be carried out at the extremely active frontiers of modern quantum
gravity, including supergravity, strings and their successors, as well as
cosmology, to search for their underlying laws. The present period is one of
unprecedented activity in the pursuit of the fundamentals of the Universe,
spurred by the current dramatic results of space- and terrestrially-based
observational platforms in charting its outer limits. The emerging picture
simultaneously provides amazing data and fundamental paradoxes. One objective of
this project is to provide explanations that foster a coherent picture of the
cosmos.
