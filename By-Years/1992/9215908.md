This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of separation science. During the tenure of this three-year
continuing grant, Professor Davis and his students will carry out theoretical
and experimental studies to ascertain the statistical limitations of two-
dimensional chromatography. The primary question being addressed by this
research is the amount of information necessary to specify the chemical
identities of analyte components in both one-dimensional and two-dimensional
thin layer chromatography. %%% The successful attainment of the goals of this
project is expected to impact broadly in the area of multi-dimensional analysis.
Additionally, useful insights into problems in capillary zone electrophoresis,
micellar electrokinetic chromatography, and field flow fractionation are
expected to accrue from this research.
