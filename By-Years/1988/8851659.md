This project will support the improvement and expansion of a laboratory for a
calculus course serving students in engineering, mathematics, and the physical
sciences at Iowa State University of Science and Technology. It is being funded
under the Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement (ILI) Program, which has
the stated goal of improving "the quality of the undergraduate curriculum by
supporting projects to develop new or improved instrument-based undergraduate
laboratory and/or field courses in science, mathematics, or engineering." This
laboratory will contain student workstations; faculty will use additional
workstations to develop and maintain course materials and several microcomputers
will be used to link laboratory and classroom instruction. The existence of the
laboratory will enable the faculty to test major revisions in their curriculum
for calculus.
