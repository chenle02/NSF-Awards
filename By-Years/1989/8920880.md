Economical solid polymer electrolyte fuel cells (SPEFCs) have potential
commercial applications for example as auxiliary power fuel cell systems for
cruise ships, offshore platforms, and remote navigation systems. Compared to
other currently used electricity generating systems, fuel cells offer many
advantages, including (1) high fuel to electricity conversion efficiency at both
rated and part load; (2) molecular construction; and (3) low pollutant levels. A
major impediment to the commercialization of SPEFC is the high cost of the
unsupported platinum electrocalyst. In this work PIs plan to develop high
utilization pulse plated carbon supported electrocatalysts for SPEFC
applications which reduce the platinum cost substantially relative to the state-
of-art. Using their Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I grant, the
PIs demonstrated a ten-fold decrease in platinum cost. Their high utilization
electrocatalyst concept is based on Nafion impregnation of a carbon gas
diffusion electrode followed by pulse current catalyzation (PCC) with platinum.
They electrodeposit small platinum catalyst particles (30 angstrom) only in
regions with electronic and ionic accessibility. The platinum utilization in
this electrocatalyst is therefore high. Because a major impediment to the
commercialization of SPEFCs is the high cost of the platinum electrocatalyst,
this technique could be an enabling technology for commercially viable
electrocatalysts for SPEFC. Another potential application for their Nafion
impregrated electrocatalyst is for poisoning resistant oxygen sensing
electrodes. Currently the electrocatalyst used as a cathode for oxygen sensing
is poisoned by a soluble lead species from the anode. Since Nafion is a proton
selective membrane, this electrode will retard the transport and poisoning of
the oxygen sensing cathode by lead. This is an SBIR Phase II grant.
