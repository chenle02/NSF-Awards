The origin of species is a fundamental problem in biology. An enduring
controversy concerns the relevant importance of geographic isolation versus
ecological specialization in promoting speciation. Sponge-dwelling shrimps
(Synalpheus) are highly diverse (100 species) and abundant on coral reefs
worldwide; several characteristics make them ideal candidates for testing
whether niche shifts can initiate speciation in sympatric populations. These
include high host specificity, low mobility, and mating in association with the
host. Recent studies have revealed significant host-associated differentiation
in demography and allozyme frequencies within Synalpheus species, as well as
high frequency of undescribed host-specific cryptic species. This research will
develop 1) a critical analysis of genetic (allomyze) and host use
differentiation among sympatric versus geographically distant demes of the
widespread host- generalist S. brooksi; 2) analyze genetic, behavioral, and
morphometric characteristics of several currently unrecognized cryptic species
of Synalpheus and their host associations; 3) construct a phylogenetic tree for
Caribbean Synalpheus, including newly defined species, onto which host use data
and life history characters can be mapped to test rigorously for association
between the sponge-dwelling habit and the radiation of this group.
