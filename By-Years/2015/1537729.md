Many tasks performed by distributed dynamic systems can be thought of as
occurring on a network of dynamic nodes interconnected by communication links.
These tasks include sensing, estimation, control, and optimization by
distributed mobile agents, such as vehicles. Implementation of these tasks often
reduces to computation of the average, or weighted average, of some variable
defined at each network node. Because communication across network links may be
slow or expensive, it is important to spread the effort of computing this
average across all the networked systems. This motivates the development of
"distributed algorithms" that rely only on information from immediate neighbors,
that is, from systems that can directly communicate with each other. While great
progress has been made in distributed averaging algorithms, these rely on highly
simplifying assumptions. This project will enable effective distributing
averaging on a range of realistic systems, and experimentally validate the
results on a network of robots. The result will apply to numerous open,
physically relevant, problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Existing distributed
averaging methods rely primarily on linear local repeated averaging-type or
consensus-type algorithms. These can only deal with prescribed cases, such as
averaging initial conditions, or steady signals, or Laplace transformed
quantities. Hence their applicability to practical applications is limited. The
objective of this project is to derive a robust distributed average tracking
framework based on novel nonsmooth nonlinear algorithms to enable distributed
coordination of networked systems. The project will address robust distributed
average tracking accounting for measurement and communication noise, different
agents' varying partial observability and discrepant data quality, inherent
physical dynamics, and optimization objectives. The results will fill in the gap
in the distributed averaging paradigm to benefit many civilian, homeland
security, and military applications involving networked systems.
