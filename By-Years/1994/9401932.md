ABSTRACT C. Crowe 9401932 The P. I. will conduct research and teaching at the
Institute for Metal Research of the University of Bremen, Germany, in the area
of Spray forming technology, with application to net-shape manufacturing. The
visit will last four months. In this time interval, a WSU graduate student will
visit the Institute for two weeks. The host institute in Germany is a leader in
the development of spray forming technology and has an active program on metal
spray atomization. The P.I. has expertise in the theoretical and numerical
simulation areas. It is expected that the P. I. and his student will benefit
from their interaction with the German counterpart, and will develop a new
program at the WSU after his return in the U.S. The P.I. received financial
support for his stay in Germany from the host institution. Two components of the
research will be further developed by the P.I. after hi re-entry back in his
home institute: "Disintegration of Molten Metal Stream by Impinging Gas Jets"
and "Distribution of Thermal Energy in the Spray Cone for Spray Forming
Applications". The project has both scientific and technological relevance in
the areas of metal spray and net-shape manufacturing. ***
