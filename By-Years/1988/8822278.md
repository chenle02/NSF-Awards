Dr. Forster is pursuing a line of research which he began in his paper,
"Unification, Explanation, and the Composition of Causes in Newtonian
Mechanics." His goal under this grant it to extend and develop this research
into what he calls a "Whewellian" approach to the philosophy of science. William
Whewell, an astronomer and leading science educator, made major contributions to
the history and philosophy of science. His philosophical works on induction have
been undergoing a recent revival among current historians, philosophers and
sociologists of science. This work entails a summary of Whewell's philosophy of
science with special emphasis on the hierarchical nature of scientific
induction. He will examine in this context problems concerning the existence of
component forces and inertial reference frames in Newtonian mechanics. He will
further examine applications of Whewell's ideas to probabilistic methods of
causal inference, strange quantum mechanical correlations, the confirmational
utility of unification, Glymour's bootstrapping account of confirmation, and the
problem of old evidence. These issues are of central concern for contemporary
philosophy of science.
