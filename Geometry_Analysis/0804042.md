Abstract Award: DMS-0804042 Principal Investigator: Jeff A. Viaclovsky

The first project supported by this award deals with regularity and volume
growth properties of critical Riemannian metrics in dimension four, and
applications to the compactness of moduli spaces and existence of critical
metrics, such as anti-self-dual and extremal Kaehler metrics. With certain
geometric noncollapsing assumptions, the appropriate moduli spaces can be
compactified by adding metrics orbifold-like singularities. This generalizes
results for Einstein metrics to the case of metrics which do not have pointwise
Ricci curvature bounds. A long-term goal is to extend the compactness theorem to
include the possibility of collapsing, and to find other applications to the
differential topology of four-manifolds. The second project deals with
orthogonal complex structures, and the relation with subvarieties of twistor
spaces. The corresponding equation is conformally invariant, so a natural
problem is to find properties of varieties which are invariant under the action
of the conformal group. This has applications to understanding the geometry of
compact Hermitian manifolds. The third project involves deformation of
curvatures, existence of solutions to fully nonlinear curvature equations, and
relations with Riemannian functionals on three and four-manifolds. A crucial
problem is to conformally deform a metric to prescribe a symmetric function of
the eigenvalues of the Ricci tensor (generalizing the Yamabe problem), and to
find natural conformally invariant conditions so that a metric can be deformed
from a weaker integral pinching condition to a stronger pointwise pinching
condition.

An important motivation for this research is to understand the relationship
between the geometry and the topology of a space. The latter, topology, is the
study of properties of a space which are invariant under continuous stretching
or bendings of a space, while the former, geometry, involves understanding
distances and is more rigid. For example, the surface of our planet is a sphere,
and one measures distances on it by computing arclengths of great circles (the
Earth is actually an oblate spheroid, but it is very close to being perfectly
spherical). One can imagine deforming the Earth by pushing in or pulling on
small or large regions to warp the geometry. Such a deformation is less
appealing that the familiar round Earth, and there are many ways to make this
notion very precise in terms of minimizing some sort of total energy
measurement. This is directly related to physical principles which say that the
state of a physical system will tend towards a final configuration which
minimizes the total energy. This idea can be generalized to higher-dimensional
objects called manifolds, which are generalized versions of the surface of the
our planet. For example, the space that we live in is three-dimensional, and if
one includes time, we are in a four-dimensional universe. In order to understand
these types of higher-dimensional objects, one attempts to find the best way to
measure distances on them which use the least amount of energy, and maximize the
symmetries of the space. The projects described above are to define appropriate
energies on such spaces in dimensions three and four, and to seek out the
important optimal geometries which minimize the total energy.
