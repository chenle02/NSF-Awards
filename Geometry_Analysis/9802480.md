Abstract Proposal: DMS 9802480 Principal Investigators: Tomasz Mrowka and
Matilde Marcolli The research project consists of three parts. The first goal is
the construction of an equivariant version of Seiberg-Witten Floer homology,
which is an invariant of the differentiable structure of the underlying three-
manifold and avoids the problem of metric dependence that arises in the non-
equivariant theory. The second part of the project consists of deriving the
exact triangles formulae that detect how the Seiberg-Witten Floer homology
changes when the three-manifold is modified by surgery and a suitable cutting
and pasting technique that relates the Seiberg-Witten invariants of four-
manifolds and three-manifolds. The remaining part of the project is dedicated to
the investigation of the relation between the Seiberg-Witten Floer homology and
the instanton Floer homology associated to Donaldson theory. The discovery of
the Seiberg-Witten invariants, as an outcome of recent developments in string
theory, has had a tremendous impact in the field of low dimensional topology.
The rich interplay of geometry and theoretical physics has allowed a deeper
understanding of the geometric structure of three and four-dimensional
manifolds. The topology and geometry of three and four-dimensional manifolds is
known to be especially rich of interesting phenomena and open problems: the
failure of the classification methods used in higher dimensions makes it
particularly important to construct computable invariants, hence the need to
investigate the properties of the Seiberg-Witten invariants and their relation
to the previously known Yang-Mills-Donaldson theory.
