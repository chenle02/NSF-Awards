National Geographic Television is requesting a planning grant to support the
development of a 3D large-format film, "Sea Monsters," which will focus on
current scientific and paleontological research into ancient ocean life. The
film will provide audiences the chance to follow men and women working in
diverse disciplines within the Earth Sciences including Paleontology,
Oceanography and Marine Biology, and the film will illustrate the interplay
between science and technology. Standards-based lesson plans for the classroom
and informal activity guides for families will augment the impact of the film.
During the planning phase the production team will conduct further research into
the scientific themes and stories for the film, identify the scientists who will
appear in the film, perform front-end topic testing and evaluation in order to
assess the public's interest and current knowledge about the topic, write a full
film treatment, develop a detailed budget and assess potential CGI studios.
