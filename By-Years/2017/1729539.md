In the last 20 years, transitional justice measures have been adopted around the
world to address the suffering of victims of human rights violations after civil
conflict. Economic compensation is one within a range of options available under
transitional justice to acknowledge the suffering of victims of massive
violence. However, the implementation of compensation plans takes different
forms at the national level. Across countries, we find that the compensation of
suffering can involve different monetary values, justifications, and
institutional practices, leaving open the question of how states arrive at
specific monetary values for suffering caused by civil conflict? This
dissertation project will answer this question by focusing on two contemporary
examples of compensation schemes created to address suffering related to human
rights violations.

The research plan involves textual analysis of newspaper reports, official
documents, and legal documents. In addition, CO-PI will conduct 30 semi-
structured interviews with experts, state officials, and victim advocates. By
considering how states monetarily value suffering, this project speaks to
current worldwide debates on peace and post-conflict negotiations, and the
corresponding discourses on victim reparation and reconciliation.
