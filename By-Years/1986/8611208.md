This project will investigate the inclusion of a plastic material, such as
polypropylene, into concrete to determine the effect on the shrinkage and drying
of the composite material. The concept to be investigated is the possible
beneficial effect of the plastic material to control cracking of the concrete
during the curing stage of the composite material. Controlling the cracking of
the concrete during curing will result in finer and more numerous cracks thus
increasing the durability of the material. The results will be of great benefit
to the construction industry for highway pavements, airport runways, slabs as
foundations of buildings and warehouses, bridge decks, and tunnel linings.
