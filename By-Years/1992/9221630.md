9221630 O'Brien A model is to be developed to predict the transport of a scalar
property (either chemical species or heat) in a compressible fluid which is
turbulent. The model is based on the Eddy Damped Quasi Normal model which has
been developed for incompressible turbulence, that is, without significant
density fluctuations. These are not to be included by generalizing the model. A
parallel effort will be the development of a Direct Numerical Simulation scheme
to be used to calibrate and validate the new model. Compressibility effects will
be moderate, the intended regime being up to a Mach number of about 0.70.
Compressible turbulence, and transport by such turbulence, is important in high
speed reaching flows. Typical model application would be to combustion and
propulsion systems. ***
