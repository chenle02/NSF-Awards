This study will investigate the impact of male labor migration to distant gold
and copper mines on social relations in the Oksobip region of Papua New Guinea.
The researcher will look at the effect of the decline of male particiation in
local economic, social and religious activities and the resulting increase in
female participation in public spheres in Min society. The anthropological
literature on New Guinea has traditionally emphasized religion and symbolic
analyses. Lacking have been analyses of social relations and social roles in
situations of social, economic, and demographic change. This study will fill an
important gap in ethnography as well as help us understand the processes of
extensive, gender-specific migration that are occurring around the world.
