Electroreception is a special sensory ability of some animals to detect
extremely small electrical fields in the natural environment. It was discovered
in aquatic vertebrates less than 40 years ago, and this special sense has since
been discovered in mammals. However, it has never been found in any
invertebrate. This project uses physiological and behavioral techniques to
design tests for the presence of electrosensory capabilities in crustaceans. The
SGER is an appropriate mechanism for this unique opportunity because the
experiments are brief and straightforward, and while the risk is conceptual that
the PI's might not find electroreception, the potential impact of the discovery
is very high. Such a discovery would have immediate importance not only in
opening an entirely new field for sensory science, but also in offering new
concepts and approaches for neuroscience in general, for evolutionary biology
and potentially for bioengineering.
