The Department of Meteorology is equipping a laboratory dedicated to educating
undergraduates in meteorological measurements, instruments, and data analysis.
The laboratory is providing instruction with state-of-the-art equipment in the
fields of mesoscale and operational meteorology, air quality and atmospheric
chemistry, and global climate change. This innovative program is expected to
stimulate a national revitalization of the meteorology curriculum.
