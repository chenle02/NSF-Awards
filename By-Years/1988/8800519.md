This project is concerned with research in ring theory. The principal
investigator will examine special classes of rings including group rings,
algebras of differential operators, PI-algebras and division rings. This project
will examine the Grothendieck group for these rings and the Gelfand-Kirillov
dimension. The research in this project is in the general area of ring theory.
Recent research in ring theory has been increasingly directed towards the study
of special classes of rings. The principal investigator will be considering
particular types of rings the significance of which comes from their origins in
various other parts of mathematics.
