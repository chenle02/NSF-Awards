Dr. Hope A. Michelsen has been awarded a Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chemistry.
Dr. Michelsen's doctroal degree was from Stanford with Professor Richard Zare.
She intends to continue research at Harvard with Professor James Anderson. Dr.
Michelsen has completed research in the dynamics of dissociativie chemisorption
of hydrogen on copper surfaces. She wishes to focus her career on the study of
heterogeneous processes in the atmosphere. Working with Professor Anderson will
give her the opportunity to learn about computer modelling of the chemistry of
the stratosphere and become involved in field measurements. This will be an
important step towards developing her career in environmental chemistry. %%% The
Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemisity Program is viewed as an important
infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new
Ph.D.'s and attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical
research and teaching.
