9701685 Sooryakumar This renewal project will support the study, via inelastic
light scattering methods, of exchange coupling mechanisms across magnetic
interfaces separated by an ultra thin spacer layer. Special tri-layer structures
with the ability to tune the Stoner exchange parameter will allow details of the
spacer magnetic and electronic structure that directly controls the inter-layer
exchange to be probed and provide information on the antiferromagnetic
properties of ultra thin metallic films. Domain wall excitations will also be
exploited to study inter-layer coupling over microscopic length scales. In
addition, the strong spin-lattice and charge-lattice couplings in the mixed
valence manganites will be investigated by light scattering. This effort will
allow for the unusual, but decidedly important, interplay between magnetic and
structural effects in these materials to be studied. %%% This renewal project
will support a laser spectroscopic study of magnetism in layered structures that
are likely to underlie the next generation magnetic data storage and magneto-
electronic devices. The study focuses on understanding the interaction between
magnetic films separated by a few atomic layers and to develop an experimental
technique to probe this interaction over length scales not realized by other
methods. In addition, since the electrical resistance of special manganite
compounds can be tuned by a magnetic field, these materials open new
perspectives into novel devices based on the spin of an electron. The underlying
physics associated with the coupling between the electron spin and crystal
structure of these materials will be investigated by laser light scattering
methodologies. ***
