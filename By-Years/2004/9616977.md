9616977 Crowley This project will continue previous studies using the Hamburg
ocean circulation model and an atmospheric energy balance model to assess the
effects of changes in physiography upon ocean circulation and the sediment
record. A sedimentation model, incorporating calcite, opal, organic matter, PO4
and carbon isotopes will be used for the latter component. The project will
concentrate upon two topics (1) gradual uplift of the Greenland-Faroe Ridge and
its effect upon North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW), and (2) controls upon NADW
production during the warm phase of the middle Pliocene, to be assessed with
varying winds, precipitation/evaporation balance, and the effect of a warmer
Southern Ocean.
