9622326 Thomas This project is a collaborative effort that will involve
mechanical and electrical engineers and materials scientists from a university,
a federal laboratory, and two manufacturing companies. The research will develop
techniques to explore microwave cavity design, microwave heating patterns, and
electromagnetic and thermal measurements and control pertaining to continuous
processing of thermal runaway materials. Thermal runaway materials are those in
which dielectric loss factors increase more rapidly as their temperature rises
when exposed to a microwave field. The inability to control temperatures during
processing prevents widespread use of microwave processing for many commercially
important materials. Microwave heating offers the possibility for better
products at lower cost, increasing the international competitiveness of U. S.
fiber and chemical industries. Results of this research may be applicable to a
wide range of materials, especially those made from polymers and ceramics.
