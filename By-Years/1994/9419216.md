9419216 Mesce Many important behaviors are controlled by specific nervous system
circuits which use biogenic amines as transmitters. In this proposal, Dr. Karen
Mesce will extend preliminary findings in which the specific nerve cells of the
leech that contain the biogenic amine octopamine were identified for the first
time. Octopamine is known to have marked effects on this animal'snervous system,
but the identity of the octopaminergic cells had never been established.
Octopamine-containing cells show up in regions where they may be related to
reproductive behavior. In addition, octopamine is expressed in different cells
within two related leech species, so that comparisons between these two species
may help reveal some important functions for octopamine-containing cells. This
project is likely to produce a better understanding the roles of biogenic amines
in CNS function and behavior. It is also possible that this work will produce
some practical insights into controlling leech reproduction.***
