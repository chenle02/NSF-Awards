This project is partially supporting the Southern California Conference for
Undergraduate Research (SCCUR). This annual event attracts a large diverse group
of students and faculty from four-year institutions, two-year colleges, and some
high schools for oral and poster presentations highlighting research and
scholarly activity performed by undergraduate students. NSF support is reducing
the registration fee for all students, providing free registration for up to 60
financially disadvantaged students, supporting evaluative activities, and
providing a follow-up workshop for a group of faculty attending the event who
are interested in writing proposals to improve student success and retention in
STEM. Participation at the conference is expected to encourage groups of STEM
faculty from 2- and 4-year institutions to pursue establishing partnerships for
undergraduate research and other collaborative projects to help more students
succeed in STEM at their institutions.

SCCUR is one of the largest broadly multidisciplinary regional conferences in
the United States. The SCCUR's first appearance at a community college in 2011
represents a unique opportunity for outreach to the public, to pre-college
students capable of succeeding in STEM fields, and to underrepresented minority
communities (Mt. SAC is a federally designated Hispanic-Serving Institution).
This conference engages the public about the innovative science and technology
research that students in Southern California perform, and makes parents and
families aware of the opportunities for young people in postsecondary STEM
education.
