Abstract CTS-9531959 C.F. Zukoski, U. of Illinois at Urbana The effect of
particle interactions on compressible consolidation processes and deformable
particle bed/suspension rheology will be investigated. Interparticle normal and
lateral (frictional) forces at distances of 1 to 20 nm will be measured with an
atomic force microscopy, and the interparticle electrostatic potentials will be
evaluated using static light scattering on model colloidal suspensions. The
particulate structure during experiments will be determined by sectioning the
consolidated beds and determining of planar volume fraction, as well as by using
small angle neutron scattering, and optical visualization. A compressible
constitutive model will be developed using the understanding of bed/suspension
mechanics at microscopic level. The project has relevance to the theory of
compressible constitutive relationships of deformable particulate systems, with
application to bed/suspension mechanics, filtration, soil liquefaction, ceramics
fabrication and various chemical processes. ***
