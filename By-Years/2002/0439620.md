The project will involve an interdisciplinary study at the Arctic Long-Term
Ecological Research site that will use existing, state-of-the-art models of
hydrology and biogeochemistry, and improve them with field studies of critical
processes of plant production, microbial decomposition, and production rates of
dissolved substances in soil water. The models will be eventually linked to
determine how soil moisture, spatial connectivity, and the timing of
meteorological drivers impact carbon-nitrogen cycling and catchment export. Dr.
Stieglitz, and co-PIs, Drs. Griffin (Columbia), Hobbie (Marine Biological
Laboratory, Woods Hole), Kling (Michigan), and Schimel (UCSB), will analyze C-N
cycling at the catchment scale to answer questions related to element coupling,
impact of strength and synchronicity of external forcing, and impacts of spatial
heterogeneity of vegetation and hydrological connectivity. The PIs expect this
research to advance understanding of land-use changes and eutrophication of
coastlines, climate change and altered ecosystem function, and global processes
such as sea-ice and deep water formation in the Arctic ocean.

This project is supported by the Biocomplexity in the Environment: Coupled
Biogeochemical Cycles research program.
