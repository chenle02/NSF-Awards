The tribology laboratory at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute has established an
ongoing program to characterize various tribological surfaces used in industry,
including high precision components such as aircraft rolling contact bearings
and computer recording discs. However, the profilometer system used for
characterizing surfaces was never designed for such high precision work or for
other than flat surfaces. This project provides an optical table, a stylus
profilometer, and an optical profilometer to enable surface measurements for
high precision tribological elements and also curved elements.
