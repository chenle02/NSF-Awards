This award will support the participation of eight U.S. scientists in a seminar
on Electromagnetic Interference in Highly Advanced Social Systems, organized
jointly by Professor Stephen Sebo of Ohio State University and Professor Tatsuo
Kawamura of the University of Tokyo, Japan. United States, Japanese and invited
third-country participants will meet in Honolulu, Hawaii during August 1988. The
seminar will focus on understanding of electromagnetic pulses caused by power
transmission systems, natural lightnings and nuclear explosions; measurement
techniques of electromagnetic fields covering a broad frequency range, including
procedures and standardization; and,the environmental effects of hazardous
electromagnetic fields and their impact on society. Many key elements of highly
advanced social systems (e.g., electric power systems, communication and
information systems, national security) are sensitive to electromagnetic
interference. Yet, the nature of such interferences, and their biological and
societal impacts, have never been systematically addressed. This seminar will
provide a forum for the exchange of research results and ideas. Discussions on
the standardization of measuring techniques and the evaluation of measured
results should prove particularly valuable in advancing the field.
