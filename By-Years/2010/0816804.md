Engineering Technology - (58) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2002, Wayne
State University (WSU) was awarded an NSF grant to develop an adaptation of the
Learning Factory model that would be less costly to implement. That project
focused on introducing the use of coordinated hands-on projects in standard
laboratory settings across selected courses, using a model engine application as
the unifying theme. This approach proved to be a more cost-effective way to give
students hands-on experience in a range of issues involved in product
realization. The goal of this CCLI phase II project is to distill a core of
course-level learning outcomes from WSU's previous work and develop an approach
for mapping these to higher program-level outcomes that help to meet industry-
defined competency gaps of students. This project takes the successful approach
of using coordinated hands-on activities across multiple courses to provide
students with specific competencies, and test its efficacy by implementing it
simultaneously in five diverse departments at four different institutions.
Students will learn by trying things out, and working with others in a holistic,
systematic way.
