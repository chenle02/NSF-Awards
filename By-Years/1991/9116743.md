A program to prepare minority graduate students for a career in engineering
education has been designed by the Faculty of the Watson School, SUNY-
Binghamton, in conjunction with the engineering Faculty of Morgan State
University, a historically black university in Baltimore. The program, called
The Partnership, features early identification of academically talented
engineering students at Morgan State, and provides academic advising and support
to smooth the transition to graduate school at SUNY-Binghamton, financial
support through the NSF Graduate Engineering Education Fellowship for the first
three years of graduate study, and specific training and encouragement for an
academic career. The Watson School and Morgan State are uniquely suited to
develop a successful collaborative program. Both are relatively small, young
programs with a strong commitment to minority engineering education, links with
industry and active support for minority education from the state governments.
Both have faculty members who are active in engineering education societies.
They have already established a faculty seminar exchange.
