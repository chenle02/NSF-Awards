This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address
development of an advanced precursor evaporation module with a specific focus
application to copper metalization. Rapid large area CVD is required for the
copper seed layer or, preferably, for deposition of the full contact layer. CVD
equipment manufacturers have responded to the deposition tool need; as have
developers of the copper precursors to enable Cu CVD. However, the copper
precursor of choice, Cupra Select TM (a liquid), has a relatively low vapor
transport rate because of its low vapor pressure, compounded by a narrow
temperature operating range (vapor pressure equals 0.4 Torr at 43 C and beyond ~
45 C this precursor begins to decompose). Flash Evaporation is not a solution
because of the low decomposition temperature. The limited vapor transport
hinders high speed large area growth. This has led to the development of a
multistep-multimachine copper metalization process (CVD seed layer followed by
electrochemical deposition of the whole layer). This is tolerable but highly
inefficient and hence costly. SMI proposes to create a patentable high volume
liquid vaporization source. Our proposed source offers at minimum a 5 fold
increase in available Cu vapor transport and is expected to allow CVD to replace
the present two-step process. If successfully developed, SMI's source will be
made available commercially. This effort will help accelerate the large scale
manufacturing of ICs with Cu interconnects, and may apply to any other CVD
process utilizing low volatility liquid precursors.

An improved liquid vaporization source will find immediate use on all Cu CVD
systems and hence be a strategic SMI component product. The unit will also find
applications to similar temperature sensitive, low volatility liquids and well
meets SMI's CVD components sales thrusts.
