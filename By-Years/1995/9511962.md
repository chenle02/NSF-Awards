An international network of three gravitational wave detectors is now in
operation. Each detector has an individual noise level of approximately 6 x
10-19 in gravitational strain, and the detectors are in coordinated operation to
look for coincident detection of gravitational waves. The LSU group plans
continued operation of its detector in conjunction with the detectors from the
Italian groups and the Australian group. Studies will be performed on the
effects of signal-to-noise ratio on the estimates of time of arrival of a
gravitational wave pulse. Continued operation in coincidence with these other
detectors will look for gravitational wave pulses of amplitudes 10-18 or
smaller. If none are seen, the lower limit of gravitational flux will be
extended to lower values. R&amp;D will be done on the continued development of
the resonator-transducer-amplifier that has been responsible for the outstanding
performance of the LSU antenna. This will involve continuation of the
collaboration with the University of Maryland to develop robust and sensitive
SQUID amplifiers for resonant transducers. In addition, there will be continued
development of the TIGA advanced detector concept developed by this group.
