Research on academic help seeking suggests that success is affected by how
students identify, select, and access potential study resources. Yet, despite
these issues, there is very little research on the actual use and quality of
study resources at the university level, either in the traditional face-to-face
or in an online setting. The project is re-engineering the study resources that
are currently available to undergraduate students in introductory STEM courses.
Part of this re-vamping involves expanding the conception of tutoring from face-
to-face, one-on-one, private, undocumented encounters to also encompass online,
many-to-one, public, archived interactions. The idea is to transform the
tutoring experience to support effective student learning using networked
computer technology by developing infrastructure for delivering online help with
data mining capabilities, developing curricular materials for training
undergraduate STEM tutors to work in online communication environments,
generating usage, satisfaction, and quality measures for study resources, and
studying response to collective versus individual help. This project promotes
teaching, training, and learning, both of students and for students, as they do
their STEM coursework. The resulting resource will meet the needs of students
who are not or cannot be physically on campus or visit the tutoring center when
they need help. Also, the anonymity afforded by the resource should encourage
students who are otherwise reluctant to seek help. More generally, this project
supports the transformation of help seeking from a private, individual activity
to a collective, social endeavor that reflects how students of today study.
