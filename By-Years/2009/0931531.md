The project is the second in an international symposium series on the topic of
combinatorial search. Currently, work in this area appears scattered across many
conferences in several fields. The intellectual merit of this project stems from
the sharing of new results, ideas, and problems across the many areas in AI and
robotics where combinatorial search is used. Broad impact comes not only from
this intermixing but from having a single locus of activity for efforts in
combinatorial search, one that we expect to become known in the wider community
as the place to look when one wants a snapshot of the latest developments in the
area. The first symposium will be held as a AAAI workshop in 2008. This second
meeting in the series is held just before and in the vicinity of the
International Joint Conference for Artificial Intelligence in 2009. NSF funding
supports authors of oral and poster presentations, as well as invited speakers.
