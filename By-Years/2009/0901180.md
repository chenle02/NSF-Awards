TECHNICAL SUMMARY

This research involves studies of specific interactions in polymer systems. One
part of the proposed work seeks to obtain a fundamental understanding of the
interplay between microstructure and the fraction of same chain contacts, or
self-concentration, in hydrogen bonded polymer blends. Measurements of the
fraction of hydrogen-bonded groups in these mixtures will also be used to
determine the effect of hydrogen bonding on rheological properties. This work
will be complemented by the second part of the proposed research, which involves
studies of the shapes and widths of bands in these strongly interacting systems
and how these are affected by interactions and relaxation processes. Infrared
bands and Raman lines are sensitive to local environment and picosecond scale
dynamics. The extent to which useful information can be obtained from the
spectra of polymers will be evaluated by comparing the results of band shape
analysis to those obtained by applying ultrafast two-dimensional infrared
spectroscopic (2D-IR) techniques.

NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY

The factors that govern both the mixing of polymer materials and so-called
relaxation phenomena (which govern their mechanical and rheological behavior) is
of considerable practical importance. Finding polymers that mix at the molecular
level (most do not) can lead to materials with novel properties. Even polymers
that phase-separate can have important properties, such as enhanced impact
resistance, providing that the size of the phase separated domains are
controlled. This research will use infrared spectroscopy to study both specific
interactions and relaxation behavior in polymers and their mixtures. The work
will also contribute to education through the mechanism of involving both
undergraduate and graduate students in laboratory work, thus teaching them the
fundamentals of spectroscopic and other techniques. More uniquely, work
supported on previous NSF awards that resulted in CD based monographs, complete
with animations and interactive programs, will be extended to produce sets of
lectures that will be freely accessible over the web.
