Webbink, Ronald AST 96-18462 Dr. Webbink will carry out a program of research
on the evolution of binary stars through studies of the loss of systemic angular
momentum. His theoretical research program, in collaboration with researchers at
the Australian National University, will examine the phenomenon of magnetic
braking thought to drive angular momentum loss, particularly the dependence of
stellar wind mass loss rate on surface magnetic field strength, and of magnetic
field strength on stellar rotation rate. He will also investigate the case of
accretion onto strongly magnetic white dwarfs, the effects of heating of the
donor star by the white dwarf and accretion disk, and the effects of white dwarf
mass loss in novae explosions. In addition, he plans to publish a catalog of
close binary systems as an aid to further study of the systems, and to use it
for population synthesis studies and a search for high proper-motion eclipsing
binaries that can be used for the determination of fundamental stellar
parameters. ***
