Improved reliable accelerometers suitable for wide deployment in seismic arrays
are needed for earthquake prediction studies. In response to this need Optical
Technologies, Inc. (OPTECH) is proposing a fiber-optic accelerometer system that
provides the desired performance improvements of broad-band, wide dynamic range,
and low power consumption, as well as other significant benefits and features: o
Broad-band response (< 0.1 Hz to > 100 Hz) o Wide dynamic range (on the order of
140 to 160 dB) o Low power consumption o Robust construction (no moving parts) o
Capability to operate in any orientation o Low maintenance cost o High
reliability (no moving parts) o High radiation tolerance (suitable for nuclear
plant deployment) o Digital out (in Phase II)
