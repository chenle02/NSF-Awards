Jeff Roberts of the University of Minnesota is supported by the Special Projects
Office to organize a workshop for the RSEC (Research Sites for Educators in
Chemistry) program. He is assisted by the PIs of the other for RSECs, who are
Kelsey Cook (University of Tennessee), Tom McCarthy (University of Massachusetts
- Amherst), and Paul Rillema (Wichita State University). This workshop will be
held at NSF headquarters on 10-12 March, 2002 and will involve up to fifty
participants. These participants include representatives from the existing
RSECs, potential PIs for new RSEC proposals, resource people, and NSF personnel.
The workshop has two interrelated goals, information exchange and assessment.
The format for the workshop includes breakout sessions. A written report is to
be drafted based on discussion in general and breakout sessions.
