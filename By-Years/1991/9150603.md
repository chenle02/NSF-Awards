This project develops an honors introductory two-semester calculus-based physics
sequence which goes beyond the narrow problem-solving focus of the standard
sequence, and directs a considerable amount of attention to the historical
context in which major physical concepts originated and developed. This helps
students to internalize these concepts, develop the ability to apply them, and
recognize their place in science and modern thought. Such a pedagogical approach
enhances understanding and captures the interest of honors students, thus making
them aware of the challenge and excitement of physics as an intellectual
discipline and career. These students represent a small but previously untapped
high ability pool of potential physics majors having a high percentage of women.
Subject matter is organized about the following major themes: particle motion
and the structure of the universe; waves and the transmission of energy;
thermodynamics, statistics and the gross structure of matter; electromagnetism
and field concepts; relativity, quantum theory, and models of the microscopic
and ultimate structure of matter.
