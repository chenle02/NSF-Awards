This Career award emphasizes the development of tools for modeling
identification, and response of mechanical systems that include dynamical dry
friction. Typical examples of such systems include automobile squeak, rail-wheel
squeal, metal cutting processes, and many other manufacturing applications.
These phenomenon are inherently nonlinear and their realistic modeling is
crucial to understanding their true dynamic behavior primarily applied to
automotive squeak. The approach involves wavelets to quantify the frequency-time
characteristics of the stick-slip and noise events. Modern dimensionality theory
incorporating state space variables is used to accommodate the nonsmoothness of
stick-slip systems. Direct measurements of friction during velocity reversals
lead to establishing relationships between the friction and the displacements,
velocities, accelerations, and time. Educational innovations include developing
a nonlinear oscillation course for off-campus delivery, incorporating computers
in courses, projecting animations in lectures, and performing physical
demonstrations in the classroom to illustrate complex dynamic phenomena.
