With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
(CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Rockhurst University will upgrade
a permanent magnet CW NMR instrument to a FT-NMR. This equipment will enable
researchers to carry out studies in natural products synthesis and medicinal
chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the
structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to
characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the
dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-
art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier
research. A broad spectrum of students at this undergraduate institution will
benefit from the upgrade since the investigators plan to integrate the
spectrometer into coursework. &lt;br/&gt;
