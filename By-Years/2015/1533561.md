This workshop project aims to create the Early Career Faculty Travel Grant
Program for the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE). The overall intent
is to increase the numbers of underrepresented minorities who successfully
pursue engineering academic careers. Support will be provided to early career
faculty, post-doctoral scholars, and senior level graduate students to
participate in the Annual National Society of Black Engineers Convention. It is
intended that participation in various workshops sponsored by NSBE will enhance
the professional success of these individuals. Additionally, the creation of a
pool of underrepresented minorities who form a collaborative and supportive
community and provide mentoring to each other and to other doctoral and post-
doctoral researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This activity enables education and
mentoring of early career African American faculty and provides them with
opportunities for professional development. They participate in the NSBE Annual
Convention activities that will support their future success in research funding
and other scholarly activities. These include the Technical Professional
Conference and Graduate Student Mini-Conference, which conduct workshops on
professional development, leadership development, and entrepreneurship, as well
interactions with industry attendees. Through the engagement in the convention
participants are developing supportive personal and professional relationships
with other African American engineering faculty. A mixed methods evaluation plan
that uses surveys and focus groups measures the level of success the program had
in increasing self-esteem and the intent to persist within academia as well as
identify how participants intend to utilize the information they have received
to better themselves and aid the next generation of academic researchers.
