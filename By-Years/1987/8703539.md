This research project plans to combine a number of computer-assisted methods
developed by the PI and others and construct the renormalization group fixed
point which governs the infrared behavior of critical lattice systems in three
dimensions, such as the critical phi 4/3 scalar quantum field model or the three
dimensional Ising model. It also plans to get rigorous bounds on the (universal)
critical exponents of these models. The work to get the rigorous results for
these three dimensional models will be done on a supercomputer. Quantum field
theory is aimed at a rigorous mathematical construct for quantum physical models
of reality. Conclusions deduced from the theory will enhance our understanding
of quantum physics and allow us to exploit this new understanding for new and
innovative technological advances.
