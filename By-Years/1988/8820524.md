The objective of this research program is to produce a reliable, versatile, and
reasonably-priced equipment to screen potential anti- cancer agents. This
automated cellular electrode system will provide capability that is currently
not available commercially for routine screening purposes. The system will be
able to measure on-line, the dynamic response of various cell lines or tissues
to anti-cancer drugs. It will be simple to use and its capacity can be modulated
to handle multiple screening. The analytical component utilizes a sterilizable
oxygen electrode which measures the oxygen consumption of the cells
continuously. The system is automated and the data acquisition, handling and
management are simplified for the convenience of the user. The feasibility of
this approach was successfully demonstrated in Phase I. In Phase II, a second
generation design of the automated cellular electrode screening system will be
designed and built. This will undergo testing in-house as well as in other
investigators' testing laboratories.
