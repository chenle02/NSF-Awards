This project builds upon the prototype Physics Teaching Web Advisory (Pathway),
which was designed to demonstrate the ability to address issues related to the
lack of preparation of many physics teachers, and to provide resources that can
enliven even the most expert physics teachers' classrooms. Pathway's Synthetic
Interviews and related video materials are beginning to provide pre-service and
out-of-field in-service teachers with much needed professional development and
well-prepared teachers with new perspectives on teaching physics. By extending
Pathway to the full curriculum, teachers and their students of all backgrounds
will benefit immensely. Pathway combines Carnegie Mellon University's state-of-
the-art digital video library technology, pedagogical advances developed at
Kansas State University and materials contributed by master teachers. This
dynamic digital library for helping teachers goes beyond simply creating a
collection of teaching and learning materials. It provides continuously
improving assistance and expertise for teachers, all of which is related to the
National Science Education Standards and to results of contemporary physics
education research.&lt;br/&gt;
