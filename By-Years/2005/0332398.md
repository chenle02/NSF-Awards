The information technology revolutions of ubiquitous computing and the wireless
internet are dramatically changing the way field maintenance of equipment is
performed and the way service needs can be anticipated. Still, the challenges of
how to exploit wireless communication for maintenance and repair are enormous
and only beginning to be understood. Unlike other forums which are either
entirely academic or industrial trade expositions, this workshop will bring
together academic researchers and industry managers in a shared review of
challenges and research opportunities. The meeting will hosted by the University
of California - Los Angeles in October, 2003.
