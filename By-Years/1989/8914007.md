Before the collapse of a structure, the weak points will first develop
deformations. The present device is an automatic safety monitoring system
utilizing laser, optic fiber or other photoelectric techniques available today
to detect the deformation. The system can be operated in conjunction with a
small computer. The magnitude and rate of change of deformation can be monitored
and recorded. When the deformation becomes larger than the preset level of
tolerance, signals and alarms can be activated, providing amble warning.
