The grant provides funds to support the Bloomington Geometry Workshop. It is an
annual meeting with the 2014 edition taking place over the weekend of April
26-27. The meeting starts with a Friday afternoon lecture and then there are
seven to nine presentations on Saturday and Sunday by well-known active
geometers primarily from the Midwestern region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
Bloomington Geometry Workshop aims to promote scientific cooperation between
geometers in Indiana and its neighboring states. Graduate student participation
has continued to increase, and the organizers encourage this by asking speakers
to make at least a portion of their talk accessible to graduate students. The
Workshop organizers also invite at least one graduate student speaker and
solicit graduate student participation from individual departments, especially
from among under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More information about
the workshop can be found on the website
