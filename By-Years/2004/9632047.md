The long term goal of the project is to fully understand the the mechanism of
the ethylene-forming enzyme. The focus of this research is to use bioorganic
methods to study the identity of critical active-site residues; to provide an
unambiguous demonstration of a suspected radical mechanism; to finalize the
enzymatic reaction stoichiometry; and to create a reasonable model for the
mechanism of oxygen activation. Since enzymes of this class do not follow
classic Pauling theories of enzymatic catalysis, the need to develop new
theories of enzymatic catalysis for multi-transition state conversions provides
further significance to the work. With this award the Organic Dynamics Program
is supporting the research of Dr. Michael C. Pirrung of the Department of
Chemistry at Duke University. Professor Pirrung will focus his work on
understanding the mechanism of the ethylene-forming enzyme as an available and
significant member of the class of non-heme iron oxidizing enzymes. Among other
reasons, the work is deemed important since the process of natural ethylene
production is a key step in the ripening of fruit.
