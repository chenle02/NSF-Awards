This project builds on the success of the National Women in Engineering Program
Advocates Network (WEPAN) to increase the enrollment and retention of women in
engineering at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Activities include:
(1) establishing three Regional Centers of WEPAN in order to provide technical
and programmatic assistance to institutions; (2) developing and implementing a
Survey of Institutional Readiness to assist colleges and universities in
determining the feasibility of initiating or expanding programs; (3) designing
and conducting three Regional Training Seminars for administrators from 60
colleges and universities; (4) developing and implementing a formal evaluation
methodology for measuring efficiency and effectiveness of the programs; (5)
using a statistical analysis to investigate relationships between
characteristics of women in engineering programs and enrollment and graduation
rates of women; (6) publishing a semi-annual National newsletter, the WEPAN
NEWS; and (7) disseminating information and materials through an electronic
network, conferences and publication.
