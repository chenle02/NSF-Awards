9417445 Baker The objective of this research is to measure the growth (by vapor
diffusion) and evaporation of individual ice crystals in the laboratory using a
new levitation technique, wherein the crystal is suspended by superimposed (AC
&amp; DC) electric fields. Temperature and moisture will be controlled (0 to
-50C) to reproduce plausible atmospheric conditions. ***
