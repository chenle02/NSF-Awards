Politics structures the regulatory and legal institutions that delimit the
operation of financial markets. The political outcomes have major impacts on
such important matters as the openness of financial markets, the balance between
investor protection and managerial prerogatives, and the tradeoff between
creditor and debtor rights. The need for a research agenda in this area led to
the organization of a research network in Europe "Understanding Financial
Architecture: Legal and Political Frameworks and Economic Efficiency." The
network was funded by the European Union. This grant supports a small conference
on the Political Economy of Financial Markets at Princeton University. The
purpose of the conference is to explore the development of an international and
interdisciplinary community in this area. The potential topics include financial
development, corporate governance, bankruptcy, debt forgiveness, and credit
markets for the poor. Invitations to participate in the conference are extended
to scholars, particularly junior scholars, from a broad cross-section of
Universities in the United States. The conference brings together potential
American partners to the European network on the political economy of financial
institutions.
