This project explores and develops tools for traffic management strategies based
on recent advances in data network congestion control and evolutionary game
theory. The objective is to develop constructive methods to influence traffic
distribution patterns in road and freeway systems in order to improve efficiency
and reduce congestion. The intent is to derive traffic management strategies
based on localized feedback and incentives, such as advanced signaling, metering
and tolling, for both dynamic incident management and long-term traffic
behavior. The research path stems from recent successes in applying analytical
tools for the control of telecommunication networks and new developments in the
theory of evolutionary games. Project personnel have been involved in a new
formulation for the Internet congestion control problem based on user utility
functions and "congestion pricing". Project personnel also have been involved in
new methods for evolutionary game theory to derive mechanisms for the evolution
of strategies that assure a group of interacting decision makers will converge
to an equilibrium without explicitly sharing individual utility functions. This
project explores, both analytically and by simulation, to what degree these
advances can have a bearing on transportation networks for the specific problems
of 1) System level mandatory routing mechanisms for incident congestion, 2)
Vehicle level incentive routing for incident congestion, and 3) Vehicle level
incentive routing for recurring congestion.

A potential long-term societal impact of this project is a greater efficiency of
the transportation system and enhancing the ability of individual users to
improve their traffic experience. A more immediate educational impact will be to
train students on a multi-disciplinary viewpoint suitable for complex networks
through a seminar course to be developed at UCLA. As an additional outreach
effort, the project will develop an educational Website where visitors can
interact with a graphical interface and see the effect of policy decisions on
traffic patterns in a sample freeway system.
