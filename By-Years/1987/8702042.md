Between the extremes of perfect crystallinity and the complete disorder of
glasses, there are a number of interesting systems. A number of such materials
have the common feature that the partial degree of spatial coherence is
important in understanding the physical behavior which will be studied. It is
intended to carry out a systematic study of the structure of the decagonal phase
of metal alloys, in which there is apparently periodic order in one direction
combined with some high degree of aperiodic order in perpendicular directions.
Proposed experiments on the growth of order in alloys will test recent theories
based on scaling. Experiments will be done to further characterize a new phase
of solid oxygen. Finally, the melting of monolayer films of rare gases adsorbed
onto the face of MgO crystals, in hope of obtaining an experimental system which
is better suited than graphite for comparison to recent theories will be
studied. All of these systems will be studied by high resolution x-ray
diffraction, both at Stony Brook and at the National Synchrotron Light Source.
