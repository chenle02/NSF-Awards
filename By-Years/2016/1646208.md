Inspired by the manner in which humans improvise in everyday life, this NSF
project is creating a theory of algorithmic improvisation for cyber-physical
systems design. It is developing a mathematical framework, supported by tools,
to address the challenge of designing systems that adapt to uncertainty in their
operating environment and to changing requirements. Moreover, this framework has
broad relevance to many fields in computer science and engineering. Results from
the proposed work are being incorporated into teaching, with a particularly
strong impact on courses at UC Berkeley on cyber-physical systems and formal
methods, and on undergraduate projects conducted under broader outreach programs
at UC Berkeley. Additionally, through collaborations with industry partners, the
project is improving the state of the art in verification and control in the
cyber-physical systems industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uncertainty in the design
process, in the behavior of sub-systems that evolve over time, and in the
operating environment remains a challenge for CPS design. There is a need to
design automatic controllers that improvise to handle challenging situations as
a skilled human would. This project addresses this need with a foundation
approach that is developing a theoretically-sound definition of algorithmic
improvisation that is also grounded in practice. It is exploring the full range
of variations of the problem definition, analyzing their computational
complexity, and devising efficient algorithms where shown to be theoretically
possible. Additionally, it is developing new applications to verification, in
novel algorithms for simulation-driven verification and verification of machine
learning components, and to control, using improvisation for randomized robot
path planning and for controlled exploration in adaptive, learning-based
control. Together, this tight combination of theoretical work and practical
applications seeks to break new ground in the science of cyber-physical systems.
