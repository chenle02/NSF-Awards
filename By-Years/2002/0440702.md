Painters Alan Campbell and Colin Campbell will create landscape images and
portraits while in Antarctica for about 2 months in 2005. This collaboration
between art and U.S. Antarctic Program science will help to expand public
understanding of the region and the research. The partnership of art and science
will be central to the exhibitions, publications, and publicity flowing from the
project.

Along with works from Alan Campbell's earlier antarctic trips under NSF
auspices, these activities will produce drawings, watercolors, and oil paintings
that tell the story of a full austral summer season in Antarctica. The artworks
will include images of the landscape, wildlife, and light of Antarctica and
portraits of support personnel and scientists.

Exhibitions in New Zealand and the United States and two books are planned.
