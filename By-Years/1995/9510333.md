9510333 Daniels This program is directed toward measurement of electronic
excited state energies and conduction band gaps in compressed cryocrystals such
as solid argon and solid hydrogen using nonlinear optical spectroscopy. These
measurements are relevant to deep planetary atmospheres problems and to ongoing
questions related to a possible insulator-metal transition in highly compressed
hydrogen. The nonlinear optics methods used are required to excite the deep
ultraviolet states involved, while probing with optical beams transmittable by
pressure cell windows. %%% Properties of crystals such as solid hydrogen and
solid argon are crucial to understanding of phenomena in systems as diverse as
the deep atmosphere of the planet Jupiter or the change of materials from
electrically insulating to conducting when compressed to extremely high
pressures. Fundamental to this understanding is a knowledge of how electrons
behave at very pressures. This program is applying innovative methods using
high-powered laser light pulses to measure electron energies in compressed
simple systems including solid hydrogen and argon. ***
