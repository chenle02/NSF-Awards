The objective of the research is to develop a mathematical formalism for
analyzing plasma wave behavior under complicated geometrical conditions.
Emphasis is placed on MHD waves although waves of higher frequency will also be
considered. Non-linear interaction of MHD waves can produce a variety of
important effects that influence heating, instability, turbulence and transport
in plasmas. An example is non-linear Alfven waves which induce current channels
via conversion of wave helicity into helicity of the equilibrium magnetic field.
This conversion contributes to the plasma current and leads to heating and
plasma instability. In addition, circularly polarized Alfven waves can couple to
drift waves and evolve into localized vortex structures which give rise to
transport within the vortex structures. These will all be explored in some
detail with emphasis on laboratory and space plasmas. The areas covered include:
1. Mass flow effects on MHD wave activity 2. MHD processes in the solar corona
3. Transport and injection of Alfven wave helicity 4. Excitation of Alfven
vortex structures 5. Phase conjugation via non-linear mixing of plasma waves.
