9505386 Carroll The goal of this project is to obtain seasonal data on ozone and
ozone precursors in order to determine (1) the climatology of these species, and
(2) the photochemical and transport processes responsible for the formation and
loss of ozone at a rural site in the midwest. Continuous measurements of ozone,
carbon monoxide, temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and
ultraviolet radiation, as well as measurements of nitric oxide, nitrogen
dioxide, and total reactive nitrogen during four seasonal intensive periods will
be conducted at the University of Michigan Biological station, located near the
northern tip of Michigan's lower peninsula. The site chosen experiences
continental polar and temperate continental and maritime air masses. The
following techniques will be employed: ultraviolet absorption for ozone, non-
dispersive infrared analysis for carbon monoxide, photolysis of nitrogen dioxide
and catalytic conversion of total reactive nitrogen to nitric oxide, and
detection of NO via chemiluminescence. A photochemical box model will be used to
quantify in situ ozone formation at the site, and modeling studies will
investigate the current understanding of photochemistry of regional transport
events.
