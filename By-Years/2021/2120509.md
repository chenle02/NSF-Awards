microbes that live on and within animals including humans, contributes to
important host bodily functions and can be negatively impacted by disturbances
in a hostâ€™s environment. In this dissertation research project, the investigator
examines how anthropogenic disturbance alters the hair, oral, and gut
microbiomes of three primate species living in the same region. The comparative
nature of this research advances understanding about how host species-specific
factors and body region-specific factors relate to microbiome diversity in the
face of external disturbances. The project supports student training in STEM and
public science outreach activities, and can inform primate conservation efforts
for endangered species living in threatened areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent
studies have shown that the vertebrate microbiome is modified by ecological
conditions, and that reduced microbiome diversity is associated with host health
issues. However, despite the compelling relationships between host health,
environmental disturbance, and the microbiome, comparative primate studies
including microbial communities throughout the host body are lacking due to the
challenges of sampling wild primates. This project examines the relationship
between microbiome diversity and landscape disturbance, hair cortisol
concentration, body region, and host species. The researcher collects hair,
oral, and gut microbiome samples as well as hair cortisol samples from three
wild primate species in the same region. Diversity of microbiome samples is
analyzed by sequencing the 16S rRNA bacterial gene, a highly conserved gene
found in most bacteria and archaea that can be used to identify the taxa present
within the microbial communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
