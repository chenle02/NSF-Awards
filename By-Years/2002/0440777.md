This award will support a Data Management Office for the Southern Ocean
Experiment of the Global Ocean Ecosystems Dynamics Program (SO-Globec), now
entering the synthesis, analysis, and modeling phase. The experiments that
formed the U.S. Globec programs are large, multi-disciplinary, multi-year
oceanographic effortsinvolving many scientific investigators from many different
organizations. The Southern Ocean Experiment was a study of the winter survival
strategy of krill under the antarctic sea ice in the vicinity of Marguerite Bay
on the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula.&lt;br/&gt;The Data Management
Office will be responsible for providing the data management services required
by the scientific investigators of the Southern Ocean component of the U.S.
GLOBEC Program as they conclude their field research, analyze the data from
their individual efforts, and integrate the results with those from other
research components. The office will be coordinated and assisted by the same
team as the Northwest Atlantic Georges Bank Program. During the proposal period,
the office will manage data sets (CTD, biomass, meteorological, satellite, model
results, etc.) from the Southern Ocean investigators and make these data
available via an on-line, World Wide Web based, data management system (JGOFS);
maintain an inventory and program thesaurus of data field names; and support and
encourage data synthesis by providing on-line, web-based and stand-alone display
tools.&lt;br/&gt;
