This Postdoctoral Research Fellowship award to Dr. Christopher R. Friesen is
supported by both the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Office of
International Science and Engineering at the National Science Foundation. During
the 24-month fellowship, Dr. Friesen will work on a project titled, "The
Currency of Compromise: Oxidative stress and energetic demands mediate trade-
offs in selected traits in color-polymorphic male lizards," under the
sponsorship of Professor Mats Olsson at the University of Sydney, Australia.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are natural products of metabolic processes in the
cells of all organisms, which may damage DNA, proteins and cell membranes. ROS
production may be a physiological mechanism that underlies evolutionary trade-
offs between traits such as those involved in securing mates and securing
fertilizations. However, it is not known whether ROS production and/or the
innate ability to detoxify ROS in the face of increased energetic demands
mediate these types of trade-off in any organism. In this project, Dr. Friesen
will study these evolutionary trade-offs in a species of lizard (Ctenophorus
pictus) which lives only one year and thus sacrifices longevity for reproductive
output. The oxidative stress of both males and females will be experimentally
manipulated to test whether males with lowered oxidative stress are better sperm
competitors, and whether females with lowered oxidative stress can store sperm
for longer periods. Furthermore, the correlations between energetic expenditure,
oxidative stress, aggression and the production of numerous, high quality sperm
will be investigated.

Video dairies documenting the progress of this research will be produced and
posted online to engage the general public's curiosity of how science is
conducted. This award provides a unique opportunity for a US scientist to
collaborate with foreign scientists, and utilize the unique facilities,
expertise and experimental conditions available abroad.
