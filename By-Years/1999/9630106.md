This award supports the National Research Council of the National Academy of
Sciences to establish a Chemical Sciences Roundtable. The Roundtable will
provide the mechanism for vigorous dialog among top chemical expertise from
universities, industry, government, and nongovernmental organizations on issues
of great current concern to the chemical enterprise. The Roundtable will serve
as an educational vehicle for exchange of information. It will organize
workshops and publish a record of the discussions for dissemination throughout
the chemical sciences community, but will not make recommendations or provide
advice. As a neutral, credible forum managed by the NRC's Board on Chemical
Sciences and Technology, the Roundtable will enable communication among all
stakeholders in the chemical enterprise.
