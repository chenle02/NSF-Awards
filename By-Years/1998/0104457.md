Professor Daniel Romo in the Department of Chemistry at Texas A&amp;M University
is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program for his
development of concise and practical enantioselective syntheses of beta-lactones
via nucleophile catalyzed aldol-lactonizations (NCALs) of ketenes and aldehydes.
Novel transformations of these beta-lactones to form various heterocyclic
structures will be explored. The utility of the intramolecular NCAL reaction
will be illustrated by the total synthesis of a lactacystin analog and an
enantioselective synthesis of the natural product, brefeldin A. Mechanistic
studies on the NCAL reaction will be carried out using REACT IR and 1H
NMR.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular
Program, Professor Romo is developing novel methods by which certain highly
strained organic compounds can be prepared with precise control of their three-
dimensional structure. These compounds serve as intermediates which can be
further converted to more complex products, many of which are share similar
structural features with pharmacologically active compounds.
