This fundamental biomaterials proposal is directed toward the production of a
new generation of "smart biomaterials". This biomaterial will be placed around a
prosthesis that is to be inserted into a bone. The biomaterial has been designed
to slowly swell, thus, causing bone cells to deposit more bone and to reinforce
the prosthesis. This new biomaterial will "direct" bone growth where it is
needed.
