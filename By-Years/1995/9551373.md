The goal of this project is to introduce every student in developmental courses,
Prealgebra, Introductory Algebra, and Intermediate Algebra, to technology-based
problem-solving techniques using graphics calculators and/or computers. Its
objectives are to 1) create a classroom environment that fosters mathematical
thinking verbally and in writing, and 2) demonstrate to students, through
technology, the link between analytical, numerical, and graphical
interpretations of concepts. The mathematics department is 1) developing
technology-based activities for our developmental courses, 2) securing the
necessary equipment and make it available in the classroom to every instructor,
3) training all instructors, both full-time and part-time, on the use of the
equipment and provide ideas and guidelines on how to use the equipment
effectively, and 4) making sure students have access to the technology both in
and out of the classroom. This grant is funding equipment for 7 classrooms with
a teacher's station comprised of an overhead projector and screen, networked
computer, projection panel, graphics calculator overhead viewer, and Calculator-
Based Laboratory system with multiple probes. These classrooms support
approximately 2,400 students each year.
