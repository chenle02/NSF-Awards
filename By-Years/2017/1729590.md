The National Science Foundation's National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG)
regularly collects information on the degree to which a college graduate's work
in their principal job is related to their field of study. These data are of
considerable interest to researchers and policymakers who are concerned with the
adequacy of the science and engineering pipeline and the efficient utilization
of science and engineering education. However, following the initial research
and testing of job relatedness questions for inclusion in the 1993 NSCG, there
has been little research to validate these survey questions or probe how workers
conceptualize the relationship between their job and their education. Without
this validation of the job relatedness survey questions, it is difficult to
interpret the rapidly growing amount of research in this area. This project
fills that knowledge gap, providing a much firmer foundation for future research
on the science and engineering pipeline. The project generates specific
recommendations to the National Science Foundation on possible revisions to
future versions of the NSCG. The research also provides broader insights into
the data collection of other federal agencies on the relationship between a
worker?s education and training and their current job.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project takes a two-pronged, mixed methods approach to understanding how science
and engineering graduates understand the relation of their job to their field of
study. The first approach is to analyze existing NSCG data to determine the
factors and job characteristics that induce a graduate to identify their job as
related or unrelated to their field of study. The analysis distinguishes these
factors from the factors which cause a graduate to work in a job that is not
related to their field of study, such as a weak labor market. The factors that
induce a graduate to identify their job as related or unrelated are the most
relevant for the validation of the job relatedness measures. Survey data
analysis is rarely sufficient for fully understanding social phenomena, so the
project also involves interviews with science and engineering graduates employed
in a wide range of occupations. These interviews provide richer context for
understanding how science and engineering graduates think about the relationship
between their education and their work. They explore questions that are not
easily inferred from the NSCG, including whether the interview subject?s job
expectations were met or the role of the passage of time in respondents? feeling
of connection with their field of study.
