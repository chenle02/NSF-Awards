This award is for the acquisition of a real time disc system with color monitor,
camera, printer, and recorder/player. The instruments are to support research
projects in motion adaptive video coding with motion compensation and motion
measurement by matching approaches. The instrument upgrades current black and
white equipment to color. One method of squeezing more use out of limited
broadcast channels is to discover new ways of coding color and motion
information. These will become particularly important with the advent of high
definition television and is critical to some of the proposed HDTV standards.
This equipment award is for the acquisition of a real time color video display
system for use in research on motion and color coding algorithms.
