The Seventh Southwestern Developmental Biology Conference will be held March
23-25, 1989 in Fort Worth, Texas. The function of the Regional Conferences is to
provide a more informal opportunity than national meetings for the exchange of
information on development. Participation by graduate students, postdoctorals
and junior faculty is encouraged. The theme of the meeting will be "Embryology
and Evolution" but contributed papers on other topics will be welcome. %%% The
regional developmental biology meetings provide a valuable educational
experience for graduate and post doctoral students. Their small size allows for
workers at all levels of their careers to interact with others in their region.
