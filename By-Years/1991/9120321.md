The PIs will utilize techniques of nonlinear dynamics to characterize parameter
spaces supporting various solutions. This will help to predict stable boundary
layers. Systems of ordinary differential equations (ODE) will be used along with
more complete partial equation (PDE) descriptions of these systems. The project
will analyze both the simpler ODE systems and the PDE systems. Multidimensional
bifurcation and regime diagrams will be developed to describe the role of
various parameters in determining the solution regimes.
