This grant provides accessories that expand the capabilities of a just-
delivered Riber 32 MBE machine and to purchase materials-characterization
instrumentation. The machine expansion consists of two parts: a thermal
treatment unit, resulting in higher purity and higher throughput growth; and
effusions cells, power supplies, and controllers to permit dopants to be added.
The materials-characterization instruments will be used to study quantitatively
the relationship between the presence of dopants and the electrical and optical
properties of the MBE-grown materials; to quantify overall crystal quality, to
identify dopant and carrier concentration and mobility; and to give carrier type
and concentration as a function of materials depth. These instruments will
expand our capability to study the basic electronic and nonlinear optical
properties of materials, and to fabricate and test all-optical (nonlinear
optical) and electro-optic devices for photonics.
