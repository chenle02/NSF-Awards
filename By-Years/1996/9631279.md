w:\awards\awards96\*.doc 9631279 Weitz The proposed research will develop a
novel, general purpose and widely applicable method to use light scattering to
non-evasively measure the elastic properties of 'soft' materials. This new
technique will extend significantly the range over which elastic properties an
be measured and will directly relate the response of the medium to its internal
dynamics. The technique will be exploited to obtain new insight into the origin
of the elasticity in a variety of disordered, or glassy, 'soft' materials,
including colloidal suspensions near their glass transition, polymer solutions
and polymer melts, compressed emulsions, networks of bio-polymers such as DNA
and actin, and slowly aging systems. %%% The proposed research will develop a
novel, laser-based method to non-invasively probe essential properties of a wide
class of materials, including gels, and biomolecules such as DNA and actin, a
fibrous molecule that imparts strength to cells. The technique will measure the
mechanical properties of the materials, thus determining whether their behavior
is more 'solid- like' (as in gelatin) or fluid-like (as in honey), and will
significantly extend the range of applicability of traditional methods. The
knowledge gained by these studies will provide new insight into underlying
origins of the mechanical properties of the materials investigated.. It will
also facilitate the application of the materials in commercial or medical areas.
