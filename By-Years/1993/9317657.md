9317657 Sogin This proposal seeks to offer interdisciplinary training and
promote collaborative efforts between molecular biologists, organismal
biologists and theoreticians. Prominent scientists in molecular biology,
ecology, population biology, organismal biology and biometrics will offer a high
powered lecture series. Topics to be covered include but are not limited to the
theory of phylogenetic (genealogical) reconstruction, macromolecular alignment
techniques, current trends in molecular phylogenetics, molecular approaches to
studies of population biology and biodiversity, comparative molecular biology,
and comparative analysis of genome data bases. The lectures will be augmented by
a computer laboratory. Students will have the opportunity to use state-of-the-
art facilites to test theoretical concepts described in the lecture series.
Guided by authors of phylogenetic analytic software programs and designers of
data base retrieval software from the National Laboratory of Medicine, the
students will have the opportunity to compare different analytical techniques
for molecular data. The computer laboratory will be equipped with diverse
computer platforms and will offer each student the opportunity to work in an
environment that is relevant to hardware configurations available at their home
institution. The opportunity to implement concepts described in the lecture
series using diverse up-to-date computer hardware is a distinguishing feature of
this course. The course is designed for established investigators, postdoctoral
fellows, and graduate students from diverse biological fields.
