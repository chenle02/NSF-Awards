This REU site award supports six undergraduate research students who will work
under the supervision of research faculty on mathematical problems in five
areas. They include harmonic analysis and the phi-transform, complex analysis
and differential equations, population genetics, image processing and
combinatorial number theory. Seven faculty will be involved at various stages of
the program. Regularly scheduled meetings together with informal discussions are
used to develop interactions among the students and faculty. Although not
required, students will be encouraged to prepare their results for presentation
and publication. As Washington University is one of the preeminent research
institutions in the country, the students have an exceptional opportunity to
meet many of the visitors who pass through the campus during the summer.
