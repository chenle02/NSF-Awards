9354552 Bagchi The purpose of this project is to develop a new project-based and
applications oriented linear algebra sequence of two courses for science,
engineering, and management students. The first of these courses serves as an
alternative to calculus for freshment. Drawing from the experience of successful
project-based curricula at WPI, these courses are being developed around project
work, hands-on experience with real world applications, extensive computer
usage, and written laboratory reports. WPI mathematics majors are playing an
important role in the development of this curricula as part of their junior and
senior projects. The modular course structure allows flexibility in customizing
these courses to student and instructor needs, thereby enhancing portability to
other institutions. ***y
