9313920 Yngvesson A joint research project is undertaken between researchers at
Moscow State Pedagogical University (MSPU), and University of Massachusetts at
Amherst (UM/A). The two groups have during the last few years separately
developed hot electron devices which have the potential for realizing a new
generation of receivers and detectors for the range 0.5-3 THz (wavelengths 600
um to 100 um), with much lower noise temperature than any present receiver. MSPU
has concentrated on thin film superconductors, while UM/A has utilized the two-
dimensional electron gas (2DEG) medium at a semiconductor hetero-junction. The
basic principles of the two devices are quite similar: a heated medium
consisting of quasi-particles (in the superconductor case), or 2DEG electrons,
is created, in which detection or mixing takes place. Recent work at both
institution has resulted in available bandwidth with demonstrations GHz range.
MSPU has shown that their devices mix up to at least 1.5 THz. A comparative
study of inelastic relaxation processes in the two media is proposed, thus
expanding the basic knowledge of inelastic relaxation processes a Howing
development of optimum hot electron-based THz mixers. The two most promising
materials known at the present time, NbN films and 2DEG at heterostructures of
GaAs/A1GaAs, have been singled out for specific comparison. ***
