This project supports a workshop by the National Academy of Sciences to develop
a research briefing and a paper on the role of the mathematical sciences in high
performance computing and computation. The briefing paper will be used in
planning at the National Science Foundation and will be distributed to other
federal agencies that support research in the mathematical sciences and high
performance computing. The project has particular promise for identifying
research opportunities and research topics in the mathematical sciences that
require emphasis in order that the High Performance Computing and Communications
program outlined by the Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering,
and Technology reach its full potential.
