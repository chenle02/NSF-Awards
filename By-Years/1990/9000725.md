A REU site is established to provide the undergraduate engineering student a
research experience in biophysical systems. The objectives of the program are to
1) develop the mental processes of the student to identify and creatively solve
research problems in biophysical systems, 2) provide research examples through
seminars, literature reviews and active interaction in research projects with
faculty and industrial personnel, and 3) enhance the written and oral
communication ability of participating students through presentation of research
procedures and findings. The program is designed to supplement the existing
strong design component of the curriculum and encourage future research
involvement of participating students. Educational programs including seminars,
course work and stimulating research projects have been planned to instill an
interest in and enthusiasm for future research activities. Several research
projects applying biophysical processes have been initiated. A program to locate
and actively recruit academically qualified students has been developed to
ensure success of the overall education effort.
