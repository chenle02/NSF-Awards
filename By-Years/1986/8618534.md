This research will employ light scattering to examine the conformations of
flexible polymers in flowing solution. Emphasis will center on extensional
flows, which can greatly perturb Gaussian polymer chains from their equilibrium,
spherical shape. Despite its importance to many industrial processes in which
macromolecules are stretched in flow, polymer structure away from equilibrium is
still not well understood. Dilute solutions will be examined using low.angle
light scattering, and low.angle neutron scattering will be attempted for
semidilute and moderately concentrated solutions. In addition to steady
measurements, a new flow device will make possible study of the transient
stretching of flexible macromolecules in Lagrangian unsteady flows. Unsteady
flows are typically found in such commercial applications as fiber spinning, and
have been made difficult to examine systematically with conventional methods.
The results of the proposed research will provide more direct, and less
ambiguous, measurements of polymer conformation than can be obtained by other
techniques.
