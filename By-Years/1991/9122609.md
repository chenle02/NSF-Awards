This award provides funds to Stanford University for the purchase of
instrumentation for the Stanford Synchrotron Research Laboratory (SSRL). The
equipment will facilitate data collection and analysis, allowing a significant
increase in the number and types of experiments that can be performed, and will
maximize the benefits to be gained from the recent improvement in quality and
availability of synchrotron radiation at SSRL. The rapid growth in the
understanding of the structure and function of proteins at the atomic level has
resulted in large part through the development and perfection of computational
tools and hardware used for X-ray crystallographic analysis of enzymes and other
proteins. The use of synchrotrons as X-ray sources has, in particular, allowed
the investigation of the structure of viruses and other very large protein
structures that are otherwise inaccessible. Recent improvements in synchrotron
design and in the equipment used for data collection and reduction has made once
difficult investigations routine and has made new lines of investigation into
enzyme mechanism possible. The equipment being purchased will provide the
benefits of this progress to a large number of investigators from all sectors of
the research community who use the SSRL.
