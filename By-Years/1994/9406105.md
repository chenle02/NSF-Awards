9406105 Frey The 8 x 10 Km Horoman Peridotite (Hokkaido, Japan) is a layered
upper mantle peridotite that contains a record of melt segregation, migration
and reaction processes that have created considerable geochemical heterogeneity.
In a collaborative effort with Japanese colleagues, F. Frey (MIT), graduate
student E. Takazawa (MIT) and N. Shimizu (WHOI) are determining the geochemical
characteristics of Horoman rocks and their constituent clinopyroxene. These data
have been used to establish that: (a) the main rock type, plagioclase
lherzolite, is a suitable source rock for mid-ocean ridge basalts but that (b)
the plagioclase-free lherzolites and harzburgites which are relatively depleted
in CaO and Al2O3 have reacted with an incompatible element-rich melt. This
enrichment of incompatible elements, expressed by high light REE/heavy REE
abundance ratios, is commonly known as "mantle metasomatism". By studying the
spatial extent of the melt- peridotite reaction in three dimensions (an
objective that cannot be attained by studying mantle xenoliths), the mechanism
and scale of this process is being determined. The results of this study will
identify the sequences of events and processes that create heterogeneous upper
mantle in an arc and oceanic tectonic settings.
