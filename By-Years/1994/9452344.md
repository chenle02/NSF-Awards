9452344 Nwankpa The interconnected power system laboratory is designed to give
the student an understanding of the important phenomena exhibited when operating
and controlling modern day power systems. The main feature of this laboratory is
that it uses real generators, transformers, motors, loads and relays
interconnected through transmission lines to form a power system which operates
at a frequency of 6O Hz and voltage level of 22O V. Experience gained at working
in such a laboratory cannot be easily obtained using a software simulation
package. The power curriculum has four on-going laboratories for studying
machines, protective relaying systems, power electronics and high voltage, which
are being interconnected so that students have the ability to practically learn
about the dynamics and operation of the interconnected components. The system is
monitored and controlled via a set of personal computers (PCs), which emulates
an energy management system (EMS) and remote terminal units (RTUs). This allows
the student to obtain a good understanding of the dynamics of the system, its
limitations and methods of control. In essence a reduced version of an actual
modern-day EMS center for a power utility is at the hands of the student.
