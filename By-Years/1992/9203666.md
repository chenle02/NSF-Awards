This an individual award for the Postdoctoral Fellowship in Plant Biology. The
applicant received her Ph.D. from the University of Illinois and her Ph.D.
research was in regulation of photosynthetic metabolism in barely. She plans to
carry out her postdoctoral fellowship research in the laboratory of Dr. June
Nasrallah at Cornell University. The proposed research entitled "Analysis of the
role of protein phosphorylation in the self-incompatibility response of
Brassica" will broaden the training of the Fellow into plan molecular genetics
and developmental biology.
