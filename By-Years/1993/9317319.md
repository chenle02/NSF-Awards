9317319 Padman This project is the analysis of the data set obtained as part of
an integrated research program into the oceanographic structure of the western
Weddell Sea. The field work was carried out from an ice camp jointly occupied by
U.S. and Russian scientists from February to June 1992. The data set obtained by
the principal investigator consists of high frequency vertical profiles of
velocity and temperature from an acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP) and a
string of twelve internally recording temperature sensors, as well as a Rapid
Sampling Vertical Profiler, a tethered sensor system that free falls through the
upper 250 meters of the ocean. The observational phase of the project was
extremely successful. The objective of the analysis phase is to study the
dynamics of diapycnal momentum and energy fluxes in the upper mixed layer, and
to investigate their dependence on shear induced mixing and double diffusion.
The work will also provide kinematic descriptions of the barotropic and
baroclinic variability of surface currents and temperature which will be used to
study how the free internal gravity wave field responds to topography and to
changes in the large-scale hydrography. ***
