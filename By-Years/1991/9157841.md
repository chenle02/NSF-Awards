Five specific aims to investigate the molecular control of meiotic initiation
in cattle will be pursued. SA1: Analyze proteins produced by oocytes matured in
the presence or absence of transcriptional inhibition. SA2: Identify cDNAs for
gene products required for initiation of meiosis. SA3: Idenfify bovine CDC2 - &
cyclin - like cDNAs. SA4: Analyze expression of CDC2 - and cyclin -like mRNAs
during oogenesis and meiotic maturation. SA5: Analyze bovine CDC2 - & cyclin -
like genes by southern hybridization. These studies will provide novel research
data on cell proliferation supporting animal biotech industries. //
