They will study the properties of strongly correlated Fermi systems using the
techniques of many body theory and the renormalization group. These
investigations are relevant to the heavy fermion compounds, liquid helium III
and the recently discovered high temperature superconductors. They will also
investigate the effect of correlations in systems which are not translational
invariant. These studies are relevant to doped semiconductors and amorphous bulk
and thin film superconductors.
