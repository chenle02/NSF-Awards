The equipment acquired will be used to integrate existing laboratories and
equipment into an instructional CIM laboratory system. Existing facilities
contain most of the component parts of CIM systems, but are not yet capable of
integrated operation. The robotics, machine tool, microprocessor, and automatic
controls laboratories are all involved. A single-site, robot-based experimental
system will be used as well as machine-tool and inspection workstations. The
single-site system will allow many CIM experiments to share the same facility,
an essential feature for educational use. Recent additions of workstation
computers and building networking have made implementation of an educational CIM
system attractive. The new equipment fills important gaps needed to make such a
system a reality and includes measurement and actuation components, network
adapters, and real-time computers.
