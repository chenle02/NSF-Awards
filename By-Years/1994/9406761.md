9406761 Beckage This is a request for funds to sponsor a symposium entitled,
"Parasitic Effects on Host Hormones and Behavior" at the January 1995 meeting of
the American Society of Zoologists. A panel of 19 speakers have confirmed their
willingness to participate in the symposium. The topic is timely and is of broad
interest to a diverse groups of scientists; it will likely attract a wide range
of researchers and students in endocrinology, behavior, immunology, and
evolutionary biology. Presentations on invertebrates and vertebrates will be
interspersed, to attract a wide audience and emphasize comparison among diverse
taxa. The speakers include several individuals of junior rank as well as several
internationally recognized senior scientists. ***
