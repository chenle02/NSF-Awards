University of Illinois Chicago When Just Procedures and Outcomes Conflict: A
Value Pluralism Model of Justice The PI proposes to investigate a model of
justice which integrates the two social psychological theories of procedural and
distributive justice. The central tenets of the PI's theory are (1) when just
outcomes are ambiguous, people's sense of justice will be determined by the
perceived fairness of the procedures; (2) when just outcomes are clear, people's
sense of justice will depend on whether these outcomes are achieved. The PI's
hypotheses will be tested in a two-stage telephone survey. During the first
stage the respondents will be queried about their stance on three controversial
issues and the perceived importance of these issues. Three weeks later the
respondents will be asked about their perceived fairness of laws affecting these
issues.
