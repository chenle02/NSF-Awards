This research project tests whether transparency by government leads to
beneficial outcomes such as better performance by government, more engagement
from citizens in public life, and improved trust in government. These kinds of
outcomes are the reasons why so many countries, including the United States,
have embraced transparency by government. Yet, there is not much direct evidence
that transparency efforts by governments produce the noted results.

The project uses a randomized field experiment to test whether transparency by a
government agency affects citizen support for government and improves the
administration of public funds. Data on these outcomes is used to statistically
test for the effects of government-led transparency at individual and community
levels. Funding is for Phase 1 only of the project.
