The subject of this research is the electromechanics of granular beds of
magnetizable particles. The purpose of this research is to establish the link
between inter-particle forces, packing, and magnetic cohesive stresses. The
research program is organized in three sections: a phenomenological
investigation using flow visualization as a tool; a modeling exercise involving
finite element magnetic field calculation and use of Rumpf's method to relate
inter-particle force to cohesive stress; and experimental measurement of tensile
strength as a function of magnetic field and other important parameters.
