Theoretical investigations will be undertaken concerning the character of the
fragmentation phase transition of nuclear matter and to determine the parameters
of the nuclear equation of state from the study of the decay products of medium
to high energy heavy ion collisions. The work will utilize a new
phenomenological model based on bond percolation theory designed for the study
of the nuclear fragmentation phase transition, also recently developed
techniques which describe heavy ion collisions via a nuclear transport theory
which incorporates one- and two-body effects. In cooperation with experimental
heavy ion physicists one will attempt to define more meaningful observables for
the study of the time history, impact parameter selection, degree of
equilibration, and phase space geometry in heavy ion reactions.
