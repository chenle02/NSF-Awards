This project develops mathematical and computational approaches for big data
exploitation. Fast and online&lt;br/&gt;algorithms that learn and adapt as data
arrives and changes are developed. How to automatically&lt;br/&gt;understand and
reduce redundancy in the data, for a given task, is also addressed in this
project. Big data&lt;br/&gt;comes in multiple forms, e.g., audio and video,
audio and text, video and weather, video from multiple&lt;br/&gt;sources, brain
imaging from multiple modalities, friendship networks and individual
preferences. This is&lt;br/&gt;also addressed in this project. The broad impact
of the research is born in the large and diverse&lt;br/&gt;applicability of big
data and in the techniques here developed. In the education arena, the
developed&lt;br/&gt;Internet classes have an audience of tens of thousands, and
the project provides unique integration of&lt;br/&gt;research and undergraduate
education via different Duke initiatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The framework
follows the parsimony theory of sparse modeling. Challenges are addressed with a
gamechanging&lt;br/&gt;paradigm: learning to optimize; on-line learning what the
task-dependent optimizer is expected&lt;br/&gt;to do, developing computationally
efficient algorithms to approximate the ideal behavior of
sometimes&lt;br/&gt;unknown optimizers. The work derives novel multi-modal
formulations for network inference, and realtime&lt;br/&gt;on-line robust PCA
and robust NMF, fundamental tools in big data modeling and exploitation;
as&lt;br/&gt;well as robust 3D shape, networks, and multi-modal matching. The
formulation elegantly solves bilevel&lt;br/&gt;optimization problems rendering
it efficient for classification and signal separation tasks.
Sparse&lt;br/&gt;modeling is extended to new venues and algorithms, making such
techniques usable for big data. The&lt;br/&gt;formulations and theoretical
foundations are complemented with numerous applications.
