This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2009 and
supports a research and training plan entitled "A novel type of position
specific recombination: Acinetobacter baylyi as a model bacterium to understand
gene duplication and amplification" for Kathryn T. Elliot. The host institution
for this research is University of Georgia and Georgia Institute of Technology
under the sponsorships of Dr. Ellen Neidle and Dr. King Jorgan, respectively.

Gene duplication and amplification are important in adaptation, evolution, and
medically significant processes, such as drug resistance and cancer. Due to its
reversibility, gene amplification is difficult to study. However, new tools
developed in a soil bacterium, Acinetobacter baylyi, have enabled advances in
the investigation of gene amplification. These methods revealed a novel pathway
generating gene duplication prior to amplification. Some duplications form at
precisely the same point in independently selected mutants without any apparent
similarity between those sequences that are joined together far too often to be
considered random chance. This research is developing computational methods to
characterize these sequences. These methods will determine whether there are
more complex patterns and relationships between these frequently joined
sequences that go undetected in the absence of sophisticated computation.

Training plans in addition to computational methods include honing mentoring
skills by working with students. Recruitment will build on current programs at
the University of Georgia, including an NSF-funded Research Experience for
Undergraduates site program. Underrepresented minorities and deaf or hard-of-
hearing students will be included. Broader impacts include the possibility to
predict and exploit genome rearrangements. Long-term goals seek to counteract
the harmful effects of gene amplification
