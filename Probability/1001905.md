The PI's work concerns deterministic systems whose small-scale behavior is
designed to mimic the average case behavior of random systems. In many cases the
large-scale behavior of such "quasirandom" systems reproduces interesting
aspects of the large-scale behavior of the random systems they mimic. At the
same time, quasirandom systems exhibit many rich and complex patterns specific
to the deterministic context, and these patterns demand explanation.

One reason for studying quasirandom systems is that they may have applications
to Monte Carlo simulation: it could be that for many random systems of interest
to scientists, the best way to get statistical information about the system is
to replace it by a quasirandom analogue. But in the longer run the real
significance of the PI's work may be the way it shows that many of the theorems
of probability theory remain true when they are recast as statements about
discrepancy, with no mention of probability at all. Such a radical revision of
probability theory seems necessary if we are ever to understand how non-random
mathematical objects (like the digits of pi) behave "as if they were random".
