This is a two year cooperative research project proposed by Dr. Jer-Ming Chiu,
Memphis State University, and Professor Yeong Tein Yeh, Academia Sinica,
supported by the AIT (U.S.) - CCNAA (Taiwan) Cooperative Science Program. This
study plans to develop high-resolution 3-D crustal imaging for the Hualien area
of central Eastern Taiwan using the data collected by the PANDA arrays. The 3-D
high-resolution structure/geological data are currently unavailable, but are
useful in examining the relationship between the earthquake processes and their
associated ground movement. All instruments and the local field expenses for
this study are covered by the scientists in Taiwan while the US-Taiwan Program,
NSF provides the funds for three visitors travelling to Taiwan. This is a cost-
effective project with significant gain to the U.S. earthquake research
community.
