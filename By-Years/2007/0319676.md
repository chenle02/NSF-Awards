This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I aims to develop an
electrochemical DNA biosensor to simultaneously detect and identify multiple
nucleic acid determinants of a variety of biological pathogens using a
combination of dynamic hybridization, microfluidics, and electrochemical
detection. The sensitivity of the detection method is high enough that
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification could be eliminated. The detection
system would consist of a sampling device, sample lysis and hybridization
chamber fluidically connected to an electrochemical cell for detection. With
this method, specific target nucleic acid species captured by oligonucleotide
probes on magnetic particles are released into neighboring working electrode
where the nucleic acid targets are directly detected by electrochemical
oxidation. This provides a method of rapid, highly sensitive, and specific DNA
detection without the need for complicated sample purification procedures,
exogenous labels, labile reagents, or expensive, heavy, power-hungry
instrumentation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial use of this product will
be in military applications and homeland defense for prompt detection of
potential bioterrorist attacks. Development of such devices for DNA and RNA
detection without the need for amplification steps would also find wide
application in the detection of pathogens in medical diagnostics, point-of-care
clinical testing, environmental monitoring, agriculture, food production, and
various industrial settings. &lt;br/&gt;
