Continued single-year, high-precision (0.2%) measurements of carbon-14 (C-14)
from tree-ring samples will be made in order to provide a continuous record from
AD 998 to 1954. The record will be examined for evidence of high-energy solar
flare events, and hard gamma-rays associated with Supernova RX J0852.0-4622 (ca.
1300-1350). It will also be possible to determine if the 11yr and 22yr cosmic
ray modulation cycles extend through the Oort and Wolf Minima. The search for
correlations between changes in solar activity and climate change will continue
to be emphasized. Participation in the construction of INTCAL 03 will also be
supported.
