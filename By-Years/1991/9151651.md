The Chemistry Department is acquiring an FTIR spectrometer for use in freshman
through senior chemistry courses. Students are using the instrument in nine new
experiments which have been developed. At the freshman level the instrument is
aiding students in the identification of a copper complexes; at the upper level
steric effects on hydrogen bonding, analysis of solids by diffuse reflectance
methods, and reaction kinetics studies are being explored.
