The proposed research focuses on several topics in Integer Programming with the
objective of advancing our understanding of the underlying mathematics of some
combinatorial optimization problems. The importance of the research lies on the
fact that significant advances on the understanding of the mathematics
associated with these problems yield improvements in the capacity of solving
large scale problems, that typically arise in real world applications. The
techniques to be used are the ones typical of Integer Programming and Polyhedral
Combinatorics. More specifically, the PI's will investigate structural
propertiese of 0.1 matrices whose associated set packing polytope has integer
extreme points. They also intend to continue investigations on the facial
structure of some polytopes associated with some packing or covering problems.
Algorithmic issues related to optimization problems on circuits of binary
matroids will also be studied. Professors Rao and Conforti are well known
researchers in combinatorial optimization and are well qualified to achieve
success in this research. New York University is a suitable environment for the
study. An award is recommended at the revised budget level for two years.
