The object of the research is to bring a quantitative analysis to the study of
the topology of the large-scale structure in the universe. A computer program
has been developed to measure the topology of the universe and it will be
applied to a large number of observational data sets and N-body simulations. The
algorithm smoothes the data set, constructs surfaces of constant density
(density contours) and measures the topology of the contour surfaces as a
function of density enhancement. The preliminary results obtained so far have
been quite encouraging. In many models (including those involving cold dark
matter) the topology of smoothed constant density enhancement at the present
epoch reflects that present in the initial conditions. Models with random phases
(as might arise form quantum noise in inflationary cosmologies) have a universal
dependence of topology on density enhancement which can be compared with the
observations. These studies should provide some important new insights into the
nature of the observed topology and its relation to the initial conditions that
produced it.
