9725891 Baldwin This grant provides two years partial salary support for a
technician to oversee operation and maintenance and to provide training to new
users of the University of Arizona Noble gas mass spectrometry laboratory. This
technical position has been and will continue to be, shared between Suzanne
Baldwin (Dept of Geosciences) and Timothy Swindle (Dept of Planetary Sciences).
Given the primary source of research support of the latter, NASA will co-fund a
portion of the technician's salary. The Noble gas group at the University of
Arizona has traditionally focused on terrestrial geochronology and
thermochronology using the 40-Ar/39-Ar technique for studies in tectonics and
cosmochemistry and planetary scale chronology using the 129-I/129-Xe system.
More recently, with the addition to the faculty of Marek Zreda, they have
expanded into the 3-He/4-He system and the use of 21Ne as both tracers and
environmental proxies of hydrologic systems. The new arrival of a second Noble
gas mass spectrometer in this laboratory (funded through the W. M. Keck
Foundation) will add significantly to the research capabilities of this group
and to the duties of the technician. ***
