from June 3 to June 8, 2002. The week-long workshop will teach students the
basic puhsics of synchrotron radiation and how it can be utilized in
environemntal studies. Both theory and hands-on experimants will be conducted
and the course material will be turned into a self-contained book for wider
distribution following the workshop.
