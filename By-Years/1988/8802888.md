The technique of linkage has been instrumental in attacking a diverse group of
problems in commutative algebra. Professors Kustin and Miller will concentrate
in this research mainly on the aspects of the theory that involve the interplay
of linkage with the structure of finite free resolution of perfect ideals,
putting particular emphasis on the multiplicative structures supported on these
resolutions. They will also extend this study to the more flexible relation of
residual intersection, so that previous techniques can be extended to a wider
class of algebras. They are particularly interested in Rees algebras, and
algebras defined by sequences and matrices of indeterminates. Applications to
determination of rationality of Poincare series and the computation of certain
K-groups are expected.
