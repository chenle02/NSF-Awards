The research objective of this award is to quantify the mechanical environment
of a bone injury and its association with the response of skeletal progenitor
cells at the injury site. Skeletal progenitor cells play a principal role in
healing of bone fractures and other skeletal injuries and can differentiate into
one of multiple, committed cell types depending on stimuli in their local
environment. The planned studies will apply a combination of experimental and
computational tools from engineering and biology to label progenitor cells at
the injury site, to quantify the mechanical environment of the tissues in which
these cells reside, and to identify the specific mechanical stimuli (e.g., shear
strain, pressure, etc.) associated with the recruitment of these cells and their
various fates. These studies will define the mechanical conditions highly
favorable to formation of a given type of skeletal tissue, such as bone,
cartilage, and fibrous tissue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These studies will
accelerate the pace of discovery in several areas of basic and clinical
research, including defining mechanical environments that can promote bone
healing, uncovering the mechanisms by which mechanical stimuli can influence
cell differentiation, and identifying new classes of molecular targets for
enhancing bone formation. Each of these avenues is directed towards alleviating
the personal and economic costs arising from bone injuries, and in particular,
from poor healing of these injuries. The educational components of the project
consist of training of junior scientists and engineers-two graduate students and
three undergraduate students will be mentored on this research project-and on
enhancing a successful, residential summer program for low-income, high-school
girls interested in scientific and quantitative fields of study. Content for the
program is supplied by university faculty and staff, industry partnerships, and
outreach modules designed by undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in
courses in engineering mechanics and biomechanics.
