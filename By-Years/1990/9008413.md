Because so much of SDSC's user community is not locally resident, a challenge
for the center is to provide visualization tools for these remote users. This
need will be addressed by developing visualization tools for the general case of
network-based environments. Thus, the software tools that that will be developed
will be structured to use network communications (e.g., sockets and remote
procedures calls) as the method of communication between a computer and an
interactive graphics display.
