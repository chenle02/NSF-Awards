In the laboratory/classroom in use here, the students (pre- service and in-
service teachers) have before them the entire course content from the first day
of class. In hypertext form guided by concept maps, the student are able to
freely navigate through the course material and use the aids there to do
numerical calculations, examine illustrations and simulations, and of course
find discussion of the relevant concepts. The HyperCard stacks on a Macintosh
computer are projected on a screen to form the basis for lecture and discussion
in the class, enabling the student to have the same illustrations and
calculations in front of them. With two students to a machine, class members
choose to follow along or do independent calculations or explorations, knowing
they are able to merge back with the track of the lecturer at any time.
Laboratory exercises are integrated as a part of almost every session, and the
versatile laboratory interface plus spreadsheet and graphics software allow the
students to analyze and present data in an atmosphere typical of modern research
facilities. The HyperCard knowledge base is accessible to the student at any
point during the laboratory, containing not only detailed information about lab
equipment and procedure, but also links to the classroom material for review of
concepts. This project has equipped the multimedia laboratory classroom needed
to implement this instructional strategy on a pilot basis with this target group
and to lay the base for expanding this approach to other undergraduate courses.
