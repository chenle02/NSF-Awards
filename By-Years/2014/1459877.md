Disagreement is ubiquitous in society, often resulting in social conflict. Can
disagreement on an issue be reduced by obtaining more information? The PI will
investigate various questions related to this theme. The project beings by
showing that while more information can sometimes reduce disagreement, it can
also increase disagreement. The main focus is on when more information should be
expected to reduce disagreement "on average".The second part of the project uses
the results on disagreement to study problems in information economics.

The PI will develop models of persuasion, signaling, and markets with adverse
selection to understand how an agent's information revelation is affected by the
arrival of additional information. The additional information can be either
exogenous or endogenously provided by other agents. Inter alia, new results will
be obtained on how competition affects information provision.
