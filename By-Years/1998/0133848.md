This project will investigate how information technology is transforming
financial markets and stock exchanges, which have historically introduced
technological innovations that are later deployed in other markets, with the
goal of understanding how other markets will be impacted by electronic trading
systems. This research will identify ways to improve current systems, enhance
the design of future systems, understand when electronic trading systems are
valuable, and anticipate the adoption of future technologies. Using both public
and proprietary data from the world's largest electronic market, Nasdaq, this
program will use a variety of econometric techniques to explore how electronic
trading systems impact stock markets both during and outside of the traditional
trading day. The insights into the development of electronic markets and
technological innovations in trade will be incorporated in MBA and undergraduate
classes to improve understanding of the real-world tradeoffs between different
market structures and the organization of an integrated firm versus coordination
though markets and in a Ph.D. seminar to study features critical to electronic
markets' success and technology adoption and diffusion across electronic
markets. This program is the beginning of a research agenda focused on related
questions in other electronic markets and ways that information technology
transforms commerce.
