The PI plans some focused experiments and theoretical modeling that are aimed
at attaining a constitutive law based upon a model of crack healing and
subcritical crack growth. He has developed a preliminary theoretical model, with
these processes as the underlying basis for it and has found that this model
fits the experimental data better than the existing models. He has also found in
experiments on serpentine that there is clear evidence of two processes
operating simultaneously during frictional sliding, with their relative
importance depending upon sliding velocity.
