0227793&lt;br/&gt;Swearingen &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is to Montana
State University to support the activity described below for 36 months. The
proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program
Solicitation (NSF 02060).&lt;br/&gt;The partners include Montana State
University (Lead Institution), MSU Techlink Center, Center for Entrepreneurship
for the New West, Montana Office for Economic Opportunity, Technology Venture
Center. The program includes: (1) formation of a sustainable, long-term
innovation partnership that will provide a major engine for the emerging
technology sector in Montana, (2) formation of an enhanced infrastructure for
creating new technology companies in the state, (3) recruitment of women and
Native Americans for entrepreneurship training and new technology-business
opportunities, (4) establishment of at least a dozen new technology companies in
Montana State University's Advanced Technology Park and then elsewhere in
Montana, and (5) development of a new model for technology-business creation in
rural states.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Montana currently ranks 50th in the United
States in annual pay and 48th in the percentage of households at the poverty
level. This program will increase the number of new sources of higher-paying
jobs, mobilize the underrepresented populations in the state, and reduce the
"brain drain" to other regions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
