9353821 Elliot The selection of a science/mathematics/engineering major, and
persistence to a degree in that course of study, will be examined in the entire
cohort of 5320 students entering Dartmouth, Brown, Yale, and Cornell college
programs in 1988. In the statistical analysis of the cohort, particular
attention to a number of factors antecedent to college admission and present
during the college experience. Among those selecting scientific fields (1625),
there will also be a deeper investigation on an almost case-by-case basis,
through questionnaires and interviews, of background, motivation, college
experience, institutional factors, career aspiration, and the like, among
minority students, both those who persisted in their course and those who did
not.
