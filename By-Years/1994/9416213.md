9416213 Davis This research is to complete the archival and begin analysis of
data from a 98 seismic station array installed immediately after the 1994
Northridge earthquake to explain the extreme damage from the main shock in
Sherman Oaks and Santa Monica. Stations were clustered in the high damage zones
as well as along two linear arrays that extended through the station clusters
into the aftershock zone. One objective was to investigate whether the weak
ground motion from the aftershocks could be used to understand the damage from
the strong ground motion of the main shock, the question of strong-motion
linearity. Over 300 aftershocks were recorded. Preliminary analysis reveals that
badly damaged areas do indeed see large aftershock amplitudes relative to those
of undamaged areas with some exceptions. This work seeks to analyze
systematically the propagation from the hypocentral zone to the stations of the
array to explain how propagation and site effects contribute to the damaging
ground motion. Strong aftershock shaking will be compared with detailed maps of
red-tagged zones provided by the LA City Council. This project is a contribution
to the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program and is supported by the
Northridge Earthquake Emergency Appropriation. ***
