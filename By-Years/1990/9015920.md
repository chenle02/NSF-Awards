Dr. Schechter will obtain observations of Cepheid variable stars and carbon
stars to determine the shape of the potential of our Galaxy. In both cases
photometry will yield distances to the stars while spectroscopy will yield
velocities. The data from the Cepheids will also be used to determine the
distance from the Sun to the center of our Galaxy. It has proven difficult to
determine the relative contributions of a disk, a bulge, and dark matter to the
total masses of galaxies. A better understanding of the relative importance of
dark and luminous matter in a galaxy is a prerequisite to understanding how
galaxies form and evolve. In the Milky Way galaxy one can measure all three
components of position and velocity for specific tracers of mass. Our knowledge
of the mass distribution in our Galaxy can then be applied to understanding the
structure of other galaxies. Dr. Schechter's research addresses two of the
fundamental problems in galactic structure -- the degree to which orbits are
non- circular at the distance of the Sun in our Galaxy and the distance of the
Sun to the center of our Galaxy.
