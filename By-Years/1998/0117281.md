Arabidopsis thaliana is a plant model organism that has become a major research
tool for plant Biologists. A primary motivation for the sequencing of
Arabidopsis was that it would serve as a reference for other plant genomes. For
this to be realized the functions of a large number of unknown and hypothetical
genes must be deduced and a cross-reference between genes in Arabidopsis and
other plant species provided. Ultimately, the development of the data resources
will lead to a better understanding of gene expressions and function in plants.

Predicted genes will be amplified and used to construct a whole genome
microarray that will be used to look at patterns of gene express through the
plant life cycle. Expressions data can help provide both functional assignments
for genes and used in identifying metabolic pathways. The data will be analyzed
using a suite of clustering and pattern recognition tool. A number of databases
will be combined and integrated to provide a web-based view of gene expression
and identification in Arabidopsis.
