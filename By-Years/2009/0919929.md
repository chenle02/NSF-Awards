Dolphins display an unusual form of sleep called unihemispheric slow wave sleep
(USWS), in which brain waves typical of sleep appear in only one half of the
cortex at a time. They do not exhibit rapid eye movement (REM) sleep at any
time. This laboratory and their collaborators have found that when fur seals are
on land they have both bilateral sleep, and REM sleep resembling the sleep seen
in humans and all other land mammals. However, when fur seals are in water,
their home for 6 months of the year, they have USWS and little or no REM sleep,
like dolphins. Therefore, the sleep behavior of fur seals provides a unique
opportunity to determine how the brain waves of sleep are generated and why,
although all other mammals have REM sleep, this state is absent or greatly
reduced when USWS occurs. To answer these questions, the project will focus on
the changes going on below the cortex, determining the nature of the
neurotransmitters that are released in subcortical regions during the various
waking and sleep states. It is expected that this will lead to fundamental new
understandings of "why we sleep" and "why we dream," two of the most important
unanswered questions in neuroscience. Three graduate students will be trained
and will complete their Ph.D.s during this project. This project represents a
model international collaboration between a Russian marine mammal facility that
is currently the only place in the world with the facilities and expertise to
study sleep in marine mammals and laboratories in the USA, Japan, South Africa
and Switzerland. This award is co-funded by NSF's Office of International
Science and Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;
