9423645 Rajan There is very little scientific evidence on how the different
financial systems of foreign countries affect the financing choices of firms,
and even less evidence on how these choices affect industrial competitiveness.
This project attempts to shed some light on how firms obtain financing in other
systems in order to improve our understanding of the effects of financial
choices on industrial competitiveness. The first part of the project establishes
the broad stylized facts on financing and dividend decisions in a sample of
large industrialized countries characterized by different institutional
environments. More specifically, the project explores the level and the
determinants of corporate leverage across countries, both at the aggregate and
firm specific level; analyzes the determinants of the maturity structure of debt
across countries; analyzes the dividend policy in different countries; and
studies the determinants of inter-firm trade credit and how it varies across the
business cycle. The second part of the project tests different theories of
corporate financing decision. Myers' Pecking Order Theory and Jensen's Free Cash
Flow Theory are tested using the dynamic aspects of financing choices. A
theoretical framework is developed to identify demand and supply of debt versus
equity and used to analyze separately the effects of different financial
institutions and regulation on the supply of, and the demand for, different
financing instruments. Finally, this project analyzes the social costs and
benefits under different bankruptcy codes and institutional settings by studying
the response of firms to financial distress in different countries.
