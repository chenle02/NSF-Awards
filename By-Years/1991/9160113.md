Superconductivity is a phenomenon that has had tremendous publicity over the
last few years. The practical application of high temperature oxide
superconducting materials is in the early stages of development. For these oxide
materials to be applied, there must be a manufacturing process that allows the
production of long, continuous, uniform wires and strips. This research will
explore a unique tubular wire manufacturing process that can allow the
production of unlimited length superconducting wires. This unique manufacturing
process is intended to overcome the problems with the conventional manufacturing
method of packing a powder in a fixed-length hollow tube, and can be applied to
any superconducting powder and sheath material combination. This process will be
researched using the Bi-Pb-Sr-Ca-Cu-O powder and Silver Sheath. The consistency
and the uniformity of superconducting wires will be evaluated. The results of
this research will greatly accelerate the use of high temperature
superconductors because long uniform superconducting wires will be available for
the manufacture of magnets, motors, generators, and magnetic resonance imaging
equipment.
