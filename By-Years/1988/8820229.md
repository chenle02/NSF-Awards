Normal visual acuity, that is, the minimum separation required to resolve two
features (about 1 min of arc), is fairly well understood. Another class of tasks
involves spatial localization of features, the so-called hyperacuities, with
thresholds of 1 to 10 seconds of arc. Several models have recently shown how the
visual system can achieve this astonishing performance. The demonstration that
visual acuity and hyperacuity are relatively unaffected by retinal image motion
at velocities ranging up to 3 deg/sec causes problems for many of these models.
The importance of achieving good acuity in the presence of image motion should
not be underestimated. The task of compensating for retinal motion is likely to
be one of the main problems to be solved by the mechanisms of early vision. The
eyes are constantly moving, so in order to preserve image quality there must
have been strong evolutionary pressures to solve this problem. Dr. Stanley Klein
is a leading investigator in the area of spatial vision. Dr. Klein's research
has two goals. The first is to understand how high levels of acuity are
maintained during image motion. The second goal is to use image motion to
isolate distinct localization cues for a variety of hyperacuity tasks. The
experiments will test predictions from several models of acuity and hyperacuity.
The results of the proposed experiments will also provide additional constraints
on a model of human spatial localization for stationary stimuli being developed
by Dr. Klein.
