The research extends the current work in human supervisory control of computer-
integrated manufacturing systems. This research seeks to understand the proper
role of the human operator in sophisticated manufacturing systems, and given
that understanding, to develop computer-based intelligent workstations and
operator associates to the human operator responsible for system safety and
productivity. In particular, the research addresses three critical facets: the
development of models of human supervisory operators in manufacturing systems;
strategies and methods for integrating analytic methods and knowledge-based
tools for decision support; and the creation of an experimental, laboratory
environment to test candidate human supervisory controls systems.
