Between the 1870's and the appearance of A. Robinson's extraordinary work, "Non-
standard Analysis" in 1961, there emerged a large, diverse, technically deep and
philosophically pregnant body of consistent (non-Archimedean) mathematics of the
infinitely large and infinitely small. Unlike non-standard analysis, which is
concerned with providing a treatment of the calculus making use of
infinitesimals, most of the former work either focused on geometry and the
concepts of number and magnitude, or grew out of the natural evolution of such
discussions. Moreover, whereas non- standard analysis derives its arithmetic
content from an exceptionally narrow, albeit an extremely important, subclass of
the class of real-closed ordered number systems, the former work deals with
arbitrary ordered number fields as well as with ordered general conception of
numbers great and small, as well as with ordered number systems having failures
of communitivity, associativity, etc. This so-called non-Archimedean mathematics
thereby reveals a more general conception of numbers great and small, as well as
a richer theory of the infinitely large and infinitely small. This body of work,
published under the rubric The Theory of Non-Archimedean Geometric and (Totally)
Ordered Algebraic Systems has continued to grow in recent decades producing a
number of major accomplishments including J.H. Conway's work on Surreal Numbers.
In this project, Dr. Ehrlich aims to provide a detailed sketch of the historical
development of this largely ignored but philosophically important subject, and
to develop a number of the philosophical implications of its results for the
concepts of number, the infinite, the infinitesimal, and the continuum, as well
as for a number of issues in the philosophy of measurement and the philosophy of
space and time.
