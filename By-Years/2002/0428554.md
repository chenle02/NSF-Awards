Digital identity management (DIM) has emerged as a critical foundation for
supporting successful interactions in today's globally interconnected society.
It is crucial not only for the conduct of business and government but also for a
large and growing body of electronic or online social interactions. In its
broadest sense, identity management encompasses definitions and life-cycle
management for digital identities and profiles, and the environments for
exchanging and validating such information, including anonymous and pseudonymous
representations. The project addresses a wide variety of digital identity needs
by developing required Flexible, Multiple and Dependable Digital Identity
(FMDDI) technology, based on a sound underlying set of definitions and
principles. The FMDDI technology developed in the project will support multiple
forms of identity, including nyms, partial identities, and a variety of user
properties, credentials, and roles. Relevant research trusts in the project
include: identity schemes and representation formats; use of ontology and issues
related to identity interoperability; anonymity, dependability, accountability,
and forensic-friendly identification schemes; psychological and social aspects
related to the use of digital identities.
