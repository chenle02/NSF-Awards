Gross will continue his study of noncommutative harmonic analysis. This will
include an investigation of generalized hypergeometric functions on matrix
spaces, domains of positivity, and Hermitian symmetric spaces, concentrating on
developing the operator-valued theory, extending the context to include Siegel
domains of type II, deriving Mellin-Barnes representations, and exploring
applications to infinite-dimensional representation theory. The mathematical
bedrock of Gross's research is the theory of Lie groups. Named in honor of the
Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, these groups have been one of the major
themes in twentieth century mathematics. As the mathematical vehicle for
exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the representation theory of Lie
groups has had a profound impact upon mathematics itself, particularly in
analysis and number theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum
mechanics and elementary particle physics.DMS-9200774 Gross Gross will
investigate the natural Dirichlet form operator over loop spaces associated to
Brownian bridge measure. The particular interest is in proving existence and
uniqueness of ground states of the associated Schroedinger operators over
homotopy classes. This is a continuation of Gross's recent work on logarithmic
Sobolev inequalities on loop groups which has many implications for the
representation theory of Lie groups. The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of
