The research deals with the buckling or crushing of tubes under the action of a
line of concentrated forces in the transverse direction. The research entails
both an analytical and experimental component. The end product would be a user
friendly computer code for predicting the crushing strength of the composite
tubes based on the properties of the composite material used to wind the tubes.
The code would be verified and modified, if necessary, based on the results of
an extensive series of experiments. Composite structures are well known for
their high strength-to-weight ratio and high rigidity-to-weight ratio. In spite
of the extensive research in developing composite structures for airframes and
space applications during the past 20 years, the basic issues such as
delamination, effect of joints, impact damage, and buckling failure of tube and
shell structures are yet to be resolved. The results of this research would
upgrade the state-of-the-art understanding of the crushing strength and failure
of laminated composite tubes used in pipes and conduits.
