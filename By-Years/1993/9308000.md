The researchers propose an examination of the mechanisms that control the
terrestrial supply of dissolved organic carbon to streams, emphasizing
measurements of concentration and susceptibility to biological utilization. The
proposed research focuses on headwater streams in the Eastern Deciduous Biome.
Research objectives include measuring: (1) the sources of terrestrially derived
dissolved organic carbon entering streams, such as groundwater, soilwater, and
wetlands, (2) the biological utility and molecular composition of these
terrestrial sources, and (3) the influence of biological activity near the
streambanks and below the streambed on the concentrations of dissolved organic
carbon in the steamwater. %%% Organic carbon dynamics are central to stream
ecosystem studies because they link energy flow and nutrient cycling. Dissolved
organic carbon may contribute from 30% to 75% of the total energy input into
stream ecosystems. Despite numerous advances during the past two decades, there
is still only a poor understanding of how much dissolved organic carbon actually
enters streams and rivers, and concomitantly, how much is utilized within the
ecosystems.
