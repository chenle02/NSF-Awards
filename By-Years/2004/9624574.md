9624574 Howell This award provides resources to support research and teaching in
the area of compliant mechanisms. Compliant mechanisms gain some or all of their
motion from the deflection of flexible members rather than from traditional
joints only. In the past, compliant mechanisms have been limited to simple
applications due to difficulties associated with their analysis. This research
focuses on the development of methodologies to simplify compliant mechanism
analysis and design. The pseudo-rigid-body model concept will be developed for
analysis of these non-linear systems, and will be used to unify compliant
mechanism and rigid-body mechanism theories. New and recent research results
will be integrated into the curriculum in the form of a new course on compliant
mechanisms for graduate and upper-level undergraduate students. Compliant-
mechanism theory offers a new way of solving many mechanical-motion problems.
Advantages of compliant mechanisms include decreased manufacturing and assembly
time and decreased cost due to reductions in part count. Other advantages
include reductions in weight, vibration, noise, and wear. Compliant mechanisms
also simplify the design of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), and allow
them to be constructed using methods similar to those used to fabricate
integrated circuits. The research will enable the design of mechanisms that were
previously considered unlikely, if not impossible, applications of compliant
mechanisms.
