Modern personalized information systems are black boxes to their users:
computerized oracles give advice, but cannot be questioned. The lack of
explanations for the personalized results has precluded broader adoption of
personalization techniques in many important but high-risk domains, e.g.,
healthcare, education, and finance. This project aims to build a generic
computational framework for explainable personalization, such that users will be
aware of what information has been collected for customizing the system's
output, and system developers can detect what type of personalized results will
disclose users' privacy, e.g., unveiling his/her gender, age, or health status.
This benefits both systems and users in the development of future information
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research focuses on two alternative
perspectives, i.e., system-oriented and user-oriented explanation generation, in
an adaptive fashion. The learning of personalization will be embedded with
respect to the learning of explanation, so as to attain both personalization
quality and explanation fidelity. In addition to building prototype systems to
conduct user studies for evaluation, this project also takes a unique angle from
econometric studies to assess the utility of the explanations via the users'
revealed preferences. The value of explanation will be measured by the
difference between the utilities of a user's decisions with and without
explanations, which in turn enables adaptive evaluation and optimization of both
explanation and personalization. The research activities will be incorporated
into teaching materials in the area of information retrieval and machine
learning. The planed outreach to high school students for education about online
privacy would increase their awareness of potential risk of privacy breaches
resulted from personalized systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
