The principal investigator will study various problems at the interface of
probability, statistics, and modern analysis. The focus of this effort will be
to expand Patterson's capabilities in topics in these areas. During the first
year of this grant he will spent one month during the summer and three months
during the fall at Texas A&amp;M University. His stay will expose him to new
topics in probability, and with the support of faculty members at Texas A&amp;M
he will formulate a set of specific problems.
