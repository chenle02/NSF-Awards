One of the most important tasks for marine biologists interested in fish
populations in the world's oceans is to understand how fish species become
distributed, how fishes survive the exingencies of marine environments, and how
the abundances of fish populations are regulated. At the center of this problem
is comprehensive knowledge of the most vulnerable stage in the life history of a
fish: its larval form. This project deals with the world's best documented and
largest collection of larval fishes of the Atlantic Ocean, collected over two
decades. As such, this research collection represents a very valuable research
resource, since numerous scientists from the U.S.A., Canada and Europe will
depend on it for continuous reference. Because the collection was made over such
a long period of time, it will give scientists a unique opportunity to study
fundamental changes in the nature of speciescomposition and abundance. Such
changes may be related to various environmental factors and will enable fishery
biologists to anticipate changes in the abundance of commercially important
fishes. Because fish larvae exhibit numerous features of interest to biologists
studying the developmental patterns of various organ systems, the collection
will play a key role in furnishing the necessary developmental stages of fish
species which are not accessible without extensive and costly oceanic
exploration. Fish larvae form a significant component of the zooplankton and
their distributional patterns reflect major oceancurrents and their dynamics.
The larval fish collection will indirectly aid oceanographers with a historical
perspective of the dynamics of zooplankton distributions.
