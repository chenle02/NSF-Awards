The research is in the field of hydraulic or coastal engineering. The objective
is to investigate the concepts of inlet stabilization and management. The
initial research is a study of Townsend's Inlet, N.J and the adjacent beaches of
Avalon, N.J. The data and analysis are extrapolated and expanded to develop a
master plan for all inlets and inlet management. Devices and instruments are
modified and used in circulation and sediment transport studies. The improvement
of a device for use in beach nourishment projects is investigated for use in
dredging studies. Modeling studies included relating sediment processes with
hydraulic processes within the inlet. This project is one supported under the
Creativity Awards for Undergraduate Engineering Students.
