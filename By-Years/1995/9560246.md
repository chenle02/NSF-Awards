This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will study the
feasibility of parallel logic simulation for large deep submicron VLSI designs
using advanced UNIX workstations. The number of transistors implemented on an
integrated circuit doubles every 2 to 3 years. This fact affects all the aspects
of the design methodology, including design simulation that takes several days
to weeks of computing to verify the correctness of a VLSI design. Moreover,
designs that contain multi-million gates can not be simulated as a single system
since they are either too big to fit on today's workstations, or generate too
many page faults making the simulation too slow. This project will investigate a
scalable architecture for performing distributed and parallel digital logic
simulation on UNIX workstations. The distributed feature deals with the size and
eliminates the page-fault problem. The scalable and parallel feature makes it
possible to simulate multi-million gate designs. The Phase I effort will
establish architecture requirements, develop the architecture, derive necessary
algorithms at the system level, develop a scaled version and analyze the
potential performance that can be obtained. State-of-the-art logic simulation
and parallel processing technology will be used for this effort. Verification
will be made that the architecture is compliant with the Electronic Design
Automation (EDA) industry standard so that commercialization is possible. The
proposed architecture has the potential to develop and commercialize three
products: (1) Scalable Distributed Parallel Verilog( Simulator; (2) Scalable
Distributed Parallel VHDL Simulator; and, (3) Scalable Distributed Parallel Co-
Simulator.
