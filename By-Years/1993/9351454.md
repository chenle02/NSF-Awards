To best prepare students for roles in industry, they must be exposed to the
latest technologies and have access to experiments where they become familiar
with the type of equipment commonly used in Industry. The current Robotics
Laboratory, having only rigid robot gripper systems, offers the students a
limited experience in the area of robotic assembly. The aim of this project is
to provide students with the state- of-the-art tools required for light-weight
robotic assembly. This will be accomplished by the acquisition of an automatic
quick-change gripper system, a parallel closure two-finger gripper, a self-
centering three-finger gripper and a Remote Center Compliance (RCC) compensator.
This equipment will directly support three undergraduate courses: Robotics,
Design for Manufacture, and the Senior Design Project.
