We still have only a poor understanding of how certain nerve cells can signal
"heat" and "cold" in the body's somatosensory system. This process of thermal
transduction has not been clarified for over 50 years, despite rapid advances in
other sensory systems based on modern approaches to membrane physiology. It is
particularly interesting to know how thermal stimuli that do not cause pain, but
simply thermal sensations, are processed by specialized nerve cells. This work
utilizes a recently developed technique with a thermal stimulator sufficiently
small to heat a single cell, and a way to monitor and control rapid thermal
changes at the small tip of the device to control temperature in a micro-
environment. The objective is to identify in thermosensitive cells what the
molecular mechanisms are for transduction of innocuous thermal stimuli.
Neurophysiological methods of current-clamp and voltage-clamp are used on
isolated cells in culture. If this novel approach can identify thermally-
sensitive membrane channels, it will be a major advance in understanding
temperature sensation at the periphery, and the function of "free" nerve endings
that have no specialized receptor organs. This work will have impact on
somatosensory physiology, on cellular biophysics, and on neuroscience, and be
fundamental to understanding how animals respond to slight thermal changes in
their environment.
