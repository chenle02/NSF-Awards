This project develops a representation of Lagrangian mechanics in which the
velocity components are measured relative to a frame that is not related to any
local coordinates on the configuration space. This approach offers more
flexibility than the original formalism of Lagrange, while keeping a clear
distinction between system configurations and velocities. Known to be an
effective and powerful tool in finite-dimensional continuous-time mechanics,
this formalism introduced by Georg Hamel has not yet been fully developed for
systems with infinitely-many degrees of freedom. The project is aimed at
systematic study of the formalism in the infinite-dimensional setting,
understanding its variational structure, its applications to dynamics of
infinite-dimensional systems with nonholonomic constraints, including stability
of a liquid-filled rigid body subject to nonholonomic constraints, and Lyapunov
function construction.

Systems with infinite number of degrees of freedom arise in many applications in
engineering and industry. Examples include flexible structures and rigid bodies
interacting with fluids. This project develops the mathematics required to model
and simulate the behavior of such complex mechanical systems. This work on the
mechanics of systems will further integrate mathematics and theoretical
engineering. The results of the project will be useful in theoretical analysis,
simulations, control, and study of the long time behavior of multi-body dynamics
and complex mechanical systems.
