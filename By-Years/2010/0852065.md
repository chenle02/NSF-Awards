&lt;br/&gt;UCSB MATHEMATICS SUMMER RESEARCH PROGRAM FOR
UNDERGRADUATES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the past decade, numerous
task forces have documented the shortage of students preparing for careers in
mathematics and science, especially among US citizens. This project will
motivate and prepare the participants for graduate studies in mathematics by
providing them opportunities to collaborate and engage in research with eminent
research scientists. It will also enhance the undergraduate mathematical climate
at participants' home institutions as they share their enthusiasm for research
with their peers. This will make visible that mathematics is more than the
textbook problems that define most students' experiences. The eventual
publication of students' research is an important educational opportunity and
also serves to remind the mathematical community of the viability of such
programs. A further goal of the program is to encourage the study of mathematics
among women and minorities underrepresented in graduate mathematics. UCSB is
among the most diverse campuses in the University of California, providing a
broad pool of applicants and an attractive summer
option.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new REU Site will disseminate current problems
and techniques of modern mathematics to a diverse group of undergraduate
students. It is well known that the earlier the exposure of a student to the
main structures of mathematics, the deeper is their understanding, and this will
then increase their motivation and success in studying advanced mathematics. The
students participating in this REU will collaborate with and learn from several
active and very successful researchers in the Mathematics Department at UCSB.
Engagement in inquiry and research is the most powerful pedagogical tool for
preparing future mathematicians. As a whole the project will benefit our society
by awakening in undergraduate students the curiosity and interest in the
scientific enterprise as a way to improve the world.
