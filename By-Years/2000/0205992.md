National Geographic Television, in Collaboration with Graphic Films, is
producing a 40-minute, large-format, documentary film about the scientific quest
to understand some of the most dramatic geological and meteorological events we
experience -- volcanoes, earthquakes and violent storms. The goals of the film
are to inform audiences about geological and meteorological forces which greatly
impact our planet, present the scientific research being performed in an effort
to understand and predict these forces, portray scientific role models and to
stimulate a greater appreciation and interest in the Earth sciences.

Informal education outreach will include:

A "Forces of Nature" website that will include educational resources targeted to
the general audience as well as to students and teachers.

Museum and Family Activity Guides

The National Geographic Society will support public programs at science-
technology centers by providing access to scientists who work in the areas of
science covered in the film.

National Geographic's cable program Explorer (carried on MSNBC) will produce a
themed show around "Forces of Nature" to coincide with the launch of the film.

A companion book
