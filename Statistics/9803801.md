----------------------------------------------------------------------- Proposal
Number: DMS 9803801 PI: Jian-Jian Ren Institution: Tulane University Project:
The Clifford Conference Abstract: The 1998 Clifford Lecture and Conference,
which will take place in October of 1998 at Tulane University. The 1998 Clifford
Lecturer is Professor Peter Bickel of University of California - Berkeley, who
will give a series of 3 lecturers on "The Method of Sieves in Non- and
Semiparametric Statistics". During the conference, there will be 10-15 invited
speakers giving talks related to Professor Bickel's main lectures. These
lectures and talks will: (a) compare and contrast the fields by examples,
discuss how bootstrap methodology fits into this framework, introduce the method
of sieves; (b) discuss and review various applications of the method of sieves
to function estimation, Haar wavelet based tests, AR sieve bootstrap, and more
general use of orthonormal based or families of bases or atoms in density
estimation and other contexts; (c) discuss the relation of the method of sieves
to model selection and the great challenge: Selecting Tuning Parameters. The
1998 Clifford Lecture and Conference will provide a unique opportunity for
researchers to meet and discuss the current issues in statistical theory and
practice. This is particularly beneficial to junior researchers, graduate
students and faculty from southern universities in or near Louisiana.
