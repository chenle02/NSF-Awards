Understanding the hydrology of faults and shear zones is critical to
determining how fluids move through the crust and to examining the fluid-rock
interactions that occur during flow. This project will examine faults in granite
to obtain evidence needed to assess spatial and temporal changes in fault zone
permeability during fault evolution. The permeability structure will be
incorporated into a numerical model for flow at both fault zone scale and at
regional scales. Results should strengthen observational and the theoretical
basis for assessing the role of fluids in a variety of tectonic processes.
