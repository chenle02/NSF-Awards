Kleene algebra with tests (KAT) is a system for describing and manipulating
computations and assertions. KAT allows propositional logic and the algebra of
programs to be integrated seamlessly into a single system that is remarkably
powerful in expressive and deductive power, yet computationally and conceptually
simple.

KAT has many applications in computer science. In particular it has recently
been used to specify and verify various communication protocols and common
compiler optimizations. It does so more simply and with less effort than more
traditional systems such as Hoare Logic.

In this proposal, we propose (i) to further develop the theory of KAT; (ii) to
produce a research monograph of significant scope giving a comprehensive
introduction to KAT; and (ii) to continue to investigate the use of KAT in
practical program verification.
