9405808 Oliker A continuing investigation of nonlinear diffusion flows
propagating with speed depending on mean, Gauss, and other curvature functions
is proposed. Such diffusion processes play a critical role in models of phase
transitions, flame propagation, material wearing, signal and image processing,
and others. Questions of existence, uniqueness, onset of singularities, and
asymptotic properties will be studied. Efficient and robust algorithms for
computing diffusion flows will be developed and tested. The results will be
applied to improve existing and develop new computational algorithms and codes
for image and signal processing. It is anticipated that the developed image
processing codes will have a variety of important applications in
communications, medicine, target identification, and Global Change studies,
especially for denoising images distorted by atmospheric turbulence.
