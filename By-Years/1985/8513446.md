This project develops a numerical capability for near field ground motion
calculations and estimates the strong motion propagation for specific site
conditions. The numerical approach uses a finite element scheme with
transmitting boundary provision. The results will then be verified based on
available analytical solutions and available field data from the following
arrays: El Centro recordings of the Imperial Valley earthquake in 1979, Smart-1
digital recordings of Lotung (Taiwan) earthquakes, Parkfield strong motion array
data, and Los Angeles array data collected by USC. The results of this study
will help to improve understanding of near field ground motions and predict
strong ground motions during large earthquakes. The results will be translated
in a form that can be readily used in earthquake engineering practice (Siting).
