Understanding international conflict (as well as international interactions more
generally) remains a critical task for social scientists. EUGene is a Microsoft
Windows-based software program that scholars may use to build quantitative data
sets in order to analyze international politics, particularly international
conflict. The software is designed to be useful both by experts and novice data
analysts. It assists in data preparation by handling data management tasks that
are cumbersome and difficult, and merging data from a variety of input data sets
with differing formats into uniform output data sets according to user-
specified choices. The software facilitates additional research by faculty,
graduate students, and scholars-at-large by managing many cumbersome and time-
consuming tasks, freeing up time that can be spent on more productive research
tasks (namely theory development and data analysis). It also provides a common
(and free) software infrastructure for dataset development by international
relations analysts. EUGene is available for free download to the research
community. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Value: EUGene has become widely used by scholars
using quantitative data to study the causes and consequences of international
conflict. In this expansion, the investigator will add another unit of analysis
to the program, add additional conflict (war) data, expand available risk
attitude data, reformat and present additional alliance data, and continue to
add new user data sets. The new version will provide an improved software tool
to the research community, particularly for those examining the expansion and
escalation of interstate conflict, and analyzing interstate disputes.
