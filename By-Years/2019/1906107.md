In the study of mathematical objects, a key role is often played by the
symmetries of the object - particularly when the object has many symmetries.
This research investigates ways of characterizing, describing, and studying
spaces with many symmetries in various dynamical, geometric and topological
settings. These questions often require learning, adapting and applying ideas
and techniques from many areas of mathematics. This work has connections with
diverse areas of mathematics: from differential equations (the use of wavefront
sets to study fine analytic properties of solutions to equations) to theoretical
computer science ((super)expanders, Kazhdan's property (T), Lafforgue's strong
property (T) and coarse embedding problems). Graduate student funding will be
used to train a new generation of experts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main thrust
of the project is to exploit connections between a wide set of areas to further
understand fundamental structures related to lattices in Lie groups. A major
focus is the study of group actions on manifolds where the PI recently made
major breakthroughs on conjectures of Zimmer's. Another major focus is on the
structure of hyperbolic manifolds where the PI recently made another major
breakthrough on a question of McMullen and Reid. Other topics include studying
families of expanders and superexpanders arising from dynamical constructions,
both to understand their coarse geometry and to see if they have novel
applications to computer science, dynamics or operator
algebras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
