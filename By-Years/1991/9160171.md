The efficient modeling of groundwater movement allows analysis and prediction
of the response of aquifers to changes in conditions. This project will
undertake the developmental work for a compact, portable and user-friendly
simulation model to be used for monitoring pollutant transport. This work is
based on the boundary integral equation method where both hydraulic conductivity
and boundary conditions are taken to be random. This formulation will allow
robust sensitivity analysis and inference about the range of variability as well
as simulation of flows.
