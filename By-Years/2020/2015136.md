The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to develop a higher power light source
for wireless infrastructure links of high power and high speed. Typically, these
links depend on mechanical alignment, presenting challenges such as a large form
factor, increased use of power, and slow response. The proposed project will use
non-mechanical methods to steer a beam. This development of these light sources
will enable optical wireless links that are both easier to align and more
stable, thus representing an important and inexpensive source for future high-
speed links.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Phase I project advances a novel compound
semiconductor laser array integrated with a high-speed electrical waveguide and
integrated micro-optical lenses on the back side of the chip to sum beams into
an overlap intensity profile. This low coherent source can be designed to
increase power out without a penalty in frequency response. The proposed project
enables non-mechanical beam steering using an array of array; the device will
direct the beam using a routing technique with passive optical offsets. Efforts
will be to understand and design optical intensity profiles in the far field and
develop the capability to non-mechanically switch or sequence the arrays to move
the data beam, to auto-align the beam's fine tuning. Optical modeling of the
micro-optical lens arrays on the opposite side of a back-emitter laser array
structure will enable understanding the light intensity and bit error rate
uniformity fields at the collector. The design process will optimize overlap
areas in the near field where uniform intensity is critical for projecting into
the far field for collector stability. These devices could yield high-speed LiFi
emitters ideal for wireless links, either for long distance or point-to-
multipoint connections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
