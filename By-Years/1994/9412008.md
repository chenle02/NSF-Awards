9412008 Richardson A high-resolution atomic force microscope will be purchased.
This instrument is urgently needed to sustain rapid progress in the development
of high resolution x-ray microscopy. X-ray microscopy is now a pivotal core
technology to the use of in-vitro analysis of sub-cellar features of biological
structures each as human chromosomes, and to the development of x-ray assayiny
techniques for computer chip manufacture. We have established at the Laser
Plasma Laboratory (LPL) at CREOL, the only university development program in the
these technologies that is based on the promising use of compact laser plasma
sources. Six faculty members and over 15 graduate and undergraduate students are
associated with this program. In the past year, our success in establishing a
dedicated laser plasma x-ray microscopy facility has resulted in the wide
recognition of the potential this technology, and broad interest expressed by a
large number of researchers, in this country and abroad, in partnering with us
to bring this technology to the threshold for commercial development. Moreover,
to encourage the latter, we are now collaborating with a number of American
companies who wish to exploit this technology. ***
