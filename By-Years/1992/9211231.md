A distinctive and much debated feature of the US banking and financial system is
the separation of commercial banking and investment banking which is legislated
by the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933. Before 1933, commercial banks and their
securities affiliates competed directly with investment banks in the business of
underwriting and originating securities. The purpose of this project is to
analyze and evaluate the arguments for and against universal banking by
examining the investment banking activities of commercial banks prior to the
Glass-Steagall Act. Information will be collected from a variety of financial
publications from the 1920s and 1930s. These data will allow the comparison of
underwriting activities and performance of commercial banks and independent
investment banks. The project will explore the empirical relevance of arguments
made in the 1930s and today against universal banking--e.g., potential conflicts
of interest when lending and underwriting are permitted under one roof, ability
to take advantage of unsophisticated depositors, and monopolistic control of
access to capital markets for small and medium sized firms. The arguments for
universal banking include potential economies of scope in information gathering
and processing. In addition, the effect of commercial banks' internal
organizational structure on the performance of their investment banking
activities will also be investigated. This project is particularly timely and
important given the great interest in banking reform.
