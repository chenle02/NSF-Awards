94-23187 Balbus This proposal describes a number of different projects
involving magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) studies of the Galaxy, having in common a
concern with differential rotation and magnetic field. The effect of a weak
magnetic field upon differentially rotating gas has been shown to be a local
instability to axisymmetric disturbances, which can influence Galactic
evolution. The projects are: (a) the extension and development of an existing
Eulerian finite difference MHD code to include multiple fluids and finite
resistivity; (b) a numerical investigation of the origin and evolution of the
Galactic magnetic field, taking fully into account the presence of the weak
field instability; (c) analytic and numerical studies of the Galactic halo, its
local stability properties, and its relation to a two-dimensional magnetized
wind; and (d) the development of an analytic formalism for, and explicit
numerical solutions of the local gravitational collapse of an MHD fluid in the
spiral arm regions of the Galaxy. This last project is motivated by the need to
have a well-defined and quantitative procedure for establishing when bound
structure drops out of the background interstellar gas flow.
