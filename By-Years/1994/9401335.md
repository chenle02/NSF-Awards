Sethuraman This award supports work on three broad problems in the valuation
theory of division algebras. The first problem is the study of non-tamely valued
division algebras over complete fields of finite characteristic, and in
particular, the study of the subfields of such algebras in terms of their
valuation theory. The second problem is the study of division algebras defined
over function fields of curves and the study of valuations on these algebras
that are non-trivial on the field of constants. The principal investigator will
also work on the classification of the Kummer subfields of tame division
algebras over Henselian valued fields. The research supported is in the general
area of field theory. Fields are algebraic structures similar to the rational
numbers, the real numbers, and the complex numbers in that each nonzero element
has an inverse with respect to multiplication. Field theory is a rich and deep
subject with its historical roots arising from the early attempts to
systematically describe the zeros of polynomials. ***
