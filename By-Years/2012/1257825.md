This project focuses on the topic of embryonic pattern formation, which is a
central aspect of embryonic development in all animals. Pattern formation relies
on communication between cell types as they progressively mold each other into
the organs and structures that make up the body. This problem is very difficult
to pursue in vertebrate animals due to their complexity. Since developmental
mechanisms are highly conserved across animals, the proposed study instead
addresses the problem of how one cell type directs the patterning of another
cell type using sea urchin embryos, which offer an elegant patterning process in
a comparatively simple system: the larval skeleton. Prior work identified
multiple conserved genes that are required for skeletal patterning in sea urchin
embryos; this project will use biochemical and molecular approaches to
understand how these genes work together to generate the three-dimensional
skeletal pattern. The results will define a mechanism for patterning as a result
of communication between cell types and tissues; because the genes involved are
highly conserved, this information will likely become a paradigm for patterning
in more complex animals. The study will directly involve the participation of
multiple undergraduate students, integrating their classroom knowledge with
hands-on laboratory experiences, as well as scientific outreach to high school
students in the Boston area to promote their interest in scientific careers.
Finally, this project includes training of Boston area high school teachers in
the summers, including classroom and laboratory experiences, with the intent of
fostering the teaching of developmental biology in the high school science
classroom.
