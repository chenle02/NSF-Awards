The CI TraCS Research Starter Supplement to the Fellowship for Transformative
Computational&lt;br/&gt;Science using Cyber Infrastructure requests a high
performance computing cluster. The PI plans to utilize it &lt;br/&gt;to develop,
debug, and deploy a comprehensive computational simulation platform for the
numerical&lt;br/&gt;simulation of coupled electro-thermal and thermoelectric
transport in semiconductor nanostructures.
