Terabytes of data are collected by companies and individuals every day. These
data possess no value unless one can efficiently process them and use them to
make decisions. The scale and the streaming nature of data pose both
computational and statistical challenges. The objective of this research project
is to develop novel approaches to making online, real-time decisions when data
are constantly evolving and highly structured. In particular, this project
focuses on online prediction problems involving multiple users in dynamic
networks. The project also aims to tackle the privacy issues arising in such
multi-user scenarios.

In recent years, it was shown that a majority of online machine learning
algorithms can be viewed as solutions to approximate dynamic programming (ADP)
problems that incorporate one additional datum per step. Along with directly
addressing the computational concerns, the ADP framework also provides
guaranteed performance on prediction problems. This project is to use and extend
the ADP framework to develop prediction algorithms that simultaneously address
the issues of computation, robustness, non-stationarity, privacy, and
multiplicity of users.
