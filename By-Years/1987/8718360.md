This action is to support the acquisition of a laser densitometer for the
laboratory of Dr. Marilyn Mcginnis. This piece of sophisticated instrumentation
will be used in various experiments which identify gene products resulting from
hormone action in brain. Androgens and other steroid hormones are thought to
exert their effects via genomic activations and synthesis of new proteins.
Although proteins induced by androgens have been reported for peripheral
tissues, proteins induced by androgen action in brain have not been identified.
Moreover, genomic effects of androgen action appear to be differentially
localized for copulatory behavior and gonadotropin regulation. Thus, local
differences in binding of testosterone and/or its metabolites, or in protein
synthesis could account for the differential effects of testosterone in the
neural regulation of copulatory behavior and gonadotropin secretion. The new
technological addition to this laboratory will address the question of neural
localization of androgen action and will identify a specific population of
proteins induced by androgen action in neural tissue.
