Kopelman The novel methods of near-field-optics (NFO) present an opportunity for
spatial superresolution in optical and spectroscopic measurements. Visible light
imaging and probing of single molecules has become a reality. The recent work is
utilized towards the following aims: 1) Characterization of interfacial domains
in molecular nanostructures, using ultra-fast near-field optical imaging and
nanospectroscopy as well as tip-to-single-molecule energy transfer (Forster-
Dexter) and spin-orbit coupling (Kasha), ultimately measuring individual
molecule matrix elements. 2) Development and study of ordered single
supermolecule light and energy antenna and their utilization as scanning optical
probes, to be used towards the above aims. 3) An experimental study of the
enigmatic light-matter interactions in the near-field-optics domain, with
applications to the above nano-domain and single molecule studies. 4)
Utilization of our molecularly engineered, optically active and photostable,
ordered supermolecule for the production of a new, higher efficiency light
emitting diode (LED). %%% We have recently developed new optical nano-probes and
nano-imaging techniques. These are particularly appropriate for mesoscopic or
submicroscopic optical studies. The proposed research is committed to both the
further development of these techniques and to their utilization for the study
of basic problems: excitations at interfaces and nanostructures, molecular
aggregates and even single molecules. The techniques combine time-resolved
spectroscopy, near-field optical microscopy, scanning force microscopy and
nanofabrication. The goals are to solve some long-standing basic problems of
excitation dynamics as well as some newly emerging questions on the interaction
of light and matter in the near field and on kinetic processes involving
nanosystems and single molecules. Ultimately, these studies are of major
interest to biology, medicine, chemistry and materials science.
