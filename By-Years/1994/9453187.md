9453187 Ervin The National Consortium for Educational Access (NCEA) activities
will focus on developing the foundation for a network and specific procedures to
recruit, train, and place minority transitioning military personnel (TMPs) into
teaching careers at the elementary and secondary school levels in mathematics
and science. The Armed Services Transition to Education Program (ASTEP) will
help military personnel to become certified teachers because it will emphasize
the following: -Recruiting minority male TMPs with at least associate degrees;
-Providing them with guidance in preparing for a teaching career while on active
duty; -Providing them with financial support for a baccalaureate degree
education; -Certifying TMPs in elementary, middle, and high school science and
mathematics; and -Placing newly licensed teachers in permanent positions in
urban schools and other districts with sgnificant populations of minority and
at-risk students. There is an acute shortage of minority male teachers at all
levels of American education from kindergarten through high school, especially
in mathematics and science. ASTEP will be designed to help alleviate this
shortage by substantially expanding the pool of qualified minority teachers in
these critical fields.
