The focus of this research is the development of new radical reactions of acyl
germanes, the study of group selective reactions of diastereomeric radical
intermediates and the use of fluorous biphasic tin hydrides in organic
synthesis. With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting
the research of Dr. Dennis P. Curran of the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Pittsburgh. Professor Curran will focus his work on the
development of new radical reactions for organic synthesis. The research is
intended to lead directly to the discovery of environmentally friendly reagents.
