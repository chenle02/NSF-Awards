The Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources (ILAR) is a component of the
National Academy of Sciences. ILAR's program goal is to provide expert counsel
on the scientific, technical, and ethical use of laboratory animals. ILAR
promotes the high- quality and humane care of laboratory animals; the
appropriate use of laboratory animals; and the exploration of alternatives in
research, testing and teaching. This award provides partial funding for the core
support of ILAR and for ILAR's participation in the International Council for
Laboratory Animal Science (ICLAS). NIH and U.S. Army provides the rest of the
core support. The core supports enable ILAR to carry out activities such as
providing advice and information on laboratory animal matters to scientists,
animal care and use committees, the federal government, the scientific
community, and the public through publication of document, broadening the base
of support from non-federal sources, and expanding on educational areas for
which ILAR has unique expertise.
