This proposal requests funds to purchase a 250 L fermentor and accessories to
upgrade the Ohio State University Fermentation laborite to a large-scale
fermentation facility. The 250-liter fermentor and associated harvesting
equipment will be used to grow microorganisms for the purification of large
quantities of enzymes, antibiotics, bacterial insecticide toxin and various
other sub-cellular components for detailed molecular and biochemical research.
