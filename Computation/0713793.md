The main goal of the proposed research is to develop a novel mathematical
approach to allow faster numerical integration of certain types of Partial
Differential Equations. The types of Partial Differential Equations considered
in this proposal are very common in many areas of physics and, in particular,
play a crucial role in numerical weather and climate studies. The main idea
behind the proposed approach is that in many applications the main quantities of
interest are large-scale averaged quantities (e.g., mean temperature changes
over the next five to ten years, mean wind velocities during the summer, mean
sea-surface temperature). Therefore, in such applications it is not necessary to
resolve all small-scale physics (e.g., local wind speed at any particular
location) accurately. On the other hand, the time-step of numerical integration
is often limited (for technical reasons) by these small-scale processes. The
proposed research seeks systematic modification of the underlying partial
differential equations to reduce the overall influence of small-scale processes
and, thus, to allow for a bigger time-step in numerical simulations.
