This project, an undergraduate structural engineering laboratory, enhances the
understanding of structural engineering principles through experiments;
introduces current technology in sensors, data acquisition, and the use of
computers with instrumentation; introduces nondestructive testing methods for
structures; and improves planning and technical writing abilities. The equipment
includes force and reaction hardware for benchtop structural engineering
experiments; a variety of sensors for static and dynamic performance
characterization experiments; data-acquisition hardware and computers for
experiments using computer-based data acquisition systems; and nondestructive
testing equipment for experiments and demonstrations on steel and concrete
structures.
