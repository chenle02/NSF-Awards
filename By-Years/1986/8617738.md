This project will continue long-term research in psycholinguistics to advance
our knowledge of the cognitive processes involved in understanding the language
of others. The PIs' earlier work has shed significant light on how we understand
anaphoric or pronominal references and their relationship to their antecedents
in the context of a discourse, and how we decide which of various possible
readings of a word or phrase is the right one in a given context. The latter
work has led to the focal topic of the current research. Results of their
experiments and those of others, coupled with recent developments in linguistic
theory, have suggested that the so-called "thematic" structure of verbs plays a
key role in interpreting sentences containing those verbs. The investigators
have developed a model of the language-understanding process, centered on
thematic structures, that makes strong empirical predictions. The current
research is a series of experiments designed to test those predictions.
