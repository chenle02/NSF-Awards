This project is a CBMS Regional Conference in the Mathematical Sciences
entitled "Coordinates in Operator Algebras: Groupoids and Categories, their
Representations and Applications". This conference will be held at Texas
Christian University May 22-26, 1990. The use of coordinatization techniques in
operator algebra arose independently in the self-adjoint and the non-self-
adjoint theories, and practioneers of each subject are largely unfamiliar with
the commonality of technique and purpose in the two areas. The principal
lecturer is Professor Paul Muhly of the University of Iowa, whose lectures will
introduce coordinatization techniques in a non-technical fashion, showing how it
arises naturally in structural questions about both self-adjoint and non-self-
adjoint operator algebras, and in applications of both types of algebras to a
variety of situations. Particular attention will be paid to intertwining results
from the self- adjoint theory with the non-self-adjoint theory and with pure
algebra.
