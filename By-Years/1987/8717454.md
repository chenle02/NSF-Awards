This research is to investigate important environmental factors which affect
the feeding ecology of two widely studied planktivorous fish: white crappie and
bluegill sunfish. The environmental factors to be studied include light
intensity, turbidity level, abundance of bloom-forming bluegreen algae, and
availability of various size classes of zooplankton. Behavioral factors in the
search cycle of these two species will also be studied which affect prey choice,
feeding efficiency, and vigilance for predators, as well as the impact of diel
activity patterns and satiation on feeding behavior. The generality of saltatory
search will be established by observing a schooling species of fish (golden
shiner) to see where such fish fall on a gradient of search strategies ranging
from ambush to saltatory to cruise. The results of these studies will be
incorporated into the existing model of planktivorous fish feeding, and the
model will be tested against feeding trials performed in a large outdoor arena.
The results of this series of studies will be of theoretical interest to those
studying the ecology of predation as well as of practical interest to those
responsible for the management of lakes and reservoirs and the production of
game fish.
