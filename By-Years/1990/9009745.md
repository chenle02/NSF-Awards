This research is a "Research Opportunity for Women / Research Planning Grant"
pilot project by a young cultural anthropologist who will study maritime share
contracts among fishermen in the Philippines. Two coastal villages will be
selected and twenty to thirty fishermen will be interviewed in this two month
project about their practice in dividing up their product in shares. Theories of
share contracts developed for agricultural production will be evaluated for
their relevance to fishing. This project is important because it supports the
scientific research of a young woman investigator, and helps her develop her
potential for doing large-scale scientific research. The topic of share
contracts is an important one because many economic production regimes are
organized in shares, and the economic understanding of the history and
development of share contracts in specific environments will add to our general,
comparative knowledge of this economic structure.
