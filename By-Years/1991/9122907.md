Lack of fitness due to drugs and alcohol has been implicated in recent
calamities (oil spills, subway crashes). Bioassays (of body fluids, hair
clippings, etc.) can establish whether or not certain chemicals were ingested at
some point in time prior to the accident, but beg the question of whether
performance itself was degraded. A performance-based assessment method would
permit more direct evidence of fitness potential in the workplace and, once
instituted, could be expected to improve productivity. Since tests are not
actual jobs, a method is need for indexing change which provides a context or
standard tied to the jobs themselves. Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of
using alcohol dosage as an indexing standard and multivariate dose- equivalency
equations were created to permit the "dialing in" of a set alcohol equivalency
level, so that combinations of performance loss which met that level could be
"flagged." Also, sensitivity in a field setting was shown using a commercial
airline pilot on several transoceanic flights involving multiple time-zone
changes, and an algorithm was developed to "tune" (minimize) false positive
errors. Plans for Phase II are to establish further job relevancy and improved
sensitivity (i.e., hit ratio) of the tests as well as minimizing false
positives.
