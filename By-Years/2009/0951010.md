When confronted with predators, many animals engage in lengthy, conspicuous
displays. These antipredator signals are often assumed to be alarm calls that
function to warn other individuals about the predator. However, recent research
has shown that many of these anti-predator displays may actually be an attempt
to communicate with the predator itself. Currently, little is known concerning
the function and evolution of communication between two antagonistic parties,
like predators and prey. This project will examine several hypotheses about the
function of predator-prey communication by focusing on displays given by small
mammals when they encounter rattlesnakes. The investigators will use video
surveillance equipment and radio telemetry to document natural interactions
between rattlesnakes and small mammals in the field. They will also design
biorobotic animal models that can recreate key elements of the displays for
experimental "playbacks". This playback approach will allow researchers to
examine how specific behaviors used by small mammals may modify snake foraging
behavior, and will provide the first experimental examination of key predictions
derived from predator-prey communication theory. This project will provide novel
insights into honesty in animal communication, antagonistic coevolution, and the
role of receiver sensory systems in shaping signaling behavior. In terms of
broader impacts beyond basic biological science, this project will (1) establish
collaborations between ecologists and mechanical engineers to develop next-
generation robotic technologies for the study of animal behavior; (2) increase
participation of underrepresented minorities in research science; (3) develop
public outreach through lectures, popular articles, radio, and documentary
films; and, (4) provide mentoring for several undergraduate and graduate
students.
