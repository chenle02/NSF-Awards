Mr. Marcus Hellyer, working under the direction of Professor Robert Westman, is
undertaking his doctoral dissertation research on a topic which remains of great
importance in contemporary science: the relationship of science and the
institutions of religion. There is a belief that certain religions are
essentially reactionary with respect to scientific revolutions. One group that
has been considered especially reactionary in the history of science has been
the Catholic Church. Yet within an organization as large and complex as the
Catholic Church, it is not at all surprising that there should be parts which
are in fact extremely reactionary as well as parts that participate in and
foster science and scientific change. Mr. Hellyer is examining one segment of
this organization to show how it has been a major contributor to the advance of
science. Specifically, Mr. Hellyer is examining the role of German Jesuits in
propagating experimental science in Germany. He is studying a paradigmatic
example of the experimental method, the air-pump, and trace its path through
Germany, from its invention by Otto von Guericke to the first printed account of
it by a Jesuit, Gaspar Schott, a professor of mathematics at the University of W
rzburg. The main problem the dissertation will attempt to solve is why a Jesuit
would support a physics which, on the surface, appears so radically different to
that commonly considered to be taught at universities in the early modern
period. To do this, he is examining Jesuit science and its relation to the
Jesuit university curriculum to determine what was actually taught at W rzburg.
He is examining the culture of the Society of Jesus to determine how much
freedom of opinion on scientific issues was permitted and to assess the role of
Jesuit correspondence in the propagation of experimental knowledge and practice.
In order to study these questions, Mr. Hellyer is making extensive use of
archives in Rome and in Germany.
