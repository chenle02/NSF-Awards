Paleoclimatic data from ice cores will likely prove to be a principal test by
which many aspects of Global Change are evaluated. Deep ice cores from polar
regions provide key paleoclimate data sets because they bridge the time scale
gap between records with annual resolution, but relatively short time scales
(e.g. tree rings), and those which have a resolution of hundreds to thousands of
years (e.g. marine sediments). This award provides for the efficient and timely
access to ice core data as they become available, as well as provides for the
safe, long-term, archival of key data for the Greenland Ice Sheet Project
(GISP2). The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) will provide data
management and archiving services to ensure efficient and centralized access to
the total data set and the permanent retention of key data. Because of the
widespread and increasing interest in paleoclimate and global change these data
sets will be used not only by GISP2 but there will be an ever increasing demand
from fields outside glaciology for this type off data.
