With support from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor
Nicholas Winograd of Pennsylvania State University seeks enhanced understanding
fundamental aspects of the interaction of energetic particle beams with solids
to enable novel applications in a variety of surface chemistry studies. The
focus is to utilize cluster ion beams, particularly those composed of energetic
C60 molecules, for molecular depth profiling experiments with an aim of
examining buried interfaces of multilayer molecular thin film structures with a
depth resolution of less than 5 nm, thereby providing 3-dimensional analysis of
materials with complex architectures. Computer simulations support experimental
measurements aimed at understanding the changes in topography during ion beam
erosion, and compensating for differential erosion rates across heterogeneous
materials. Methods to inhibit chemical damage accumulation and increase
sensitivity are also sought.

Results from this research should find widespread application in such diverse
fields as mass spectrometry, polymer science, astrophysics, drug discovery,
geology and chemical imaging. Students participate in K-12 presentations in
economically disadvantaged nearby school districts as well as gaining invaluable
skills that can be applied in a professional career.
