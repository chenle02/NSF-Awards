The focus of this research is the preparation of D2 symmetric catalysts by
control of the arrangement of simple chiral ligands within a complex rather than
designing elaborate ligands of D2 symmetry. The catalysts will be evaluated in
asymmetric cyclopropanations, aziridinations and epoxidations. Intermolecular
C-H insertions and 3 + 2 annulations using vinylcarbenoids and electron rich
alkenes will be studied in detail. With this renewal award, the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Huw M. L.
Davies of the Department of Chemistry at SUNY-Buffalo. Professor Davies will
focus his work on designing metal catalyzed asymmetric transformations. The
methodology and the resulting chiral products have potential for use in the
preparation of molecules with interesting biological properties.
