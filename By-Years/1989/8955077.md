An AACJC task force will assess the status of science, mathematics, and
engineering education in two-year colleges. A small group of experts will review
existing studies and data regarding barriers that cause students not to enroll
in science, factors preventing them from being successful, and factors which
mitigate against their transferring to four-year schools. Areas needing further
study will be identified. Following the study, AACJC will convene a Roundtable
of national leaders to review the study and develop specific recommendations and
plans for action. The roundtable will publish a report that incorporates
specific plans of action for colleges, state leaders, the AACJC, business, and
the NSF.
