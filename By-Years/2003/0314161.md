Proposal Number: 0314161&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: DIMACS Special Focus on
Communication Security and Information Privacy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Fred S
Roberts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vitally
important aspects of our modern society have become dependent on rapid and
secure communication, which is increasingly electronic. The new electronic age
offers vast potential for new services and applications, but gives rise to
serious new vulnerabilities and security threats. Moreover, many of the most
important new applications come at the price of threats to privacy. The Center
for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science (DIMACS) will initiate
a three-year "special focus" on Communication Security and Information Privacy
that will explore the new vulnerabilities and threats and new methods for
dealing with them. The activities planned for support under this special focus
will include working groups, workshops, and tutorials on several themes,
including Computer Security; Software Security; Large-scale Internet Attacks;
Intellectual Property Protection; Security of Web Services and E-Commerce;
Cryptography: Theory Meets Practice; Security Analysis of Protocols; Mobile and
Wireless Security; On-line Privacy: Threats and Tools; Privacy/Confidentiality
of Health Care Data; Intrusion Detection and Network Security Management
Systems; Security and Trust Issues Associated with Ad-Hoc Computing/Pervasive
Networking; Secure, Efficient Extraction of Joint Information from Multiple
Datasets; Database Security: Query Authorization and Information Inference;
Electronic Voting -- Theory and Practice; and Mobile Code Security.
