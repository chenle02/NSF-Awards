This dissertation research project will fund a graduate student from the
University of California-Riverside to study the conditions under which local
communities cooperate with conservation programs, and how local concerns are
accounted for in such programs. Building upon good contacts with Mexican
scientists, the student will study two sites of UNESCO's Man in the Ã•Biosphere
Program in Durango, Mexico. Fieldwork will compare two biosphere reserves to
study the conditions affecting local support of the biosphere program. This
project is important because it will help us understand the causes of local
community cooperation with, or antagonism to National programs which limit local
autonomy in use of natural resources. In a world where pollution is an
increasing danger, any knowledge to help build community support for
conservation is valuable.
