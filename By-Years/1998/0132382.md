The broad goal of this proposal is to gain a deeper understanding of the adult
human mathematical mind by studying its development in infancy. A major goal is
to test the hypothesis that infants rely on analog magnitude representations of
number similar to those used by adults, young children, and non-human animals.
Previous studies suggest that infants may rely on two distinct systems for
representing number; an object-file system for representing small values and an
analog magnitude mechanism for representing large numerical values. This
hypothesis will be tested by studying the psychophysics of number discrimination
over a wide range of numerical values, testing whether infants are sensitive to
ordinal relations between numerosities, and taking the first step to determine
whether the enumeration process(es) that infants use involves serial or parallel
processing. The proposed experiments will use the time that infants look at
various displays and the location of infants. eye movements as dependent
measures. The results of the proposed studies should provide a strong foundation
for the development of a coherent model of the development of non-verbal
numerical representations and will contribute to the principal investigator.s
long-term goal of studying both the evolution and the development of numerical
cognition. &lt;br/&gt;
