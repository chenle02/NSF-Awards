A collisionless plasma is a fully ionized gas in which electromagnetic forces
dominate collisional effects. The motion of a high temperature, low density
collisionless plasma is described by the Vlasov-Maxwell equations, a nonlinear
system of hyperbolic partial differential equations. In this setting collisions
are ignored while the charge and current densities (which drive the Maxwell
system) are determined in a self-consistent manner from velocity moments of
solutions to the Vlasov equation. The major question to be studied is this: are
there shocks in a three dimensional collisionless plasma? That is, could a
singularity develop from smoothly prescribed initial values as time progresses?
Smooth global solutions are known to exist in lower dimensional situations
(e.g., two space and velocity variables) and when the data are
"small."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kinetic Theory includes the study of the motion
and properties of plasmas. Plasmas are often called the fourth state of matter
(after solids, liquids and gases); they account for practically all of the
material in the universe. Plasmas are charged gases and hence are excellent
conductors of electricity. "Plasma engines" have been used recently to power
some NASA spacecraft. Notable examples of collisionless plasmas include the
solar wind, the ionosphere, galactic nebulae and comet tails. The motion of a
plasma is described by a number of complicated equations dictated by physics.
Among the mathematician's goals are to show that these equations have solutions
(under appropriate conditions) and to approximate them numerically (so that one
can predict certain behavior in future situations). To show that the Vlasov-
Maxwell system has a "nice" solution would at least partially confirm this
system as the "right" one to describe these phenomena. &lt;br/&gt;
