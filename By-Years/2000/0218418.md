Research shows that U.S. Latinas, particularly recent immigrants, are more
likely to be diagnosed with and die from cervical cancer than are white women.
Qualitative studies suggest that Latinas face numeorus barriers in attaining
health services, but there are no systematic quantitative studies that account
for preventive behaviors. The work combines acculturation theories and the
social psychology of belief and behavior relationships as conceptual frames in a
stage model. This study uses constructs from two stage models to investgate the
complex relationships among numerous individual variables - perceived
vulnerability, subjective norms, self-efficacy, attitudes toward cervical
cancer, knowledge, acculturation, and cultural factors - and precautionary
behaviors. The work involves focus groups, scale validation exercises, and then
a systematic survey designed to account for health-seeking practices among
Latinas in North Carolina. The research will identify factors within the
cultural ethos of Latinas that have the effect of increasing their risk of
cervical cancer and lessening their propensity to seek cancer screening.
