With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Hope College will acquire an Inductively Coupled
Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES). The research programs that will
benefit from the purchase of this instrument are centered on biogeochemical
studies of the local Lake Macatawa watershed, specifically the fate and
transport of metals within the watershed. This instrument will also be used to
train undergraduate students in state-of-the-art analytical methods commonly
employed in chemistry, geology and environmental
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electrically generated plasmas produce energetic
sources for the optical emission spectrometer. An inductively coupled plasma is
a high-temperature source in which energy to form the plasma is generated by a
high-frequency magnetic field. The optical emission spectrometer is an extremely
useful analytical tool that allows the identification of molecular species and
an understanding of the energy levels in the molecule. These studies will have a
significant impact in furthering our understanding of environmental chemistry of
watersheds.
