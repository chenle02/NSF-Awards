The objective of this proposal is to design part of an Intelligent
Vehicle/Highway (IVHS). Underlying IVHS is the belief that a dramatic increase
in highway capacity can be achieved by the automatic control of vehicles in
cooperation with an enhanced traffic management capability installed in the
highway system. It is proposed to design and test a significant part of the
control system dealing with maneuvers of cars in platoons. As far as possible,
the existing theory of discrete event systems will be used, making extensions to
the theory when it is necessary. The design effort will expose significant
questions which the current theory cannot adequately address. The design will be
evaluated on a 1,000 vehicle simulation of a section of a highway. It is hoped
that the experiment will yield a ballpark estimate of how much highway capacity
can be increased by IVHS.
