9972531 Friedman This award will provide partial support for speakers and
others at the 1999 Greater Boston Logic Conference, held at M.I.T., May 14-16,
1999. These conferences normally occur on a biennial basis, alternating with the
UCLA logic meetings that occur in even-numbered years. They have provided an
opportunity for mathematical logicians from around the world to present the most
current results in the field to an appreciative audience of their peers and have
been held at M.I.T. every other year for more than a decade. A prominent feature
of these conferences has been the high level of participation by students and
young postdocs, including women and minorities, and this is again the case for
the current year. Attendance is estimated at one hundred, primarily from the
United States, with some representation from Europe. ***
