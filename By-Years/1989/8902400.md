The principal investigator will find a natural class of objects on which
curvature measures are well-defined and satisfy the kinematic formula. It is
expected that such a class will consist of the zero-sets of non-negative "Monge-
Ampere" functions satisfying certain additional assumptions. He will investigate
whether curvature measures are intrinsic invariants. Alexandrov's theory of
intrinsic curvature of surfaces to higher dimensions will be generalized. The
geometry of non-smooth objects can be studied from a unified point of view when
scalar-valued curvatures are thought of as measures. No comprehensive theory of
curvature measures embraces both convex sets and singular algebraic varieties.
The principal investigator will use his recently developed methods involving
geometric measure theory to further clarify this problem. New tools using these
techniques will be created.
