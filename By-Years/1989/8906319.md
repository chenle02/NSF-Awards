Animals are expected to behave in ways that maximize their own survival and
reproduction. That an animal might ever risk its own survival or reproduction to
aid some other individual to which it is not related or mated is currently a
very controversial concept in behavioral ecology. Some species of ants provide
an ideal opportunity to examine aspects of this controversy; these species
exhibit cooperative colony foundation among unrelated individuals. The desert
leaf-cutter ant is unique among such species since one of the cooperating co-
foundresses voluntarily assumes the high-risk task of foraging for food outside
the nest (foraging by foundress queens does not occur in most species of ants).
This "foraging specialist" is apparently accepting a high risk role that
decreases her probability of survival and reproduction while increasing the
survival and reproduction possibilities of her non-foraging, co- foundresses.
Such behavior is considered "altruistic." This proposal examines several aspects
of the selective forces that might favor such altruistic behavior in animals. In
particular, the eventual reproductive success of "foraging specialists" will be
examined using new molecular genetic methodology (an examination of inheritance
patterns of mitochondrial DNA). Further, "foraging specialists" in laboratory
colonies will be prohibited from foraging to examine the behavior of non-
foraging co-foundresses when confronted with a possible "cheater" who refuses to
forage. Finally, the underlying population structure that favors cooperative
colony foundation in some species (but not others) will be examined. This work
is some of the first to empirically examine the nature of interactions among
cooperating non-relatives. Development of an insect "model" system for such
study and experimental manipulation is especially appealing.
