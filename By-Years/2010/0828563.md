CBET-0828563&lt;br/&gt;Brady&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project
Summary&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Suspensions and granular media are found
widely in nature and industry. And although the two fields have developed
independently, recently it has been noted that viscous suspensions and dry
granular materials often display similar flow phenomena. Despite the
similarities, the two fields nevertheless remain separate. Here we propose that
this separation is unnecessary and that suspensions and granular media - wet and
dry - actually correspond to different limiting behaviors of one common system.
The linking parameter is the Stokes number - the ratio of the inertial to shear
forces: small Stokes numbers correspond to viscous suspensions and high Stokes
numbers to dry granular media. The proposed research is a simulation study
covering the entire range of Stokes numbers (and concentrations) and thus
explores the flow behavior and rheological connection between these two fields.
Not only will we learn about this connection, we may also advance our
understanding of both suspensions and granular media. This study also provides
vital rheological data (shear and normal stresses, shear-induced diffusivities,
microstructures, etc.) for inertial suspensions, of which there appears to be
surprisingly little.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: In a broader context,
this research will help elucidate the behavior of an often called new state of
matter - granular matter. Granular flow forms part of the larger area of
multiphase flow with applications ranging from sediment transport in rivers and
bays, to pneumatic conveying of minerals, to the production of pharmaceutical
powders. The work will also engage PhD students who will become experts in
computational methods, multiphase fluid physics and rheology. This research
provides the foundation for modeling multiphase flows that has widespread
application in science and technology.
