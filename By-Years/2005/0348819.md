This project will enhance and further develop an existing community air quality
model to produce a truly integrated weather-chemistry model capable of better
forecasting the abundance and transport of particulate matter (PM) in the
atmosphere. The P.I. will initially further develop the Model of Aerosol
Dynamics, Reaction, Ionization and Dissolution (MADRID) to improve how aerosols
are treated in a real atmosphere. These improvements will be combined with an
existing cloud chemistry model and both incorporated into NOAA's Weather
Research and Forecast (WRF) Air Quality prediction system version 1 (WRFAQV1)
model, followed by a series of evaluations of model performance with a view to
producing an operational version for ozone and PM forecasts. Forecasting air
quality (or "Chemical Weather") is an emerging area of research interest
crossing disciplinary boundaries within the atmospheric science community, and
this research has far reaching implications for human exposure, health and
regulatory policy. The broader science impacts of this study lie in making
substantive and necessary contributions to improving tools required for more
reliable predictions of air quality in the future. The P.I. will integrate this
research into a number of education and outreach activities. The project will
contribute substantively to the professional development of an early career
female faculty at a major State research and teaching university, support
research training and higher education of two graduate students and provide a
number of summer undergraduate internships in collaboration with two industry
partners. The education plan also includes opportunities for course development,
student participation in research, and public outreach.
