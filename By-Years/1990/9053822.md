Wichita State University (WSU) is leading a partnership comprising Unified
School District 259 (USD) and Wichita/Sedgewick County Partnership for Growth
(WI/SE). The partnership proposes to use existing private sector and educational
relationships and networks to develop and pilot integrated instructional
packages in 4 target USD 259 schools over a 4-year period. Private sector
technical personnel will be involved in planning and providing instruction.
After evaluation, these units will be disseminated throughout school systems in
the country and made available nationally. Anticipated results include: (1)
integration of private sector technical personnel in projects to improve science
and mathematics education, (2) integration of current applications of science
and mathematics into course content, (3) improvement of science and mathematics
teaching, (4) improved science and mathematics learning among all student
populations in local schools, and (5) involvement in science and mathematics
learning and improved performance by students from population segments
traditionally underserved in technically-based careers.
