The Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, with partial support from NSF,
will develop science, mathematics, and technology components for a new,
permanent 17,000 square foot exhibition on the Pacific. Broad in scope and
dramatic in its impact, this exhibition will cut across many fields and
disciplines in presenting a coherent, integrated view of the Pacific regions.
Topics from anthropology, geology, biology and geography will be combined using
collections, reconstructed objects, large scale models, and interactive
components in this landmark exhibition. The project will make extensive use of
leading researchers, educators, and an evaluation consultant, and will utilize a
variety of prototyping and formative exhibit development techniques. The
science, mathematics and technology portion will cost $ 1.9 million, of which
approximately one third is requested from NSF. The complete 17,000 square foot
exhibition will cost $ 3.3 million and will be seen by at least 10 million
adults and children over its 20 year life.
