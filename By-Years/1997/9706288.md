The Petaflops Algorithm Workshop (PAL' 97) will be held April 20-25, 1997 in
Williamsburg, VA. The object of this workshop (PAL' 97) will be to identify
novel algorithm approaches that will be significantly more efficient for key
applications on future petaflops systems, present and evaluate results of
federally sponsored studies in petaflops computer algorithm and also in new
architecture point designs. It will also determine the scope and structure of
future government-funded algorithm research activities to ensure that petaflop
computers will be usable and effective for important future missions.
