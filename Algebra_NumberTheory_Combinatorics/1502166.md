This award provides funding for the workshop "Perspectives on Complex Algebraic
Geometry" to take place May 22-25, 2015 at Columbia University, New York, New
York. Algebraic Geometry is the study of the solutions of polynomial equations
in several variables. As polynomials arise in every topic that can be studied
numerically, algebraic geometry plays a central role within mathematics and has
close ties to the sciences. The field traces its roots back to the foundations
of mathematics, has led to some of the most significant mathematical
accomplishments in the past hundred years, and continues to be a burgeoning and
vital field today. Within the field of algebraic geometry, complex algebraic
geometry plays a special role. Namely, the complex structure of the solution
sets allows for a wide range of techniques, including those from geometry,
analysis, and topology. Some of the most powerful techniques involve the use of
Hodge theory, which uses harmonic theory on compact manifolds to relate the
topology, complex structure, and algebraic properties of the solutions sets.
Recently, the connections with physics have played an increasingly important
role in algebraic geometry. Many questions in physics can be phrased naturally
in the language of differential geometry. Through deep and surprising
connections that exist between differential geometry and complex algebraic
geometry, some of these questions can be addressed using the techniques of
algebraic geometry. Questions posed by physicists have been solved using
techniques developed by algebraic geometers. In turn, recent developments in
physics have led to astonishing new results and open problems in algebraic
geometry.

The purpose of the workshop is to survey the recent developments in the field of
complex algebraic geometry with a focus on the following 3 main topics: (1)
Topology and geometry of algebraic surfaces and 4-manifolds, (2) Vector bundles
and G-bundles, and (3) Geometric applications of Hodge theory. These are central
topics in the field of complex algebraic geometry, that have seen a number of
interesting recent developments, and lie at the intersection of a number of
fields of mathematics, but which have been less well represented lately in terms
of workshops. The workshop will bring together some of the leading experts in
the field, as well as a number of young researchers, who will further propel
developments in these directions. More details on the conference can be found at
