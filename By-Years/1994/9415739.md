This grant in the Chemistry Division Special Projects Office provides partial
support for a workshop on "Research Opportunities in Pollution Prevention for
Chemists and Chemical Engineers: An Industrial Perspective" which will be held
October 29-30, 1994 in Gaithersburg, MD. This workshop, which will be hosted by
NIST and which has a projected attendance of 100-125 people, is sponsored by the
Council for Chemical Research, the NSF /MPS Division of Chemistry, the NSF/ENG
Division of Chemical and Transport Systems, NIST, and the Center for Waste
Reduction Technology of the American Institute of Chemical Engineering. The
purpose of the workshop is to define academic research opportunities in
chemistry and chemical engineering from an induatrial perspective. Discussions
of long-range industrial needs in environmentally benign chemical synthesis will
be framed in a format of plenary speakers and panel discussions, and are
intended to stimulate competitive, industrially relevant proposals to NSF from
the academic chemistry community.
