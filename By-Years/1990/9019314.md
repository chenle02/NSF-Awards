Simulation and sensitivity studies will be done to evaluate the potential for
using electro-magnetic (EM) techniques to determine large-scale properties of
oceanic transport. Output from the Community Modeling Effort (CME) will be used
to provide gridded information at basin scale for the North Atlantic Ocean.
Special attention will be on the effects of seafloor topography, spatial
variation of the geomagnetic field, variable sediment thickness, and non-locally
generated electric currents.
