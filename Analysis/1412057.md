This award will support a three-year run of the Ohio River Analysis Meeting that
is hosted by (in alternate years) the University of Kentucky and the University
of Cincinnati; the first conference in this sequence will run in March of 2014.
In 2015 the conference will run at the University of Cincinnati and in 2016 it
returns to the University of Kentucky.

This annual conference is centered on the recent developments in the field of
Analysis, and in particular in the subfields of partial differential equations
and mathematical physics. Through plenary lectures the conference will provide
an opportunity for regional mathematicians, postdocs, and graduate students to
attend state-of-the-art talks and to confer with leading researchers in the
field of Analysis. Through contributed talks the meeting will provide a venue
for young mathematicians to present their results to a distinguished audience.
An overarching goal is to foster cooperation and collaboration amongst analysis
researchers in the Ohio Valley region.
