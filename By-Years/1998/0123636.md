The goal of this project is to contribute to the development of a national
science and engineering academic workforce that includes the full participation
of women in all levels of faculty and academic administration, particularly at
the senior academic ranks, through the transformation of institutional
practices, policies, climate and culture. Through the Leadership Education for
Advancement and Promotion Program (LEAP), the University of Colorado seeks to
transform the makeup of the science and engineering faculties at the University
of Colorado, Boulder, and to increase the number of women trained in the
scientific, mathematical, engineering, and technology (SMET) disciplines serving
in key administrative positions. The University of Colorado, Boulder seeks to
improve the environment for all faculty members, by improving the level of
managerial and leadership skills possessed by the faculty. Providing all the
tools needed to work effectively will reduce the stresses commonly associated
with achieving tenure. LEAP will therefore accelerate the promotion rate of
women faculty by increasing retention rates and making their environment more
supportive. The program is designed to keep faculty members on track for tenure,
to identify potential leaders, and to give people more leadership
opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program is designed to work with efforts
already underway at the University of&lt;br/&gt;Colorado. Formative evaluation
of the program will maximize the effectiveness of the funds used over the
lifetime of the program. At the end of the five-year period the University of
Colorado, Boulder expects to have more women in leadership positions in the
University. In addition, they will have trained a cadre of faculty better able
to pursue long term change, and have developed an effective way to continue to
train faculty for success. This program will permanently impact the institution
and the changes it initiates will be self-sustainable through internal
support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by the NSF ADVANCE
Program. The overall mission of the ADVANCE Program is to increase the
participation of women in the scientific and engineering workforce through the
increased representation and advancement of women in academic science and
engineering careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
