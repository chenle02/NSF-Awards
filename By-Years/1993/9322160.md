9322160 Parsons Dr. Edith J. Parsons and other members of the Chemistry
Department of Clemson University are being supported to continue a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period of
1994-96, eight undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively
engaged in a variety of research projects. Projects cover the traditional areas
of chemistry- analytical, inorganic, organic and physical. Students will be
primarily from the ten-state region surrounding Clemson.
