Project investigates the ground amplification phenomena in the Salt Lake
Valley, using numerical simulation of the 3 dimensional wave equation. Low
frequency propagation (0-3 Hz) and resonence is simulated using finite
difference techniques on a parallel- architecture computer. Provides an accurate
understanding of the ground amplification problem, which has direct impact on
the development of improved zoning maps and verification of existing ground
response measurements. Direct application to earthquake hazard reduction
objectives.
