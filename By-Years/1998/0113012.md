The Department of Statistics at North Carolina State University will purchase a
high-performance clustered computing facility which will be dedicated to the
support of research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for
several research projects, including in particular: - Simulation Methods for
Data Measured With Error - Stochastic Models of Gene Regulation - Spatial
Modeling, Visualization and Inference - Statistical Analysis of Large Data Sets
- Models of Biological Pattern Formation
