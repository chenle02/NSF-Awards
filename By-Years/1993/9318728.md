This project will research the relationship between incompressible and
compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, including observable
consequences in the solar wind, such as characteristic anisotropies in the inner
wind and scalings of various fluctuations in the outer heliosphere. A transport
theory for description of the long wavelength and low frequency variations of
local MHD turbulence will be further exploited to address important
observational issues in the solar wind. Extensions of this theory will describe
assimilation of waves injected by wave-particle interactions associated with
upstream waves, as well as waves associated with pickup and assimilation of
newborn cometary and interstellar ions. Further work in basic MHD theory will
include development and refinement of a phenomenology of MHD relaxation
processes based upon an information-entropy description which has recently shown
promise in the context of two dimensional hydrodynamics turbulence. Finally, the
investigators will construct models for including turbulence effects in self-
consistent models of solar wind acceleration, and self-consistent models for
charged particle-wave turbulence dynamics near comets and shocks.
