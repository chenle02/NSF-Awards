9411619 Mickelson This proposal is for sponsorship of a small workshop to be
held with approximately 25-35 participants from industry, universities, and
government laboratories and agencies. All participants will be involved in
optoelectronic packaging. The purpose will be to try to foster discussion
between packaging researchers and students, from different mother disciplines,
through having them discuss specific design problems in optoelectronic
packaging. Graduate students will be encouraged to attend the workshop through
travel support. Such non-classroom education will enhance students' experiences
through group discussions and poster exchanges. ***
