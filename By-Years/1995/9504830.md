9504830 de Moustier The Scripps Institution of Oceanography will will undertake
an instrument develoipment project to build a multi-sensor, digital Deep Tow
vehicle capable of fine-scale multibeam swath mapping and acoustic backscatter
imaging near the seafloor to a 6000 meter depth. The system will be configured
to operate with either coaxial or fiber-optic tow cables and be capable of
deploying sensor packages as science requirements dictate. The plan is to
integrate a pair of 110 kHz side-looking sonars, a 4 kHz sub-bottom profiler, a
40 kHz obstacle avoidance sonar, a 12 kHz navigation sonar, a 23.5 kHz up-
looking sonar, a CTD, a transmissometer, a magnetometer and a complement of
still and TV cameras onto an existing towed vehicle). This high resolution tool
will be used to study geological seafloor phenomena such as crustal accretion
processes, small-scale abyssal sediment processes (sediment wave amplitude,
asymmetry, wavelength and orientation), scale dependence of seafloor topography,
and seafloor acoustic backscattering. Ultimately, the data will provide a base
for better understanding the relationship between the magmatic and tectonic
processes that control the ridge system and hydrothermal venting.
