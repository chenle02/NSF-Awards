A number of spectroscopic, magnetic resonance, and dielectric relaxation
studies are conducted to: 1) probe the relationship between 2D structures and
material properties, 2) better understand the solid-state chemistry of the
materials, and 3) explore the possibilities for producing new "molecular
composite" materials of technological interests. The 2D materials to be studied
have a semiconducting (inorganic) phase and an insulating (organic) phase. The
research proposed involves experiments that examine the effects of reduced
dimensionality on the behavior of electronically excited electron-hole bound
pairs; dielectric loss measurements that reveal structure and dynamical behavior
in the organic phase; and exploitation of solid-state chemistry of molecular
composites to prepare novel photoluminescent materials. These spectroscopic
measurements are important because they are difficult or impossible to conduct
with other low-dimensional samples.
