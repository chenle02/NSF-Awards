Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;This project is creating a set of laboratory
exercises that support student understanding of robust software systems design
for modern electronic commerce applications. Lecture and lab are closely
synchronized so that technical topics, strategies, and case studies presented in
lecture are immediately reinforced by an implementation experience in the
laboratory. Lab exercises include protocol performance, cryptography,
authentication, electronic transactions, and steaming multimedia using
technologies such as Java, ASP, Perl, XML and MySQL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There
is particular emphasis on the planning and evaluation process to ensure that the
materials are those most necessary and sufficient for student understanding of
electronic commerce.
