Wi-Fi has emerged as the technology of choice for Internet access. Thus,
virtually every smartphone or tablet is now equipped with a Wi-Fi card.
Concurrently, and as a means to maximize spectral efficiency, Wi-Fi radios are
becoming increasingly complex and sensitive to wireless channel conditions. The
prevalence of Wi-Fi networks, along with their adaptive behaviors, makes them an
ideal target for denial of service attacks at a large, infrastructure
level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to comprehensively investigate the
resiliency of Wi-Fi networks to smart attacks, and to design and implement
robust solutions capable of resisting or countering them. The project
additionally focuses on harnessing new capabilities of Wi-Fi radios, such as
multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) antennas, to protect against powerful
adversaries. The research blends theory with experimentation and prototyping,
and spans a range of disciplines including protocol design and analysis, coding
and modulation, on-line algorithms, queuing theory, and emergent
behaviors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The anticipated benefits of the project include:
(1) a deep understanding of threats facing Wi-Fi along several dimensions, via
experiments and analysis; (2) a set of mitigation techniques and algorithms to
strengthen existing Wi-Fi networks and emerging standards; (3) implementation
into open-source software that can be deployed on wireless network cards and
access points; (4) security training of the next-generation of scientists and
engineers involved in radio design and deployment.
