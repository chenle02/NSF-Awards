The general goal of this research project is the development of a better
understanding of the fundamental nature of discrete time circuits, fault
diagnosis in analog circuits and nonlinear transistor networks and their
properties, and the development of new mathematical techniques for their
analysis and design. Utilization of results from the proposed work is expected
in important applications such as the checkout and maintenance of complex
electronic circuit boards and in the development of analytical methods for
solving related problems. The research will also contribute significantly to the
training of new researches and result in PhD dissertations.
