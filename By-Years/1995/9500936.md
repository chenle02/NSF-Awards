9500936 Propp Abstract The investigator studies two-dimensional structures such
as tilings of finite regions with the goal of understanding how constraints at
the boundary propagate inward in the presence of randomness. He uses methods
from the mathematical fields of combinatorics, dynamical systems, and
interacting particle systems in order to prove results that quantify the way
boundary conditions temper randomness. His main objects of study are currently
dimer models, which can also be interpreted as random tiling models. Crystals
are ordinarily thought of as the ultimate in orderly arrangement, but at an
atomic scale there is often structural disorder with measurable consequences for
the bulk properties of matter. Statistical physicists have made much progress
towards modeling these sorts of structure, usually by making some simplifying
assumptions. One of these is the supposition that the structure is two-
dimensional (an appropriate assumption if one is studying surfaces of crystals);
another is the supposition that the structure has no boundary. The investigator
is relaxing this second assumption and studying what happens in certain standard
models of crystalline matter in which there is a boundary of a specified shape
having specified structure, and in which all the randomness is confined to the
interior.
