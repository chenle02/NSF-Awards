Companies dealing with profound hearing loss, chronic pain, Parkinson's disease,
and epilepsy must rely on expensive and technologically-limited hand-assembled
electrode arrays in their neurostimulators. These devices are costly due to low
throughput and yield; the complexity is limited by what can be achieved with the
human hand; and quality assurance is difficult to maintain in the presence of
human error. By using lithographically-based technology for the automated
manufacturing of arrays, this project has the potential to significantly reduce
their cost while improving their reproducibility and performance. The
microelectromechanical arrays has the potential to enable medical device
manufacturers to increase the number of electrodes on their leads by 5X, reduce
the size of the electrodes by greater than 30X, reduce the overall size of the
leads by 92%, and easily define the mechanical properties of the arrays. And by
utilizing this technology to eventually add position sensing and actuation, the
team believes that the insertion of the arrays can be largely automated,
reducing surgical placement time and cost while allowing better placement and
improved performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a rise in the incidence of
neurological diseases and disorders in the US. Conditions such as hearing loss,
Parkinson's disease, and epilepsy are more prevalent now than ever, and
pharmaceutical solutions are lacking in both effectiveness and safety.
Neurostimulation implants have been developed to treat such conditions, however,
their performance and costs are lacking, due to hand-assembly manufacturing. In
the case of hearing loss, over 150,000 cochlear prosthetics have been implanted
worldwide to date; however, over 250 million people worldwide are estimated to
be disabled due to hearing loss. Many of these people are in developing
countries and lack the funds necessary to take advantage of current prostheses,
both due to the cost of the systems themselves and due to the cost of the
associated surgery. By using lithographically-based technology for the
neurostimulation arrays, the team has the potential to significantly reduce
their cost while improving their surgical safety and performance. The enabling
technology will also promote the creation of new neurostimulation devices (e.g.,
for blindness and paralysis) whose size and complexity is not currently
achievable with hand-assembly. The technology being proposed promised to result
in a significant leap forward in the practical treatment of neurological
disorders and diseases on a worldwide scale and thus possesses the potential for
significant impact.
