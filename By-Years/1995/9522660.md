9522660 Vonder Haar The Center for the Analysis and Prediction of Storms (CAPS)
at the University of Oklahoma is one of the NSF s Science and Technology
Centers. The goal of CAPS is to develop the scientific basis for the improvement
of short term forecasts (less than 24 hours) of severe convective weather. The
purpose of this project from the Colorado State University is to work in
conjunction with CAPS scientists to produce high-quality, gridded analyses from
the Oklahoma adaptation of the local area prediction system developed by the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. These gridded analyses will be
used by CAPS scientists in diagnostic studies of convective phenomena; as
background fields for high-resolution Doppler-retrieval procedures; as initial
conditions for high-resolution numerical models and four-dimensional data
assimilation procedures in order to test the capabilities of the CAPS Advanced
Regional Prediction System. Additionally, these gridded analyses will be used by
a variety of scientists in the study of severe weather. ***
