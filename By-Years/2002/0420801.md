This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award provides funds for the purchase
of a large scale, Solidica ultrasonic consolidation system. This equipment will
be used to support research on the fundamentals of ultrasonic consolidation
traversing lengths scales from atomistic, molecular dynamic modeling, to
hierarchical design/optimization procedures. These include examination of atomic
species migration during ultrasonic consolidation, fabrication of multilayer
smart materials incorporating ceramic fibers, polymers and metallic layers,
large scale ultrasonic curing of fiber reinforced thermosetting polymers, benign
environmental treatment of textile fiber surfaces and low temperature
fabrication of intermetallic matrix composites. It will also be used to support
the undergraduate interdisciplinary senior design program.

This equipment will contribute to developing a knowledge base in ultrasonic
consolidation which has application in biomedical devices, aeroengines and air
frames. Specifically the knowledge gained will allow incorporation of sensors
and direct communication links in orthopedic devices, achievement of real time
control variable configuration wing components and direct manufacture of
aeroengine components incorporating both cooling air passages and thermal/damage
sensors and actuators.
