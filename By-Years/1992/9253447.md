WGBH Educational Foundation seeks support from NSF to add a Science Unit to its
Descriptive Video Service. In their original proposal they cited three
objectives: to produce universally available narrative audio descriptions of
public television science program for visually impaired Americans, to
disseminate information regarding the availability of the programs, and to raise
funds for additional program descriptions. A modest evaluation plan was
included. With the funds requested here, they will describe NOVA, NATURE, and
THE NEW EXPLORERS. Other programs will be added in the subsequent years. This
request is for the support of the first year of a three-year projection.
