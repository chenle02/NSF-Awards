The international mobility of highly skilled workers, in particular human
resources in science and technology (HRST) is an important and growing policy
issue with a number of countries. The project is a preliminary investigation of
the statistical, methodological, economic and policy issues involved in the
international mobility of skilled workers, especially IT specialists, research
scientists and engineers or entrepreneurs. Results from the statistical
components of this work will feed into the revision of the "Canberra manual"
which sets international guidelines for the measurement of human resources in
science and technology. Expected outcomes of the project are (1) new indicators
reflecting international mobility for a range of countries to be published in
2001; (2) An international conference on the issue scheduled for 2001; (3) a
compendium of country studies and international statistics will be published in
2001/2 containing revised and expanded versions of works presented at the
conference.
