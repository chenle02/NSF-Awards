A data center or data bank for the validation of dynamic and static constitutive
relations for soils will be established at Case Western Reserve University. It's
content will be made available to those involved in the development and use of
behavioral models entering the design of critical structures under a variety of
environments. Structures in a severe environment require a level of
sophisticated calculation that utilizes the proper constitutive equations. For
example, dams, nuclear power plants, offshore and onshore platforms will have to
satisfy earthquake resistance codes, and are designed using finite elements
programs based on those equations. Researchers in America and other countries
have already offered to add their data to this base. Ongoing and future research
will also add to the data base. It is expected that the center will become self-
supporting in three years, after which it could continue on its own or be
incorporated as part of one of the designated test sites for geotechnical
experimentation.
