This one-year research effort builds on past advances in the molecular beam
epitaxy of GaA1As heterostructures on Si achieved under previous NSF support. It
will concentrate on improving the performance of the cw laser diodes on silicon
by incorporating compressive strain in the quantum well active regions,
improving material quality, and reducing residual "bulk" layer strains. The
collaboration with Professor Carl Thompson in the Department of Materials
Science and Engineering on the initial stages of nucleation and on the
development of improved growth techniques will be continued. Preliminary work on
selective area epitaxy will be conducted, and an active collaboration with
colleagues in the silicon-oriented MIT Microsystems Technology Laboratory will
be established to develop a growth sequence which is compatible with their
BICMOS process.
