This U.S.-Poland Cooperative Joint Research on "Photophysics of Atoms and
Electrons" is a renewal of INT 89-05178, between groups of American and Polish
researchers headed by Dr. J.H. Eberly, University of Rochester, amd Dr. I.
Bialynicki-Birula, Institute of Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences. The
researchers are investigating the properties of electrons, atoms, and molecules
in radiation fields. Over the past year, they have performed theoretical studies
of coherent optical pulse propagation, cooperative emission and superradiance,
X-ray bremstrahlung and inner shell ionization processes, the effects of laser
fluctuations and noise on photo-absorption and emission, the theory of atom-
field interactions in the context of cavity QED and phase representations for
radiation fields. They have also worked on short-pulse studies of diatomic
molecules, quantum fluctuations in stimulated Raman scattering, and ionization
of atoms and molecules by ultra-strong electromagnetic radiation (optical and
microwave). This research in theoretical physics fulfills the program objectives
of advancing science by enabling leading experts in the U.S. and Poland to
combine complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong
mutual interest and competence.
