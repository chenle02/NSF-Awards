The Center for Innovative Learning Technologies (CILT) was founded in October
1997 with a four-year grant from the National Science Foundation. The invited
Accomplishment Based Renewal (ABR) proposal describes CILT' s planned activities
during this ABR period.

CILT was formed to stimulate the development and implementation of important,
technology-enabled solutions to critical problems in K-14 science, mathematics,
engineering, and technology (SMET) learning. CILT has engaged the collaborative
efforts of an exceptionally wide range of people, institutions, and
organizations including hundreds of cognitive scientists, computer scientists,
natural scientists, engineers, classroom teachers, educational researchers,
learning technology industry leaders, and policy analysts. CILT is designed as
an inclusive national effort led by five institutions -SRI International,
Stanford University , University of California at Berkeley, Vanderbilt
University, and the Concord Consortium - each with a broad range of expertise
and an international reputation for making effective, innovative contributions
to technology-enhanced SMET learning.

During the ABR period, CILT will continue its current work of hosting workshops
that encourage collaboration throughout the field; funding and facilitating a
new round of seed grants; and fostering the development of new researchers
through its post doctoral researcher program. In addition, CILT team will find
ways to sustain the promising aspects of CILT by refocusing the theme teams,
nurturing the community that CILT has created, institutionalizing effective
components of CILT, and exploring next steps. More can be learned about CILT and
its current activities at http://www.cilt.org.
