Dynamic seal performance can be improved by favorably controlling the fluid
pressure between the two sliding surfaces. Favorable control of fluid pressure
in the mixed friction regime can lead to reduce gross wear and reduce friction.
In traditional design the detail of the mixed friction lubrication is left to
the inherent characteristics of the materials themselves. By altering material
properties in a pattern over the surface area to some depth, it is possible to
produce surface which have wear depths and/or surface characteristic variations
which correspond to these patterns. These patterns of varying effective film
thickness can be used to enhance mixed friction lubrication. Such differential
wear may be stable even with significant amounts of gross wear, thus ensuring a
continuation of the benefits on pressure distribution, grosswear, and friction.
