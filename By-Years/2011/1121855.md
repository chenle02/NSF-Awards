It has long been recognized that the direction of evolution is determined not
only by the environments to which organisms are exposed, but also by features of
their genetic and developmental programs that constrain the ability to vary. A
pattern indicative of such 'developmental constraint' is irreversible evolution,
or the failure of lost structures to reappear when organisms return to ancestral
environments or behaviors. This project employs an example of irreversible
evolution, the reduction of tooth-bearing locations in cypriniform fishes, to
characterize the genetic features underlying developmental constraint. Teeth in
this group, which includes minnows and suckers, were lost from the mouth and
upper throat over 50 million years ago and are retained only on the lower
surface of the throat. The lost teeth have never returned, despite the adoption
of ancestral feeding modes by multiple lineages of this diverse group. The
project will identify genetic changes that occurred in association with loss of
teeth in cypriniforms and test the hypothesis that irreversible evolution is the
result of accumulated changes in multiple genes and developmental pathways. In
addition, genetic engineering approaches will be applied to a common laboratory
cypriniform, the Zebra Danio, in an attempt to restore lost teeth. The enhanced
understanding of developmental constraint expected to result from the project is
relevant to the practical question of whether species will be able to adapt to
manmade environmental change or will instead become extinct. In addition to
providing research training at the undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate
levels, the project will produce modified fish strains that will enhance courses
in Fish Biology and Genetics at the University of Colorado, as well as an
exhibit at its Museum of Natural History.
