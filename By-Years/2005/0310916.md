&lt;br/&gt;Reconfigurable Computing: Bridging the
Gap&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reconfigurable computing exploits the
ability of hardware to adapt its structure and function to suit a given problem.
Theoretical models have established its power and versatility, and commercially
available devices have exploited reconfiguration in solutions to a variety of
problems, yet a significant gap exists between theory and practice. Theoretical
models make assumptions that are unlikely to be realizable. Practical solutions
are often tied to device-specific features, solving the given problem, but
offering little beyond that in developing broad techniques. This project seeks
to bridge this gap by tethering theory in reality, while abstracting solutions
from device details.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We approach the task of bridging the
gap between theory and practice from two directions: (1) theoretical models
(primarily the R-Mesh) and (2) commercially available hardware (primarily
FPGAs). The first direction will realistically account for practical
considerations (like bus delay and power consumption), while exploiting the
power of reconfiguration. The second direction will construct problem solutions
(in areas like image processing and networking) on practical hardware with an
aim of extracting and applying general principles. We expect these directions to
open the door to hybrid architectures that seek to build on the strengths of the
two platforms and fill each other's deficiencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
