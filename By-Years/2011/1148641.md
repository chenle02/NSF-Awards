With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program is funding Professor
Jon Fukuto of Sonoma State University to elucidate the chemical interactions of
H2S with a variety of likely and possible biological targets. It is proposed by
the Fukuto lab that an important fate of biologically generated H2S is the
formation of protein persulfides (RSSH). From a chemical perspective,
persulfides are expected to have unique properties that can alter thiol protein
function in ways unknown with other thiol-modifed species. Thus, the generation
of persulfides in proteins and subsequent effects on protein function may be an
important aspect of H2S biology/signaling. Significantly, the ephemeral nature
of persulfides may also be an important aspect of their physiological utility
and, interestingly, would have precluded their discovery or recognition as a
biologically relevant species.

Broader impacts include the exposure of undergraduate students to
interdisciplinary research in Chemical Biology. Moreover, fundamental
biochemical studies of H2S are expected to have impact on the broader scientific
community. It appears that NO and CO, together with H2S, constitute an
integrated and intimately intertwined signaling system of volatile "second
messengers". That is, reported commonality in biological targets and possible
chemical interactions indicates a chemical signaling "web". Thus, information on
H2S-signaling mechanisms is expected to contribute to the understanding of this
network of gaseous low molecular weight signaling species.
