This research project will focus on methods for analyzing data recorded in time
and/or space that is count-valued, for example, daily county COVID-19 deaths,
monthly state tornado counts, and annual North Atlantic severe hurricanes. The
data may be correlated in time, implying that counts observed today may be
associated by counts occurring in the immediate past, or correlated in space,
implying that adjacent observations are associated with each other. The PI will
develop statistical methods that take into account the particular type of
distribution appropriate for the counts, for example, Poisson, geometric, and
binomial, enabling the researcher to make more accurate forecasts and
inferences. The models and methods developed here allow both positive and
negative correlations in time and space, a feature not achievable with many
current statistical count models. For example, COVID-19 cases tend to cluster in
groups, while oak and pine trees do not prefer to grow near one and other
(negative correlation). The models to be developed in this project will permit
the incorporation of covariates and allow for likelihood inference. The PI will
also seek to construct the California Climate Center, a research station for
climatic and environmental problems quantified by technical methods.

On a technical level, the PI will transform a Gaussian space-time process into a
count process having the desired marginal distribution(s). The work will prove
that this setup produces the most flexible count structures achievable.
Extensions involving non-Gaussian processes will be explored and methods to fit
the spatio-temporal model via maximum likelihood techniques will be developed
via particle filtering and sequential Monte Carlo methods. Extensions to
multivariate count time series and will be examined and asymptotic inference for
some setups will be studied. Space-time applications to snow presence/absence
trends in the Northern Hemisphere will be conducted.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
