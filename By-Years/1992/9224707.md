Murdocca In this project a system is being built to translate a dataflow
language into hardware and implement the hardware on an optical gate array. The
system is comprised of three components: a compiler to translate a dataflow
language such as ID into a dataflow graph; a method for converting dataflow
graphs into hardware described by a hardware description language, along with a
simulator; and a synthesis program for mapping HDL descriptions onto an optical
gate array. The optical gate array consists of planes of electronic gates, with
the planes interconnected by free-space optics. An advantage of this kind of
gate array is quick reconfiguration of the optical interconnections which allows
dataflow graphs to be changed quickly. This project is applicable to the
development of advanced integrated engineering cells for manufacturing. Because
of noise immunity and lack of electromagnetic interference, optical computation
is well-suited to the factory floor. Reconfigurable optical computers of the
type under development in this project may allow high-speed computation to be
inserted into manufacturing processes in new ways.
