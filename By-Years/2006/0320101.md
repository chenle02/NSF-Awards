Support is proposed for student travel assistance for the 2003 IEEE
Nanotechnology Conference. The conference, which has been held twice previously,
brings together researchers focused on developing nanotechnologies and applying
these technologies to electronic, magnetic and photonic devices and systems. The
requested support will be used to provide travel stipends for students
presenting talks at the conference. In addition, support will be provided for
undergraduate students involved in nanotechnology programs through summer
research experiences and other extracurricular projects. The broader impact of
the proposed program includes involvement of graduate and undergraduate students
in a technical conference run by a major professional society. In addition to
technical exposure, this experience will provide the opportunity to interact
with a broad range of researchers involved in this field.
