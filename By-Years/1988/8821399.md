This project involves the estimation of a labor demand model which includes both
fixed and quadratic variable adjustment costs. The model will be estimated with
existing, monthly data for seven durable goods plants and existing data for
airline firms and with new, monthly data for fast-food outlets. The goals are to
examine whether the fixed adjustment costs that appear to characterize the
durable-goods plants describe adjustment elsewhere and to infer whether they
reflect costs stemming from: 1) Disruption of arrangements among workers; 2)
Complementarity of groups of workers with lumpy capital; and 3) Implicit labor
contracts that specify maximum employment with layoffs when demand is low. In
addition, a simulation general equilibrium model will be constructed to examine
the dynamic effects of taxes and subsidies, noting the incidence of small
changes in payroll tax rates, given discrete demand dynamics. The relative
impacts of marginal and standard employment subsidies will also be examined when
labor demand adjusts discretely. &amp;&amp;The purpose of this research is to
examine the how employment is affected by changes in wages and product demand.
While there has been a large amount of research on this general issue, no one
has examined this using data at the level of the individual plant. As result it
has not been possible, up to this point, to infer the true structure of the
costs that determine how employment reacts to changes in output and wages. This
is regrettable because knowing the nature of these costs would allow us to infer
the probable impacts of policies that could affect adjustment costs such as
advanced notice of layoffs and plant closings, mandatory listing of job
vacancies, and others. This research is important because it should increase our
ability to better infer the potential consequences of such policies.
