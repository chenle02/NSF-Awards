******************&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is centered
around issues related to localization type effects for ergodic Schroedinger
operators and the study of anomalous quantum transport in the quasiperiodic and
Anderson model-type settings. It involves the continuing development of non-
perturbative methods for the&lt;br/&gt;proofs of localization and other
properties as well as studying phenomena that demonstrate the limitations of
non-perturbative results. Another major goal is the development of methods to
study anomalous quantum transport to be applied to both deterministic and random
potentials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our research concerns the anomalous spectral
and diffusive properties of quasiperiodic and other deterministic and random
structures. This is therefore research on the fundamental properties of
disordered systems that serve as models of systems with impurities.
Deterministic ergodic,&lt;br/&gt;particularly quasiperiodic, potentials are
often used to model quasicrystals. Study of the spectral and quantum transport
properties of the microscopic models is important to understand and interpret
much of the experimental data on quasicrystals. Such understanding may lead to
finding new materials with desired physical properties. Disordered systems are
also used in modeling many other micro and macro effects: from quantum
localization to earthquakes. The proposed topics include studying properties of
both highly and weakly disordered systems of Quantum Mechanics that demonstrate
certain anomalous behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
