This award supports a conference entitled: "Workshop on Crystals and Hodge
Theory". The workshop will be held during March 1993, in Berkeley, CA. The
workshop will be concerned with recent results in crystalline cohomology and
Hodge theory, covering both geometric and arithmetic applications, as well as
fundamental results about "abstract" variations of Hodge structures and
crystals. The special emphasis will be on the unity between the two fields.
