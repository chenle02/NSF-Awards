The proposed collaboration between PI O'Rourke, University of Utah, and PI's
Crawford and West, University of Kansas, is to continue interdisciplinary
research on Aleut populations through genetics, archaeology, and cultural
anthropological methods. The proposed research builds on a previous project in
the Aleutians looking at mtDNA in both modern and ancient populations. This
project proposes to expand on the previous research with increased sampling and
analysis of Y-chromosome polymorphisms. The research will
potentially&lt;br/&gt;bring greater scientific understanding of the nature of
the evolutionary relationships between prehistoric and modern Aleuts and other
North American and Siberian groups. In addition, it will provide new insights
into the question of the origins of the modern Aleut population specifically and
potentially the original colonization of the Americas.
