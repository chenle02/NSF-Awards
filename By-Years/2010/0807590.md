This planning grant is being used to assess the needs and misconceptions of K-12
language and social studies teachers with respect to communicating about climate
change science and its impacts. The University of Wisconsin Madison's
Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies (CIMSS) will convene
a group of 25 elementary and non-science teachers in a Teacher Summit on Climate
Education to identify appropriate resources and delivery mechanisms that help
promote climate literacy among such educators. Of particular interest is how to
use, and make more accessible to audiences at this level, information provided
in the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Summary for Policy
Makers report. By explaining the science behind the study to a wide range of
educators, more teachers will be able to accurately answer student queries,
which will raise science literacy.
