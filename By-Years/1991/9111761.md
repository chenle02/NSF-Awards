The objective of this project is to develop a further understanding of the
biology of the vascular wall so as to provide guidance for the development of
tissue-engineered vascular grafts for the bypass and replacement of diseased
vessels. This will be done by reconstituting a blood vessel in a laminar
pulstile flow system. A key question to be answered is whether cell-cell
interactions, i.e. between endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells,
are required to create a blood vessel with functional integrity, particularly in
regard to its endothelium. The significance of this project is in its
representing a further engineering of the in vitro environment so as to make it
more physiologic, and in its contributing to our understanding of those factors
necessary to achieve a normally functioning blood vessel. This is important
whether it be for vascular biology studies in cell culture or for the
development of vascular prostheses, either hybrid grafts or living blood vessel
equivalents.
