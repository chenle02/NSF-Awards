This research will investigate the transport properties, in particular ionic
conductivity, of gel-derived alkali silicate materials. This investigation lies
at the interface between chemistry and materials science. High ionic
conductivity requires high alkali concentrations. The sol-gel process involving
alkoxides and salts is one way of incorporating high concentrations of alkali
into silicates. The sol-gel process is a low temperature approach to glass
formation, where a mixture of alkoxides is allowed to hydrolyze and polymerize
to form an oxide network. The oxide network condenses in the presence of the
solvent which can be removed from the pores by natural evaporation. The
microporous gel which remains after drying is called a xerogel. Preliminary
studies show that the microporosity has an effect on transport properties and,
consequently, ionic conductivity. Three aspects of xerogels affecting transport
properties are being investigated: 1) the effect of microporosity and pore size,
2) the contribution of proton conductivity, and 3) effect of phase separation in
a microporous solid. Principle instrumentation for this project includes complex
impedance spectroscopy, nitrogen sorption analysis, Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy and solid state magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic spectroscopy.
