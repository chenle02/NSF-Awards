The main theme of the proposed research will be the linear and asymptotic
stability of special solutions (waves) of a wide class of partial differential
equations. In a series of recent works, the PI and collaborators have
characterized the linear stability of travelling and standing waves for second
order in time equations and systems. Such results provide necessary information
for the asymptotic stability of the same waves. The PI and collaborators will
build on their previous work to show asymptotic stability of standing waves for
the following models: the Klein-Gordon equation, the sine Gordon equation and
the Dirac equation. A second goal of the proposal is to study the existence and
stability of coherent structures, arising in spatially discrete models. More
concretely, the project will deal, among other things, with Hertzian granular
chains/crystals and the discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger
equation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project deals with nonlinear dispersive
equations, which model wavelike behavior of important physical processes.
Important class of problems under consideration include the propagation of light
in optical waveguides, motion of quantum particles, the mechanics of fluids to
mention a few. The overarching theme of the investigation will be the stability
of coherent configuration - that is, if one is initially close to such coherent
structure, does it stay close to it forever? The mathematical formulation of
such problems, as well as their analysis and predictions about their long time
behavior will greatly enhance our understanding of these and related processes.
