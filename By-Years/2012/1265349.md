The objective of this project is to accelerate the discovery and development of
small molecule therapeutics that delay aging and could be used in the treatment
of age-related diseases. To this end, researchers are developing a process that
allows them to quickly identify candidate anti-aging compounds based on their
effects on cell division parameters. Researchers then evaluate the ability of
these compounds to delay aging of single-celled and invertebrate model
organisms. Other approaches to identify compounds that delay aging focus on
modulation of gene products implicated in aging. The approach used through this
work selects compounds for further study based on their effects on cell
division. This process may be more unbiased and may allow for a much quicker
evaluation of candidate therapeutics. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Building on
previous research, this project, if successful, plans to develop technology and
products to applications that could benefit society. Current approaches to treat
age-related pathologies are frequently disease-specific. The approach used in
this project is designed to modulate the aging process itself, potentially
influencing the outcome of diseases for which age is a key risk factor.
