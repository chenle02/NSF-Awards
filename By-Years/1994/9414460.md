ABSTRACT CTS-9414460 Rutgers University P.I.: Fernando Muzzio Improved design
and control of industrial mixing operations could lead to the prevention of
large amounts of waste. Progress in the past has been hindered by the lack of
quantitative descriptions of mixing processes. The work conducted under this
grant will consist of closely integrated experiments and direct numerical
simulations. The goal is to obtain a full description of the fluid mechanics in
mixing processes, generating explicit information that can subsequently be used
to optimize the performance of a reactive system. Chaotic flows will be used as
the starting point. Initially work will be focused on the partitioned pipe
mixer, which consists of a static set of planes located inside a pipe. Reactive
mixing experiments and computations will be conducted to investigate the effects
of different mixing regimes on product distribution and waste production in
industrially relevant reactions. Over the course of this work, studies will be
conducted both for low and high Reynolds number cases.
