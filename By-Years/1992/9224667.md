Boshernitzan will continue his work in ergodic theory and combinatorial number
theory. He will study the homogenous ergodicity property that dynamical systems
may satisfy, pseudo- Anosof interval exchange maps, alpha-rotations with alpha
having bounded partial quotients, and symbolic flows coming from substitutions.
The study will lead to quantitative estimates on how well the orbits of the
above mentioned dynamical systems are uniformly distributed. This project
involves research in ergodic theory. Ergodic theory in general concerns
understanding the average behavior of systems whose dynamics is too complicated
or chaotic to be followed in microscopic detail. Under the heading "dynamics can
be placed the modern theory of how groups of abstract transformations act on
smooth spaces. In this way ergodic theory makes contact with geometry in its
quest to classify flows on homogeneous spaces.
