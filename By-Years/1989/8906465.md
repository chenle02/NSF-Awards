This proposal requests a real time mass monitor for the measurement of particles
from a model combustor. The particle mass monitor is to be coupled to a halogen-
specific detector for the analysis of organochlorine compounds, in particular
polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans
(PCDF). There is evidence that the formation of PCDD/PCDF may occur
heterogeneously and may be catalyzed over fly ash. Rate data for these
complicated reactions are virtually nonexistent. A (almost) real time mass
monitor would measure particles coming off the combustor (soot, fly ash) and
enable the determination of mass rate of particle accumulation, total particle
mass, and particle concentrations. If one or more of these measures correlate
with levels of PCDD/PCDF or their precursors, a better understanding of the
heterogeneous processes leading to their formation may be obtained. The
equipment purchased will complement and greatly expand the capability to perform
quantitative experiments aimed at understanding the formation of PCDD's and
PCDF's from the combustion of chlorine containing fuels. A better understanding
of the conditions under which PCDD and PCDF are formed is vital for meaningful
incinerator design improvements that minimize their emission to the atmosphere.
