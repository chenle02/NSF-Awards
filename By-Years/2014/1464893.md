Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis
program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Carol M. Taylor of Louisiana State
University is developing approaches to the microbisporicins, a family of potent
antibiotics with considerable therapeutic potential. As these compounds are
entering clinical trials, the research addresses the issue of producing large
quantities of lantibiotic drugs and providing unambiguous details of their
structure. As an educator, Professor Taylor is producing a compendium of
experimental demonstrations for use in large introductory organic chemistry
classes. These lecture demonstrations illustrate important organic chemistry
concepts that facilitate understanding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The studies on the
synthesis of the microbisporicins embrace a number of strategies that capitalize
on the sulfur-rich nature of these compounds. Specifically, the issues addressed
in the proposal are the construction of the C-terminal Z-amino-vinylcysteine
motif and a reductive desulfurization approach to form thioether bridges. The
approach is independent of microorganisms and their enzymes and offers the
potential for a highly convergent approach to the microbisporicins and analogs.
The strategy has broad application in lantibiotic synthesis.
