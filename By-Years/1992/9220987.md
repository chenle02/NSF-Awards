This award establishes a prototype Internet connection for Cooperative
Extension Service (CES) offices in Arkansas. The installation includes a router,
line, modem bank and modems for six extension offices. The extension offices
will reach the Internet connection over toll-free lines. This initial
installation allows testing of the hardware and software, as well as
determination of the training and support requirements. Future phases will
expand the network to the almost three hundred CES agents in the State, who will
use the Internet connection to access databases and other information resources
to allow them to respond more quickly to their clients' information requests.
