*** 9710613 Bryant This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
project will continue the Phase I effort that investigated the
microencapsulation of phase change materials (PCMs) in a form stable enough to
withstand the melt spinning process, with special emphasis on capsules with mean
particle size less than 10 microns. Phase II will include: (a) investigating dry
heat stability of capsules in air, (b) identifying the nature of effluent
materials given off with heat, ( c) optimizing the microencapsulation process
and investigating process scale-up; (d) demonstrating the incorporation of
microcapsules into the major melt-spun fibers, and (e) evaluating spinning
performance and fiber properties. Phase II is anticipated to produce micro-PCMs
on a scale suitable for prototype spinning of melt spun fiber for conversion
into apparel and other articles The commercial applications of melt-spun fibers
and fabrics with enhanced thermal energy storage capabilities is expected in the
apparel and industrial insulation markets, where controlled protection in hot or
cold thermal environments is required. ***
