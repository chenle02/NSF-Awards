The etching of silicon compounds by electron beams releases a plasma cloud of
etchant gases such as NF3, CF4, and SF6. These gases interfere with the electron
beam, as they get further excited and broken up by the incoming electrons. Such
process is complicated by the radiative interactions, ionization, and the
participation of admixed gases or substrate atoms. This grant aims at the
elucidation of these overlapping processes by such combined diagnostics
approaches of time-of-flight spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and, if necessary,
laser induced fluorescence. The evolvement of a reliable interaction model would
be extremely useful to the silicon processing industries.
