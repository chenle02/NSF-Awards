The goal of this program is to determine the relationship between supermassive
black hole growth in the centers of galaxies, and the general evolution of the
galaxies in which they reside. The work will comprise a multi-disciplinary
approach to this topic involving a cohesive analysis of observational data and
galaxy simulations to provide the first significant constraints on the
mechanisms driving black hole growth in the local universe. High spatial
resolution integral field spectroscopic observations of a matched sample of
Seyfert and inactive galaxies will be obtained on the world's leading near-
infrared telescopes in both the northern and southern hemispheres. A number of
properties will be examined down to parsec scales in the two subsamples to
identify those that are unique to Seyfert galaxies and are thus likely to be
associated with black hole growth. These include the distribution, kinematics,
and mass of the interstellar medium, the presence of a nuclear stellar disk, and
how this stellar population relates to the nuclear interstellar medium.

Broader impacts include teacher training and participation in the University of
Washington Pre-Major in Astronomy Program (Pre-MAP). This program recruits
incoming students from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in science
and promotes astronomy as an undergraduate major by allowing them to explore the
field in an enriching and supportive environment.
