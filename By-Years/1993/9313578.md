9313578 Lee The objectives of this study are: 1. to develop a scattering theory
for surface waves in anisotropic media, 2. to develop an algorithm for numerical
calculation of the scattered waves fields and to perform direct computational
simulation of the scattering of waves, and 3. to perform physical ultrasonic
experiments to obtain improved insight and understanding of the scattering
mechanisms in anisotropic media. The proposed theoretical approach will be based
on the combination of the Born approximation and the dyadic representation of
the far field Green's function for an anistropic laterally homogeneous half-
space. Physical ultrasonic experiments will be performed to ascertain the
validity of the scattering theory. ***
