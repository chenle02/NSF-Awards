The proposal concerns the investigation of motivic cohomology
of&lt;br/&gt;schemes and its relationships to algebraic K-theory. One part of
the&lt;br/&gt;project proposes an investigation of generically contractible
sheaves.&lt;br/&gt;The investigator intends to use the properties of such
sheaves in&lt;br/&gt;an attempt to show that Grayson motivic cohomology
coincides with &lt;br/&gt;Voevodsky one and hence Graysons construction gives
another&lt;br/&gt;approach to the dvelopment of the motivic spectral
sequence.&lt;br/&gt;Another part of the project concerns the Friedlander-Milnor
Conjecture.&lt;br/&gt;The investigator expects to develop new methods for the
proof&lt;br/&gt;of the rigidity property for homology of the finite
general&lt;br/&gt;linear group. Finally the investigator plans to figure
out&lt;br/&gt;what if anything is missing in the proof of the Bloch-Kato
Conjecture&lt;br/&gt;modulo an arbitrary prime
integer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research proposal is in the area of
mathematics known as&lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry. The objective of algebraic
geometry is to&lt;br/&gt;gain a deep understanding of the geometric properties
of &lt;br/&gt;solutions to polynomial equations -- while everyone sees
&lt;br/&gt;quadratic equations in school, equations of higher degree
or&lt;br/&gt;more variables become much more subtle. Yet,
because&lt;br/&gt;computer and robot computations are inherently
finite&lt;br/&gt;approximations to the continuous "real world,"
understanding&lt;br/&gt;polynomials is vital to such endeavors.
