The Department of Biological Sciences is improving its curriculum by
introducing an interdisciplinary team-taught course, Instrumental Methods for
Biologists. This course corrects a perceived deficiency in the undergraduate
training of biologists with regard to the theory and application of
sophisticated instrumentation. Through the combined use of its existing
facilities and the additional equipment acquired through this project, (and with
valued assistance from the Department of Chemistry), the Biology faculty is
bringing to its majors fresh insights into the principles of electronics, modern
data management, analytical techniques, and physiological monitoring methods.
While the new course, "Instrumental Methods for Biologists" is targeted for
second- or third-year biology majors, chemistry and physics majors also are
invited to enroll in it. Inclusion of this course in the Biology curriculum
provides students with a foundation in the analytical and evaluative techniques
that are focal to their fields of inquiry, thus accelerating their transition
into competent professionals. This course is facilitating the development of
enthusiastic, instrumentation-literate scientists at this university. The
grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal sum obtained from
non-Federal sources.
