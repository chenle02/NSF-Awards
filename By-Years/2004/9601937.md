9601937 Farmer Building on their strong research program on silicon wafer
processing, micromachining, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), electrical
and optical characterization, and related areas over the past eighteen months,
NJIT researchers have investigated specifically the process of bonding ultra-
thin silicon wafers (as thin as 2 micrometers), a product of Virginia
Semiconductor, Inc. (VSI), to virgin and oxidized silicon substrates. This work
has recently culminated in a joint patent application for a bonded structure
using ultra-thin silicon, and a commitment by VSI to supply ultra-thin wafers
for continued research, both on the processes and mechanisms of ultra-thin wafer
bonding, and on MEMS, silicon-on-insulator (SOI) and silicon-on-silicon (SOS)
applications. Through the Academic Research Infrastructure Program, NJIT is
seeking to expand its research efforts in ultra-thin silicon wafer bonding. ***
