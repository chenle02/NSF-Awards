The project focuses on cluster algebras and their relation to the representation
theory of finite-dimensional algebras and combinatorics. Cluster algebras are
commutative algebras with a special combinatorial structure, which are related
to various fields in mathematics and physics. The PI will pursue several
investigations. For general cluster algebras, he plans to prove the positivity
conjecture, which is the oldest unsolved conjecture in the field. For cluster
algebras of surface type, the PI will study the properties of canonical bases
introduced by him and his collaborators. Moreover, he will use the bases to gain
a better understanding of the cluster algebra itself as well as its relationship
with representation theory and Teichmueller theory. The Pi will also study
automorphisms of cluster algebras which will lead to a better comprehension of
the intrinsic symmetries of cluster algebras. The PI will integrate education
and research at several levels. He will organize a graduate summer school on
cluster algebras at the University of Connecticut. The PI will continue to
develop an international network at institutions in Argentina, Canada and the
US, which will allow advanced graduate students and postdocs to go abroad for
two-week long research visits in order to exchange ideas with local researchers.
Moreover, the PI will continue to run the cluster algebra seminar in his
department.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When cluster algebras were introduced by Fomin
and Zelevinsky in 2002, their original motivation came from representation
theory, which is a branch of modern algebra. Studying the symmetries of a model
is often more fruitful than studying the model directly, and representation
theory has found many applications in physics and chemistry as well as in other
mathematical fields. The cluster algebras provide a mathematical framework for
fundamental patterns which occur throughout representation theory. Surprisingly,
these patterns are also observed in various other branches of science which, a
priori, are not related to representation theory. This motivates a further
development of the theory of cluster algebras to which this project will
contribute. &lt;br/&gt;
