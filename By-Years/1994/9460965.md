Cutting tools form the backbone of manufacturing operations for metals,
polymers, and advanced materials such as intermetallics and composites of all
types. Recently, the impetus for manufacturing has increased the focus of many
overseas companies on efficient methods of manufacturing. Hardness and high-
temperature strength of the cutting tools increase with a decrease in WC
particle size and improved dispersion of the hard second phase in the matrix.
Contiguity of the tungsten carbide grains also plays an important role in the
tools' performance. Hence, a variety of methods have been proposed to decrease
the particle size including coprecipitation of tungsten and cobalt and
subsequent carburization. However, these techniques result in the formation of
embrittling (-phase complex carbide thereby resulting in inferior mechanical
properties. In order to solve these problems, Materials Modification Inc.,
proposes the use of a synergistic combination of novel technologies that can be
used to tailor properties in cutting tool inserts so that several of the
problems such as contiguity between WC particles, presence of light elements at
grain boundaries, and non-uniform matrix distribution will be eliminated. Phase
I will concentrate on synthesis, consolidation, and evaluation of properties
while Phase II will focus on further process, optimization, prototype
development, field evaluation, and coordination with major manufacturers for
commercialization of this technology.
