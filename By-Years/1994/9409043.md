The existing evidence on economic literacy among the general population casts
serious doubt on the proposition that personal financial planning is the
consequence of highly sophisticated deliberation, as envisioned in modern
economic theory. Much of the population is ill-equipped to make even the most
basic economic calculations, and few have mastered more advanced concepts such
as compound interest, risk-return tradeoffs, inflation adjustments, or the
difference between actual and actuarially fair insurance premiums, that govern
the tradeoffs at the heart of the life cycle allocation problem. Although it is
conceivable that unsophisticated individuals could act as if they make
reasonably well-informed decisions, this is unlikely in the context of personal
financial planning. Thus, the study of economic literacy, relevant developmental
experiences, and sources of financial information and advice should shed
considerable light on household financial decision making, and should aid in the
design of public policies that are designed to influence these decisions. This
research consists of three parts. Part 1 involves an analysis of data from a new
and unique household survey on demographics, developmental experiences, sources
of financial information/advice, economic knowledge, and current financial
behavior. Data are analyzed to identify and quantify the determinants of
developmental experiences, information sources, knowledge, and financial
decisions. Part 2 involves the design and preliminary analysis of a follow-on
survey. Part 3, which is joint with Jonathan Skinner of the University of
Virginia, involves an empirical analysis of economic vulnerabilities, using the
Panel Study of Income Dynamics. In particular, the study examines the
relationship between consumption trajectories, before and after retirement, and
accumulated wealth, in order to test the hypothesis that the observed decline in
consumption after retirement reflects farsighted planning, against the view that
this decline res ults from inadequate saving.
