Abstract

Proposal: DMS 9803616 Principal Investigator: Naichung Conan Leung

The scope of research covers topics in Gromov-Witten theory, Seiberg-Witten
equations and almost Hermitian-Einstein equations. The proposed project is to
count the number of holomorphic curves on Kahler manifolds with elliptic
fibration in terms of modular forms; study the structure of Einstein four
manifolds using Seiberg-Witten equations and the geometry of Gieseker stable
bundles.

The principal investigator study equations describing different geometric
objects and properties of their moduli spaces.
