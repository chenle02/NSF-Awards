This research aims to address the validity of octanol-water partition
measurements as a basis for estimating the toxicity and distribution of certain
pollutants between biota and surrounding aqueous environment. Sorption of
chlorinated aryl alcohols, products of paper manufacture, onto liposomes is
proposed for a more representative model of biological tissues. Measurements
will be made as a function of concentration, pH and salt concentration. Results
for ionized and un-ionized species will be determined and compared with the
octanol-water partition coefficients. Discrepancies of acid dissociation
constants between the sorbed and free toxins is to be examined. Results from
this research will be helpful in determining the fate of pollutants, estimating
toxicity levels, and in evaluating the use of biomass for the removal of these
types of pollutants.
