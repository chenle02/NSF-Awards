This project will develop mathematical models for the interactions between the
economic stake-holders in the modern power grid. While the electricity market is
becoming decentralized, understanding the underlying market forces in the
presence of fluctuating market conditions and regulations remains inadequate.
Providing higher quality information and modeling aids to decision makers is
crucial in the drive to achieve grid efficiency and enhanced stability. It is
also central to avoiding unintended consequences that have plagued economic
policy-making for the grid and for making effective regulations that incentivize
aligning stakeholder behavior with societal goals, such as climate change
adaptation and investment in new technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
will construct rigorous stochastic models and related numerical algorithms for
quantitative assessment and analysis of how to guide the grid in its "smart"
evolution. The research will address (i) long-term grid evolution, in particular
investment in renewable generation and competition between different producer
sectors; (ii) behavior of electricity prices and related financial contracts in
the new era of deep renewable penetration, micro-grids, and new requirements on
grid stability. The project blends together applied mathematics, game theory,
and control, and extends the reach of stochastics to a key application area. The
project will contribute to inter-disciplinary training in mathematical sciences
at the PhD level and will enhance the exchange of ideas between mathematicians,
operations researchers, engineers, and statisticians.
