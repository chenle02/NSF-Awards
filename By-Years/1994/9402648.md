This project will lead to the development of a technique for measuring the
composition of the neutral atmosphere. A high resolution spectrometer will be
used to measure optical emissions produced by atmospheric species. By combining
these measurements with theoretical models, it is possible to determine neutral
densities and temperatures and a scaling factor for the solar extreme
ultraviolet flux. The spectrometer will measure emissions between 560 and 740
nanometers. The instrument will provide the first measurements from the ground
of several important emissions produced in the mesosphere and thermosphere.
