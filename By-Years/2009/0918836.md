Community Oriented Science Education (COSE) is a three year exploratory project
to develop learning activities, thematically linked by the standards-based
concept of energy transfer, covering about 16 class periods of middle school
science. The activities highlight the fundamental processes and the integrative
nature of 21st Century scientific investigations and are coupled to design-
oriented, project-based experiences that enable students to apply emerging
conceptual understandings while conducting community-oriented investigations in
culturally relevant contexts. The materials provide experience with the concept
of energy as it relates to students' lives, say in operating electronic devices,
while providing understanding of and experience with rigorous scientific
investigation. Students participate in teacher-guided research projects before
executing a student designed and directed research project related to energy and
its uses. Ample opportunity is provided for small group interactions to promote
social construction of knowledge. The project evaluates the prototype materials
designed to promote the development of robust STEM identities of middle school
urban youth in field tests at inner city schools with student populations
representative of the ethnic and socio-economic diversity that typifies many
urban American schools. Materials are assessed on their capacity to affect
student attitudes, interests and achievements in STEM courses, to impact student
abilities to think critically and quantitatively, and to contribute to a
framework on which to base more materials and intervention strategies. In the
field tests, information from students is gathered through the use of SMART
phones and other of digital formats. Learning is assessed through embedded
assessments and performance tasks.
