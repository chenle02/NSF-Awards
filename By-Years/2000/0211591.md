Differences in species composition among insect communities at different sites
(i.e. species turnover, or beta-diversity) are poorly known in tropical
rainforest. This is unfortunate as the patterns of beta-diversity are important
for setting conservation priorities, as well as for our understanding ecological
and evolutionary factors, which generate extraordinary species diversity, found
in tropical ecosystems. This study investigates the beta-diversity of insect
herbivores in lowland rainforests as a product of changes in vegetation and
changes in insect communities feeding on particular host plants. Beta-diversity
will be examined using caterpillars (Lepidoptera) feeding on selected host
plants in New Guinea. Herbivores feeding on rare and wide spread plants will be
compared to test the significance of host plant distribution and specificity for
beta diversity. This project represents one of the most comprehensive studies of
insect beta-diversity in the tropics and one of the first attempts to quantify
beta-diversity of species-rich rainforest communities on a regional scale. In
contrast to previous, largely descriptive studies, it separates and tests the
effects of key factors, viz. host plant distribution and host specificity, in
generating beta-diversity patterns of tropical herbivores. The project also
promotes graduate student training and involves underrepresented Pacific
Islanders in scientific research through parataxonomist training. The proposal
also builds capacity for New Guinean entomology through training of local
students, strengthens a local research station and develops the national insect
collection. Furthermore, results can be applied to developing conservation
strategies for NG and parataxonomists will have additional impacts through
landowner education.
