Research continues on highly automated software tools which produce VLSI-
structured logic designs which are correct by construction. Emphasis in the
research is on synthesis of multilevel Boolean Networks with the following
specific research objectives: satisfy all ;ita priori;ro design rules,
specifications, and constraints whenever possible; and provide a unified theory
of disparate logic synthesis techniques, including 2-level logic minimization
methods, local transformation, don't-care techniques, and others. A longer-range
objective is an investigation of possible applications of these synthesis
techniques at the functional level. The final goal is "silicon compilation,"
i.e., automated synthesis of a given behavioral specification (e.g., system
architecture and instruction set) into specified target layout technologies.
Test cases of complete microprocessor synthesis are studied.
