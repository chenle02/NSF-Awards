The long-term goal of this research is to support established paradigms in
programming language research in order to reduce programming effort and shorten
development time. Constraint logic programming (CLP) is a new class of
programming languages whose basic operation is constraint solving over a
computation domain. CLP languages are best used for combinatorial problems that
often require considerable expertise and development time. Typical examples
include scheduling and formal verification of circuits. CLP languages presently
support partial enumeration (subsuming branch and bound and backtracking) as the
main paradigm. A successful representative of the first generation of these
languages is CHIP which is now widely used in industry (e.g., at Siemens, Bull
and ICL) for tasks like the scheduling of ships in Hong Kong harbor. This
project will develop a second-generation CLP language, extending the support for
combinatorial problems in three directions: 1. Constraint handling: new
reasoning and pruning techniques will be incorporated by providing new primitive
operations such as constraint entailment and new ways of combining primitive
constraints; 2. Execution models: dynamic programming and local search will be
investigated in order to incorporate them into CLP languages; 3. Computation
domains: the project will investigate new application areas such as
computational geometry and parsing where constraints play a fundamental role in
order to identify new computation domains.
