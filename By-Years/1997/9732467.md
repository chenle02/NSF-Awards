The Experimental Physical Chemistry and the Atomic, Molecular and Optical
Physics Programs support William C. Stwalley of the Physics Department at the
University of Connecticut in his continuing spectroscopic studies of diatomic
molecules at long range. In this effort, Prof. Stwalley will collaborate with
Prof. Phillip L. Gould, an expert in collisions of ultracold atoms. They will
investigate the high-resolution photoassociative spectroscopy of ultracold
alkali atoms using all optical multiple resonance spectroscopies. Emphasis will
be on highly excited states of alkali metal diatomics (e.g., potassium or cesium
dimers), but Stwalley and Gould will also attempt to observe photoassociation of
atom-molecules such as Cs-H2. Molecules at long range are molecules in which the
atoms are separated by very large distances, yet attractive forces are still
strong enough to maintain a `molecular` nature. Such molecules are of great
current interest, partly because new effects show up which will extend our
knowledge of molecular potential curves, partly because of their relevance to
the work in laser cooling and trapping and Bose-Einstein condensation. The
studies that will be carried out in this new collaborative effort will greatly
increase our understanding of chemical bonding by revealing the subtle forces
that act to attract and `congeal` atoms separated by large internuclear
distances. Successful completion of these studies will furnish highly detailed
information on interatomic forces which, in turn, are of fundamental importance
to our understanding of atomic collisions and the assembly of atoms into higher
states of aggregation ranging from molecules, to clusters, and on to condensed
phases.
