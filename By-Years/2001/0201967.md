This dissertation research will analyze data from the National Longitudinal
Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) to examine the impact of friendships on
mental health. The principal outcome studied is the one-year change in high
school students' scores on standard depression scales. Positive mental health
changes are hypothesized to result from higher prior levels of integration into
friendship networks and improvements in those friendship networks. Special
attention will be paid to how friendship networks may explain different levels
of mental health for minority adolescents. School characteristics such as school
size and urban location will be studied both for their direct effect on mental
health and how friendship networks may affect mental health differently in
different contexts. &lt;br/&gt;
