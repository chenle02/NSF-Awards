Project Summary Zirin/9320822 This proposal will provide a new instrument, the
spectro- magnetograph, to Big Bear Solar Observatory to measure the strength of
quiet Sun magnetic fields as well as weak pores and "invisible spots." This
instrument will also provide a definitive measure of weaker solar fields,
emerging flux, the polar fields, and other features. The PIs will study their
extensive data on quiet Sun magnetic fields to determine their formation and
evolution, and continue their joint studies of the magnetic features responsible
for X-ray bright points.
