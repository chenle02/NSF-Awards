93-53653 Ballinger Nebraska EPSCoR Experimental Systemic Initiative This
proposal outlines several specific initiatives that will support the Nebraska
EPSCoR office's efforts to promote increased competitiveness in the research
programs of faculty of the four academic research institutions in Nebraska. The
projects are grouped into three general areas of activity including travel
associated with grant or collaborative research opportunities, disciplinary
research conferences, and educational programs to increase the number of women
and minorities in science disciplines. Travel programs involve opportunities for
junior faculty to visit program officers in federal agencies and to explore
collaborative research opportunities in national research labs and industry.
Conferences include an international conference in atomic collisions physics, an
intrastate conference in regulatory peptide research, and possibly an additional
intrastate conference to stimulate increased collaboration among scientists of
the state's four research universities. Educational programs are focused on
engineering and biomedical science at the pre-college level, biochemistry at the
college level, and water science at the graduate level.
