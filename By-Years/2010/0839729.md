This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will investigate the
feasibility of growth of high quality, low cost bulk gallium nitride substrates
by the high pressure ammonothermal method. The proposed approach utilizes a
novel apparatus which is scalable to process volumes of hundreds of liters at
modest cost.

If successful this project will dramatically reduce the cost of GaN substrates
for use in optoelectronics and energy conversion devices.
