This is a proposal that aims to study the sizes of solutions to (families of)
topological problems with respect to various norms. The purely metric aspect of
this goes under the name of "controlled topology" and has had numerous
applications to topological rigidity, stratified spaces (especially orbifolds),
and homology manifolds and these will continue to be studied. However, other
norms involving fewer or more derivatives are important for applications to
analysis (especially variational problems) and differential geometry (e.g.
systoles) --- these will be studied simultaneously with their applications.

In general, topology, when applied traditionally, has been used mainly as a
qualitative tool. However, it is possible to mix topological ideas with analytic
ones, and fashion tools that measure not only whether things are possible or
impossible, but rather how difficult they are. In so doing, topology makes
contact with other branches of mathematics: notably analysis and probability. It
is hoped that this will thereby enrich all these fields.
