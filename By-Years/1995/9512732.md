9512732 Cvetic This proposal encompasses the study of theoretical elementary
particle physics including theories of supersymmetric gravity. Supersymmetry is
an invariance which relates bosons and fermions. Solutions of these theories
describing black holes will be investigated, and the general framework of
supergravity theories will be analyzed. ***
