The intrinsic and extrinsic chaotic dynamics of simple Coulomb systems is
studied using classical transport theory based on a Langevin equation.
Extensions to include quantum mechanical effects are planned to delineate the
domain of applicability of the classical description. Molecular dynamics using
an equation of motion approach is used to investigate the eigenvalue spectrum of
irregular quantum systems and will be applied to study resonance phenomena.
Finally, a semiclassical and quantum mechanical study of highly excited
resonances in He-like systems will be initiated to examine the positions and
widths of resonances and their decay modes and branching ratios.
