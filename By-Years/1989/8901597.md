Professor Blum is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to perform theoretical studies of the thermodynamic properties
of ionic solutions. Since many chemical reactions involve ionic species in
solution, an improved theory of ionic behavior is an important first step in
understanding chemical reactions in solution and at electrode surfaces.
Professor Blum will employ the scaling properties of the Mean Spherical
Approximation introduced in the Ornstein Zernike theory of ionic solutions. This
theory is one of a class of theories which is based on integral equations
involving pair correlation functions. One of the concepts to be developed is
that of the electric microfield which is the local fluctuating electric field as
seen by an ion or molecule in solution. This quantity plays a central role in
the theory of chemical kinetics and spectroscopy of ions in solution.
