Most materials exhibit slow fluctuations, with a broad distribution of
characteristic rates, in a variety of electrical, mechanical, magnetic, and
optical parameters. Despite the ubiquity of a simple form (1/f) for the
frequency spectrum of such fluctuations, a wide variety of mechanisms are
involved, as has been demonstrated in past experiments. These fluctuations are
of interest for two general reasons. First, they limit the performance of a
variety of sensors and devices. Second, they provide a useful tool to study
fundamental properties of materials, especially the poorly understood types of
materials known as glasses, which exhibit partially frozen random structures.
They are using electrical, optical and magnetic fluctuation techniques to
investigate ordinary glasses, glassy metals, spin glasses, magnetic materials
with random domain structures, and other systems. Their particular focus is on
how frozen random structures emerge from fluid random structures as temperature
is lowered, and on what type of unfrozen modes remain at very low temperatures.
