The objective of this project is to conduct a quantitative study of dynamic
capillary effects throughout the hysteretic capillary pressure-saturation
relationship using a combination of experimental techniques. The hypothesis is
that dynamic capillary effects vary with saturation, wetting/drying path, and
fluid and porous media properties, and that the relationships are dictated by
the magnitude of the response of the ratio between capillary and viscous forces
to changing velocity. This hypothesis will be evaluated through direct
measurement of the dynamic capillary pressure coefficient, Ã´, throughout the
hysteretic capillary pressure-saturation (Pc - S) relationship. Experiments will
make use of custom-designed membrane-based fluid-selective pore pressure micro-
sensors, coupled with a method for rapid measurement of hysteretic (Pc - S)
relationships. A collaborative modeling effort using the CompSim 3-D multiphase
flow model will use the results of experimental measurements to explore the
potential impacts of dynamic effects in large-scale systems.
