In the study of local rings of equicharacteristic p, the tight closure has
proved very useful. This closure also extends nicely to local rings of
equicharacteristic zero. Unfortunately this closure does not naturally extend to
mixed characteristic rings. This project is designed to fill this void. In
earlier work, the principal investigator defined several variants of an extended
plus closure. As the name suggests, these closures, which coincide with tight
closure in equicharacteristic p, are based upon the plus closure of an ideal,
the set of elements which are in the extension of the ideal in some integral
extension of the original ring. In the earlier work, a number of properties of
these closures were demonstrated. Most notably, the principal investigator has
demonstrated that the colon-capturing property implies that ideals in regular
rings are closed and also that the colon-capturing property does in fact hold in
dimension three. Hence the Direct Summand Conjecture is a theorem in dimension
three. A key objective of the current project is to extend these results to
dimension four and above. A completely successful program would establish that
one of these extended plus closures - or a close relative - satisfies all of the
requirements suggested by Huneke for a mixed characteristic analog of tight
closure. It would also determine whether or not three particular rings of
interest are Cohen-Macaulay. The most compelling of the three is the absolute
integral closure of a complete mixed characteristic local domain of dimension
three. For equicharacteristic complete local domains and all complete local
domains of dimension not equal to three, the answer is already known.

One of the most fundamental subjects in algebra is the understanding of the
concepts of ideals and modules in local rings. For those local rings which
contain a field, the notion of tight closure has evolved as a way to give a
unified presentation - and a simplified one - for many of the known properties
of these objects. As a natural byproduct, it has led to the discovery of new
properties. Understanding of local rings which do not contain a field has always
lagged behind. The principal investigator has proposed several closely related
and promising candidates to play the role of tight closure in the alternate
setting. These candidates have already led to one significant new result. In
this project, the investigator will continue his efforts to determine which is
the best candidate and to what extent the new closures fill the void.
