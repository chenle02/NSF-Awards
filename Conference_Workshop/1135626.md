This grant provides funds to support twelve U.S.-based young researchers to
participate as speakers in the special sessions and plenary lectures at the
Twelfth Asian Logic Conference, to be held December 15-20, 2011 at Victoria
University of Wellington, New Zealand, one the major centers of logic in the
world. All but one of those for whom funds are sought have either very limited
or no other means of travel support. The biannual Asian Logic Conference is one
of the most important meetings in logic outside of North America, and this the
first time it will be held outside of continental Asia. The program includes
areas of great current interest (Algorithmic randomness, Logical Aspects of
Graphs and Matroids, Modal Logic, Set Theory) and speakers include leading world
experts. This event provides an important platform for young researchers to
present their work on a world stage and presents excellent opportunities for
young U.S. based researchers to make strategic contacts in the Asia-Pacific
region.
