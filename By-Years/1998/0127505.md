Computer Science (31) This project develops a virtual testbed that allows for
providing hands-on experience to large numbers of students together with the
course material for an introductory course on embedded systems programming. The
key feature is to couple a PC with an embedded processor board and to simulate a
variety of external electromechanical devices thereby alleviating the need to
provide expensive, maintenance prone physical devices in large numbers. Requests
of devices by user programs running on the embedded processor are transparently
forwarded to the simulators on the PC. Using software instruments such as
voltmeters and scopes, students experience hands-on programming while the
institution experiences a low-cost low-maintenance laboratory.

The course material being developed applies to an introductory course in
embedded systems programming and consists of a sequence of modules, each of
which is centered on a small programming project. All materials are web-based to
allow for broad dissemination and possible distance learning.
