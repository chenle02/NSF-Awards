This action funds U Kei Cheang of Drexel University to conduct a research
project, entitled "Investigation of microswimming in biological fluid
environment," during the summer of 2012 at Ewha University in Seoul and Hanyang
University in Seoul. The host scientists are Professor Sungsu Park and Professor
Jaebum Choo.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is the understanding of the
effects and relative importance of the many interactions influencing microbial
transport in complex biomaterials. This is a challenging problem requiring a
unique and innovative approach combining fluid mechanics, solid mechanics,
microbiology, microfabrication, and digital image processing. The results of
this work promise to establish the base of knowledge needed to properly
understand microbial locomotion in a variety biological, health, environmental,
and agricultural scenarios. In addition, the proposed work has the potential to
transform understanding of locomotion and propulsion in realistic environments.
Complex media affect microbial roles in infection, fertility, ecology, and
environmental applications (such as bioremediation of pollutants and drinking
water contamination). Demonstration of artificial bacteria control in synthetic
bio-environment and establishing biological relevance through live cell
comparison could have great impact on biology and engineering.

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
