Every student of elementary mathematics knows that if a quantity is multiplied
each period by a positive number x, the result will evolve geometrically with
the number of periods n as xn. It is not much harder to show that if instead,
the period multiplying factors Xk are identically distributed positive random
variables, the result will tend to evolve according to ean where a = E(lnx1),
although it will fluctuate from this value. This is the basis of the famous
Kelly result used in investment theory. A major (and deep) generalization of
this result due to Bellman is that if a vector is repeatedly multiplied by
positive random matrices Xk, each component of the results evolves as ena,
although a is hard to compute. This major result of Bellman's has been
fruitfully applied to many random systems, including those in biology, inventory
control, and population dynmics. It can also be applied in investment problems,
including problems of industrial investment, which is our primary interest. In
many of the most important situations a vector is transformed by random
nonlinear mappings Hk. It might seem impossible to characterize the long term
result in this case. However, we have extended Bellman's result to the nonlinear
case-obtaining virtually the same conclusion concerning growth. This deep result
opens the door to many interesting applications. In this project we propose to
further the theory of these processes, apply the results to interesting and
important investment problems, and develop effective computational methods for
computing the relevant quantities.
