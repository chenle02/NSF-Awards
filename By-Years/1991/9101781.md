This award supports a collaboration to make high energy gamma ray observations
in the Southern Hemisphere between Dr. Trevor C. Weekes of the Smithsonian-
Astrophysics Observatory and Dr. Jorge Sahade and Dr. Hugo Levato both of La
Plata University in Argentina. They will explore the Galaxy's emission at all
energies, and establish a TeV observatory in the southern hemisphere. Sensitive
ground-based observations of some of the Galaxy can only be made from the
southern hemisphere. No such facility now exists. The proposed Argentine
observing site will be an excellent one for the purpose. The U.S. program in
gamma ray astronomy will be benefitted by the proposed research in that TeV
observations of the Galaxy will be conducted at a sensitivity not feasible from
within the U.S. It is clear that this will be a genuinely cooperative piece of
research, beneficial not only to the U.S., but to Argentine astrophysicists as
well. The latter will be trained in a technique that is new to them, work with
modern equipment and will do most of the actual observing. Further, a good
working relationship will be furthered between the U.S. and Argentine
communities in high energy astronomy.
