This study has three primary objectives: l) to continue studies on the structure
and organization of the RNA of sonchus yellow net virus (SYNV), a plant
rhabdovirus; 2) to infect tobacco protoplasts with SYNV so that kinetics and
subcellular location of the viral specific RNAs and proteins can be investigated
during synchronous replication; and 3) to isolate a transcriptase from infected
protoplasts. Completion of objective l will provide a precise description of the
genome of a plant rhabdovirus that can be used to compare its structure,
function, and evolution with related animal rhabdoviruses. Infection of
protoplasts with SYNV (Objective 2) will allow analysis of the kinetics of
synthesis of SYNV RNAs and proteins at defined stages of replication and will
permit investigation of their association with host polypeptides and cytopathic
structures that appear during infection. Isolation of a transcriptase complex
(Objective 3) from infected protoplasts will facilitate in vitro studies of the
functions of viral specific components and the requirement for host factors
during transcription of messenger RNAs and replication of SYNV RNA.
