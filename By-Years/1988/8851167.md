A Pneumatic Automation Simulator is developed using pneumatic and electro-
pneumatic elements in the Industrial Engineering Laboratory at this institution.
The simulator is used primarily in the manufacturing oriented engineering
courses. It provides practical instruction to students in the design, test, and
microcomputer control of pneumatic circuits that generate several of the
automation functions used in manufacturing methods and assembly systems. The
most common functions in the circuit designs are work clamping, release and/or
ejection, orientation, work sequencing and delay. This instructional facility
also acts as an independent setup for student projects and attracts industry
collaboration with the institution in the continuing education of their
engineers in the use of pneumatic automation systems. This award is being
matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
