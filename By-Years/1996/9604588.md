This research group at Penn State University requests support to continue their
participation in an international collaboration known as ZEUS at DESY in
Hamburg, Germany. The machine known as HERA collides, at high energy, electrons
and protons. As the electrons and their interactions are well understood, such
an experiment serves as a super electron-microscope that can explore structures
related to the proton. Such investigations have led to many discoveries in the
past, and also can predict certain aspects of proton-(anti) proton collisions,
necessary to understand new phenomena observed in those interactions.
