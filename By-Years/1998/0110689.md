TECHNICAL: The project is aimed at the structural characterization of the
catalytic element of VS RNA, an 881 nucleotide, single-stranded plasmid present
in the mitochondria of certain natural strains of Neurospora. Most ribozymes
recognize a complimentary single-stranded RNA through Watson-Crick base pairing;
however, the VS ribozyme recognizes its substrate primarily through tertiary
interactions. How this recognition occurs is not well understood, and it is
clear that more structural information is needed to augment the wealth of
biochemical data currently available. Due to the size of the VS ribozyme (~154
nucleotides) the project uses a modular approach. Initially the structures of
isolated domains of the RNA, stem-loops as well as helix junctions, will be
determined using standard NMR methodology. These structures and resonance
assignments will then serve as starting points for the analysis of their
conformation as part of the intact ribozyme using a combination of recently
developed NMR techniques and specific/segmental labeling strategies. The results
from these experiments will provide insight into how RNA tertiary structure
influences the secondary structure of the building blocks and provide
information about the domain structures in the functional ribozyme. In the last
phase of the project residual dipolar couplings and information form other
sources (NOEs, FRET studies, etc.) will be used to determine the global
structure and cleavage mechanism of a functional ribozyme.

NON-TECHNICAL: Ribozymes are RNA molecules with the capability to catalyze
chemical reactions. This research is aimed at the structure determination of one
such system: The Neurospora VS ribozyme. Multidimensional NMR spectroscopy will
be used as the main tool to determine first the structures of isolated domains
and then the global structure of the molecule. The information derived from the
structures will provide insights into how RNA catalysis works on the molecular
level.
