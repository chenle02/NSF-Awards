The goal of this collaborative proposal between the University of California at
Santa Cruz and Duke University is the definition of features for recognition and
classification of objects in imagery. Feature vectors are enriched and made
invariant at the same time by an efficient, probabilistic coding of the feature-
space manifolds that are obtained when features undergo all possible
transformations in a predefined class. This coding is designed to circumvent the
curse of dimensionality by reducing the representation requirements to the two
properties that are essential for recognition and classification, that is,
uniqueness and continuity. Uniqueness requires different manifolds to be coded
differently, while continuity requires similar codings for similar
manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theoretical and empirical investigations will
study optimal feature design, the performance of these features with various
classification and recognition methods, and the trade-off of computational
efficiency and performance. Misclassification rates for families of features and
transformations will also be measured, both by theoretical bounds and empirical
tests. The behavior of the proposed representations will be examined in the
presence of clutter and data corruptions such as occlusions. These concepts will
be tested through their application to the automatic diagnosis of colon cancer
from computerized tomography scans, and to the interpretation of American sign
language from video sequences. &lt;br/&gt;
