9401807 Borthwick The long term goal of this project is to understand the
algebraic structure and the geometry of non-commutative spaces obtained through
deformization quantization. Many examples of such spaces have been constructed
using the Berezin-Toeplitz quantization. The investigator plans to construct
Fredholm modules for these quantized spaces and so compute their Chern
characters. It will then be possible to investigate how the quantum Chern
character relates to that of the original manifold in the semiclassical limit.
The investigator further intends to construct the unitary representations of the
quantum algebras by finding generators and relations and then to study the
connection between these representations and the geometry of the original
manifold. This project lies at the interface between geometry, analysis and
algebras. A modern approach of Connes studies geometrical invariants using non-
commutative algebraic structures. These structures have been explicitly realized
only in a few cases. The completion of this project will provide new explicit
examples of this non-commutative geometry. The mathematical benefit will be in
knowing explicit geometric invariants. ***
