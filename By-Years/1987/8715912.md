The 28th Meeting of the International Geological Congress will be held in
Washington, DC, July 9-19, 1989. This prestigeous meeting will attract several
thousand earth scientists, many from third world countries in addition to those
from Europe, Japan and other developed countries. This action provides funds to
the operating committtee, incorporated as the 28th International Geological
Congress, Inc., for expenses in excess of registration and other expected
income. This grant includes funds transferred to NSF from other government
agencies for this purpose. The earth sciences community of the United States
will benefit from a strong and successful meeting of this scope and stature,
both from direct exchange of knowledge and from the favorable exposure a
successful and well-attended meeting will provide.
