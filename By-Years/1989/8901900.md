This project is concerned with the development of intermediate-cost workstation
computing environment to enhance productivity of scientists dealing with
amorphous object visualizations. The major emphasis is on the graphical and
analytical analysis of computer generated data to gain both quantitative and
qualitative understanding of the underlying structure.
