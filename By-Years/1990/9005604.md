The Theoretical Intermediate Energy (Nuclear/Particle) Physics Group was
established in 1987 through a Research Improvement in Minority Institutions
(RIMI) grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF). The grant period will
end in the summer of 1990. Funds are sought for the continuation of this group;
however, now the structure will include nuclear experimentalists and will be
known as the Nuclear Physics Group of which the theory group is a part. The
Nuclear Physics Group will serve as an umbrella for both theory and experimental
Intermediate (Medium) Energy physics grant support from all funding sources.
This structure will eventually lead to application for a NSF Minority Center of
Excellence grant, for example. Funds to support one Research Assistant
Professor, one graduate student, one part time Nuclear Physics Group
Administrative Assistant (the other part of this salary has been included in an
NSF nuclear experimental proposal submitted through Hampton University), and the
Principal Investigator are requested.
