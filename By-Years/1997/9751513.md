This department is developing a Science Mentoring Networked Classroom (SMNC)
that combines state-of-the-art instructional technology with a mentoring
pedagogy to create what is arguably the most effective science learning
environment in the Nation. This facility brings real-world phenomena into
lecture and laboratory settings. This process is implemented by the ability of
the networked computers to enhance discussion and the sharing of ideas. The
SMNC, devoted to a specific suite of science courses, is affecting every
student. It could potentially revolutionize the way science is learned not only
here, but at the high schools, colleges, and universities that adopt this unique
approach to teaching. *
