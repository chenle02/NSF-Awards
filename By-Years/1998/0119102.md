&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific exploration of vision and particularly
color vision has its historical roots as far back as the eighteenth century,
when scientists such as Dalton and Young attempted to explain color vision and
color blindness. Color vision allows an animal to make distinctions based on
chromatic information rather than luminosity. Color vision helps an animal
identify important objects in their environment The study color vision in
aquatic mammals provides an unique opportunity to examine the adaptation of the
mammalian visual system to the unique properties of an aquatic visual envirom-
nent. We have recently demonstrated that the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops
truncatus) lacks the common cone-based dichromatic form of color vision typical
of most terrestrial mammals. This is an exciting finding, and it is the
beginning of a comprehensive molecular study of the visual pigments of aquatic
mammals for two different mammalian orders and one suborder (whales, seals and
manatees) have independently adapted to life in an aquatic environment. This
research project will determine if all aquatic mammals: Cetacea, Pinnipedia and
Sirenia have a visual system similar to that of the dolphin and express only two
spectrally distinct classes of visual pigments: one rhodopsin and one cone
pigment and hence lack typical mammalian dichromatic color vision. This
comparative study of color vision in aquatic mammals will examine the adaptive
processes that occurred as these distinct orders and suborder of mammals with
different terrestrial ancestors moved from a land to an aquatic
environment.&lt;br/&gt;This research project will allow my laboratory to
continue to successfully train both women and minority science students. Of the
ten minority and women undergraduates who have worked in my laboratory, two are
enrolled in MD/Ph.D. programs, five are currently in graduate school and two are
in medical school.&lt;br/&gt;
