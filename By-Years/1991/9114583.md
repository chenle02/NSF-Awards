An experimental study of the single crystal constitutive equations and
polycrystal behavior will be carried out with emphasis on the determination of
grain interaction in the behavior of polycrystalline aggregates. This will be
achieved by measurements of the local finite plastic deformation in each grain,
as well as global finite plastic deformation of the polycrystal. Compression,
tension and biaxial compression experiments will be performed on polycrystals
with very large grain size (4-12 mm), thus making it possible to determine local
deformation in each grains. Material and lattice rotations will be measured
using marked grid or small strain gage rosettes and x-ray diffraction technique,
respectively. Test samples will be made from very high purity aluminum and each
sample may contain twenty to thirty grains in order to obtain a representative
polycrystal behavior. Experiments will also be performed on polycrystals (with
regular or normal grain size) in order to determine better constitutive models
for finite plastic deformation of these solids.
