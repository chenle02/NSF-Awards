Atmospheric particulate matter has the potential to impact visibility, radiative
balance, and health. This project will develop instruments to qualify the
character of ambient atmospheric particulate matter with diameters less than 2.5
micrometers, particularly semi-volatile and carbonaceous components. Two
instruments will be developed and validated, and they will be subject to a
preliminary, local field test near the end of the project. The instruments
include a modified, commercially-available, optical instrument based on removal
of gas-phase species with a denuder, filtration of particulates and measurement
following thermal desorption from the filter, and one based on fiber membrane
sampling with gas chromatography/ion-trap mass spectrometry species
quantification. The organic and elemental carbon fractions of particulate matter
will be determined using the former instrument with 1-hour time resolution (an
improvement over the commonly employed 12- to 24-hour resolution measurements),
while marker organic compounds for specific emission sources will be quantified
with the latter instrument. The project will involve the use of a controlled
chamber to identify the marker compounds and to validate the performance of the
instruments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this project include new
instrumentation for atmospheric chemistry research available for use by
interested members of the community. There will be significant involvement of a
post-doctoral fellow, and several graduate and undergraduate students in its
execution. Through better quantification of the organic content of particulate
matter, particularly through measurement of specific compounds, better policy
decisions regarding mitigation measures can be made, and more quantitative
assessment of impacts of particulate matter of societal concern is possible.
