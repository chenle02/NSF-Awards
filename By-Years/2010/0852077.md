Abstract

Proposal:

Dissolved Organic Matter in the Arctic: What Does it Look Like, Why Does it
Matter?

P.I.:

Claudia M. Boot

Proposal # 0852077

Claudia M. Boot has been awarded a Postdoctoral Fellowship in Polar Science to
study dissolved organic matter in the Arctic. She will conduct her research
under the mentorship of Dr. Josh Schimel (University of California Santa
Barbara) and Dr. Matt Wallenstein (Colorado State University). Dr. Boot?s
research will determine the major components of dissolved organic matter in the
three vegetation types (tussock tundra, wet meadow, and shrub tundra), document
seasonal variability of those components, and determine the molecular
characteristics responsible for the variation. The results will improve models
of carbon cycling in the Arctic. The fellowship will introduce Dr. Boot to
Arctic research, and she will bring new chemical techniques to the laboratories
of her mentors.
