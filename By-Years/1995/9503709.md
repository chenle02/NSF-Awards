Research supported by this grant is under the auspices of the Arctic Systems
Science (ARCSS) Global Change Research Program and is jointly sponsored by the
Division of Ocean Sciences and the Office of Polar Programs. Work to be
performed represents preliminary steps towards a major 5-year research project
named SHEBA, which is envisioned to study the heat budget of the Arctic Ocean
and its impact on global change. The primary goals of SHEBA are: (1) to develop,
test and implement models of arctic ocean-atmosphere-ice processes that
demonstrably improve simulations of the present day arctic climate, including
its variability, using General Circulation Models (GCMs), and (2) to improve the
interpre- tation of satellite remote sensing data in the Arctic for analysis of
the arctic climate system and provide reliable data for model input, model
validation and climate monitoring. The investigators will examine the scale at
which physical processes affect the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) as a result
of the presence of leads in the Arctic pack ice. The opening of leads produces
increased cloudiness and has a major impact on the heat budget of the Arctic.
The results of this research will be used to select the best measurements to be
made in the SHEBA field experiment and to modify Global Climate Models so that
better simulations of Arctic heat flux may be accomplished.
