The object of the proposed research is the study of propagation phenomena in
different contexts. Topics in the proposal encompass such diverse areas as the
study of diffractive phenomena for the wave equation at edges, as well as the
asymptotic behavior of waves on curved space-times, such as in general
relativity. The project will employ geometric microlocal, or phase space,
techniques to explore new problems in these areas. Some of these techniques are
constructive, such as the proposed construction of the forward fundamental
solution and the scattering operator on a class of asymptotically Anti-de Sitter
(AdS) spaces, while others rely on phase-space energy estimates, such as the
microlocal positive commutator estimates that are expected to be of use in the
study of the asymptotic behavior of the wave equation on curved space-times
(such as Kerr-de Sitter space, describing rotating black holes), of wave
equations with global conditions replacing initial conditions, and in wave
propagation on curved space-times with asymptotic edges and cusps. Even elliptic
problems, which correspond to stationary (no propagation) problems, can
sometimes benefit from a different point of view: recent work on the meromorphic
continuation of the resolvent of the Laplacian on asymptotically hyperbolic
spaces, and on its high energy behavior, provides an example.

Wave propagation is ubiquitous in the physical world, with electromagnetic waves
(e.g., light waves) being one of the most prevalent examples. A typical question
is how waves interact with structures such as edges, generalizing the well-known
law of reflection from mirrors. Scattering theory is another subject governed by
propagation phenomena. For instance, scattering phenomena enter into the
description of quantum waves on large scales, mathematically modelled as
"infinity." As propagation phenomena are ubiquitous in the physical world, their
more precise understanding has many potential applications. A concrete physical
application that is expected to be of interest is developing scattering theory
(i.e., investigating how light waves or quantum particles behave globally, in
the context of curved space-times, which give a description of our universe in
the framework of general relativity). Some of the techniques involved are also
expected to benefit the understanding of imaging problems, for instance, in the
geophysical context.
