The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project is the integration of hands-on and computer-based learning to teach the
relationship of mathematics to physical constructions. The learning experience
is designed for desktop and tablet computers as well as augmented reality
headsets. This project is founded on the idea that creativity can open the door
to understanding the relationship between oneâ€™s imagination and skills that are
taught in the classroom. Mastering the abstract concepts of middle-school math
is critical. The proposed system maps creative ideas to abstract mathematical
concepts, supporting the ability to transfer knowledge of mathematical concepts
to real-world situation, and adaptable to the entire K-16 education space.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase 1 project
will support the research and development of a learning platform consisting of
Internet-of-Things hardware devices, a construction knowledge engine and
learning module applications. The project uses both declarative and procedural
learning by merging the physical, virtual, and computational worlds for creative
problem-solving, and spatial thinking and fine motor dexterity skills
development using a building, sense-making, and synthesis learning framework.
This system consists of connectable blocks that render a virtual model to be
analyzed for mathematical and structural features. The project will design a
prototype through the tasks of development of the pilot middle school
mathematics curriculum, creation of technical designs for manufacturing, and
validation for deployment at scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
