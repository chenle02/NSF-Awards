This award is made to the University of California/Davis in support of a career
planning workshop for underrepresented minority undergraduate chemistry majors.
The workshop will be held August 7-9, 1993 at the Davis campus and will be the
first of its kind in the western states. The objective is to bring minority
students together with high-achieving minority mentors from industry, academia
and government in order to introduce the students to the opportunities created
by obtaining an advanced degree in Chemistry. The workshop will be hosted by the
University of California Davis Chemistry Department and will provide
opportunities for the student participants to observe graduate research,
advanced laboratory instrumentation, and to meet with graduate students to
discuss areas of mutual interest. %%% This award is viewed as a way of
encouraging interested minority undergraduates to continue their studies in
Chemistry by introducing them to successful minority role-models in a supportive
setting. The longer term objective is to increase the participation of
minorities in the chemistry enterprise.
