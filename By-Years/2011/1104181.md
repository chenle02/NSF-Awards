The Center for Aviation and Automotive Technology Education Using Virtual
E-School is a resource that develops and disseminates E-learning modules with
virtual reality and similar high-level visualization/simulation tools for
automotive and aviation technician education. The aviation and automotive
industries in South Carolina and elsewhere, as well as appropriate ATE Centers,
are providing input and validation of the content for the modules being
developed and extensively tested. The modules also contain pedagogical
strategies and assessments. The primary target audience is the two year college
faculty and students in associate degree programs. The virtual teaching
environment is also being used to interest high school students and to recruit
students from populations underrepresented in technical careers. Since the need
for technicians in the industries greatly exceeds the number that can be
educated in the two year colleges, the modules provide other venues for learning
and recruiting. The Center also provides an online student internship and
placement service. The efficacy of high definition modules is compared to that
of lower quality that can be viewed on laptops.
