Shubin proposes to study L^2 holomorphic functions and L^2 Dolbeault cohomology
on non-compact manifolds with boundary. He will use Von Neumann algebra
techniques to further develop the L^2 Oka-Grauert theory on complex manifolds M
with pseudoconvex or q-convex boundary bM admitting a holomorphic action of a
Lie group G on M with a compact quotient M/G. He plans to investigate existence
of non-trivial L^2 holomorphic functions on M for concrete Lie groups G which
act freely on M with compact quotient M/G. In this way it might be possible to
describe the class of groups G for which the existence of non-trivial L^2
holomorphic functions is guaranteed. The situation when there is no group action
will be also considered with the purpose of finding geometric conditions which
guarantee existence of non-trivial L^2 holomorphic functions. Techniques from
several complex variables are similar to those appearing in linear and non-
linear partial differential equations that describe cosmological models (through
twistors) and free boundary problems, providing models for plasma in tokamaks by
methods of Helmholtz and Kirchhoff. Investigation of these models can lead to
important discoveries in thermonuclear reactions which are our main hope for the
future source of cheap energy.
