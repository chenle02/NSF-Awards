This award is for support for a program of physical and visible studies on the
shallow and deep ice cores to be retrieved from Siple Dome, West Antarctica.
Visible examination of ice cores has proven to be a powerful technique for
dating and paleoclimatic interpretation. Recent examination of a shallow core
from Siple Dome indicates that annual-layer dating is possible and that visible
examination will contribute significantly to the dating effort at Siple Dome.
Once ages are obtained, distances between layers provide snow accumulation after
correction for density variations and ice flow thinning. Thin- section
examination of the core will contribute to understanding the visible
stratigraphy, and will reveal c-axis fabrics which are related to past ice
deformation. The results of this study should include a better understanding of
rapid climate change in the Antarctic and should contribute to knowledge of the
stability of the West Antarctic ice sheet.
