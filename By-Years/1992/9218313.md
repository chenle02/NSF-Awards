Three separate tasks are planned. The first is an isotopic investigation of
separated mineral phases from "ultradeep" ultramafic xenoliths from kimberlites.
The second task is a geochemical and isotopic study of ultramafic xenoliths from
several oceanic islands. The third task will be the major focus of our work. It
entails development of laboratory capabilities for measuring 238U and 232Th
isotopes by mass spectrometry, and will concentrate on the measurement of 226Ra
in both whole-rock and separated phenocryst phases. The goal of his work is to
gain a better understanding of the timescales and nature of magmatic
fractionation processes, magma transport, and the origin of the ubiquitous 226Ra
excesses in volcanic rocks from a variety of tectonic settings.
