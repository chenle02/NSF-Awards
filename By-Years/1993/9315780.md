9315780 Heller This work is concerned with the chemical concepts for bonding 10-
100 nm diameter monocrystallites of photoactive oxide semicon- ductors with
defined optical, electrical and photoelectrochemical properties to different
glass and ceramic substrates. The objective will be the building of a foundation
for a bonding technology, whereby bonding of the semiconducting oxide
crystallites to silicate glasses and ceramics would not introduce damaging
junctions with the substrate, i.e. would not result in recombination centers
that would drastically reduce the quantum efficiency of the hole or the electron
reactions at the opposite interface, in contact with a gas or a liquid. The
approach is based on modifying the back contact by an interlayer of an oxide
with an increased band gap, so that the change carriers will be strongly
repelled from the back. ***
