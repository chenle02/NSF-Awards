The investigator seeks development and analysis of accurate, rapidly
convergent, high performance solvers for the types of challenging partial
differential equations that arise in present-day materials science applications,
as well as use of such solvers for design of concrete devices and prediction of
properties of realistic systems. He creates algorithms to treat certain types of
problems related to potential theory and wave propagation, composite materials
and optical devices, elasticity, acoustics, and electromagnetism. Significant
difficulties arise in these classical fields of numerical analysis and
computational science in the context of the materials science problems
considered, which require treatment of microstructures, non-coercive systems,
geometric singularities, resonant structures, high frequencies, multiple
scattering, etc. These are mathematical problems that, in spite of significant
efforts and progress over the last century, remain elusive in a wide range of
important instances. The combination of a number of such challenges often arises
in the treatment of materials science configurations, which has made materials
problems difficult to tackle. In particular, most algorithms available for the
types of materials science applications considered in the project lack in either
accuracy, computational efficiency, or both -- a circumstance that has hindered
progress in the field.

The investigator develops effective, high-performance computational methods for
solving partial differential equations that model the properties and behaviors
of various physical systems, emphasizing features important for materials. The
project has consequences for several areas of societal interest, including the
medical field (tomography, imaging), electrical engineering (optics,
electronics), military and civilian remote sensing (radar, sonar, stealth),
communications (antennas), atmospheric science, etc. The project also provides
training for students at both graduate and undergraduate levels, as well as for
postdoctoral associates.
