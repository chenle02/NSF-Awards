Research will be conducted on the development and application of computational
methods and algorithms in statistical mechanics and related areas in quantum
condensed matter physics. The development of methods predominantly features
computation of subdominant transfer matrix eigenvalues and excited state
energies, where the main applications will be (i) universal amplitudes in
critical phemonena and quantum spin chains; (ii) the relaxation time spectrum of
stochastic dynamics; (iii) models for Monte Carlo error analysis; and, (iv)
excited state properties of Lennard-Jones boson clusters. Another topic is the
universality with respect to surface fluctuations (geometric and other) of
amplitudes characterizing wetting layers at bulk criticality. Lastly, we propose
to develop a systematically improvable approximation scheme for the computation
of the finite temperature thermodynamics of quantum chains. %%% Theoretical and
computational research will be done to improve computational techniques used in
dealing with the interactions of large numbers of particles. A number of
different systems will be studied to demonstrate the developed techniques. The
successful completion of this project will provide techniques which are
applicible to a variety of important computationally intensive problems.
