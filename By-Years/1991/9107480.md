Leguminosae is the third largest family of flowering plants, and includes many
ecologically and economically important species. To understand this great
divesity it is necessary to describe the patterns of relationship and phylogeny
linking the many species and genera to one another. Much work of this type has
been done, and continues, using traditional characters such as morphology and
chemistry. This study will focus on variation patterns at the DNA level,
specifically emphasizing the chloroplast genome, which has proven to be of great
utility as a source of characters for constructing phylogenetic hypotheses.
Restriction site analysis and DNA sequencing will be used to survey genera
representing all of the major tribes of the pivotal subfamilies Papilionoideae
and Caesalpinioideae, the groups considered to represent the main radiation of
the family. Results from these studies will be integrated with those of non-
molecular studies progressing elsewhere in the community. The resulting
phylogenetic hypotheses will be used to study the origins of nitrogen-fixing
symbioses in the family, with emphasis on the development of the nuclear
multigene families involved in nodulation.
