Ralf Spatzier continues to investigate rigidity properties of Riemannian
manifolds and group actions. In particular, he proposes to study hyperbolic
actions of higher rank abelian groups, actions of semisimple groups, higher rank
Riemannian manifolds, geodesic flows and manifolds of negative curvature.
