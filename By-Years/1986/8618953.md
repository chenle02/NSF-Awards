This research will examine the role of time-scale structure in high-gain
feedback systems and its relation to robustness of a design with respect to
uncertainties and disturbances. Based on this, a novel concept of time-scale
structure assignment for general dynamic systems is to be explored. Furthermore,
unification and consequent generalization of various exisiting analysis and
design of high-gain feedback methods is sought by casting them into the
framework of singularly perturbed systems. Partitioning of a given design into
subparts is facilitated through consistent exploitation of time-scale separation
concepts embodied in singular perturbation theory. The specific problems which
are to be examined are: (1) Eigenstructure assignment via quadratic regulator
theory , (2) Direct methods of eigenstructure and multiple time-scale assignment
in linear systems, (3) Almost disturbance decoupling with internal stability,
(4) Guaranteed stability of uncertain systems, (5) Kalman filter with weak
measurement noise, (6) Multiple time-scale assignment and shaping of slow and
fast dynamics in nonlinear systems and (7) Nonlinear "cheap" control problems.
