This request is for support to broaden and diversify the student participation
in the 42nd IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems
(ICDCS), a premier international forum for the presentation of research results
in distributed computing. It seeks to increase student participation in the
conference and the field. The proposed funding would support the travel of
eligible US students to the conference. Travel grants encourage the research
interests and the involvement of students in the field who are not well funded
and those who are just beginning their participation in the field or are
interested in entering it. A special effort is made to reach out to women and
under-represented minorities. Preference is given to students who will present
their research at ICDCS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
