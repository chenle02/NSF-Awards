The focus of this research is the development of methodology for chiral molecule
synthesis. Reactions of prochiral free radicals involving radical-radical
coupling of persistent radicals with transient radicals will be examined. With
this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr.
Rebecca Braslau, a young investigator, in the Department of Chemistry at the
University of California-Santa Cruz. Using free radical chemistry, Professor
Braslau will focus her work on the development of synthetic methodology for the
preparation of optically active compounds.
