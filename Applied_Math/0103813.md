Research is proposed on the following topics: 1. Breakup of liquid jets: This
research will mathematically analyze the capillary breakup of jets of Newtonian
and viscoelastic liquids. The effect of polymer additives in suppressing breakup
is well known and exploited both in nature (spider webs) and in technology
(control of drops sizes in spraying of liquids). The research will concentrate
on the asymptotics of breakup and compare various constitutive theories. 2.
Stability of viscoelastic flows: Elastic instabilities have been investigated
extensively over the past ten years. Such instabilities often pose limits for
polymer processing conditions. In the numerical investigation of instabilities
in complex flows, continuous spectra which are poorly resolved pose a
significant challenge. The research is aimed at using analytical techniques to
determine the location of these continuous spectra. 3. Shape control in
elasticity: An elastic medium is controlled by actuators which can supply a
stress of a given type. The research will investigate the question whether such
controls can achieve a given shape of the medium. 4. Numerical simulation of
two-fluid flows: The research will continue work on simulation of flows of two
liquids using a volume of fluid code. The following three problems will be
investigated: a) Formation of ``staircase" structures on impacting drops due to
capillary waves. b) Tipstreaming in drop breakup under shear when surfactants
are present. c) Effect of normal stresses on breakup of viscoelastic drops under
shear.

The proposed research addresses fundamental issues which arise in the processing
and use of polymeric liquids, the control of deformations of elastic solids and
the formation of emulsions by shear mixing. The proposed topics include a
comparison of the qualitative behavior various models of polymeric fluids in jet
breakup, the stability of polymeric flows, the question which shapes of an
elastic medium can be achieved by a given type of control, and the development
of numerical methods for two-fluid flows.
