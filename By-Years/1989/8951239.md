This award provides funds for equipment to teach an undergraduate laboratory
course in plant biotechnology at Arizona State University. The course, Plant
Genetic Manipulation Laboratory, is currently being offered only to graduate
students. Its present enrollment is closed to undergraduates because of
limitations in equipment. Plant Genetic Manipulation Laboratory (BOT 498) is a
2-credit, 1 semester course, which meets twice a week for a total of 6 hours.
Students are trained in the isolation and purification of DNA, RNA and proteins
from plants. They prepare DNA gels, Southern blots, protein gels and Western
blots. They learn recombinant DNA techniques (restriction, ligation, vector
construction), bacterial transformation and selection, plant transformation
(using Agrobacterium tumefaciens based vectors and electroporation) and are
taught basic plant tissue culture techniques. The equipment for this project
includes items found in all molecular biology labs sufficient to train 10 to 15
students per lab in teams of 2-3 students. Training in this subject is in demand
by students who will benefit from the practical laboratory experience. It will
also benefit ASU scientists and faculty who are seeking undergraduates and
potential graduate students trained in these areas. This is particularly
relevant now at ASU with the expansion and opening of laboratories which are
part of the new USDA-DOE-NSF Plant Science Center for the Early Events in
Photosynthesis. The grantee is matching this award with non-Federal sources.
