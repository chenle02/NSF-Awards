The analysis of incomplete information has had a profound impact on economic
theory, especially in the context of non-cooperative models. However,
cooperative theory in the presence of asymmetric information is much less
settled. This project will study important open problems of cooperation and
incentives under asymmetric information, with an eye on applications such as
auctions and bargaining. Due to the importance of individual incentives, the
research will rely heavily on insights from non-cooperative game theory and
mechanism design.

When economic agents can cooperate with each other, it is important to consider
economic allocations that are immune to changes induced by self-interested
groups or coalitions. The idea of coalitional stability is typically formalized
through the set of allocations known as the `core,' also connected with the
theory of competitive markets. This project is concerned with the theory of the
core in an environment with asymmetric information. When a coalition of
asymmetrically informed agents forms, it is not clear how much information will
be shared among them because it may be in their individual interest to hide some
of it. The research will analyze how to formalize coalitional stability in this
context. It will provide a way of making endogenous the amount of information
pooling among agents, and investigate conditions under which the set of "core"
allocations is non-empty. The research will also explore how non-cooperative
decentralized mechanisms may be designed to implement socially desirable
outcomes. The results of the project will lead to a better understanding of
important social, political and economic phenomena, including collusion in
auctions and coalition formation in problems of bargaining.
