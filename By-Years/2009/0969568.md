This project incorporates focused efforts to improve the first-year experience
of STEM students and maintain interest and excitement in STEM fields throughout
the undergraduate experience. Three new courses are being developed that
specifically target the retention of first-year STEM majors by incorporating
more active, student-based pedagogies and interdisciplinary laboratories in
introductory biology, physics and chemistry courses. Case-based learning
strategies are being implemented in introductory biology to introduce students
to subject material through the use of relevant real-world problems. The new
Studio Physics course is allowing students to learn about physical principles
through class discussions and lectures integrated with hands-on laboratory
experiences, and is being facilitated by special lab tables fitted with
computer-linked data acquisition systems. The integrated chemistry and biology
course is emphasizing the connections between biology and chemistry through
interdisciplinary laboratory experiments that are providing students with
opportunities to confront real-world problems. The project is also developing
support activities in the form of mathematics skills review sessions that are
targeting students enrolled in introductory chemistry and physics courses, and
is also initiating a STEM vocations course to provide career guidance to early-
career students. First year students in STEM fields are interacting with faculty
mentors and gaining valuable field and lab experiences through the project's
summer research program. To help foster a sense of community and to maintain
student interest in the STEM fields beyond their first year, the project is also
developing a Science Caf√© that is involving speakers who are making informal
presentations and leading discussions with students on important current topics
in STEM fields. The project is incorporating research on the effectiveness of
using peer mentors in a Case-Based Learning classroom, and project outcomes are
being monitored and improved by an iterative formative evaluation program.
Overall project outcomes are being assessed and disseminated to the larger STEM
community. Project activities are increasing the retention of all STEM students
and especially, are increasing the number of female STEM majors. This project
implements successful pedagogies and programs that are known to be successful,
is expanding upon already-strong programs, and is increasing the institutional
STEM graduation rate by 18%, thus producing an additional 19 STEM graduates by
the end of the award period.
