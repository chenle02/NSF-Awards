Hans Bethe enjoys the reputation of being one of the most important and most
revered of physicists of the 20th century. A refugee from Hitler's Germany,
Bethe moved to Cornell University where he played a major role in the
development of quantum theory and its application to the structure of atoms,
molecules and solids during the '30s. He was also one of the principal
contributors to the elucidation of the content of relativistic quantum mechanics
and quantum electrodynamics until the late 50's. He also made major
contributions to solid state physics. During World War II, before receiving
clearance for the Manhattan project, Bethe made significant contributions to
aerodynamics, penetration of armor by projectiles, and radar. Upon joining the
Manhattan Project, he worked under Oppenheimer on the theoretical design of an
atomic bomb and eventually was named the head of the theoretical physics
division at the Los Alamos Laboratory. After the war, he continued playing a
significant science policy role dealing with issues as divergent as the cold
war, the hydrogen bomb, the McCarthy era, the Korean War, the Oppenheimer
affair, Sputnik, the nuclear test ban, Vietnam, the armament reduction
negotiations, SDI, environmental issues, science education, nuclear energy, etc.
In all of these issues, Bethe was the voice of the concerned scientist who
wished to use science for achieving peace, not perpetuating war. Under this
grant, Professor Schweber is writing, at Bethe's invitation, an intellectual
biography of this great scientist. The biography is dealing not only with
Bethe's contributions to theoretical and applied physics, but also is addressing
Bethe's activities in the field of science policy, disarmament and international
affairs.
