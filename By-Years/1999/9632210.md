This project will apply ion microprobe analyses to examine variation of trace
elements (B, F, Mg, Sr) and oxygen isotopes at sub-monthly resolution in Porites
corals from Johnston Atoll (central Pacific) and Two-Mile Reef (South Africa).
The goals are twofold: to determine covariation among trace elements in order to
assess their relationship to water temperature, and to examine the relationship
between coral growth geometry and the geochemical tracers. Several colonies will
be analyzed at each site to examine local variability and instrumental records
of water temperature are available.
