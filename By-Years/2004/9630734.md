9630734 Crane Research Communications Ltd. will develop research designs,
measurement, and analysis techniques for the assessment of the impacts of
informal science learning television programming and other media. Experts in the
fields of psychology, science education, communications research, and evaluation
and testing will develop methodologies and instruments to: o better assess
impact on attitudes, cognition, and behavior for specific audiences, o take into
account the idea that informal science learning may take a variety of forms, and
o better assess cumulative impacts of television and other media on informal
science learning. The PI's for the project will be Valerie Crane, President of
RCL, and Beth Rabin and Suzanne Carter, both on the RCL staff. Advisors would
include experts in research on children's television programming such as Ellen
Wartella and Keith Mielke, specialists in inquiry-based learning and formal and
informal science curricula such as Matthew Schneps, and specialists in
evaluation and testing such as Edward Chittenden.
