This award provides funds to establish a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
SITE at Mountain Lake Biological Station, a facility of the University of
Virginia located in the Allegheny Mountains of southwestern Virginia. This Field
Station attracts researchers from throughout the country who come to the station
to study the population biology of local plants and animals. Students will be
chosen from a national pool of applicants to spend ten weeks at the station
during the summer. The students will meet together with an REU coordinator at
least once a week to discuss general issues on the conduct of science and their
specific projects. Students will work closely with mentors to design and
complete independent research projects in areas that could include the
epidemiology of plant parasite-host systems, the ecological genetics of plant
pollination systems, the genetic implications of group living in insects, the
behavioral ecology of birds, the analysis of local vegetation patterns, and the
interactions between populations that live in adjacent communities.
