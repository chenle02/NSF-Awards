This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of U.S. graduate
students, postdocs, and junior faculty who participate in the program "Problems
in Mathematical General Relativity" that will run from September 14 to December
15, 2015, at the Institute Henri Poincare in Paris, France.

This trimester-long activity will be part of a world-wide celebration of the
centenary of Einstein's discovery of general relativity. It will bring together
the leading authorities in the field to discuss a broad spectrum of topics,
including the following: the formation, rigidity, and stability of black holes;
the stability of Kerr-Cauchy horizons; the relationship between geometry and
general relativity; the dynamics of self-gravitating matter. The highlight of
the trimester will be a workshop that will be held November 16-20, 2015, and
that will constitute the event's primary celebration of general relativity's
hundredth anniversary. The program for the trimester provides ample opportunity
for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their
work.
