The PI proposes to develope theoretical models of crystalline
solids&lt;br/&gt;that are based on the positions of the atoms that make up the
crystal.&lt;br/&gt; As a first step, the PI proposes to study (large) elastic
deformation &lt;br/&gt;of perfect crystals. This will help us to understand the
critical strain that&lt;br/&gt;the material can sustain before defects form. The
PI then proposes to&lt;br/&gt;study the formation, structure, energetics and
dynamics of defects in crystals.&lt;br/&gt;Understanding defects in crystals is
crucial since defects control the &lt;br/&gt;response and failure of the
material, as in, e.g. nano-devices&lt;br/&gt;and semi-conductor thin films. By
understanding the interplay between &lt;br/&gt;loading and failure mechanisms as
well as their microscopic origin, the PI &lt;br/&gt;hopes to give guidelines
fordesigning materials that avoid certain modes of failure.&lt;br/&gt;To obtain
simplified models that can be readily linked with traditional
&lt;br/&gt;theories of continuum mechanics, the PI also proposes to develop
&lt;br/&gt;continuum models in the form of nonlinear elasticity theory
&lt;br/&gt;that are derived directly from the atomistic models. Such a theory
gives &lt;br/&gt;a much simplified description for the material properties and
are &lt;br/&gt;therefore easier to use.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;As applications,
the PI proposes to study the mechanical properties of&lt;br/&gt;carbon nano-
tubes. Nano-tubes are very good examples for this project&lt;br/&gt;since they
can sustain very large elastic deformation before failure. In fact
&lt;br/&gt;they are the strongest fiber known to us. The PI proposes to study
large &lt;br/&gt;(therefore nonlinear) deformations of nano-tubes, their modes
of failure, &lt;br/&gt;as well as properties of nano-tube-reinforced
materials.&lt;br/&gt;
