9511215 William Wright One of the goals of neuroscience is to understand what
happens in our brains when we learn. A powerful approach to finding answers to
this question is provided by studying the brains of early animals and asking how
much of what happens is similar to processing in early animals and how much
occurs only in higher animals. The work of this group of neuroscientists
examines mechanisms of learning in marine mollusks. It charts changes in
specific cellular mechanisms of learning in a specific behavior in several
species of these animals. By monitoring in parallel correlated changes in
learning capabilities, this study will provide more precise insights into the
roles of these cellular mechanisms in learning. Besides the knowledge of whether
and how mechanisms of learning change across species, this work will also give
insights into learning mechanisms in higher animals.
