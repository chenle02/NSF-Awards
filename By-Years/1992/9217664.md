The objective of the proposed research is to use numerical models of
crystallization processes to further understand the origins of layering in
igneous rocks. The emphasis is on a post-nucleation process termed crystal aging
(Ostwald ripening) that can give rise to fine-scale layering as a result of
rhythmic long-range order related to dissolution of small crystals and growth of
larger crystals. The results of this research should increase understanding of
the petrogenesis and origin of layered mafic and ultramafic intrusions, which
are the major source of the platinum group elements.
