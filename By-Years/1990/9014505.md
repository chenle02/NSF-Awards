The primary purpose of these initial studies is to demonstrate that total
internal reflection infrared techniques are highly sensitive and useful in the
study of surface adsorbed metal carbonyl compounds. These studies will also form
a background for the proposed research by aiding in the understanding of the
infrared spectra of Cr(CO)6 on Al2O3 surfaces. The interactions of Cr(CO)6 with
the surface and with other Cr(CO)6 molecules can be determined, and the
structure of the surface adsorbed molecule can be elucidated. The investigator
will spend this planning period preparing a research proposal that will
demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed experimental techniques, and the
ability for these experiments to be carried out at a primarily undergraduate
institution. A significant portion of the time will be utilized obtaining
preliminary data. The infrared absorption spectrum of Cr(CO)6 adsorbed on Al2O3
single crystal surfaces will be measured as a function of surface coverage.
These measurements will demonstrate the viability of the proposed research as
well as the capability of the institution.
