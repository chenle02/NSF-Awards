9512864 Constable This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
research in marine geology and geophysics between Steven C. Constable at the
University of California, San Diego and B. Ildefonse and D. Mainprice,
Monpellier University. The investigators will conduct electrogeophysical studies
of the Oman ophiolite, which is an exposed ancient ocean surface. The primary
objective of the research is to study bulk physical properties and subsurface
structure. The field work and data interpretation will be conducted in
collaboration with the French group, in order to take advantage of their
structural and petrophysical knowledge of the Oman ophiolite.
