The management of changes is a difficult and error-prone process in software
maintenance and many other fields. Due to a lack of theory, there are few tools
and methods available to systematically change objects while preserving
important properties along with such changes. This problem is addressed by the
theory of structured change. The overall research objective is to find
principles for sound change management and to establish a theoretical foundation
for the development of supporting tools. One particular goal is the development
of domain-specific languages, which users can employ to effectively manage
changes in all kinds of software applications.

The following technical approach is pursued. First, a flexible change
representation is developed. Based on this representation, laws of a change
algebra will be established to identify property-preserving transformations that
can support sound change transitions. This work is accompanied by the
development of algorithms for the incremental checking of property preservation.
Ultimately, the theory will enable the development of tools that help users to
effectively manage the evolution of objects. This goal is supported by the
investigation of interaction principles that underly the editing and exploration
of structured objects and their changes. Building on top of the theoretical
foundation, the development of domain-specific languages will provide concrete
help for users to express more sophisticated transformations and combinations
than the simple one-step operations that are offered by the underlying formal
model. Specifically, in the area of change representations for programs such a
DSL will yield new, theoretically founded support for feature-oriented
programming and software product lines. In the context of spreadsheets, web
sites, etc. the development of such DSLs will empower millions of users to deal
in a more systematic way with changes.
