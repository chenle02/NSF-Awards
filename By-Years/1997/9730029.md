Lawrence E. Raffalovich The proposed research investigates the relationship
between income inequality, economic development, and political democracy. It
will focus on a crucial but neglected topic in stratification theory: the power
of a small elite to appropriate a disproportionate share of society's surplus. A
primary objective is to specify the structural sources and social consequences
of this power. Time series analyses will permit the examination of models that
incorporate both over-time change and cross-national differences in inequality.
These models also can estimate the extent to which short-term power--such as the
power to appropriate the immediate benefits of economic growth--is conditioned
by the institutional structure of society, such as the extent of political
democracy. This will help illuminate the apparent contradiction in prior
research between longitudinal and cross-national findings. The proposed research
will contribute to theory and research in social stratification, the sociology
of development, and quantitative research methods. In addition, by examining
both cross-national and longitudinal variation in inequality, the proposed
research will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the short-run
and long-run processes that produce observed patterns of inequality in society.
