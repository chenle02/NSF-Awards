This project investigates the interplay of nonlinear dynamics and random abiotic
fluctuations on distribution and abundance of interacting populations. To
investigate this interplay, the theory of random dynamical systems which
combines dynamical systems techniques with probabilistic machinery are applied
to a class of random ecological maps sufficiently general to account for spatial
structure, stage structure, and multispecies interactions. New mathematical
methods for verifying stochastic dissipativeness, persistence, and extinction
will be developed. The application of these methods to populations dispersing in
random environments, the storage effect and the Allee effect in stage-structured
populations, random replicator dynamics, and antagonistic interactions of ideal
free populations in source-sink environments will be pursued. For models of
structured populations, new methods will be developed for understanding
monotonicity and convexity properties of the dominant Lyapunov exponent for
parameterized families of random products of non-negative matrices. Since these
dominant Lyapunov exponents determine the asymptotic growth rate of populations
at low densities, they are critical for understanding persistence.

The interaction between environmental fluctuations, for example those due to
anthropogenic disturbances or weather, and biological processes can dramatically
affect the outcomes of species interactions. Consequently, the applications of
the mathematical techniques developed in this project may be of practical value
to the conservation or the restoration of ecological communities, the prevention
of biological invasions, the management of natural resources, and biological
control of agricultural pests.
