CMMI - 0804194&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gordon Research Conference on Composites
is one of the few Gordon Research Conferences that addresses a field within the
purview of materials science. The field of composite materials is highly
interdisciplinary, requiring the efforts of physicists, chemists, mechanics,
mathematicians and materials scientists. The conference currently focuses on
nanotechnology; the Intellectual Merit can be summed up succinctly as providing
a rare and unique forum for the leading researchers from these diverse
backgrounds to critical review research results, establish collaborations, and
foster new research directions in the nanotechnology area.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the continued rise in energy cost, the increased
utilization of composites in aerospace and automotive applications, and the
projected impact of nanotechnology in the biomedical sciences research area, the
broad impacts of this conference become clear. Nanotechnology integration,
however, has not progressed at a discovery pace to meet the new application
needs. An added benefit of this conference is the mentoring activities of early-
career scientist and engineers that naturally occur at the poster sessions. The
partnering that develops between the conference participants provides a
framework for developing new and more efficient teaching methodologies and for
integrating the research discoveries into broader programs and activities of
national interest. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
