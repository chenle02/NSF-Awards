9712543 WHARTON Parasitic Hymenoptera (wasps) are extraordinarily diverse,
containing some 70,000 described species, but comparatively poorly known
taxonomically despite their importance in understanding terrestrial ecosystems.
Virtually all parasitic Hymenoptera are parasitoids of other insects and many
are quite host-specific. They are therefore essential components in the complex
food webs of natural ecosystems and they provide a valuable source of natural
enemies for pest insects in managed ecosystems. Improved taxonomy and more
natural classifications of parasitic wasps will enable better characterization
and management of biological diversity, and it will directly support research
directed at a more sustainable agriculture with fewer negative impacts on the
environment. This research, by Robert A. Wharton, James B. Wooley and
colleagues, will provide comprehensive taxonomic monographs in four key groups
of parasitic Hymenoptera. The project will address taxonomic needs in four
families representing four major lineages (superfamilies) of parasitic
Hymenoptera: 1) Braconidae (superfamily Ichneumonoidea), 2) Encyrtidae
(superfamily Chalcidoidea), 3) Eucoilidae (superfamily Cynipoidea), and 4)
Diapriidae (superfamily Proctotrupoidea). Specific objectives are to produce
worldwide monographic treatments of key genera in each of these families,
treating nearly 1000 species. Four Ph.D. students will be trained in the course
of the project, one in each major lineage to be addressed. The collaborative
nature of the project (including specialists from four different countries) will
provide exceptionally broad training and experience for the students in all
aspects of modern, collection-based systematics research. Training will
emphasize taxonomic methodology at the species-level, including computer/video-
aided image analysis, and computer databasing of character data as well as host
and locality data.
