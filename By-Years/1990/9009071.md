The object of this proposed research is to undertake exploratory studies on the
ultraviolet transmittance characteristics of fluoride glasses. In particular the
effect of composition on the ultraviolet absorption edge will be investigated in
a range of fluoride compositions. Furthermore, the effect of ultraviolet
irradiation on the absorption edge will also be studied. The proposed research
is intended, in part, to assess the viability of further work in the area of
optical characteristics of ultraviolet transmitting glasses.
