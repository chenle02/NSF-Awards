This project will improve undergraduate laboratory work in Biotechnology by
providing a highly instrumented fermentation facility which permits senior-year
majors to scale up their projects from a single laboratory flask to an on-line
production level. While biotechnology is a diverse interdisciplinary field, its
origins are in biology. Mankato's Biology Department has played the leading role
in defining and developing what will constitute the major program in
biotechnology. Mankato State University students complete a rigorous selection
of courses in biology, chemistry and physics prior to the senior year of the
program. During the senior year the students are involved in classes and
laboratories that address one of the major problems in the discipline: "scale-
up". To accomplish this, students enroll in a three-quarter sequence entitled
Biological Engineering Analysis and concurrently in a Biotechnology Laboratory.
The former introduces the student to the analytical aspects of scaling up a
bioconversion and the latter requires the student to apply these principles in
the design and execution of a project. More specifically, students will work in
teams on a project of interest to a faculty member or a sponsoring industry, and
will be responsible for isolating/constructing an organism that carries out a
bioconversion, and then scaling up the process. Students will have hands-on use
of this highly instrumented fermenter facility, using their engineering skills
to optimize and scale up their projects.
