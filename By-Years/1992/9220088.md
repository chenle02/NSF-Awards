This award will provide 32% of the funds required to equip a workstation-based
seismic reflection data-processing facility in the Department of Geology at
Syracuse University. Syracuse University has committed the necessary remaining
funds. The computer facility will be used primarily by the Principal
Investigator and students in the analysis of seismic reflection data and their
interpretation of large-scale structures of the Earth's continental lithosphere
regions.
