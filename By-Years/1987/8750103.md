Modern measurement and analysis equipment will be used to upgrade an existing
thermofluids laboratory under this project. The three areas to be covered
include fluid flow anemometry, pressure measurement, and temperature
measurement. In each of these areas, modern sensors will be obtained and
interfaced with microcomputers. These include hot wire and film anemometers,
pressure transducers, total, static and boundary layer pressure probe sensors,
and temperature transducers. With this equipment, a variety of experiments will
be performed including fluid flow velocity, dynamic and static pressure,
aerodynamic drag, and heat and mass transfer with temperature distributions in
flow fields.
