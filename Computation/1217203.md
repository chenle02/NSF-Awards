Highly oscillatory dynamical systems are computationally very challenging.
Traditional numerical techniques require several function evaluations per
wavelength. This is typically prohibitingly computationally costly. In earlier
work the investigators have developed and analyzed numerical algorithms for
efficient solution of such systems with well-defined scale separation. In this
proposal the investigators tackle the harder problems where the scale separation
is less clear and where the decomposition into slow and fast variables is not
known. Abstractly, a full-scale model with state variables u is given. A number
of slow variables, U, which include the local averages of u(t), is to be
computed using a sequence of short time histories of u(t), starting from
appropriate initial conditions consistently defined by U(t). Hence, the
essential objectives that form this proposal are: (1) Under what conditions and
in what sense do the multiscale approaches converge? What is the accuracy in the
approximation of U, and what are the stability properties of the methods? (2)
How can we find higher order accurate algorithms in a systematic way, when the
dynamical system's right hand side can be decomposed into stiff and non-stiff
parts? (3) Design such methods with a substantial reduction of computational
complexity compared with existing techniques. The proposed research will
delineate mathematically what it means for a dynamical system that appear to be
highly oscillatory to possess slow modes. With this information, new efficient
numerical algorithms can be devised and tested rigorously. The proposed research
will establish a mathematical link between a variety of averaging theories and
new effective numerical integrators and filtering techniques.

The proposed research is at the very mathematical and computational heart of
many important applications in science and engineering, from astrophysics to
quantum mechanics. In these applications there are rapid oscillations as, for
example, vibrations of atoms that affects the overall system on a much slower
time scale. This is traditionally difficult to simulate with reasonable
computational cost. The theories and algorithms developed in this proposal make
such simulations practical and directly relate to important atomistic
simulations that are used in place of actual physical experiments. They will
have direct consequences, for example, in molecular biology for understanding
drug functions at the cellular level, and also in the study of material
properties and unstable events such as the formation and propagation of cracks,
which may affect electronic components as well as the structural safety of
airplanes.
