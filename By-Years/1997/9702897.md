9702897 Marsh The ability to capture the key dynamics of precision machines is
critical to the design of precision machines to meet the manufacturing
challenges of the future. This Career plan addresses this need by seeking means
for representing critical machine dynamics reliably and efficiently. The
research will begin by capturing analytically the important behavior of several
classes of machine components such as spindles, bearings and bolted/welded
connections. The relevant behavior of each component from the component models
will then be integrated into the model of the entire machine system and used to
study chatter avoidance, tool development, and machine design. The Career plan
also offers education of engineers capable of accurately modeling and analyzing
precision machines. The development of models to represent the key dynamics of
precision machines is central to the design of precision machines and their
components to meet tomorrow's manufacturing challenges. The integrated research
and education program enables the creation of young engineers specializing in
machine design for dynamic performance.
