0321402&lt;br/&gt;Wu&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation award to the
University of Alaska Fairbanks Campus supports acquisition of a high resolution
inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (HR-ICPMS) for oceanographic and
geological research. The instrumentation will be housed in the facilities of the
Frontier Research Program for Global Change at the International Arctic Research
Center, University of Alaska. It will be applied to a variety of projects, with
existing support in place to focus on the investigation of iron-binding organic
ligands, the use of Pb isotopes to trace Arctic water masses, and use of Ir in
ice cores to study variations in cosmic material influx. The mass spectrometer
supported here provides a unique capability in the Fairbanks region, and it is
expected to catalyze interdisciplinary and extramural collaborations. It is
anticipated that training and use of the new instrumentation will be
incorporated into courses and research projects involving both undergraduate and
graduate students at University of Alaska. University of Alaska and the Frontier
Program of IARC are providing 30% of the cost of the project from non-federal
funds. It is supported by the Division of Ocean Sciences at
NSF.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
