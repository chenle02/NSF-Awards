9314315 Phipps The Australian Antarctic Discordance is a section of mid ocean
ridge that is significantly deeper than expected. This project will collect
crustal thickness measurements from two neighboring segment in the Discordance
has a median valley and a 1 km deeper axial depth than its neighboring Southeast
Indian Ridge segment to the east that has an axial high morphology. Questions to
be addressed are whether: (1) the Discordance is underlain by thin crust, (2)
the Klein &amp; Langmuir correlation of mid ocean ridge depth, crustal
thickness, and major element chemistry is valid for the Discordance, (3) the
crustal thickness on the adjacent Southeast Indian ridge differs from that in
the Discordance, and (4) a magma lens exists under the Southeast Indian Ridge.
