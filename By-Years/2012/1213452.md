With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division
of Chemistry, Professor Shigeru Amemiya at University of Pittsburgh and his
group will be utilizing a nanogap (a gap with a width of &lt;10 nm) to develop
the novel electrochemical method that combines cyclic voltammetry (CV) with
scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). The nanogap-based approach that was
developed in the Amemiya laboratory overcomes the limitations of widely used CV
and SECM methods and enables completely new measurements of interfacial charge-
transfer reactions at extremely high rates on laterally heterogeneous surfaces.
The versatile nanoelectrochemical method will be useful for the characterization
of nanomaterials such as monolayer graphene and electrocatalytic nanoparticles,
as well as for investigation of rapid charge-transfer reactions such as electron
transfer at redox-active self-assembled monolayers and ion transfer at
liquid/liquid interfaces. Such studies will massively augment our knowledge and
understanding of interfacial charge-transfer reactions, which are the basis of
future technological developments in energy conversion and storage, molecular
electronics, and ion sensing and separation in addition to fundamental
advancements in various scientific areas, especially, in electrochemistry,
nanosceince, and material science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The implementation of
the nanogap-based electrochemical method as a routine experimental tool among
scientific community will be accelerated by commercializing tailor-made
nanoelectrodes and by sharing simulation programs for data analysis. The
integration of the electrochemical research into undergraduate teaching will be
promoted by the development of pencil-lead-based voltammetric electrodes as an
educational tool to discover the lipophilicity of various ions as the critical
molecular property related to their environmental toxicity and pharmaceutical
activity.
