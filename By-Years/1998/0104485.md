NSF Award Abstract - DMS-0104485&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical Sciences: Wave
Interactions in Continuum Mechanics
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0104485&lt;br/&gt;Young,
Robin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a study of nonlinear
hyperbolic waves and their interactions. Waves are ubiquitous in science, and a
general understanding of their interactions is of fundamental interest and
importance. This project will systematically develop a dual framework for
understanding waves and their interactions, via direct and asymptotic methods.
Interacting pairs of waves are described in detail, and are combined in a
coherent fashion to describe the structure of general solutions. These methods
will be applied to several important systems of continuum
mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mathematical theory of waves lies at the
intersection of mathematics and physics and has application to many engineering
problems. This project develops methods for understanding the results of wave
interactions in general systems. The results obtained in this study will be of
use in experimentally measuring material properties of elastic solids.
