9410625 MASKUS Differences in patent laws across countries have been a major
issue in the multilateral GATT negotiations in the Uruguay Round, in the
negotiation of the North American Free Trade Area, and in U.S. efforts to
discipline foreign unfair trade practices. It is argued that weak patent laws in
developing countries tend to distort international trade and investment flows by
inducing innovative firms to withdraw from servicing markets with limited
protection. There is, however, virtually no reliable information about whether
varying international patent laws tend to expand or restrict trade. Theoretical
models suggest that either of two conflicting outcomes are possible. On the one
hand, because stronger patents provide additional market power to firms, the
firms may choose to engage in greater exercise of that market power through
export limitations and price discrimination. On the other hand, stronger patent
laws tend to expand the available market size for innovative firms. It is
important to determine how domestic regulations of this sort, as opposed to
standard trade barriers, influence international trade. This project will
specify a series of theoretical models that allow for various market structures
and changes in trading behavior induced by marginal shifts in patent laws. In
addition, econometric models will be used to test empirically the hypotheses
generated by the theoretical models. ***
