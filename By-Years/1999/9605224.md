This international collaboration between the PI and John Allen of Lund
University, Sweden has two objectives. One is to further characterize redox
control of the phosphorylation of membrane proteins from chloroplasts of higher
plants, cyanobacterial thylakoid membranes, and chromatophores from purple
bacteria. The primary method used will be potentiometric redox titration and
phosphorimaging. The other is to determine the roles of individual
phosphoproteins in controlling light-energy harvesting and distribution, as well
as photosynthetic electron transfer. The main method used there will be
fluorescence spectroscopy to probe both single turnover and steady-state
electron transfer. The Lund laboratory will provide equipment and resources
needed to perform the research. The result of the collaboration could lead to a
breakthrough in our understanding of a process fundamental to photosynthesis,
and could have application to other cell systems.
