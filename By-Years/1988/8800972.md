This award will support collaborative research between Prof. Thomas J. Morgan of
Wesleyan University and Dr. C. Cisneros of the Institute of Physics of the
National Autonomous University in Cuernavaca, Mexico. The researchers intend to
study differential scattering processes in highly excited atom formation via
collisions of hydrogen ions with neutral gaseous targets. These measurements
should yield the first experimental determination of the differential scattering
cross section for fast, highly excited atom formation and should provide a basis
for understanding the collision mechanisms involved. While there exists a large
body of information on the formation of highly excited Rydberg atoms via
electron capture collisions in the keV energy range, formation via electron
detachment from a hydrogen ion has only recently been studied and interesting
differences between these two processes have been noted. This award will serve
to continue a successful collaboration to which the U.S. PI brings his expertise
with highly excited atom experiments and the Mexican side its experience with
differential scattering measurements.
