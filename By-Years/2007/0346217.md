Weakly adsorbed water has been observed to dramatically increase the rates of
photocatalytic decomposition of organics on platinum/titania (Pt/TiO2)
catalysts, but chemisorbed water, which is more strongly adsorbed, does not. The
objective of this research is to understand how weakly adsorbed molecules
accelerate the rate of these catalytic reactions. Understanding these
observations may be important in many catalytic reactions. These studies will
also contribute to understanding photocatalytic oxidation, which is used to
oxidize low concentrations of VOC pollutants in air. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A
combined experimental and theoretical approach will be used to elucidate the
mechanisms that are involved in acceleration of these catalytic reactions.
Photocatalytic decomposition, which takes place on Pt/TiO2 at room temperature,
is a particularly effective means to study such behavior. The use of UV light to
start and stop the reaction isothermally provides a unique means to study
intermediates and mechanisms. The experimental studies will use continuous-flow
isothermal reaction, infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed species and
intermediates, and temperature-programmed desorption. Transient isothermal
reaction will be combined with isotope labeling as a major component of the
experimental studies. Adsorption isotherms of water will be used to determine
the amounts of adsorbed water during reaction conditions. The theoretical
modeling will use ab initio computational chemistry to test reaction mechanisms,
determine the effect of weakly adsorbed molecules on adsorbed organics, and do
trajectory calculations to investigate the reaction coordinate for
photocatalytic decomposition. The infrared spectra of optimized intermediate
structures will also be computed from first principles for comparison to the
experimental results. The modeling and experiments will be coordinated so that
each helps guide the other. &lt;br/&gt;
