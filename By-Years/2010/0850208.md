The "SC Graduate Steps to STEM" project provides scholarships for new graduate
students in STEM fields - Biology, Geology, Marine Sciences, Mathematics,
Statistics and Physics and Astronomy - at the University of South Carolina (USC)
as an enrollment incentive and to ease financial constraints while also
providing support mechanisms to participating fellows. Targeted students for
these scholarships are graduates of the "SC STEPs to STEM" program, most of whom
transferred to USC as juniors and are often non-traditional students, as well as
undergraduates in South Carolina LSAMP and TRIO programs. Ultimately, the goal
of this project is that fellows graduate with a Master's degree in a STEM field
to either enter the workforce with increased earning, knowledge and social
contribution potential, or to continue doctoral studies in the STEM field of
their choice. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is based on practices that have
been shown to be effective in retaining students in science and mathematics
graduate programs and leading them to doctoral programs, and include:
&lt;br/&gt; (a) correcting deficiencies in the fellows' undergraduate education
through tutorials, appropriate coursework and teaching experience; &lt;br/&gt;
(b) helping fellows establish relationships among peers and faculty at USC and
elsewhere in the research community so that the students have well-defined
career goals and a support system that helps them achieve their goals;
&lt;br/&gt; (c) providing a smooth transition from undergraduate science
programs at USC and other 4-year institutions to graduate programs in Science
and Mathematics at USC; and &lt;br/&gt; (d) participating in the USC Preparing
Future Faculty program to further encourage and prepare fellows for academic
careers that encompass teaching, research and service.
