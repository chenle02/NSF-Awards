The investigator analyzes the large systems of coupled oscillators that arise
in various branches of biology and condensed-matter physics. A common theme is
the spontaneous emergence of synchronization due to cooperative interactions
among the oscillators. The systems of ordinary differential equations that
constitute the models will be investigated analytically and numerically.
Techniques to be used include methods of dynamical systems, bifurcation theory,
statistical visualization of the many-osillator dynamics plays a crucial heurisc
role in the research. Several of the taksk are expected to generate
experimentally testable predictions. The mathematical problems studied here are
models of behavior as varied as the beating of a heart, the patterned flashing
groups of fireflies, or the circadian rhythm. Specific areas to be studied
include: phase models with a large but finite number of oscillators; pulse-
coupled oscillators with distributed frequencies or local coupling; phase-
locking and invariant 2-tori in arrays of Josephson junctions; arrays of
electronic relaxation oscillators; coupled oscillator models for the Drosophila
circadian system; and delayed switching of charge-density.
