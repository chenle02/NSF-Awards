The investigation will determine the characteristics of orographic forcing and
its contribution to the total occurrence of mesospheric gravity waves. The
project entails the estimation of the momentum and energy flux associated with
the mountain waves as well as the level of flux divergence, i.e., wave
deposition, into the mesopause region. The project goals will be achieved using
all-sky imaging observations of the mesosphere-lower thermosphere (MLT) mountain
waves in conjunction with measurements from several types of multi-diagnostic
instrumentation co-located at the El Leoncito Observatory in Argentina providing
hydroxyl and oxygen winds, temperatures, and brightness. Additional satellite
measurements of MLT temperature and airglow emission rate, as well as
tropospheric/stratospheric winds and temperatures, will also be utilized in
order to obtain a comprehensive characterization of the origin and behavior of
the waves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary thrust of the project is to analyze
gravity wave data generated by westerly winds flowing across the Andes and
imaged in the immediate downwind region by their effects on the hydroxyl,
oxygen, and sodium airglow emissions. Mountain wave events will be identified
using tropospheric and stratospheric temperature measurements obtained from
satellite radiances. These measurements, combined with mean wind information in
the troposphere and stratosphere, will characterize the forcing conditions for
mountain wave generation. Other satellite measurements will provide mean state
temperature covering a large vertical extent of the atmosphere which will help
tie the lower atmosphere measurements to the MLT region measurements. The
subject of orographic forcing of atmospheric gravity waves is of current
interest as part of efforts to determine the importance of coupling of various
kinds of tropospheric processes to the upper atmosphere. The work will advance
these efforts.
