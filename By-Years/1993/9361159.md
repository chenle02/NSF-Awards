9361159 Lewis This project is funded under the National Science Foundation's
(NSF) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which is designed to
provide an opportunity for small business, particularly the small high
technology firm, to participate in NSF research. Phase I of the SBIR program
serves as a filter to select promising proposals and determine if the firm can
do high quality research. Phase II is the principal research project. Phase III
is the conversion of the NSF-funded research into commercial applications and
technological innovation supported by follow-on private venture capital or other
non-federal financing. The focus of this Phase I project is to analyze a
cellular channelizer/equalizer/detector, called the Athena Cellular Telephone.
The technology is based on DS-CDMA protocol, a synergistic (patent pending)
arithmetic processor design, and a highly integrated receiver design. The
planned result is an extremely compact, single-chip DS-CDMA receiver which
contains digital mixers, downconverters, and adaptive equalizers.***
