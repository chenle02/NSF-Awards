A high voltage laboratory is being developed that permits students to better
integrate theoretical electrostatics with physical systems. The laboratory will
expose students to high voltage phenomena, measurement techniques and practical
applications of electrostatics. Students will also learn high voltage safety
practices, and the laboratory will provide a experimental facility for senior
design projects related to high voltage phenomena and equipment. Equipment
consists of AC and DC high voltage power supplies, measurement instruments, a
special purpose close range telescope, high voltage insulators, a set of
conducting spheres and a high voltage capacitor. This project is being matched
by an amount equal to the award.
