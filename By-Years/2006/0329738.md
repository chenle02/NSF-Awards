The information utility of a sensor network is dependent on the survival of
critical sensor nodes whose identities are determined by the dynamics of
information flow and task distribution in the network. This proposal will
develop energy-efficient algorithms for dynamically identifying critical sensors
and increasing sensor lifetime through optimal data transmission schedules and
duty cycles. Path reliability, length and sensor energy-consumptions are three
important metrics affecting network lifetime. The notion of energy weakness of
information routing paths will be developed and used to derive energy-aware
protocols that enhance sensor network survivability by selecting reliable
information paths with low energy weakness. New techniques for measuring the
vulnerability of sensor placements and task distributions will be developed and
used to derive efficient tasking algorithms that maximize critical sensor
survival. Public dissemination of research and software and training of graduate
students will be an important component of the proposal.
