Project Abstract SES Proposal 0135441 Space and Geometry in Kant's Critical
Epistemology Lisa Shabel, Ohio State University

This project has two interdependent aims: 1) to examine Kant's philosophy of
mathematics in its eighteenth-century historical context; and 2) to determine
the role that Kant's philosophy of mathematics plays in the epistemological view
he defends in the "Critique of Pure Reason." The project is motivated, at least
in part, by the weakness of traditional interpretations of Kant's philosophy of
mathematics. Most recent commentary on Kant's philosophy of mathematics falls
victim to one or another sort of isolationism: commentators interpret Kant's
philosophy of mathematics in isolation either from the eighteenth-century
mathematical milieu that was familiar to him and his contemporaries, or from the
epistemological arguments and results that his own philosophy of mathematics was
deployed to serve, or both. This project aims to provide an account of Kant's
philosophy of mathematics that situates it with respect to both the mathematical
results that inspired it and the epistemological results that it inspired.

The project uses textual research to show that in the eighteenth-century both
symbolic and non-symbolic mathematical methods were dependent on constructive
geometric procedures; in particular, early modern editions of Euclid's Elements
show that modern geometric methods depend on diagrammatic reasoning. This
textual research will support a defense of Kant's philosophy of geometry as a
rich and compelling account of eighteenth-century mathematical practice. The
project also shows that Kant's epistemological arguments regarding the nature of
space serve to provide a foundation for constructive geometric procedures by
establishing the pure cognitive faculty of spatial intuition as the source of
geometric reasoning. It follows that, for Kant, the a priori representation of
space is both the object of geometry and the medium in which we perceive spatial
objects. In defending this interpretation of Kant, the project also provides a
new explanation of Kant's defense of the applicability of pure geometry.
