Abstract ATM-9615952 Jin, Fei-fei University of Hawaii Title: Modeling the
Tropical Climate State and its Interannual Variability with Coupled Ocean-
Atmosphere-Land Models This project is a continuation of NSF supported research
which investigates annual and interannual tropical ocean-atmosphere
interactions. The PI intends to study the tropical climate state, its annual
cycle, and interannual variability as well as their interactions using a
conceptual model to outline principal mechanisms. An Intermediate Coupled Model
(ICM) will be used as a main tool for detailed bifurcation study and numerical
simulation to understand the roles of the principal physical processes
highlighted by the simple conceptual model and the ICM. This study will advance
our understanding of the nature of the tropical climate state and its annual and
interannual variability observed in tropical ocean-atmosphere system and
simulated by coupled models.
