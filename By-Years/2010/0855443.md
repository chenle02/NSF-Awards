Optics and optical tools have played a key role in the scientific development
over the last century. In this project, the next generation of optical tools is
developed. Specifically, a method to construct the world's first arbitrary
optical waveform generator is studied. This is a device that will generate
millions of lasers (each with a different color) simultaneously, covering
infrared, visible, and ultraviolet spectral regions. Highly coherent molecular
vibrations and rotations are utilized to generate these lasers. Constructing an
arbitrary optical waveform generator has been one of the biggest challenges
since the invention of the laser in 1960.

Once constructed, such a device will have important applications in broad areas
with a large impact on society: (1) By combining all the lasers with different
colors, flashes of light whose duration is shorter than a femtosecond (a
billionth of a millionth of a second) can be synthesized. As a result, ultrafast
electronic processes that occur on these time scales can be probed and
understood. With this new understanding, new devices with possible applications
in fiber optic communication systems may be constructed. (2) By using all these
lasers with different colors, a large number of atomic and molecular species can
be investigated simultaneously. Chemical structures of complex molecules,
including biological molecules such as proteins, can be much better understood.
(3) Using arbitrary optical waveforms, certain chemical reactions can be laser
controlled with a precision that has never been achieved before. As a result,
specific chemical products (such as drugs) may be synthesized much more
efficiently.
