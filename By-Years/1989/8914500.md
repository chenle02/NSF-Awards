This is a cooperative U.S..Taiwan joint research project on medium energy
physics. This project is cooperated by Dr. Leonard Kisslinger, Carnegie Mellon
University and Dr. W. Y. Pauchy Hwang, National Taiwan University. This is an
important research project studying an interface area between nuclear and
particle physics. This area has not been researched by the physicists in either
the U.S. or Taiwan, and was identified as an important area for collaboration
during the 1988 U.S..Taiwan workshop supported by the AIT.CCNAA. Both the U.S.
and Taiwan P.I.'s are distinguished nuclear physicists. The major research
support for this study is provided by the Taiwan National Science Council; the
NSF funds contribute to the U.S. P.I.'s travel and subsistence. This is a strong
project and can make significant advances in our understanding of medium energy
physics.
