Drosophila that have evolved enhanced longevity usually have reduced early
reproduction. There are also negative correlations between reproduction and
survival characters (e.g. starvation resistance) in D. melanogaster. Similarly,
Drosophila and other organisms that have enhanced survival as a result of
dietary restriction have reduced fertility. What is not clear is how nutrition
and selection might interact with each other in the enhancement of survival,
given that both are affected by this type of trade-off. The central questions
for this project revolve around this interaction: (i) Can genetic trade-offs
between survival and reproduction be surmounted by nutritional manipulation?
(ii) Can selection change the effects of dietary restriction upon survival and
reproduction? Two main experiments are planned. (1) Estimation of genetic
correlations between early fecundity and starvation resistance (a factor that
controls longevity) over four nutritional environments. This experiment would
test the environmental dependence of genetic correlation. (2) Selection for
increased starvation resistance under varying nutritional regimes: high or low
nutrition before starvation and high or low nutrition after starvation but
before egglaying. One of these selection regimes would favor the erosion of the
normal dietary restriction (high then low nutrition), while one would favor it
(low then high nutrition). The experiment would test the degree to which the
dietary restriction response can be genetically changed by selection.
Experiments (1) and (2) might reveal conditions under which trade-off between
fecundity and starvation resistance is circumvented.
