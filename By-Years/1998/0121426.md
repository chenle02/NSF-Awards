Soon, autonomous mobile robots will be used in settings such as elderly
communities, schools, and hospitals to carry out intelligent but "unskilled"
tasks such as delivering food or teaching calisthenics. Humans are integral in
these systems-as operators, as users, and as people who live and work where
robots are employed. This proposal targets critical questions of human-robot
interaction, and of robotic assistants in personal and work settings. The
research involves experiments on mental models of robots and robotic assistants,
ethnographic design research, and organizational field research. The initial
research will aim at design of appropriate roles, tasks, and interactions of
robotic assistants in elderly environments. Later research will address other
domains for using assistive robots. This research builds on cognitive and social
psychology, and design. The research will contribute to theory on people's
interactions with robots, facilitate useful and graceful interactions between
people and robotic assistants, and advance robotic technology and dialogue on
ethical issues surrounding deployment of life-like robots. The research team is
highly multidisciplinary. This project will address major NSF concerns
including: bringing technology to bear for special populations, extending human
capabilities, using technology for collective work, and integrating technology
into social contexts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
