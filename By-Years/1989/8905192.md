The Alleghanian Orogeny in the southern Appalachians includes both thrust fault
and strike-slip fault regimes. A classic fold and thrust belt has been described
in the Valley and Ridge and Blue Ridge provinces and, from seismic reflection,
overthrusts have been projected beneath the Piedmont. Strike- slip has been
documented in several major shear zones. However, the timing between the thrust
movement and the strike-slip move- ment are controversial. This project will
examine a portion of the Grandfather Mountain window near Marion, North Carolina
where both the Linville Falls (thrust) fault and the Brevard (primarily strike-
slip strain indicators) are in close proximity. Shear sense indicators will be
mapped in an attempt to determine relative timing between the different fault
types and to determine the nature of the interaction or overprinting fabric
relations in such a system. Results will help resolve a long- standing question
int he southern Appalachians, and should provide insight into overprinting
fabric development in general.
