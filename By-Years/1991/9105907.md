The objective of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms of regulation of
heme-regulated eIF-2. kinase (HRI) at the molecular structural level. The
specific aims are (1) structure-function relationship of the autokinase and
eIF-2. activities if HRI; (2) molecular mechanisms in the regulation of HRI by
heme. The methods to be employed are recombinant DNA techniques, polymerase
chain reaction, synthesis of oligodeoxynucleotides , high pressure liquid
chromatography, amino acid microsequencing. In vitro transcription and
translation, protein kinase assays, gel electrophoresis, deoxynucleotide
sequencing, expression of HRI protein in recombinant baculovirus,
immunoprecipitation and Western Blot analysis. HRI is a key regulator of protein
synthesis, a process which is essential for the regulation of cell growth,
differentiation, antiviral response and hormonal responses. Structure-function
analysis of HRI will advance our knowledge on the regulation of protein kinases
which are vital in the regulation of various cellular processes.
