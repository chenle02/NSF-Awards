The treatment of large quantities of water and wastewater has relied for
decades upon the use of inexpensive biological reactors in centralized treatment
facilities. More frequently the treatment of contaminated soils is accomplished
by microbial treatment technologies by developing conditions for microbial
degradation of pollutants in soils, or by stimulating in-situ degradation of
microbes capable of degrading target pollutants in contaminated soils, and
ground water aquifers by injecting chemical or microorganisms. Several groups at
the University of Arizona are involved in basics and applied research in which
new microbial- based techniques and processes are developed to reduce
remediation costs and the time required for cleanup. Currently groups
participating in this research, representing the disciplines of Chemical
Engineering, Environmental Engineering, and Soil, Water and Environmental
Science, are dispersed among several locations. Funds from the ARI Program and
the University will be used to renovate an existing laboratory to consolidate
support facilities into a single Environmental Engineering BioProcessing
Laboratory (EEBL). The targeted space for the EEBL is located in the basement of
the Civil Engineering Building constructed in the early 1970's. Existing
conditions make the laboratory unsuitable to conduct modern research.
Renovations will consist of: installing lab benches, modifying electrical and
plumbing systems, and improving the HVAC. New built-in facilities will include:
a fume hood, a walk in refrigerator, a water softening system, acid and base
storage cabinets, and a volatile chemical storage cabinet. Centralizing
environmentally related bioreactor work into a single facility will provide an
important resource for researchers interested in microbial processes. The
project will be instrumental in promoting collaborative interactions among
faculty and students interested in bioremediation and other microbial-based
processes, and ultimately produce high quality research in environmental
microbiology and bioprocessing and general biotechnology activities at the
University.
