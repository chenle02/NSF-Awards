This project involves the deployment of novel mass spectrometric instrumentation
for measuring intermediate-volatility organic compounds (IVOCs) and semivolatile
organic compounds (SVOCs) during the Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS)
scheduled for the summer of 2013. IVOCs and SVOCs may be important species in
the formation and evolution of secondary organic aerosol--a major research focus
of SOAS--but are poorly constrained, and not routinely measured in real time by
commonly available techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deployment of the
instrument to the SOAS ground field site will close a gap in the measurement of
the inventory of organic species, and aid in overall carbon accounting. These
measurements may be helpful for meeting several of the SOAS science objectives,
including understanding the fluxes and oxidation of biogenic carbon, and the
influences of anthropogenic emissions on biogenic
aerosol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support measurements made by a
graduate student, who will gain valuable experience in carrying out atmospheric
chemistry fieldwork, working with researchers from a number of different
institutions, including government and industry scientists.
