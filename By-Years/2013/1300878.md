In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Douglas A. Klumpp of the Department of Chemistry and
Biochemistry at Northern Illinois University will explore synthetic chemistry
involving highly charged cationic species (superelectrophiles). It has been
previously shown that superelectrophiles exhibit large-scale electron
delocalization and these charge-charge repulsive effects can be used to drive
new types of synthetic reactions. Specific synthetic goals include the
preparation of technologically important heterocyclic products, such as indoles,
indolizidines, 2-oxyindoles, and aza-steroids. Several natural product syntheses
will be explored using this chemistry. Superelectrophilic reactions will also be
done to identify synthetic routes to commodity chemicals from biorenewable
feedstock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The successful development of the proposed
chemistry will improve access to a variety of organic products. These chemical
reactions could be valuable to the pharmaceutical, petrochemical,
colorants/dye/pigment, and agricultural chemical industries. With both synthetic
and mechanistic components, the research will be an ideal training ground for
graduate and undergraduate students in chemistry. Moreover, summer research
projects are planned for home-schooled, high school age students-typically, high
achieving students with little access to formal laboratory sciences.
