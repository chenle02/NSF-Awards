This award will support the participation of ten U.S. scientists in a
U.S.-Japan Seminar on Surface Characterization by Electron Diffraction, REM, and
Holography, to be held March 15-18, 1993 in Honolulu. The co-organizers are
Professor Philip I. Cohen, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of
Minnesota, and Professor Ayahiko Ichimiya, Department of Applied Physics, Nagoya
University. The objective of this seminar is to bring together recent advances
in electron probes of surface structures important to the nucleation and growth
of thin films. The electron probes to be emphasized have similar analyses, with
many of the participants involved in more than one aspect. The participants are
from several fields, including electron microscopy, surface science, and
epitaxial growth. This seminar should enhance significantly the interactions
between U.S. and Japanese scientists using new electron probes of new materials,
improve their understanding of these probes, and develop the technology for the
growth of these new thin film materials.
