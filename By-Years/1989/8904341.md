The structure of dienelactone hydrolase (DLH) has been solved and is currently
being refined at high resolution. Dr. Ollis plans to determine the enzymatic
mechanism of DLH using a combination of solution studies and substrate binding
studies with the crystalline protein. He will also structurally and chemically
characterize the catalytic triad of DLH using both diffraction methods and NMR.
In addition, crystals of two proteins that interact with DNA, a single stranded
binding protein and a DNA ligase, have been obtained and will now be studied.
The study of how organisms evolve to utilize new nutrient sources is both
fascinating and of critical importance for the survival of living systems. The
enzyme DLH is an ideal model system to understand this evolution at a molecular
level. DLH is a component of the ketoadipate pathway which operates in bacteria
and fungi and which possesses of a number of different branches, in each of
which catechol or a catechol derivative is catabolized.
