The proposed research utilizes a variety of accelerators in the U.S., Canada and
Europe to study intermediate and high energy nuclear reactions. These studies
examine both the dynamics of the nuclear reactions and the degrees of freedom
required to describe the structure of the nuclear states. The major emphasis of
the program will involve studies of electromagnetic processes. In particular
with the expected completion of CEBAF accelerator in 1994, much of the effort
will be directed toward the experiments associated with the CEBAF. An additional
project involves the construction of a recoil neutron polarimeter (HARP) which
will be used at NIKHEF and CEBAF. The proposed experiments, at CEBAF as well as
NIKHEF and MIT-Bates, address physics questions ranging from the determination
of nuclear structure functions to nucleon-nucleon correlations in nuclei to the
underlying quark structure of baryon resonances. An experiment at even higher
energy to measure J/Psi production in nuclei is being contemplated. Hadron-
induced studies at other facilities will tend to emphasize the measurement of
polarization observable, either with polarized incident particles, polarized
nuclear targets, or both. Such measurements provide additional constraints and
information on the medium corrections to the interactions and the role of
relativity in the processes. //
