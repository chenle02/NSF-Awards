The first phase of this research deals with the effects of prestretch on the
mechanical behavior of elastomers. The second phase of the research deals with
the effects of finite elasticity and reinforcement (fiber structured) on the
stability of both solid and inflated structures. Experimental methods will be
developed and employed to verify the phenomena indicated by the results of the
theoretical studies.
