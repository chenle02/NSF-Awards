This project concerns theoretical and practical aspects of the Homeomorphism
Problem for 3-manifolds (to algorithmically recognize the topological type of a
given 3-manifold). In its full generality, the solvability of this problem is
still an open question, but for a large class of 3-manifolds, the corresponding
problem has been solved. Typically, those algorithms which completely solve a
Recognition Problem are slow (i.e., of exponential time-demand), while the fast
(polynomial-time) algorithms give only partial results. Recently, the
investigator found a complete algorithm for recognizing the "unknot" which is
also fast; however, the proof that the worst-case time-demand is, indeed,
polynomially bounded, is not yet complete. The investigator intends to complete
the work on the fast recognition of the unknot, and to extend the result to some
related recognition problems. He also intends to simplify the older theory by
means of recently discovered results.
