Jolly/Disotell/Phillips-Conroy When two natural populations interbreed, they
tend to become genetically homogenized. If, however, individuals of mixed
ancestry are relatively unfit, a narrow, intervening hybrid zone may persist for
generations, filtering gene-flow between the populations. Many such hybrid zones
are known, but few involve primates, even though hybridization was probably
important in human prehistory. Our study brings together investigators at New
York University, Washington University in St. Louis, and Addis Ababa University,
Ethiopia. It combines powerful, new techniques of genetic analysis with field
observation to investigate hybridization between two baboon populations,
strikingly different in both behavior and appearance, whose ranges meet in
Ethiopia. We have already collected and stored DNA from about a thousand
baboons, of four generations. In three more field seasons we shall complete this
dataset, and clarify ecological influences on hybridization by mapping the
hybrid zone more widely. Each animal will be typed for hypervariable DNA
markers. Their distribution will show how social behavior affects the genetic
structure of the populations, reveal patterns of inter-group migration, and
indicate the darwinian fitness of cross-breeders and their offspring. The result
will be a unique picture of the dynamics of natural hybridization and the
genetics of evolutionary divergence.
