9320297 Cole The Center for Spoken Language Understanding at the Oregon Graduate
Institute of Science and Technology will purchase a file server and disks to
support research in computer and information science and engineering. The
equipment will be used for several research projects, including: language
identification, collection of census via telephone, voice server for spoken
interaction with computers, and research on robustness in speech recognition.
The collection and transcription of telephone speech in many different languages
enables basic research in automatic language identification and the development
of multi-language spoken language systems. The current file server at the Center
has reached it's disk limit. The projects listed require significant amounts of
new data. Some have budgeted disks which will not fit in the current server.
Others require storage not yet available. The new server and disks will have a
much greater capacity and throughput than the old, and will allow the Center to
continue collecting data and developing algorithms for these projects and for
the whole speech research community. *** M{E { .. M{E z MSSP_AM LEX ` n CUSTOM
