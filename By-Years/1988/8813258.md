This research involves the numerical solution of a collection of problems
arising in geophysics, petroleum engineering, and biological contexts. Finite
element procedures and homogenization will be used to continue work on flow of a
compressible fluid in a fractured reservoir. Model problems simulating the
contraction of a viscoelastic muscle will be studied numerically by developing
methods for the numerical solution of the appropriate nonlinear time-dependent
partial differential and integro-differential equations and systems.
