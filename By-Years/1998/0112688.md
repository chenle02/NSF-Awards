ABSTRACT

Information Technology Research (ITR)

Small Proposal

Proposal Id: EIA-0112688 Investigator: Denis Lee Institution: Suffolk
University Title: ITR/PE: Knowledge Acquisition and Effective Development of
Information Technologies/Systems Workers

This award provides support for a 3-year research study to examine the changing
knowledge and skill requirements for different types of Information Technology
(IT) /Information Systems (IS) work. It will investigate how IT/IS workers
acquire the knowledge and information they need for their work and how they
coordinate their work effort with colleagues. It will analyze various important
mechanisms that might facilitate or inhibit these processes. Finally it will
also relate these work-based learning behaviors of IT/IS workers to their
demographic and educational background as well as to performances, professional
development and turnover.
