Litigation campaigns commonly shape public discussion and public policy on
topics ranging from hot-button social issues to technical matters of regulatory
policy. How do campaign organizers decide what to claim, when, and where? How do
these decisions interact with official decisions and grassroots mobilization?
Under these influences, how do litigation campaigns evolve and sometimes grow
and influence public discussion and public policy? Previous studies have
commonly focused on key cases in prominent courts or how legal claims influence
grassroots mobilization. This study will expand the focus to include every
formal claim made by a campaign in every forum, and then will examine how the
relative success of these varying claims in different forums shapes the course
of the campaign over time. The study has broad implications for understanding
law's contribution to, and limits on, public policy. The broader impact also
includes training and education of graduate and undergraduate students.

The campaign to be studied is an effort by environmental groups since 2003 to
block construction of coal-fired power plants nationwide. As part of this
effort, these groups have pursued a wide variety of legal claims in many types
of forums, from local courts and planning commissions to the EPA's
administrative tribunals and federal appellate courts. The research will compile
data on all claims made by the campaign in all forums nationwide over the course
of the campaign, and will then combine these data with publicly-available data
on relevant aspects of the political context at the state and national levels.
The study will be the first comprehensive analysis of a litigation campaign over
time and across both political and legal forums in all relevant jurisdictions.
It is also the first to bring together theoretical insights from three
literatures: studies of the American state, group-based legal mobilization, and
resource mobilization, topics commonly studied separately, and the first to use
a data-compilation method, the catalog of contentious events, adapted from
studies of social movements.
