Geography undergraduate students in this project are becoming immersed in the
scientific aspects of this discipline through a pedagogic atmosphere of
cooperative learning and real-time communication. They engage in active learning
through computer-aided instruction offered by a Virtual Communication and
Spatial Analysis Laboratory (VC-Sal) program. The VC-Sal project also emphasizes
certain major themes. These include animate geography, undergraduate
communication and mentoring relationships using cooperative on-line learning,
and exposing undergraduates to current professional and scientific applications
of geography. There is integration of targeted undergraduate course projects
with existing departmental research, and it is expected that the project will
spur non-majors to attain an understanding of the basic principles and methods
of science.
