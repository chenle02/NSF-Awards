The Rural School Science and Information Technology project serves rural
teachers and students with a curriculum that focuses on applying three
increasingly complex information technology applications (Geographic Information
Systems, modeling/simulation and game development) to environmental sciences.
Sixty teachers will receive summer training and continued support when they
return to their classroom. Approximately 700 students over the three year period
will attend a one-week summer camp and/or participate in after school clubs
where teachers will develop curriculum as they master their IT skills. The
curriculum is aligned with the Washington State Essential Academic Learning
Requirements as well as national technology standards. INTELLECTUAL MERIT: The
RSSIT project moves secondary science teaching beyond the use of GIS in the
classroom to encompass innovative ways of looking at and manipulating scientific
data. While a number of schools use GIS for mapping, few take the materials to a
higher level through the modeling of real-world data and simulations based on
that data. Placing real-world inquiry into a game development context is almost
unheard of in the secondary context, despite the interest of many secondary
students in computer games and the fact that many high quality games create
plausible virtual worlds. BROADER IMPACTS: The combination of training, access
to sophisticated software and support for implementation provides an environment
for successful classroom implementation and eventual dissemination. The
assessment process advances teaching and learning by providing clear learning
targets along with published criteria against which the teachers can measure
their mastery of content and skills.
