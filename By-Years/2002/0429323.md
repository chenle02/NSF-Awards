This proposal presents research, development, deployment and testing of data-
mining and machine learning-based technology for email and instant messaging
data, including attached documents and files, and allowing for a broad range of
applications for criminal investigation (both evidence gathering and evidence
analysis) by law enforcement agencies. This tool can be applied to email and/or
account misuse, user behavior-based analyses such as detecting criminal groups
using email and Instant Messaging accounts that communicate with one another,
and for the purpose of detecting various roles of the individuals that
communicate with each other, as well as the subject matter discussed and
exchanged between parties or groups of corresponding parties. Such investigative
activities are routinely performed today by law enforcement agencies for
criminal intelligence gathering, evidence processing of subpoenaed electronic
records and in the detection of stegonographic communications between suspect
groups of criminals and terrorists. If successful, this research will
substantially improve the productivity of forensic analysis personnel, and
support evidence gathering and tracking.
