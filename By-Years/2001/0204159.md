Symbolic Representation Based Partial Order Methods S. Purushothaman Iyer

Symbolic representations are used in analysis of finite and infinite state
concurrent system. However, they could be subjected to constraint explosion much
like state explosion in analysis of finite state designs of concurrent systems.
The reason for both of these explosions is the consideration of all
interleavings, of a concurrent system, during their analysis.

Partial-order techniques depend upon the notion of independence among actions to
avoid considering all possible interleavings. The proposed research will
investigate the notion of unfolding, which aids both in discovery of independent
actions and in succinctly representing the state space of systems. In
particular, the proposed research will address the following topics:

o How to build unfoldings for real-time automata as available, for instance, in
the tool-set UPPAAL.

o Implementation of an unfolding-based partial order method for UPPAAL.

o A comparative (theoretical) investigation of unfoldings and current partial
order methods, with a view to generalizing unfoldings to other infinite state
systems. o Empirical evaluation of the proposed implementation against current
practices.

The proposed research will aid in faster, and more complete, analysis of
infinite state concurrent systems than is currently possible.
