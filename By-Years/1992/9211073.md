Parallelism inherent in the computationally intensive problems arising in the
simulation of advanced electron devices will be identified and exploited for the
development of novel software tools. Advances, both in the optimization of
algorithms for use on specific machines such as a MasPar MP-1216, as well as in
the simulation of hitherto unexplored device phenomena are targeted. Previous
research involved the development of a numerically intensive simulator for
quantum transport in nanostructured semiconductor devices. A rich set of matrix
problems drawn from this work, including complex valued linear systems
solutions, eigenvalue problems as well as QR, and SV decompositions on regularly
structured matrices, have been identified as candidates for future work on
parallel processing machines. Quite similar matrix problems arise also in the
treatment of electromagnetic waveguides, and the scope of this work can be
readily expanded to include problems in this field as well.
