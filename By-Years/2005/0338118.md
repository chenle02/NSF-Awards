The Iraqi seismic network has the important characteristic of being located at
the western edge of the Zagros Mountain range. This range represents the
convergent tectonic boundary between the Eurasian and the Arabian plates. The
seismic data collected by this network has the unique feature of sampling the
effects of the mountain belts to the east. The tectonic features of this
convergent belt will affect seismic waves propagating from the east. The Iraqi
stations will uniquely record these effects without receiving contaminating data
from other tectonic regions. Currently, a monitoring gap exists from central
Turkey in the north to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in the south, and from Iran in the
east to Israel and Jordan in the west. This gap makes it very difficult to study
the tectonic setting of the region, especially the shallow as well as the deep
structure of the Zagros Mountain. Analysis of regional seismic phases from the
past and future manmade explosions and testing in the region will not be
possible without data from the Iraqi Seismic Stations. The project was planned
to accomplish four main goals: (1) reestablish communications with some of the
Iraqi Seismological and geophysical scientists to assess the conditions of the
seismic stations and their seismic archives, (2) schedule in coordination with
the Iraqi counterparts, a 2 to 3 week visit to the Iraqi Seismological Unit and
the Earth Science Departments at the University of Baghdad and Mosul to assess
the status of the Iraqi seismological archive and the network hardware and
software operational conditions to determine the requirements for future upgrade
and restart; (3) assess the possibilities of future collaboration to start an
updated broadband seismic network in Iraq, and (4)examine the possibilities of
establishing a GSN station in Iraq.
