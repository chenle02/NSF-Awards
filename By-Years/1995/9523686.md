The goal of the Interactive Systems Workshop is to bring together the principal
investigators of the projects within the Interactive Systems program to increase
their awareness of related work from other disciplines within the program, to
foster interchange between the investigators across disciplines. The areas
covered by the Interactive Systems program seek solutions for the key bottleneck
in expanding the usefulness of computer technology today. Whereas hardware or
software resources were once the critical issues, improved communication with
the user has become the most pressing need. While this problem arises in many
areas of computer application and appears in various roles in different NSF
programs, the Interactive Systems Program has the ability to provide a single
locus for research on the core scientific issues that underlie communication
between humans and machines that apply across many application domains. This
workshop takes a step toward pulling together the basic science in the
Interactive Systems area into a single cohesive approach that can address core
issues that apply across many areas of the application of computer technology.
