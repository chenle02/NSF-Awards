Tara Holm's principal focus in this proposal is the role of group actions and
quotients in symplectic and algebraic geometry. While the questions that Holm
and her collaborators plan to address have origins in symplectic and algebraic
geometry, their solutions will involve methods from and have applications to
algebraic topology, mathematical physics, and combinatorics. A fundamental tool
in all of these problems is the momentum map, which relates the geometry and
topology of a Hamiltonian system to the discrete geometry of the momentum
polytope. The PI will use this tool to create a general framework for Lam,
Schilling and Shimozono's combinatorial K-theory calculations of the affine
Grassmannian. Holm and collaborator S. Tolman will use the momentum map to
enhance our understanding of the integral cohomology rings of symplectic
quotients. Together with A. Bertiger and K. Taiplae, Holm will investigate
quantum invariants of symplectic quotients, with applications to combinatorics
and algebraic geometry. There are many examples of spaces endowed with group
actions that are not Hamiltonian systems, but enjoy many of their topological
properties. Together with M. Harada, N. Ray and G. Williams, Holm will study
invariants of orbifolds in the context of toric topology. Holm and A. Pires will
investigate the topology of toric origami manifolds. These are classified by
origami templates, whose combinatorics should provide insight into the
topological invariants of the original manifolds. Finally, Holm and Y. Karshon
are writing a research monograph that will disseminate the powerful methods from
equivariant symplectic geometry that have applications across mathematics to a
wide audience of research mathematicians.

Symplectic geometry is the mathematical framework for describing phenomena in
mathematical physics, from classical mechanics to string theory. The momentum
map is an important tool that translates the symmetries of a physical system
into discrete data. An expert in symplectic geometry, Holm will achieve a deeper
understanding of the relationship between the geometry of a symplectic manifold
and the combinatorics of the moment map data. Together with collaborators, she
will investigate questions whose origins are in symplectic and algebraic
geometry, and whose solutions will have wide applications. The proposed
activities will advance our knowledge in the fields of symplectic geometry,
algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, combinatorics and mathematical physics.
Holm's broader objectives include increasing the participation and visibility of
women in research mathematics, and enhancing the undergraduate experience in
mathematics.
