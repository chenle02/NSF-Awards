Corbett 9510278 Synthetic explorations will be pursued for novel materials among
the metal-rich halides and chalcogenides of the early transition metals and the
physical characterization of these materials. The studies will feature the
unique group of highly reduced compounds in which metal cluster and condensed
cluster phases are stabilized by strongly bound, interstitial elements. The
cluster hosts will include scandium, yttrium and the lanthanides, the halides
will be chlorine, bromine and iodine, the chalcogenides sulfur, selenium and
tellurium. The interstitials in halides will feature the transition metals.
Further characterization of the apparently metallic lanthanides-based compounds
and of the nature of their electronic and magnetic transitions will be
emphasized together with searches for other phases showing unusual properties
and new structures and bonding. Physical properties of interesting phases will
be defined by crystal structure, conductivity, magnetic susceptibility, and
photoelectron spectroscopic measurements and augmented by extended-Huckel (band)
calculations. Particular emphasis will be given to the nature of the bonding and
the physical properties and to new horizons in solid state chemistry. %%% The
need for new materials is well recognized. The long range objectives of the
present program are to expand the boundaries of what is possible in the solid
state, to understand and conceptualize the results as to stability, structure,
bonding and properties and, ultimately, to provide sufficient information and
experience to allow some systemization and reasonable predictions. Several new
and exciting directions are proposed. The new emphases include binary, ternary
and quaternary (interstitial) compounds of lanthanum, an element that has been
investigated very little but which appears to exhibit some distinctive and
remarkable compounds ***
