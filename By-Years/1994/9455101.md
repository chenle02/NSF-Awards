This three-year program sponsored by the California State University Program for
Education and Research in Biotechnology (CSUPERB) promotes updated, current
instruction in molecular life sciences and biotechnology at the undergraduate
level. The program offers summer workshops in molecular life sciences and
biotechnology for comprehensive university and community college faculty,
complementing the current CSUPERB faculty enhancement program of workshops for
the inexperienced in molecular biology. There are a total of eight advanced
workshops: two each of the HPLC Workshop (CSU Fullerton), the Recombinant DNA
and PCR Workshop (San Diego State University), the Cell Culture Workshop (CSU
Hayward), and one each of the Molecular Approaches to Immunology Workshop (CSU
Long Beach) and the Nucleic Acid and Protein Sequence Computer Analysis Workshop
(San Diego State University). Follow-up sessions are coordinated with the annual
CSUPERB Symposium and Conference held at the Cal-Poly Pomona campus.
