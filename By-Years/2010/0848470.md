This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program in the Division of Chemistry supports work by Professors Carolyn Cassady
and David Dixon at the University of Alabama - Tuscaloosa aimed at enhanced
understanding of the gas-phase chemistry of deprotonated amino acid amides and
peptides, in order ultimately to provide new approaches to mass spectrometric
structure elucidation supporting proteomics and related studies. Combined
experimental and computational efforts will provide insight into fragmentation
and thermodynamic properties. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work exposes a diverse
group of both graduate and undergraduate students to important interdisciplinary
research areas, providing them with tools that will prepare them to contribute
to a wide range of chemical biology challenges. Both PIs have also been actively
engaged in outreach activities, exposing large numbers of students to the
powerful computational and analytical tools utilized in their laboratories.
