Funding has been provided through an International Travel Grant to permit
attendance and presentation of a paper at the Second International Symposium on
Engineering Turbulence Modeling and Measurements, May 31 -June 2, 1993, in
Florence. The research involved Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of turbulence
aimed at directly assessing the influence of ambient turbulence on the transport
mechanisms, in the wall boundary layer, from the flow to the wall. Ambient
turbulence in the free stream is known to influence transfer into the wall, and
it is an important factor in a broad variety of engineering flow systems.
