0213546&lt;br/&gt;Casey&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will permit the purchase
of a new 500 MHz NMR spectrometer to complement the existing spectrometer in the
Keck Solid-State NMR Facility at the University of California at Davis. This new
instrument is a wide-bore 500 MHz spectrometer with all of the features
necessary for state-of-the-art multi-resonance, multi-dimensional studies of
solid samples. The new spectrometer will be used for studies in Chemistry,
Materials Science and Earth Science, although the principal investigators (PIs)
of this proposal are earth scientists with immediate research needs. The PIs
have integrated research that examines the earliest stages of mineral growth
from solution and the controls on reaction rates. The PIs research groups rely
heavily on NMR spectroscopy because it provides structural and kinetic
information on X-ray amorphous materials in situ, including information about
rates of chemical exchange over a large range in timescales. Purchase of this
new spectrometer is supported by the University of California because it is also
key to campus initiatives for growth of interdisciplinary research and faculty
recruitment in the Earth and Environmental Sciences. Environmental materials are
commonly poorly crystalline oxides or biomolecules where NMR spectroscopy is
often the only suitable method for determining structure.&lt;br/&gt;
