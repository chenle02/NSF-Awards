This is an award to support exploratory research on a technique to identify and
quantify viral content of environmental waters. The technique is based on
artificial synthesis of nucleic acid sequences that will be used as primers for
a polymerase chain reaction that amplifies the nucleic acid chain of the target
virus for identification and quantification. This proposal was submitted to NSF
under conditions outlined in NSF 89-85, Small Grants for Exploratory Research
(SGER). The proposed research addresses limitations of current approaches for
determining the quality of a water supply by use of surrogate parameters rather
than by search and analysis for the target itself.
