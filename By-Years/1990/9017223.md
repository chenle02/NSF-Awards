This research inolves the study of nonlinear phenomena in ferromagnetic thin
films. In thin films there are a samller number of magneto-exchange modes which
simplifies the comparison with theory because the truncation process (of the
Hamiltonian) becomes simpler. The plan is to study samples with different
thicknesses thus having different densities of magnetostatic modes, determining
the dependences on magnetization, anisotropy energy, temperature and frequency.
There will also be an effort to replace some of the magnetic ions with
nonmagnetic ions to study the effect on the spinwave dispersion coefficient. In
addition to mode locking and modes suppression the effects of noise will also be
investigated. The analytical model will be extended to incorporate more modes to
obtain better results. The effects of hidden modes will be considered, and the
validity of the random phase approximation will be examined, with the
possibility of removing this requirement on the non-excited modes.
