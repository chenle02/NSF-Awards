Abstract ATM-9415947 Pillsbury, R. Dale Oregon State University Title: BEST:
Benguela Current Sources and Transport, Current Meter Data Analysis The BEST
(Benguela Current Sources and Transport) program was designed to monitor the
transport of the Benguela Current during 1992-1993 and relate its variability to
regional phenomena, such as the Agulhas Retroflection and eddy shedding. The
Project OCE- 9116922 was funded at Oregon State University for three years
starting August 1, 1991 to prepare, install and recover the current meter
moorings used as a part of the field work for BEST. This grant will continue
that work and analyze those data to assist in their integration into the much
larger data set collected by BEST. The scientific objectives and methodology
were described in the original proposal. The data set consists of a June 1992 to
November 1993 moored array of Inverted Echo Sounders, Pressure/Inverted Echo
Sounders, and Current Meters; CTD data set along the line of mooring deployments
during June 1992, November 1993 and a more extensive set of stations in May
1993. The analysis will be carried out by A. L. Gordon, LDEO, (specialty-water
mass stratification; S.L. Garzoli (specialty-IES/PIES), also at LDEO, after her
assignment with NSF; and Dale Pillsbury, OSU, (specialty-current meters). This
research is important because it seeks to provide new knowledge about ocean
currents and transports that would enhance our ability to understand and model
ocean circulations.
