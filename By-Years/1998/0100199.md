The long-term goal of this research is development of a piezoelectric-based
cochlear implant, while complementing research in existing implant technology
and to the understanding of hearing processes. The device will utilize the
incoming mechanical energy into the cochlea to generate electrical charge by
virtue of the piezoelectric effect, and stimulate surviving nerve fibers in the
cochlea. Another goal will be to overcome challenges in the fabrication of
miniature piezoelectric devices, and gain insights into their properties.
Compared to currently used cochlear implants, this unit is self-contained and
designed to work without any signal amplifiers or transmission elements, greatly
simplifying the stimulation process. A considerable amount of background
research has already been performed in our laboratories, both in vivo and in
vitro. Results have demonstrated feasibility, and have indicated the need to
focus on device analysis and development. A device utilizing bending mode
piezoelectricity has been designed. The design is flexible, allowing a number of
engineering parameters to be varied to obtain optimum performance. Specific aims
of the proposed research are to: a) determine the dynamic acoustical
piezoelectric properties of PVDF in the bending mode; b) systematically evaluate
device performance as a function of engineering variables; c) perform in vitro
testing in a mechanical model of the cochlea; and, d) study the nature of
mechanical forces in the cochlea to enhance transducer performance. Research
will involve collaborations with acoustics, biophysics and polymer surface
treatment specialists to improve upon the initial efforts and bring to fruition
an implantable device.
