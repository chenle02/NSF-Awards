Two software systems, RRL (the Rewrite Rule Laboratory) SATO (SAtisfiability
Test Optimized), developed under the past grant, have been successfully used for
solving many problems often considered a challenge for automated theorem
provers, including several dozens of open problems in quasigroups. The current
research will further increase the reasoning power of RRL and SATO. The
objectives of this research are to develop new high performance reasoning
algorithms, and to apply these algorithms in specification and verification of
hardware and software, and in solving open problems in algebra, logic and
combinatorics. The research focuses on constraint satisfaction and automated
mathematical induction. The topics include efficient constraint propagation,
parallel and distributed reasoning, intelligent induction schemata formulation,
management of large proofs, and implementation and experimentation of all the
involved algorithms. Practical problems will be chosen from software and
hardware design verification and combinatorics as test problems for both RRL and
SATO. Both systems will be enhanced to meet the need of large-scale applications
by user-friendly interfaces. Special effort will be made to distribute RRL and
SATO to the automated reasoning community worldwide.
