This project is working to instill an interest in mathematics, science, and
engineering careers in Hispanic high school students and enhance their
mathematics and science skills. One hundred and twenty high school students are
participating in the project activities. The students, after school, work in
teams studying mathematics and science. Each student is assigned two mentors, an
engineer and an engineering student. The mentors serve as role models and
resource persons to provide the students with realistic information about
careers in engineering. The students and their mentors meet as a group several
times during the school year. The students also visit and observe their mentors
at work, The project utilizes the methods and approaches of "El Ingeniero", a
career education/mathematics and science enrichment program which has been
identified as an exemplary program in "Changing America: The New Face of Science
and Engineering", the final report of the Task Force on Women, Minorities, and
the Disabled in Science and Technology.
