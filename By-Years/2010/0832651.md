Professors Martin F. Jarrold, Bogdan Dragnea, Stephen C. Jacobson, Peter J.
Ortoleva, and James P. Reilly at Indiana University are supported by the
Collaborative Research in Chemistry Program to address how supramolecular
assemblies, such as viruses, are built from their component macromolecules as
well as how structural transitions occur in the assembled complexes. The self-
assembly of supramolecular complexes spans time scales from nanoseconds to
hundreds of seconds and length scales from nanometers to micrometers.
Intermediates in these processes will be monitored by interfacing current and
new mass spectrometry techniques with microfluidic devices capable of reaction
control and opto-electronic detection. Experimental studies are integrated with
a multi-scale theoretical approach. The new methodologies are being tested on
simple icosahedral viruses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The highly collaborative
approach taken in this program will provide graduate students and postdoctoral
researchers with cross-disciplinary training, positioning them to make
significant scientific and technical contributions. Talented undergraduate
students from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology and Prairie View A&amp;M
University work at Indiana University during the summer months and continue
their projects at their home institutions with the assistance of collaborating
faculty during the academic year. Tutorials on the use of multiscale simulation
software will be produced and made available by the Indiana University
Nanoscience Center.&lt;br/&gt;
