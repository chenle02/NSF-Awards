Rapid advances in research on magnetism and magnetic materials are occurring in
geophysics, geochemistry, nanoscience, condensed-matter physics, and to a great
extent, along the boundaries between these fields. An interdisciplinary
discussion of critical developments in the geoscience applications of fine-
particle magnetism, and their fundamental physical foundations, will help to
advance our understanding of Earth's surface environment and its deep interior.
This award will provide partial support to hold a Conference on Rock Magnetism
and its Applications, June 26-29, 2014 in Santa Fe NM, continuing a biennial
series of such conferences. St. John's&lt;br/&gt;College will serve as the
venue. Support will help cover the facility-use costs and to provide partial
coverage of participant travel expenses (full coverage for invited plenary
speakers and on-campus accommodations for other participants).
