This grant provides funding to host a workshop on Humanitarian Logistics
Research. Humanitarian logistics (HL) is involved with the transportation,
handling, and distribution of the critical supplies needed by both the
population that survives a disaster, and the disaster response itself.
Inefficient HL leads to massive human suffering if the population needs are not
met, or if critical disaster response functions-such as search and rescue,
medical assistance, among other-slow down, or come to a halt, due to the lack of
critical supplies. Regrettably the amount of research on this subject of
national importance is not commensurate with its importance. Adding to the
problem, only a tiny number of researchers in logistics study the realities of
HL, the practitioners that have disaster research experience have almost no
contact with these researchers, while the social scientists with expertise in
disasters have very few interactions with the scholars in HL. These important
groups of stakeholders-logisticians, social scientists, and practitioners-tend
not to work together to improve the important field of HL. The main objectives
of this workshop are to address this issue by: (1) providing a forum for the
exchange of ideas and experiences between practitioners and researchers from all
relevant disciplines (e.g., social sciences, engineering, logistics) on the
subject of HL; (2) helping break barriers and establish links of communication
between research communities that typically do not interact with each other;
and, (3) defining the key components of a research agenda to addresses basic
research needs on HL.

To achieve its objectives, the workshop will be structured around presentations
on the topics of "The Realities of Humanitarian Logistics;" "The Social Side of
Humanitarian Logistics;" "The Analytics of Humanitarian Logistics;" and
"Research Needs on Humanitarian Logistics." These presentations will be followed
by breakout discussions to define research agendas on: "The Social Sciences of
Humanitarian Logistics" and "The Analytics of Humanitarian Logistics." A plenary
discussion will synthesize a comprehensive research agenda. A workshop report
will summarize the work done and the key insights of the discussion. The
workshop is an extremely cost-effective way to gather worldwide expertise on a
subject of national significance, as amply demonstrated by the recent disaster
of Super Storm Sandy, and Hurricanes Irene and Lee. The workshop will have a
profound impact on the definition of a forward looking research that, by tapping
into the expertise of leading scholars from multiple disciplines, addresses the
basic research needs of the country to enhance the efficiency of the HL
procedures at the core of disaster response procedures.
