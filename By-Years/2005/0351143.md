McGuire&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt; Aseismic fault slip is one of the most
important processes in plate tectonics. Oceanic transforms are advantageous for
understanding aseismic fault slip because about 90% of the plate motion is
aseismic and only about 10% results in earthquakes. This project will deploy as
acoustic ranging system across the Discovery transform fault for one year that
will be contemporaneous with a deployment of ocean bottom seismometers. The
combination of this instrumentation, Discovery's fast slip rate, and the mixture
of seismic and aseismic slip on the Discovery fault will yield constraints on
the portions of the fault that fail seismically and aseismically. Inferences
about the seismic and aseismic regions of the fault will be combined with both
passive and active source seismic imaging results that will relate the behavior
of the transform to rock mechanics knowledge about the deformation properties of
basalt, gabbro, serpentine, and peridotite.&lt;br/&gt;
