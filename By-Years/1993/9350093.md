9350093 Elwood The Milwaukee Public Schools seeks funding for a self
study\planning grant for the development of: 1. a policy making structure that
stimulates stakeholder collaboration; 2. a community mindset that recognizes the
importance of mathematics and science; 3. a set of mathematics and science
standards; 4. a systemic process to review and assess program success. The
Commission 2000 will establish the bounds of the study, establish a structure
for continued guidance and monitoring of mathematics and science education
reforms and review the products generated by the self study. A Working Group
comprised of Milwaukee constituencies will conduct the work of the self study. A
Project Steering Committee will facilitate the work of the Steering Committee
and provide direction and feedback during the self study. Upon completion of the
study, a final document will be developed that will include a "State of the
District" report and recommendations for improvement. ***
