9301210 Lynch This award will support the collaborative effort between computer
scientists Lynch, Rice, and Marinescu and biologist Rossman. The principal
research issues to be addressed are: 1) The analysis of biological
macromolecular structures, with emphasis on viruses, virus-receptor and virus-
antibody complexes; the study of new antiviral compounds that interact with
viral capsids, interfere with viral-receptor interaction, or inhibit uncoating.
2) The development and analysis of parallel algorithms for film and imaging
plate processing, phase determination by molecular replacement, refinement and
structure analysis in the study of biological macromolecular molecules or
assemblies such as viruses. ***
