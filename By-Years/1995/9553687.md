The proposed project involves the development of a "Welding Lab on Disk," a
sophisticated interactive computer simulation software package, to supplement
and complement hands-on welding laboratory experiences for welding technology
students. The project integrates the development of instructional media, teacher
enhancement, and instrumentation and laboratory improvement via a coalition of
Northern Illinois University, and Rock Valley College, a two-year community
college in the northern Illinois region. The goals of the project are to enhance
students' understanding of the interdisciplinary nature of advanced welding
technology, to minimize laboratory-related costs, hazards, and environmental
pollution, to motivate teachers via application of computer simulation and
research participation, and to attract women and minorities into advanced
technology programs. Preliminary development and research findings, documented
by the recent publications of the principal investigator, have shown that the
proposed computer software package will result in good engineering economy and
high pedagogical effectiveness. An advisory and evaluation board of outside
experts will provide additional expertise and experience. The proposed project
will complement future research and development activities leading to "Advanced
Technology Labs on Disk."
