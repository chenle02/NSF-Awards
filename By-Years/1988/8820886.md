In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Physical Chemistry Program
of the Chemistry Division, Professor Taylor will apply nonlinear dynamics to
chaotic unassignable atomic and molecular spectra to extract detailed
information about regular dynamic motions over short time intervals. By Fourier
transforming limited regions of high resolution spectra it will be shown that
periodic orbits mimic the dominant chaotic motion. Resonant scattering theory
and stabilization methods will be used to compute ladders of resonant states
which interact with the chaotic quasi-continuum. The motion on the periodic
orbits supplies molecular motion whose quantization causes the low resolution
spectra. Applications will be considered for the chaotic spectra of acetylene
and the sodium trimer.
