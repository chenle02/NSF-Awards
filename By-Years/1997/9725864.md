9725864 Filloux The goal of this project is to characterize electromagnetically
Archaean cratonic roots, specifically the root of the southern and central
portion of the Slave craton in Canada. The results of this study will be
combined with ongoing broadband magnetotelluric, reflection seismic, passive
seismic and related geological studies of the Canadian Lithoprobe Transect
SNORCLE to help improve understanding of the nature and origin of deep cratonic
roots. Proven oceanic magnetotelluric technology installed in strategically
located lakes on the Archaean Slave province will be used to conduct very deep
magnetotelluric probing of cratonic root structure. Information on the depth
extent of the root electrically, any lateral variation in its structure, and its
deep electrical anisotropy will be obtained. These results combined with those
from SNORCLE will help address questions on the structure and composition of the
deep crust and mantle beneath the oldest craton and are relevant to the
understanding of how Archaean cratons have been modified over the past 4 Ga. In
addition, various hypotheses on the formation of continental lithosphere in
general can be tested with the data to be collected. ***
