This project in theoretical gravitational physics is concerned with a broad
range of research in gravitational physics, including quantum gravity, quantum
field theory in curved spacetime, classical general relativity, and some
astrophysically oriented research. The mathematical properties of the Wheeler-
DeWitt equation on superspace will be investigated, particularly with regard to
the existence of an initial value formulation and to the study of the asymptotic
behavior of solutions in the limit as the spatial geometry is scaled to "zero
size". Issues in quantum field theory in curved spacetime such as the validity
of the "averaged null energy condition" and the "chronology protection
conjecture" will be analyzed. Numerous topics in classical gravitation will be
investigated, including the issue of how the entropy of a non-stationary black
hole should be defined in a general theory of gravity, and the conditions under
which a "second law" will hold. The main goals of this research are to obtain a
deeper understanding of mathematical and physical issues in general relativity,
and to make progress towards formulating a quantum theory of gravitation.
