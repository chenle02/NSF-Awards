This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase I project will prove that
homogeneous, low-loss TiO2 and YVO4 crystals can be produced via commercially
viable hydro-thermal crystal growth processes. Recently, a program to grow
homogeneous YVO4 and TiO2 birefringent crystals using hydro-thermal growth
methods had preliminary results that indicate that these crystals can be grown
in hydro-thermal solutions at ~ 500 degrees C. The crystals appear to have
superior optical properties. In particular, hydro-thermal TiO2 and YVO4 should
display greatly improved birefringence homogeneity and lower optical loss. These
improvements will allow more compact, higher performance, higher efficiency
components used in optics, photonics, telecom, and laser devices, equipment, and
systems.

The broader impact of this technology would be as optical switching, optical,
and networking. The demand for crystals used in optical components is expected
to skyrocket. Over 10 million optical components (isolators, circulators, beam
splitters, etc.) were sold in 2001, and that demand is expected to increase
significantly in the next few years. The number of crystals used in optical
components is expected to be three orders of magnitude higher than the volume
used in solid state lasers.
