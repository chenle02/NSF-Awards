The PI will continue studies on the processes that control the stratigraphy of
sedimentary basins, including tectonics, sedimentation and climate. The
combination of data analysis and modeling provide insight to the evolution of
process rates and dominance in the relation between stratigraphic sequence and
surface phenomena. Application of this research area to foreland basins is
particularly important to continental history.
