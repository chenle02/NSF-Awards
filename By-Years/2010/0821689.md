This is a project to build a near infrared capability into the Robert Stobie
Spectrograph (RSS) for the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) 11 meter
telescope. With this capability, the RSS will be able to simultaneously record
spectroscopic data in the visible and the near infrared. This capability will
open a new window for the discovery and study of the most distant and earliest
galaxies in the universe by measuring the onset of star-formation and the
luminosity function of the first star-forming galaxies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project will contribute to the training of a new generation of astronomical
instrumental scientists including postdoctoral researchers, graduate students
and undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;
