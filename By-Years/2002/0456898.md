This collaborative experimental research program will use femtosecond laser
pulses focused to intensities of 10^17 - 10^19 Watts per square centimeter to
examine the high intensity nonlinear optical properties of droplets. The PI's
intend to answer the question of how light at relativistic intensity interacts
with particles comparable in size to the light's wavelength. The interaction
will be probed by measuring (a) the electron energy spectrum and hard x-ray
emission that result from it, and (b) the high order harmonic generation that
results from the nonlinear polarizability created when electrons are strongly
driven around the particles. A variety of prepulse techniques will be employed
to control the level of ionization on the particle surface and its plasma scale
length. Ultimately, the experiments proposed here will study light-matter
interactions that take place when the matter consists of particles that have
been fabricated to respond resonantly with the irradiating field. The broader
impact of the program will significantly add to the scope and number of research
opportunities available to physics students at Harvey Mudd, and will support the
education of graduate students at U.T. Austin.
