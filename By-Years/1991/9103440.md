This grant is to continue a coordinated program of theoretical modeling and
analysis of existing satellite data directed toward an improved understanding of
the interaction of the solar wind with the terrestrial magnetosphere-ionosphere
system. Key elements of the work include: (A) quantitative time-dependent
modeling of the open magnetospheric field configuration and the resultant
mapping of the solar-wind electric field to the polar caps; (B) empirical study
of polar- cap convection patterns and of the polar-cap potential drop under
time-variable solar-wind/IMF conditions; and (C) empirical study of thermal and
suprathermal electron populations above auroral acceleration regions and their
mapping to the magnetotail plasma sheet. The modeling efforts combine the
flexibility and physical clarity of analytical formulations with the
computational power of modern supercomputers. The data analysis efforts combine
multiple spacecraft datasets to address specific questions posed by theory. The
close coordination of modeling and data-analysis activities has a synergistic
effect on understanding the complex solar-terrestrial system.
