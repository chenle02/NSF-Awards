Measurements of Turbulence and flow Structure in the Water Column of the Coastal
Ocean using PIV&lt;br/&gt;Thomas Osborn and Joseph Katz&lt;br/&gt;John Hopkins
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A novel and unique measurement system will be
deployed to obtain measurements of oceanic turbulence. A submersible PIV system
will be used during 3 campaigns at SABSOON, a coastal observatory in the South
Atlantic Bight, to measure turbulence and mean flow characteristics in the
bottom 10 m of the water column and to compare these to stratification, wave
climate, and circulation. Reynolds stresses, dissipation, production, transport,
and buoyancy flux will be related to elevation, mean velocity distribution,
shear, stratification, Richardson number, and wave phase. When and where a local
balance between production, dissipation, and buoyancy flux holds will be
explored. The correlation, or lack thereof, between turbulent and wave stresses
will be investigated. The origin of gusts will be characterized. In the context
of Large Eddy Simulation (LES) modeling, subgrid scale (SGS) turbulent stresses
will be compared to typical parameterizations. Wave-turbulence separation will
be performed using a version of the Trowbridge technique. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
