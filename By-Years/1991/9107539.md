Previous work on photoeffect calculations will be extended to provide
information concerning open shell atoms and large Z atoms and ions. Attention
will also be given to ionization plus excitation phenomena and to the study of
electron spectra obtained in ion-atom collisions. The overall aim is to provide
a basic understanding of the physical phenomena involved in a particular process
using the simplest calculational procedure possible.
