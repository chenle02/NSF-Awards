The project aims at developing geometric methods to solve a variety of
algorithmic problems regarding various combinatorial structures. The problems
include enumeration of lattice points in certain sets (such as sets defined by
formulas of Presburger arithmetic), asymptotic counting of combinatorial
structures of a given type (such as bases in matroids), and understanding metric
and combinatorial properties of some universal convex bodies (such as the convex
cone of non-negative multivariate polynomials). The proposed approaches include
developing computationally efficient techniques of working with multivariate
rational functions, understanding properties of very large finite metric spaces,
and applying methods from convex geometry.

In combinatorics, we are interested in working with finite, although very large,
sets, where methods of classical analysis often fail because the main objects
are no longer smooth but discrete. The project aims at developing efficient
computational methods for some previously intractable problems dealing with
exact or approximate enumeration in very large sets and finding maximum
(minimum) of functions defined on large sets. Many of the considered problems
are of interest to statistics, physics and optimization.
