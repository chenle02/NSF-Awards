Firing 9730953 The direct velocity measurements collected under the hydrographic
program of the World Ocean circulation Experiment (WOCE) will be combined
together with other observations to provide a complete description of the ocean
current field in the Pacific. Both shipboard and lowered Acoustic Doppler
Current Profiler (ADCP) data will be used in regional and basin-wide analyses.
The observations will be compared with the out put of general circulation and
tidal models to assess the temporal context of the observations.
