This project addresses mathematical, algorithmic, and computational issues for
coupling the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations and the three-dimensional
nonlinear elastodynamic equations to achieve high-order accuracy. The
transmission conditions between the fluid and structure will be enforced exactly
with the proposed formulation, which allows for the fluid and structure sub-
problems to be computed independently and in parallel, greatly facilitating the
solution of such systems on massively parallel computers. The elastodynamic
equations and the Navier-Stokes equations are solved employing identical set of
high-order basis functions, substantially simplifying the implementation of
transmission conditions between the fluid and the structure. Scalable algorithms
for efficient computations of large-scale fluid-structure problems are proposed
and investigated.

Fluid-structure interaction is omnipresent in natural and man-made environments,
and underlies many engineering, physical and biological applications. Wind
rustling leaves and ringing chimes, hurricanes breaching levees and destroying a
community or an entire city, circulating blood in normal or diseased arteries
inducing favorable conditions for the formation of aneurysms or atherosclerotic
plaques, are several immediate examples. The proposed research will enable
accurate computations of fluid-structure interactions. This will bring about
unprecedented predictive capabilities and profoundly impact many scientific
disciplines.
