The Graduate Climate Conference will take place Nov 6-8, 2015 at the Marine
Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole MA. The goal of the conference is to foster
a scholarly community focused on collaborative research into the nature of
climate and the impacts of climate and climate change on society. The conference
will bring together students with diverse academic and personal background and
offers a supportive atmosphere where they can learn from one another. This
opportunity allows graduate students to familiarize themselves with the breadth
of climate science as well as the enormous range of tools available to help
answer complex questions. Participation from diverse members of the graduate
climate science community will be sought. A significant lasting impact of this
conference is the participants' interaction with their contemporary early-career
colleagues; providing this contact information will increase the speed at which
scientific progress can be made by facilitating graduate students with a
professional network of young climate scientists.
