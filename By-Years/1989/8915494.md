The Antarctic Research Series, begun in 1963 with the aid of a grant from the
National Science Foundation, publishes the results of all phases of antarctic
research. Volumes have provided extensive and authoritative reports of research
results in marine and terrestrial biology, solid earth geophysics and
geochemistry, oceanic and atmospheric studies, and geology. These volumes are
designed to serve the entire community of working scientists, students, and
laymen interested in biological or physical sciences. Volumes are devoted to a
single topic or occasionally a particular geographic area. In soliciting,
reviewing, and selecting papers for publication, particular attention is paid to
providing an attractive publication outlet for the work done under the U.S.
Antarctic Program. To date, 98 volumes (over 11,000 pages, including a special
collection of papers in Reviews of Geophysics, have been published. An
additional 600 plus pages are currently in press. The series is recognized by
the scientific and library communities who look to it to provide continuing
access to south polar results. The Board of Associate Editors for the Antarctic
Research Series has recently expanded the modes of publication to better meet
the needs of the research community.
