"Surface Modification of Stainless Steels to Enhance Passivation" This
investigator examines the application of a square wave voltage (AV) to stainless
steels that are immersed in an electrolyte. The idea is to significantly
increase the stability of the passive film on the stainless steel by the AV
processing. Experiments are being conducted to show the general applicability of
the process to other stainless steels, examine the pertinent experimental
variables, explore subsequent treatments to enhance the passivity, and study the
surface chemistry to gain knowledge on the mechanisms creating the enhanced
passivity. %%% The approach is unique, a totally new process for stainless
steels, representing a significant modification to existing practice. If
successful, the approach could eventually lead to new, simple procedure for
improving the corrosion resistance of stainless steels through surface
modification.
