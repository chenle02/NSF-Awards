9603168 Zook Dr. Zook is an expert in the biochemistry of plant secondary
product metabolism with special focus on sesquiterpene metabolism. The
importance of this pathway as the main producer of plant defense molecules has
propelled the biochemical understanding of the enzymes in the pathway to the
forefront of plant/pathogen interaction biochemistry. The proposal is about a
well-planned antisense strategy with which defined phytoalexins, products of
sesquiterpene synthesis, or the entire pathway, are eliminated by antisense
technology. Additionally, synthesis will be enhanced by over-expression. The
model organism is potato and the analysis of plants will include measurements at
the gene expression, biochemical and physiological levels. It can be expected
that the work produces fundamental knowledge about the importance or absolute
essentiality of phyoalexins and will provide information of fundamental
importance for our understanding of plant/pathogen interaction and how to
manipulate such interaction in the future.
