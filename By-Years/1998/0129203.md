This award provides support to 8 US participants, including graduate students
and junior faculty, in a US-France joint workshop on genome analysis of the
plant pathogen, Erwinia Chrysanthemi 3937 in Lyon, France, July 2002. The
workshop, organized by Nicole T. Perna of the University of Wisconsin and Nicole
Cotte-Pattat of the Institut National des Sciences Appliquees de Lyon, France,
brings together researchers in genomics and Erwinia biology. The goals are: to
discuss strategies for completing the sequencing of E. chrystanthemi genome and
methods of genome analysis; to develop standards for annotation (predict genes
and their functions); to train on a web-based multi-user annotation system; and
to forge collaborations for post-sequencing projects. This workshop affords an
opportunity for the ultimate end-users of the Erwinia genome sequence data to
create the annotation and a solid framework for future research partnerships.

This award represents the US side of joint proposals to the NSF and the French
National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS). NSF will cover travel to France
and living expenses of US researchers and graduate students. The CNRS will
support the travel of the French researchers to the workshop.
