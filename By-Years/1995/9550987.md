Through this project, an Intelligent Data-Acquisition and Control (IDAC) system
is provided for the energy conversion laboratory. Each of four experimental
stations in the energy conversion laboratory is equipped with a self-contained
IDAC system comprising a LabVIEW (data-acquisition, control and presentation)
system, PC-computation base, C-language compiler, Fuzzy-logic development
system, sensors, and actuators. The intelligent system facilitates real-time
data acquisition, provides automatic control, and presents experimental results
graphically. A renewed interest in the electrical power system engineering
technology option is underway, and the proposed laboratory upgrade project
better prepares graduates for employment in the electrical utility industry.
