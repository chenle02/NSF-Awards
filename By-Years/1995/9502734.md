9502734 Ali The goal of the research aspect of this work is to propose a
multilayered network architecture that is robust to future evolution in network
topologies or transmission formats and bit rates. This is achieved by
introducing an all-optical transparent layer in the transport network hierarchy.
Such a network must be able to support all types of existing and future network
services. The network must also be scalable to handle large geographical areas,
while having the flexibility to adapt to shifting traffic patterns. The proposed
multilayered network architecture satisfies these objectives by combining
optical wavelength division-multiplexing (WDM) with synchronous optical
networking (SONET) and asynchronous-transfer mode (ATM) networking. The
educational aspect of this proposal focuses n developing and coordinating an
undergraduate/graduate optical communications/lightwave networks curriculum in
our department. The ultimate goal is to prepare, in an accessible style using
undergraduate level reasoning, a new generation of undergraduate students who
can fully understand and appreciate the "all optical" revolution in networking
that fiber optic technology is producing. ***
