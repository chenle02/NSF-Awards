Design of cyber-physical systems today relies on executable models. Designers
develop models, simulate them, find defects, and improve their designs before
the system is built, thus greatly reducing the design costs. However, current
model-based design methods lack support for model libraries (creating and
exchanging models as "black boxes"), tool interoperability (allowing models to
be co-simulated by multiple tools), and multi-view modeling (allowing to combine
models that "live in different worlds", for instance, a control-logic model with
an energy-consumption model). This project seeks to remedy this by developing a
compositional modeling framework based on interfaces. Interfaces allow submodels
to be treated as black boxes, exposing relevant information while hiding
internal details. &lt;br/&gt;Success of the project will provide a solid
theoretical foundation for compositionality in cyber-physical systems.
Compositionality is a key property in system design, allowing to build systems
in a scalable and modular manner. This project will enable the construction of
model libraries, allowing the exchange of models developed by different teams,
potentially coming from different disciplines and using different modeling
languages and tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the considerable economic and
societal impact of cyber-physical systems in general, the proposed project will
have considerable impact on engineering and computer science education. Its
focus on a rigorous and unified modeling theory will erode the boundaries
between the currently separated cyber-physical system sub-disciplines that
hamper competitiveness of our students. Finally, the project is strategically
important for the competitiveness of the United States as it strengthens its
presence in international standardization efforts for model exchange and co-
simulation.
