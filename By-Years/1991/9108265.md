This research examines the corrosion behavior of amorphous metals. The focus is
on transition metal/metalloid alloys and the mechanisms of formation of stable,
protective, passive oxide films on the surface of the alloys. Several
experimental techniques are used to characterize the films and study their
stability in various environments. The application of photoelectron spectroscopy
in conjunction with photoelectrochemical and standard electrochemical techniques
aids in clarifying the role of alloying elements in the formation of the passive
films. A fundamental understanding of passive film breakdown should result from
the research. %%% This research should lead to the development of new
experimental techniques, improvement in the understanding of passive films on
metal alloys, and improved chemistry to enhance the corrosion resistance of
transition metal/metalloid magnetic materials.
