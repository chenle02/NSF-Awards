This three year REU Site program is a collaborative effort between Texas A&amp;M
University (TAMU) and the University of Texas at Brownsville (UTB). The
undergraduate students will engage in hands-on research projects related to
energy and propulsion. Specific topics include alternative fuels combustion,
materials for energy conversion and storage, biodiesel fuels, advanced energy
conversion using supercritical CO2, wind energy research, and hypersonic
propulsion, among others. In addition to the scientific research that will be
performed, the approach utilized in this site will provide valuable data toward
the effect of longer-term research experiences on the tendency of the
participants to ultimately pursue advanced
degrees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site will impact society in
two major ways: 1) through the involvement of undergraduate students in
scientific research, encouraging them to pursue advanced degrees in science and
engineering; and 2) the energy-related research will potentially benefit
thousands of people through alternative sources and improved, less-polluting
combustion devices. With regard to the first major impact, the proposed site
will provide experiences for thirty to forty undergraduate students. Special
emphasis will be given to the recruitment of underrepresented ethnic minorities
and women from universities in Texas that are not major research institutions,
thus providing research opportunities to students who might not otherwise have
them. In addition, first- and second-year students will be encouraged to
participate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"The site is co-funded by the Department of
Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program."
