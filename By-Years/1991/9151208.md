The development of an environmental fluid mechanics laboratory which integrates
physical and mathematical modeling is planned. Interdisciplinary problems of
environmental contaminant transport increasingly demand appreciation for and
capability with sophisticated mathematical and computational modeling.
Simultaneous observation of physical and mathematical models is the planned
laboratory experience. Sand box and column experiments in porous media flow are
designed, constructed, and operated to demonstrate streamlines, transport, and
flow rates. Free surface flow experiments are conducted in a demonstration
flume. Concurrent with operating experiments, mathematical/computer models with
graphical display are validated by comparison to the physical models. Having
completed validation, the mathematical models are extended to examine flow
conditions beyond the constraints of the physical experiments.
