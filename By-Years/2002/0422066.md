This program continues a successfully completed CSEMS program that more than met
its goal of 95% college-wide retention and on-time graduation rates. It achieved
its goal of significantly increasing the retention rate and opportunity for our
talented, but economically disadvantaged, students, to complete their
undergraduate degrees in a timely manner. The minimum academic qualifications
for acceptance and continuation in the program are a B average both in the major
and overall. The previous program successfully supported 40 students, chosen
each year out of a pool of more than 60 qualified applicants. The current
program recruits more minority students, provides each scholar with application-
oriented experiences in their field, assists each scholar with employment or
graduate school admission upon graduation, and retains 95% of the scholars to
graduation at end of two years.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The program has a
strong advisory component in the selection of appropriate and challenging course
work for each student, supplemented with several out-of-class discipline-related
activities. It provides an extensive lecture and seminar exposure for students
in mathematics and computer science, as well as several research
projects.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: The previous program had an equal number of
female and male students and a 6% minority representation, somewhat matching the
campus population. The college is committed to increase minority participation
in the program to 10%.&lt;br/&gt;
