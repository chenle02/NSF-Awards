Dr. J. McNeil has made major contributions to the field of relativistic hadron-
nucleus scattering theory, such as the development of the relativistic impulse
approximation, (RIA) and the calculation of magnetic moments. He plans to
continue his research in this field by performing a relativistic RPA calculation
of the response functions of finite nuclei, by analyzing meson-nucleus
scattering within the RIA and by doing a relativistic calculation of
subcoulombic radiative capture processes. Dr. McNeil is a young nuclear theorist
who has made seminal contributions to the new field of relativistic nuclear
physics. His specialty is relativistic hadron-nucleus scattering theory. With
his collaborators he has performed significant calculations which have greatly
contributed to the development and advancement of this field. He plans to
continue his research in this area.
