The objective of the proposed research is to continue prior University of
Washington studies on mixed-mode concrete fracture aspects of diagonal tension
failure in reinforced concrete members. Specifically, the shear transfer
mechanism, which is thought to resist stable crack growth, will be studied using
crack-line wedge- loaded, double cantilever beam specimens with short starter
cracks and various loading histories which are crack-length dependent. Moire
interferometry will be used to measure simultaneously two orthogonal
displacement fields from which the crack opening displacement and the slip of
stably growing diagonal tension cracks will be determined. Moire data together
with the loading data will be used interactively with a finite element code to
deduce the crack closure and shear forces in the fracture process zone under
mixed mode loading. Mixed mode stable crack growth criterion will be deduced
from this hybrid experimental-numerical analysis. The results will be correlated
with fractography and profilometer analyses of the fractured surfaces in order
to assess the relative micromechanic contributions of the various constituents
(hardened cement paste, coarse aggregate and fine aggregate, etc.) to mixed mode
concrete fracture.
