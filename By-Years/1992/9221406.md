This research project, in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, will
develop the use of in situ NMR spectroscopy for the study of catalytic
reactions. Instrumental development will be undertaken to allow the use of NMR
under the high temperature and pressure conditions of typical catalytic systems.
This approach will be used to carry out a systematic investigation of catalytic
chemistry of zeolite materials. In addition, preliminary studies of mechanisms
of enzymatic catalysis will be attempted using these methods. %%% A detailed
understanding of the mechanisms of catalytic reactions is essential for a number
of important technologies, including commodity chemical production and fine
chemical synthesis. The chemical information which is available from NMR methods
can provide this sort of understanding. This research project will develop
instrumentation which will enable the use of NMR in catalytic studies, and will
systematically apply these methods to important classes of catalytic reaction.
