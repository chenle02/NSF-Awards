This is a project by the physics faculty of Bethany College to improve the
quality of the senior- level Modern Physics Laboratory course through the
acquisition of some new equipment. This project has enabled the department to
change the emphasis of the course from a repetition of classic experiments in
modern physics to the carrying out of more current, topical experiments in
solid-state physics and modern optics. Students are able to gain hands-on
experience investigating important microscopic physical phenomena using modern
instrumentation and data acquisition equipment, which serves as a vital
introduction to the world of modern physics research. The upgrade also enables
students to verify and reinforce concepts discussed theoretically in several
upper- level courses. In addition, their experiences serve as a basis for
independent research projects carried out in the students' senior year. The
equipment is also be used for these research projects.The lab course focusses on
two active areas of physics research: solid state physics and modern optics.
Equipment consists basically of three items: a cryogenic dewar, and an
electromagnet for solid state studies, and an optical table with accessories for
optical experiments. With existing equipment and further departmental
acquisitions, these will allow a range of modern experiments and techniques to
be explored.
