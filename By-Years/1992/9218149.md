This award supports the participation of ten U.S. scientists in a U.S.-Japan
Seminar on Development and Future Dimensions of Structural Testing Techniques.
The seminar, which will be held in Hawaii June 28 - July 1, 1993, is co-
organized by Professor Stephen Mahin of the University of California, Berkeley,
and Professor Tsuneo Okada of the University of Tokyo. The seminar focuses on
three main themes: technical aspects of existing and emerging technologies for
experimental analysis of structural components and systems, theoretical
considerations related to test planning and execution, and methodologies and
procedures for documentation, dissemination, and sharing of experimental data.
Among the topics for discussion are: laboratory automation, advanced loading
techniques, advanced instrumentation, advancement of data acquisition and
analysis, fabrication of specimens, scale effects, rate of loading effects,
establishment of appropriate loading condiditons, innovative test concepts,
dissemination of experimental data, correlation of experimental and analytical
data, and development of design criteria on the basis of test results. This is
the first meeting between U.S. and Japanese researchers in this field in nearly
a decade. It is expected that the seminar will result in several new assessments
of procedures and recommendations on development of methods, facilities, and
dissemination of information. //
