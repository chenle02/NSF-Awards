The objectives of this project are: to develop reliable schemes for the
truncation of the differential equations governing the moments of general
systems under nonwhite parametric excitation; to develop appropriate filters for
the case of nonwhite excitation; to use the above results to study the response
of simple nonlinear and hysteretic structures under nonwhite parametric loads;
and to study the response of complex nonlinear systems under nonstationary,
nonwhite parametric excitation due to earthquakes, wind and wave forces. Simple
structures such as beams will be examined first, and then the methods will be
applied to complex systems such as bridges and offshore platforms. This research
will result in a much better understanding of the behavior of nonlinear
structures subjected to random parametric excitations. The systems will be
modeled realistically as nonlinear or hysteretic, whereas the loads will be
nonstationary nonwhite processes.
