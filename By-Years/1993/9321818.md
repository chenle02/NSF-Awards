9321818 Willigen This project supports the dissertation research of a cultural
anthropologist from the University of Kentucky. The student will study how
forced resettlement of a rural population (due to the construction of a major
water control project) in India has affected their medical beliefs and
practices. The design includes a comparison village which has not been
relocated, and one which has. Using structured interviews, participant
observation, and several techniques of cognitive anthropology to elicit medical
belief models, the student will explore the unintended consequences of forced
relocation. This research is important because of the frequency in the
developing world of forced relocation, due to development projects such as this
project studies. The consequence of such relocation on the health of the
impacted peoples is usually harmful, yet we have no understanding of how the
impacted people's understanding of health issues changes in response to the many
changes in their living situations. In depth case studies such as this one can
help planners understand community reactions to relocation, and help design
programs to minimize harmful effects. ***
