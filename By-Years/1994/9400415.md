9400415 Woodall The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at
Purdue University focuses on heterostructure materials for electronic and
photonic applications. The purpose of the Center is to develop enabling
technologies in these areas of research with the long-term goal of facilitating
the commercialization of new products using these technologies. The MRSEC is
organized through two interdisciplinary research groups. The semiconductor
misfit heterostructures group addresses problems associated with the development
of semiconductor device technology using non-lattice-matched materials. The long
term goal is to produce economically viable enabling technologies for
fabricating photonic and electronic devices using unexplored semiconductor
materials grown on non- lattice-matched substrates with optical and electrical
properties matched to specific applications. The extrinsic control of
heterostructure properties group focuses on important materials problems
associated with light emitting and detecting devices fabricated from high-band
gap semiconductors with composite semiconductor materials used for electronic,
photonic and optoelectronic applications (especially nonlinear applications).
The MRSEC supports programs for educational outreach and human resource
development based on existing Purdue University efforts. Special focus is on the
enhancement of programs for minority and women students. The MRSEC supports
shared experimental facilities for the preparation, fabrication and
characterization of heterostructure materials and devices. The center currently
supports 10 senior investigators, 2 postdoctoral research associates, 1
technical staff member, 8 graduate students, and 10 undergraduates. The MRSEC is
directed by Professor Jerry Woodall. ***
