Spontaneous mutation rates have been assumed to be constant and uninfluenced by
selective forces. Recent experiments have shown, however, that when stationary
cells of Escherichia coli are subjected to certain non-lethal selections,
mutants appear with time. Because the only mutants that accumulate among the
population are those that are selected for this phenomenon has come to be known
as "directed" or "adaptive" mutation. This phenomenon is not due to obvious
artifacts and is under genetic control. This research will investigate the
cellular process that give rise to "directed" mutations. Using a well-defined
mutational assay, the involvement of recombination, DNA synthesis, and various
DNA repair pathways will be investigated. New genetic defects affecting the
process will be isolated. That populations are able to increase their
variability under stress without deleterious genetics consequences has clear
evolutionary significance. %%% Understanding the mechanism by which this is
accomplished may lead to new insights into the regulation of genetic processes
and how they may be influenced by the physiology of nutritionally-deprived
cells.
