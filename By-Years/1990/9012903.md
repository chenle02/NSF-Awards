Under this award, Dr. Pfeffer and his colleagues will extend the results of
their previous work on the effects of topography and beta (Coriolis
acceleration) on atmospheric flows through a mix of laboratory experiments with
a rotating annulus and theoretical and numerical modeling studies. Preliminary
studies by this and other groups suggest that topography can affect the speed of
the zonal flow, the location and maintenance of large scale standing waves in
the atmospheric flow (blocking phenomenon), as well as contribute to the chaotic
behavior of the atmosphere. For each of the areas under investigation, the
laboratory results will serve to motivate and initialize numerical experiments
and to verify the model and theoretical results. Dr. Pfeffer and his group
represent one of the few experimental laboratory programs still in existence in
this country. Their research provides an important and unique perspective on and
contribution to understanding fluid, and in particular atmospheric, flows.
