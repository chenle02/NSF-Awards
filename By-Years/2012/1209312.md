This action funds George Max Anderson of the University of Louisville to conduct
a research project, entitled "Investigation of nanometer-scale silicon carbon
based particles to decrease size and increase performance of electronic
devices," during the summer of 2012 at Shanghai University in Shanghai, China.
The host scientist is Dr. Zihua Xin.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in detecting minute
differences in nano-scale objects that can result in significant property
changes. By analyzing and learning what factors control these property changes,
this research promises to exploit these differences to further efforts to
miniaturize a wide range of electronic devices.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
