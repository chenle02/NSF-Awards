9451493 Brazdil Capillary gas chromatographs are enhancing the basic chemical
principles taught in the general chemistry offered both science majors and
nonscience majors. The students are using instrumentation practicing chemists
use on a routine basis to gain a better understanding of such topics as
qualitative identification, calibration and quantitation, identification of
chemicals present in household products, Henry's Law, partitioning behavior of
substances, and LeChatelier's Principle. Additionally, illustrating the
connections between gas chromatography and paper or thin layer chromatography,
enables students to better understand the underlying equilibrium partitioning
principles involved in all forms of chromatography.
