It is proposed to study various aspects of the theory of relativistic strings,
which have the ultimate objective of a unified quantum theory of gravity and the
other fundamental interactions. (1) Classical and quantum two dimensional world-
sheet supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models will be used to study the low energy
behavior of bosonic fields in string theories. (2) The superspace formulation of
spacetime supersymmetry will be used to construct manifestly supersymmetric
effective actions, allowing results of sigma model calculations to be extended
to include fermions. (3) The BRST formalism for the covariant description of
relativistic quantum field theories will be studied further.
