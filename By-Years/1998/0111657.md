This project combines a theoretical and experimental exploration of the basic
chemistry of boron, structure-property relationships, long range intermolecular
interactions in ordered fluids, and the potential for practical applications of
some of the materials in the optoelectronics and communications industries. The
focus of the project is on developing a new class of calamitic (rod-like) liquid
crystals derived from inorganic boron clusters. The design of the materials
takes advantage of the unique steric and electronic features of the clusters
such as three-dimensional aromaticity, high electronic polarizability, variable
polarity, and high rotational axes. This combination of properties is not
available in purely organic systems. The proposed study focuses on nematic
materials with lateral and longitudinal dipole moments, mesogenic additives to
ferro- and antiferroelectric liquid crystals and mesogenic nonlinear optical
chromophores. The proposed activities will include quantum mechanical
calculations, synthesis, characterization and evaluation of device performance.
The project is designed to have a maximum impact on education and research
productivity. The project will expose students to a broad spectrum of research
activities, give them versatile expertise in organic materials, and prepare them
to undertake complicated projects in the materials chemistry
area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The subject of this research project is the
development of a new class of liquid crystals to address issues in fundamental
and applied science and technology. Liquid crystals combine properties typical
for solids, such as optical and dielectric anisotropies, with the fluidity of a
liquid. This unique combination of properties makes these remarkable materials
an indispensable component of contemporary technology, such as &lt;br/&gt;flat
panel display, telecommunication, and sensors. The project is designed to have a
maximum impact on education and research productivity. &lt;br/&gt;
