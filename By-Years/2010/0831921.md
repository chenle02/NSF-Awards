This project is a novel alliance among the state school system, Jackson State
University (JSU), Jackson Public Schools and other public schools in
Mississippi. The project also partners with the Ironwood Observatory and
Education Center in Hawaii, the James Cook Universtiy Center for Astronomy in
Australia and the NASA Stennis Space Center in Mississippi. The focus of the
partnership is on high school physics, chemistry and earth science. The project
anticipates enabling 45 preservice teachers to obtain teaching licenses in high
school science. Courses will be designed and taught by the College of Education
and Human Development and the College of Science, Engineering and Technology.
The project will provide 200 inservice teachers with 160 hours of professional
development. The goal is to enable teachers to implement National Science
Education Standards and the Mississippi Science Curriculum Frameworks for high
school (9-12) education. The long term goal is to improve student achievement in
science and to significantly reduce achievement gaps in the science performance
within the diverse student population. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The inservice
component consists of two compressed 3 credit hours graduate courses. Each
course will be taught in 10 days (20 days total), two weeks in summer and 10
Saturdays during the academic year. The emphasis will be on conceptual
development for each major topic and will include coursework, inquiry-based
laboratory work, demonstrations, hands-on activities, and problem solving with
special emphasis on using technology as tools of instruction. Project team
members will complete at least three follow-up visits to the classrooms of the
participants.
