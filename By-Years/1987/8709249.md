This grant in Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry provides support for the
research of Dr. Edward Arnett, Duke University. The work is focused on the
structure-energy relationships which characterize the aggregation and reactivity
of organic anions in solution. Understanding such relationships is essential for
a complete construction of the interactions between reactants and solvents in
solution. The following processes will be studied: (1) the energies for a number
of fundamental processes such as heats of interaction of lithium cation with
neutral ligands such as ethers, esters, ketones, aldehydes, and amines and with
enolate, phenolate and alkoxide ions; (2) heats of reaction of direct relevance
to the important reactions of lithium enolates such as the aldol and Michael
condensations; (3) the degrees of aggregation for selected enolate ions in a
spectrum of solvents of varied polarity --cyclohexane, benzene, dioxane, DMSO
and sulfolane-- by freezing point depression (such results will be related to
x-ray crystal structures, heteronuclear NMR, heats of complexing and, in
favorable cases, to kinetic analysis of alkylation or aldol reactions); (4)
equilibration of carbocations, carbanions, and radicals where thermodynamics and
kinetics for single electron transfer may be compared directly with coordination
(two electron transfer).
