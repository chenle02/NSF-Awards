This award will support the development of tools and new methods by which
genomic DNA sequences can be surveyed for specific types of regulatory sites.
These methods will be based on assessments of whether candidate sites having
base sequence consistent with regulatory function also have the physical-
chemical attributes necessary for activity. Specific types of regulatory regions
to be considered include origins of replication, and the various types of
functional loci involved with transcriptional regulation such as promoters,
terminators, enhancers, poly-adenylations sites and silencers. The project will
focus on yeast and human DNA.
