Six problems are posed about hyperplane arrangements A defined by a product Q
of linear forms in a vector space V. (1) The polynomial map Q has a non-isolated
singularity at the origin. Let F be its Milnor fiber. Compute the cohomology of
F for a generic arrangement. (2) It has been conjectured that if A is free, then
the restriction of A to a subspace in its lattice is again free. Investigate
this conjecture for Coxeter arrangements. (3) Known results on Hessians and
discriminants of Shephard groups will be combined with ideas of Saito to give a
case-free proof of the existence of flat basic invariants for Shephard groups,
and to explain why the complements of their reflection arrangements are
K(G,1)-spaces. (4) Let S be the algebra of polynomial functions on V and let J
be the Jacobian ideal generated by the partial derivatives of Q. If A is
generic, then the homological dimension of S/J is equal to dimV. Study the
homological dimension of S/J for all arrangements. (5) Given H in A let B denote
the restriction of A to H. There is a natural restriction of the derivations
tangent to A to the derivations tangent to B. This map is surjective in some
cases and not surjective in others. Find precise conditions for surjectivity.
(6) Subspace arrangements will be studied with respect to the question of
additivity of the Poincare polynomial under deletion and restriction. The use of
computers, to furnish experimental material, is implicit in the work. These six
problems show that in high dimensions the ways in which a finite number of
linear spaces can be imbedded in a linear space of one greater dimension
exhibits a surprisingly rich structure. Standard tools of topology are well
adapted to elucidating this structure and will be further exploited.
