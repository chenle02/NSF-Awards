The objective of this research is to assess the degree to which deposit feeding
populations in field circumstances are limited by food, in the context of
changes in nutritional quality of the sediment over spatial and temporal scales.
Past research has demonstrated that newly deposited seaweed based detritus
contributes substantially to population growth of deposit feeders, but that the
particulate organic matter in the sediment also is of great importance. Seasonal
studies over the last two years demonstrate that the sediment promotes declining
population growth from spring to fall and carbon retention also declines when a
deposit feeder ingests spring versus fall sediment. These findings will be
extended to experimental studies on the addition of detritus in the field, since
a diagnostic marker of lateral transport of detritus is available. The
experimental addition studies will be combined with the marker approach as well
as with caged controls for predation, to examine the impact of detrital addition
and seasonal organic matter change in the sediment on the population growth of
the dominant oligochaete worm, Paranais litoralis, and on the behavior of the
mud snails, Ilyanassa obsoleta and Hydrobia truncata. Interactions between
feeding behavior, sediment deposition and flow will also be examined. This study
will be the first to utilize the combined spatial and temporal approach to
examine detrital limitation of surface feeding benthic field populations.
