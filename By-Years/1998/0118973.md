0118973&lt;br/&gt;Soboyejo&lt;br/&gt;A U.S./Africa workshop on Materials and
Infrastructure for Development will be organized in San Diego from June 25-27,
2001. The workshop is an extension of one of the break-out sessions at the NSF-
sponsored US/Africa workshop that was held in Pretoria in August, 2000. The
workshop will bring together researchers from Africa, South America, Europe and
the United States to interact within a basic research framework that will
stimulate materials and infrastructure development within the U.S., Africa and a
global framework. The workshop will also provide opportunities between African
and U.S. researchers that could result ultimately in synergisms that are not
possible within national or continental boundaries. In an effort to ensure
subsequent interactions, participants from outside the U.S. will be given the
opportunity to visit potential collaborators within the U.S. before returning to
their home countries. The highlights of the symposium will be published on a
web-site that will be developed to disseminate the information from the workshop
to a worldwide audience. The technical papers from the workshop will be
published in the International Journal of Concrete and Cement Composites after a
rigorous review process. Travel assistance will be provided to 12 invited
speakers, two graduate students and one post-doctoral research associate. An
undergraduate student will also be supported to assist with the development of
the workshop web-site.&lt;br/&gt;***
