This research explores the financial and economic determinants of air carrier
safety performance. One of the most widely discussed and perhaps most
controversial effect of airline deregulation has been the perceived decline in
air safety. This project investigates the determinants of air carrier safety,
with particular attention to the question of whether less profitable or
financially insecure carriers provide less safety to their passengers. The first
stage of the project develops a model of air carrier accident rates as a
function of carriers' risk exposure, traffic and operating characteristics, and
financial condition. This model is estimated on panel data for large U.S. jet
carriers over the l957-l986 period. The second stage of the project explores the
possibility of developing alternative safety indicators, including incidents,
inspection results, and direct measures of safety inputs such as maintenance
expenditures. The results should provide insights on the effect of economic
deregulation on air carrier safety performance.
