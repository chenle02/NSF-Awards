OCE-9530307 Geochemical and field evidence suggest that melt transport in the
mantle is localized into some form of meso-scale channels; however, the
mechanism for the formation of such channels from a grain-scale distribution of
melt is poorly understood. Two possible mechanisms will be investigated: (1)
reactive inflitration instability, which is an interaciton between the fluid-
mechanics of melt motion and chemical dissolution, and (2) purely mechanical
flow segregations due to local pressure graneints. A series of numerical model
problems will be used to quantify the behavior and effects of both of these
processes.
