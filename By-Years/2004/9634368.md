IBN: 9634368 PI: McLaughlin This project will be supported under the NSF program
on INTEGRATING ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES INTO NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH; it is a
collaboration of mathematicians and neuroscientists attacking the most important
issues in brain research. In our view, the premier problem facing us is how to
understand the function of the cerebral cortex of the brain as a functioning
neural network. We study the part of the cerebral cortex that handles visual
information--called the visual cortex. Cells in the visual cortex are
selectively sensitive for the orientations of the visual boundaries of objects.
We will develop and test neural network models for this selectivity, to see
whether it is a property that emerges from interactions between nerve cells in
the cerebral cortex, or whether it is a passive by-product of the connections to
cortical cells from lower levels of the visual system of the brain. We believe
that understanding the neural basis for orientation tuning in the visual cortex
may be crucial for understanding the function of the entire cortex. If we find
evidence that interaction between neighboring neurons in the cerebral cortex is
essential for orientation tuning to work, then this will be crucial support for
the idea that the cerebral cortex is a richly interconnected, interactive neural
network that can be studied with available analytical tools.
