This collaborative project explores teenagers' understanding and engagement with
privacy, including tool development for strengthening the understanding
management of privacy in digital media among U.S. teenagers. Through interviews
and focus groups the PIs identify how sociocultural differences, like race and
class, impact how teenagers engage with privacy both in their online presence
and through their usage of devices and apps. The systematic examination of
differences in race and socioeconomic status has been understudied, but creates
significant variances in social norms and education around technology and
privacy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Revealing how sociocultural groups navigate
social pressures, norms, varying exposure/access to different technologies and
platforms, and their own digital identity formation and maintenance, allows
greater understanding regarding how teenagers formulate their attitudes and
behaviors towards privacy. This project adds nuance to the current research on
teens and privacy, and corrects false impressions regarding their behaviors, if
any, while also leveraging the data from participants to engage them in a
participatory privacy tool design and building process. The Broader Impacts of
this project include the tools being developed, provided to teenagers and those
involved in the lives of teens such as teachers. The research concerning the
impact of sociocultural differences, as well as the research behind the
development of the tools is available to other investigators, program and
software developers.
