9703937 Shockey The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty four months of research
abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions
abroad. This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit by
Dr. Bruce J. Shockey to work with Dr. Federico Anaya Daza at the Museo Nacional
de Historia Natural in La Paz, Bolivia. Dr. Shockey will be studying the
Pleistocene faunas of Bolivia. To do this, he will work with Dr. Daza on:
conducting field work at Pleistocene (Ensenadan and Lujanian) localities and
assist in the curation of specimens for the Museo Nacional de Historia Natural
(MNHNBol). Specifically he will carry out work describing selected specimens of
ungulates, work on environmental reconstructions based on morphological studies
and stable isotopic analysis of enamel; and coordinating studies of nonungulate
taxa discovered with international researchers. The low latitude, which places
Bolivia nearer to the continental gateway for the North American immigrants than
Argentina; elevational gradients, which offer opportunities to sample a range of
adaptations that may have been required for the immigrants to breech rugged
barriers to the continent; and the environmental diversity, ranging from rain
forest to the high, cold, and arid Altiplano of Bolivia, make it a virtually
ideal country in which to study the interaction of immigrant and native
ungulates during the Pleistocene. ***
