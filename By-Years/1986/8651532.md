This project will deliver in-service training to 30 junior and senior high
school teachers. The project hypothesizes the creation of an environmental
center in an environmentally-sensitve wetland along Lake Ontario. The data
gleaned from the project will aid in planning programs for a proposed new
environmental center. Participants will attend a five-week summer course
beginning in July of 1987. During this segment of the program, participants will
learn how to evaluate the environmental consequences of the development.
Subsequently, a series of five monthly curricular workshops during the following
academic year will use the summer experience to create suitable curricular
modules for the participating schools. The cycle of a summer course and five
curricular workshops will be repeated the following year with a new and
different group of teachers. During the summer institute, each school will be
asked to recommend student "colleagues" to work with teacher in field collection
and identification projects.
