During summer 1988, eight undergraduate students will receive training in
analysis and interpretation of data from a major new social science survey, the
National Survey of Families and Households (NSFH). Each student will be
supervised by one or two of the NSFH faculty research team. A graduate assistant
will provide training on the VAX computer system, and on personal computers, for
data analysis and report writing. Students will learn to extract working files
from the large survey file, to perform basic statistical analyses, to document
data, and to present findings in tabular, graphical and written form. They will
interact daily with faculty supervisors and meet weekly as a group to discuss
data and computing problems, and to report on research findings. At the end of
the summer, students will present short papers on their research projects in
colloquia attended by graduate students and faculty of the Center for Demography
and Ecology. These papers will be candidates for inclusion in the CDE Working
Paper series. Applicants for the REU program will be recruited from state and
private colleges in the upper Midwest, particularly those with relatively high
minority enrollments. UW-Madison's current recruiting procedures for two ongoing
undergraduate research programs aimed at minority students will be used to
obtain applicants for the NSFH program.
