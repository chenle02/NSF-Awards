The Security and Human Behavior workshop's goals are to discuss, in an informal
and interdisciplinary setting, issues where security, psychology, and behavior
interact. The scope is broad: topics that have been covered in the past include
the misperception of risk, security usability, deception, security and privacy
decision making, and so forth. As the SaTC program has expanded to include
social sciences in addition to its core in computer science, gatherings such as
SHB provide a key venue for interaction between the different
communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports student attendance and
participation in the 2016 SHB workshop. Participation in the SHB Workshop is by
invitation - and the first rule of the SHB Workshop is that everyone who attends
actually participates in the discussion. This will ensure that students get more
value from attending SHB than many conferences and workshops where they can
simply listen.
