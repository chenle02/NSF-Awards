9321556 Van der Veen This award is for support for a study on the mechanics of
Columbia Glacier, Alaska, USA during its current rapid retreat. The extensive
data set of surface elevations and velocities obtained from many repeat aerial
photogrammetries of the glacier will be analyzed in order to identify the sites
of, and magnitudes of mechanical controls on the lower part of the glacier. This
data will also provide information to help determine whether the ongoing retreat
is associated with a major change in flow style, and to test various calving
relations at each phase of retreat of the ice front. The understanding of the
controls of the collapse of the Columbia Glacier, obtained from these data, will
be very helpful in understanding major collapses of other glaciers. ***
