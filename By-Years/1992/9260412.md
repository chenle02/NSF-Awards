Tuning the wavelength of lasers is basic to many uses of light. This research
activity will develop a new mechanism for electronically tuning lasers. The
objectives are to make more rapidly tunable lasers that are efficient and
reliable. The tuning method is by suppressing unwanted longitudinal cavity
modes, or equivalently unwanted wavelengths. The loss mechanism is based on a
coupling between a laser cavity's fundamental transverse mode we wish to
suppress and a higher- order higher-loss transverse mode of the same laser
cavity. The coupling is by an acousto-optic modulator in the cavity. A
successful Phase I and Phase II program will produce tunable continuously-
emitting and pulsed lasers relevant to a wide range of research and measurement
applications.
