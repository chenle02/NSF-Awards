The feedback control laboratory provides students with hands on experience in
control system identification, compensator design, and performance verification.
The experiments are structured such that the students learn and test problem-
solving strategies in feedback control. Personal computers perform process data
acquisition and real-time process control. The computers provide graphics
support for system identification and compensator design choices, for
comparisons between predicted and actual performance, and for iterative
performance improvement. Students design test compensators for thermal, fluid,
pneumatic, and high-pressure hydraulic control systems, as well as DC-motor
speed and position control systems.
