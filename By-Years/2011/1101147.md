Classical economic theory models humans as acting rationally through the
optimization of their expected utilities. The paradigm of bounded rationality
takes a step toward greater realism by placing computational limitations on
agents' abilities to determine optimal decisions. Behavioral and cognitive
studies reveal that humans are also categorically bounded, meaning that they use
a finite categorization of the set of decision problems that may be posed, with
a small number of categories. This project will focus on the use of quantization
theory and information theory to establish foundations for the interplay between
categorization and decision making. The researchers aim to understand the impact
of categorization on individual decision making, team decision making through
majority voting, and sequential decision making. The theory developed in the
project will include both analysis of situations in which the categorization is
fixed and optimal design of categorizations. In addition to the behavioral
justification for the study of categorization, informational limitations on
learning suggest that categorization into classes of decision problems has
ramifications for engineering design.

This project has the potential to influence economic theory and the
understanding of certain social and organizational phenomena. Specifically, the
project offers a way to understand the decision making performance of teams,
with the incorporation of certain human limitations and the potential for
differing preferences (e.g., between Type I and Type II errors) among teammates.
Differences in preferences lead to a quantifiable penalty of team discord, even
when the team shares the common goal of making correct decisions. There is also
a quantifiable advantage from team diversity in the sense of obtaining better
performance when teammates apply different categorizations. These new concepts
could contribute to principles for team formation and for how data gathering
policies can be optimized with the goal of fair decision making.
