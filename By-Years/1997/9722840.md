The 200 species that comprise the Order Primates exhibit extreme diversity in
social organization compared to other mammalian orders. Current theory suggests
that the extent of competition for food within a primate species is the single
best predictor of that species' social organization. With greater food
competition, for example, more rigid dominance hierarchies, greater female
versus male dominance, closer affiliations among females, and little female
dispersal are expected.. Squirrel monkeys, a species distributed throughout the
Neotropics, offer a uniquely powerful test of the importance of food competition
in the evolution of primate social organization. No other primate taxon has such
widely divergent population differences in social organization. Two previous
field studies were entirely consistent with predictions. Costa Rican squirrel
monkeys, with negligible within-troop food competition, exhibit almost non-
existent female social bonds and females emigrate. In contrast, food competition
is high among Peruvian squirrel monkeys, females form close social bonds, and
females have never been known to emigrate. My preliminary observations in
Suriname indicate yet a third form of social organization with strong male
dominance of other troop members, and little female affiliation. Yet the
extremely intense food competition that exists in this population is in apparent
contradiction to theory. If confirmed, the squirrel monkey social system of
Suriname provides a powerful test of the hypothesis of close linkage between
food competition an social behavior in primates, and provides an important
window to our understanding of the mechanisms that affect and structure primate
social systems.
