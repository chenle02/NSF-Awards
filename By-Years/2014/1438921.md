Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are common components in critical
infrastructure systems such as the smart power grid, smart buildings, oil and
gas pipelines, chemical processing plants and water distribution systems.
Securing these systems requires a skilled and knowledgeable workforce with
expertise in several engineering disciplines. This project will develop new
interdisciplinary courses, and modules that will be incorporated into existing
courses, to enhance cybersecurity education. The development of the curriculum
will be guided by an advisory board consisting of industrial experts. The
graduates from these programs will possess the skills required to secure and
maintain these critical systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the project
are (i) the training of future engineers/scientists to design, build and
maintain secure industrial control systems, (ii) the development of new courses
on security issues, (ii) the recruitment of students from underrepresented
groups, (iii) the involvement of undergraduate/ graduate students for conducting
design/ thesis projects in the secure industrial control systems ,(iv) the
dissemination of the results through, web-based curriculum dissemination, and
journal publications, and (v) outreach activities to community college and high
school students. Formative evaluations will continuously improve the curricula
of the courses and a summative evaluation at the end of the grant period will
evaluate the level to which the goals and objectives of the project have been
met. The data collected through the evaluation process will be use to improve
program delivery as well as evaluate project success.
