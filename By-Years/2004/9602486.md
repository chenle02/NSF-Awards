This three-year award supports U.S.-U.K. collaboration between Gerald J. Stubbs
of Vanderbilt University and T. Michael Wilson of the Crop Research Institute in
Scotland. the objective of their research is to determine the three- dimensional
structure of furoviruses in molecular detail. The project is related to Dr.
Stubbs research on the structure of a wide variety of different, unrelated
helical plant viruses. Furoviruses have unique genetic structures, viral host
interactions and transmission modes, and low levels of coat protein sequence
homology with other viruses. Sequence comparisons indicate that furovirus RNA
binding is very different from that of other helical viruses. The structures of
these viruses will be important in understanding the nature of host-viral
interactions, specificity, vector transmission, and protein-nucleic acid
interactions. The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration his expertise
in structural biology. This is complemented by the U.K. investigator's expertise
in virology and his research on furoviruses. The project will advance our
understanding of the molecular structures of helical plant viruses and will
eventually be used in applied studies of disease resistant plants.
