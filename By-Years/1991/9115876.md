This project examines the hypothesis that recruitment pulses to rocky
intertidal barnacle populations are caused by the collision of upwelling fronts
with the rocky intertidal zone. A front separates the relatively cold and salty
upwelled water nearshore from the relatively warm and fresh water further
offshore. It is hypothesized that the upwelling front is a place of convergence,
and that larvae of intertidal barnacles accumulate there. At certain times such
fronts appear to collide with the shore and to deposit their accumulated larvae
on the rocky intertidal zone, thereby producing a recruitment peak. To test this
hypothesis, knowledge of the temporal history of the position and vertical
structure of an upwelling front is required, contemporaneously with knowledge of
the distribution and abundance of larvae in the water column and their
recruitment success. This will be achieved through use of satellite AVHRR data,
shipboard net tows and temperature, salinity, and velocity measurements, moored
and shore-based measurements of temperature and wind, and benthic monitoring in
the intertidal zone. This research is significant in increasing our
understanding of recruitment and of cross-shelf transport, and in developing
predictive models for the dynamics of coastal populations with pelagic larvae.
