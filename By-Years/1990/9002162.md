The object of this research project is to show the feasibility of an advanced
concept, video imaging microscope whose features include real-time, three- color
video images, instantaneous zoom, very low illumination power, selective
contrast enhancement, and highly linear densitometry. Data resolution matched
the diffraction limit of the optics over a wide range of magnification. Low
cost, direct viewing models would be useful for routine clinical applications
and multi-user observation of cell smears or sections in pathology,
hematopathlogy, and cytology. Such a system could be the ideal vehicle for the
creation of video teaching databases of pathological abnormalities, and provide
the critical link between optical microscopy and the rapidly expanding area of
video image display, storage, processing, and teleconferencing. Expanded feature
models with automated stages, automatic focusing, and computerized image
processing facilities would be useful for the development of automated cell
analysis in pathology, hematology , cytology, and many other disciplines.
