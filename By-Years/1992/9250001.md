New data-analytic and concepts-based textbooks along with advances in
statistical software, and computer and multimedia technology now offer the
opportunity to rethink the way in which we teach statistics. This project, in
coordination with an effort at Ohio State University, is combining and
augmenting these resources to develop a unified curriculum and supporting
materials for teaching statistical concepts and methods. Products of the project
will include: laboratory manuals designed as a bridge between standard texts and
computer software that will guide students through experiments that generate
data for analysis; start-up materials to aid students use computers for
statistics; a machine-readable encyclopedia of examples and problems that will
include data, descriptions of experiments, and computer-based retrieval; and a
computer CD-ROM archive of edited video materials keyed to specific statistical
concepts and tied to an instructional statistics program.
