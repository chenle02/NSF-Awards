9312318 Williamson This project funds the creation of an electronic information
management and dissemination server, the History of Global Change Information
Server (HGCIS), for the use of economic historians studying global change. The
server will evolve into a primary communications channel between researchers of
the economic history of global change and into a repository of critical
knowledge, technical details, and general subject matter expertise on the
economic history of global change. The HGCIS's goals are: 1) to provide an
international forum for global change researchers to exchange ideas, opinions,
and data; 2) to develop on-line global change databases with search capabilities
and accessibility to all researchers; 3) to maintain an on-line library of
papers, proceedings, and electronic meetings. To achieve these goals, the
proposed global change network server will assemble a membership registry
database, bulletin boards, electronic conference rooms, research rooms, global
change databases, and electronic libraries.
