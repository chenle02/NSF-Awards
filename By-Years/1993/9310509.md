The Yuanaqu Basin is an intermontane structure covering about 350 sq. km within
the Zhongtiao Range of central China. Eocene to Oligocene terrestrial rocks in
this basin contain one of the best records for vertebrate fossils of this age in
Asia, including, to date, at least 50 species of mammals and five of reptiles.
These fossiliferous deposits were discovered in 1916 by a Swedish geologist
whose collections formed the core of a monograph on early Tertiary vertebrates
of China. Since this early expedition paleontologists have visited this basin
and collected fossil vertebrates in the Heti Formation. As a result, at least 20
taxa have been added to the original list and many represent valuable material
on mammals. In 1993 the People's Republic of China will build a dam on the
Huanghe (Yellow) River, and at least 15 important fossil-bearing sites will be
submerged. This project is a collaborative effort between Chinese and American
paleontologists to retrieve fossils from these sites and characterize the
paleomagnetics prior to submersion. %%% The significance of this project is that
it offers the last opportunity to salvage valuable paleontological material from
the Heti Formation in China. The stratigraphy of this region is well known and
it has a rich record of vertebrates in the latter part of the Eocene. Prior to
flooding of this region, the combined Chinese and American teams will salvage
fossil bearing materials from the sites that will be lost. This is very
important because this particular formation has morphologically complete
specimens preserved in deposits, and as such, these fossils will shed light on a
dynamic interval, when the climatic, faunal, and biogeographic changes of the
Eocene-Oligocene event occurred.
