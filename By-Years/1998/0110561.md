0110561 Lall The objective of the proposed workshop is to develop an on-line
hydroclimate data library through a coordinated multi-national effort. We
anticipate that a position paper on the need for such a library, and desirable
features (including data processing algorithms) and capabilities, will be
prepared through remote interaction between some of the invitees and circulated
in advance of the meeting. The two-day meeting will then focus on a discussion
of this position paper, strategies for implementation and funding, and the
development of one or more community proposals for different portions of the
work identified. A strategy to integrate the technology developed from the
project into the electronic data libraries of the USGS and other agencies will
be developed as part of these deliberations. The recommendations of the workshop
will be summarized in an article in EOS. The same article will also seek
additional comments and expression of interest in participation from the
community. This workshop will be held at the Lamont-Doherty, Earth Observatory,
Palisades, New York in April 2001.
