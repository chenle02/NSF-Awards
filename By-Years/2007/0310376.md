0310376&lt;br/&gt;Bernd Girod&lt;br/&gt;Stanford U&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With
conventional compression, the encoder exploits the statistics of the source
signal. However, efficient compression can also be achieved by exploiting source
statistics - partially or wholly - at the decoder only. &lt;br/&gt;This
surprising insight is the consequence of information theoretic bounds
established in the 1970s, particularly those by Wyner and Ziv for lossy coding
with side information. We refer to compression that builds on these results and
exploits receiver side information as Wyner-Ziv coding. While still in its
infancy, practical Wyner-Ziv coding has the potential to widely impact
distributed communication systems. For video signals, it might find applications
ranging from enhanced digital television broadcasting, low-complexity networked
cameras, and improved visual surveillance systems for military and civilian
applications.&lt;br/&gt;In this project, we develop and explore new Wyner-Ziv
coding techniques and apply these to two different video communication problems.
Wyner-Ziv coding is a radical departure from conventional, non-distributed
coding, and, therefore, a significant part of our effort is devoted to
fundamental problems of code design, quantizer design, and the role of
transforms. In the first application, we consider a novel video compression
system with asymmetric complexity, useful for wireless mobile cameras. Since
Wyner-Ziv coding exploits the source statistics in the decoder, the encoder can
be very simple, at the expense of a more complex decoder. In the second
application, we devise a novel unequal error protection scheme for video
broadcasting that protects the video waveform with a lossy source-channel code.
Such a scheme does not require a layered, embedded representation of the video
signal to achieve graceful degradation with worsening channel
&lt;br/&gt;conditions and is hence compatible with deployed single-layer video
compression standards.&lt;br/&gt;
