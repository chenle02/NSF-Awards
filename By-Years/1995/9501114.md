9501114 Heppelmann Research will be carried out in high energy proton-induced
knockout reactions and in polarized proton-polarized proton scattering. Both
experiments will be carried out at Brookhaven National Laboratory, the former at
the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron facility, and the latter at the
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider facility. Development work and data
analysis/interpretation will be carried out the university. Research in these
areas will advance our understanding of the quark structure of the nucleon and
of the nucleon's complex spin structure in terms of constituent and sea quarks
and gluons. These topics are high priority activities in contemporary nuclear
physics. Development, construction, and utilization of advanced instrumentation,
particularly electronics for data acquisition is integral to this activity.
Education of graduate students, undergraduate students, and postdocs is a strong
component of this grant.***
