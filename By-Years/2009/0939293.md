This is a symposium proposal to host a Polar Fair at the Maryland Science Center
in Baltimore April 4-5, 2009. This is a special symposium, building on the
International Polar Weekend events hosted at the American Museum of Natural
History in New York in 2007 and 2008. The Baltimore Polar Fair is associated
with the 50th Antarctic Treaty Meeting. The interactive Polar Fair will bring
together approximately 35 IPY research scientists and educators to share their
research with the general public through hands-on interactive activities. The
program is one component of a larger suite of weekend events, including NASA's
"Frozen" Science on a Sphere, The Antarctic Artists display, and Polar-Palooza.
Polar Fair participants will include representatives from native Arctic
cultures, historical figures in polar research, as well as the most up to date
equipment and science techniques being used in polar research through the
International Polar Year. The format allows and encourages people to learn in
several different ways: passive listening and viewing as well as one-on-one
question and answer, demonstrations, and personal participation. Through the
event, the public will gain an appreciation for the rich history of polar
research and exploration, as well as the wide range of science research being
conducted in both the Arctic and the Antarctic.
