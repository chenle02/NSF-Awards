Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under this award the PIs will study ice-rafted
detritus (IRD) in high-sedimentation-rate cores from the high-latitude South
Atlantic (SA). Previos studies have identified six to seven discrete episodes of
IRD deposition between 12 and 60 kyr during the last glaciation that have been
suggested to be regionally correlative. If these events can be shown to be
widely distributed and synchronous, they may indicate instability in Antarctic
ice sheets. The PIs will examine the origin of these South Atlantic IRD (SA-IRD)
events, their significance for Antarctic ice-sheet dynamics, and their exact
relationship to millennial-scale climate events recorded in polar ice cores.
This project will 1.) map the aerial distribution of IRD events in the South
Atlantic basin; 2.) date SA-IRD events using AMS-14C and estimating particle
flux and sediment redistribution using the Th-normalization method; 3.) trace
the origin of IRD events to their Antarctic source area(s) using mineralogy and
geochemistry; and 4.) correlate South Atlantic IRD events to Antarctic and
Greenland ice cores, other marine sediment cores (e.g., North Atlantic), and
global sea level records.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
