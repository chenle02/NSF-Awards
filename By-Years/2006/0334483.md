The KDI initiative was a two-year innovative program whose goal was to foster
multidisciplinary research across the directorates at NSF. A KDI PI workshop,
online survey and archival analysis were used to examine what happened in those
projects three to four years after the fact. A majority of KDI projects were
geographically dispersed, multidisciplinary, and comparatively large (average of
4 principal investigators). More dispersed projects incurred significantly
higher coordination costs and were also associated with PIs reporting fewer
positive outcomes. However, before making recommendations to NSF and to
researchers about the appropriate coordination infrastructure needed in
dispersed projects, additional analyses need to be performed and alternate
explanations ruled out. Finer grained measures will be computed from zip codes
and fields of specialization. Descriptive statistics from unfunded projects need
to be examined to better understand how funded projects differ on features like
dispersion and multidisciplinarity. One timely objective is to help clarify
which questions NSF should ask when evaluating innovative, multi-disciplinary
research programs.
