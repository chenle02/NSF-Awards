Liang 9310152 This is a three-year cooperative research project for developing a
chip load servo system to improve machining product tolerance, surface finish,
and machine use by Dr. Steven Liang, George Institute of Technology and
Professor H. T. Young, National Taiwan University. The objective of this project
is to establish cooperative research between the U.S. and Taiwan in precision
machining and machine tool technology. This project will involve the major U.S.
machine tool companies, GM, Ford, and the Torrington Company, as well as Taiwan
machine tool companies. Dr. Liang has an excellent track record in this field of
research. The success of this project can improve the control of product
dimensional accuracy and surface finish and can enhance precision machining
technology. This study is jointly supported by the NSF and the Taiwan National
Science Council. The Manufacturing Processes and Equipment Program has provided
$20,000 to jointly support this project.
