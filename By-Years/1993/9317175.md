Abstract Fink This proposal will identify the specific genes involved in pathway
of IAA biosynthesis, the tissue specificity of these genes, the phenotypes of
mutations that prevent expression, and regulatory mutations affecting the
pathway. The plant hormone, indole acetic acid (IAA) has remarkably diverse
effects on plant growth and morphogenesis (22) (e.g. apical dominance, cell
division, cell enlargement and lateral root formation). Our belief is that once
the gene(s) specifically involved in IAA biosynthesis are cloned, the role of
internal IAA in each of these processes can be understood. As most of the
structural genes in the pathway are found in multiple copies, mutations will be
sought in each member of a set so that the role of gene redundancy in the
tryptophan/IAA pathway can be determined. To achieve this goal experiments are
designed to improve transformation, gene targeting, and the control of gene
expression by antisense. %%% Indole acetic acid is a plant hormone which affects
many growth and morphogenic characteristics of plants. Most of what is known
have been determined by external application of IAA to plants. However, little
is known about its synthesis and function in an in vivo situation. The aromatic
amino acid pathway is utilized for the biosynthesis of IAA and we will identify
and clone the genes encoding the enzymes of this pathway, determine gene copy
number and attempt to gain insight into the internal functioning of the hormone.
We will, as necessary, develop the technology needed to achieve these goals. ***
