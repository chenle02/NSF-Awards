With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Michael Blakey and assistants will
curate the W. Montague Cobb Human Skeletal Collection. These materials were
collected by Dr. Cobb in the course of his many years of medical school work and
are currently stored at Howard University in conditions which render the
majority virtually inaccessible for research purposes. The collection consists
of 737 skeletons and 982 records on these and other cadavers. What makes these
collections particularly valuable are the associated records because this gives
researchers a "known" base against which to develop analytical methods and to
the study effects of processes such as aging and diet on the skeletal system.
Dr. Blakey plans to renovate and expand his present laboratory facility for
collection storage, research and related laboratory courses. Specimens will be
relocated to the new laboratory facility and stored in adequate cabinets. A
detailed and complete inventory of skeletal specimens and elements will then be
made. The computer index will be expanded and upgraded and the availability of
the collection be made known through publication. This project is important for
several reasons. There are very few large and well documented skeletal
collections in the United States - far too few given present research needs.
This project will add to the list a third which will be available for study. It
will also serve to halt the progressive deterioration which the materials are
undergoing.
