This research explores the application of optical systems to symbolic artificial
intelligence computing. It addresses both algorithms and architectures. Basic
fundamental operations for symbolic AI computing and highly parallel and novel
optical architectures are being developed. Heuristic search procedures are
applied and analyzed using a combination of analytical modeling methods,
simulation techniques, and laboratory experiments. The increasing demands of
speed and performance in symbolic AI computing are imposing stringent demands on
the design of computer architectures and algorithms. Optical computing is a very
promising technology for elevating the processing speed to several orders of
magnitude over what electronic technologies can offer. This research will result
in the development of new optical architectures and algorithms that exhibit high
speed and parallelism. It will also result in a better understanding of the role
of optics in computing.
