Structural estimation is vital in empirical economics. The need for structural
estimation arises from confounding factors due to individual choice making and
market forces. A classical application is estimation of the effect of tax
changes in a particular market, where structural estimation can be used to
separate supply and demand factors. This research will study how to do
structural estimation without functional form assumptions, which will help avoid
misleading inferences that do occur in applications. A menu of models and
methods will be developed. The research will also develop statistical tools to
help in selecting among the methods. These tools will evaluate the performance
of the different methods using higher-order approximations, and help determine
which method is best.&lt;br/&gt; Previous work shows that avoiding functional
form assumptions in structural modeling can lead to more accurate inferences in
important applications such as evaluating the effect of tax changes on labor
supply or consumer well being. This research will add significantly to our
ability to do structural estimation by developing methods for some of the most
important models. Also, the study will show that certain of the methods have
particularly good statistical properties. This research will show that among
methods that are currently widely used for estimating models in both
microeconomics and macroeconomics the one called empirical likelihood has
particularly attractive properties. These results suggest that using this
particular method may lead to more accurate inference in empirical
research.&lt;br/&gt;
