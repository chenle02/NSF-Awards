In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Baer will study the conformations of small organic molecules using
various spectroscopic techniques. In one set of experiments the structures of
simple linear and cyclic ethers and ketones will be determined. Enthalpy
differences between conformers will be measured using a heated valve technique.
In the second study the structure of more complex steroids will be determined.
Resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) and pulsed field ionization
threshold photoelectron spectroscopy (PFI-TPES) are two techniques which will be
used to measure the Rydberg spectra and ionization energies. %%% Since data from
isolated gas-phase molecules and those in the liquid phase will be compared, the
results of these spectroscopic investigations will provide insight into
solvation effects on the spectra and structural properties of molecules. The
data on steroid conformations will help in the understanding of the shapes and
structures of biological molecules. Such data impact many fields, from the
understanding of the mechanism of drug action to the synthesis of materials by
biotechnological methods.
