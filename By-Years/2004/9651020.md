This project is designed to remove the obstacles that discourage capable
students from continuing to study physics. It is using microcomputer-based
laboratories (MBL) as a platform to provide a more effective learning
environment to aid all students, even students who are science deficient or who
have never been provided the opportunity to study physics. These MBL experiments
and activities cover the majority of the topics taught in a traditional two-
semester introductory physics course. The classroom is completely mobile to
allow instruction in a variety of settings. It uses a file server network
system, laptop computers, Universal Laboratory Interfaces, and a variety of
interfacing probes. The project is allowing increased access to physics
education for students in rural areas using an interactive television (ITV)
system with two-way video and audio.
