Alanah Fitch, Loyola University of Chicago, is a Discovery Corps Senior Fellow
for the 2004-2005 academic year. Fitch will implement web-based access to
various analytical instruments and partner with two Kenyan Universities to
conduct various environmental chemistry projects. The project also includes a
strong education component examining various access modes (hands-on, real-time
virtual and simulation) and will strengthen the research infrastructure in the
United States and in Kenya. This Discovery Corps Senior Fellowship is supported
by the Division of Chemistry and the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary
Activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Discovery Corps Fellowship Program is a
pilot program seeking new postdoctoral and professional development models that
combine research expertise with professional service. Discovery Corps Fellows
leverage their research expertise through projects that address areas of
national need. Their projects enhance research capacity and infrastructure and
contribute to workforce development and job creation. The Discovery Corps
Program supports both Postdoctoral Fellows and Senior Fellows.&lt;br/&gt;
