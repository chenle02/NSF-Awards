Carbon stocks and fluxes in urban and suburban residential
landscapes&lt;br/&gt;NSF-Ecosystem Studies&lt;br/&gt;Jenkins, Cadenasso,
Groffman, Pickett, Cox, and Grove&lt;br/&gt;December 2004&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Virtually all across the United States, residential vegetation consists of a
predictable combination of trees, turfgrass, shrubs, and gardens. Preliminary
evidence suggests that carbon (C) sequestration in residential areas is driven
strongly by vegetation (rather than by miles driven or electricity consumed, for
example) and that substantial sequestration does occur where people live.
However, very little is currently known about a) how much C sequestration is
taking place in residential landscapes, or b) what factors determine the rates
of C sequestration. Using three contrasting neighborhoods in Baltimore, MD, this
project will quantify the major C pools in residential areas, the rates of
exchange between these pools and the atmosphere, and the relative importance of
factors such as soil type, landscape structure, residential age, and land use
history in determining C sequestration on residential
land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Residential areas are large and growing, and
National-scale C cycle estimates based on forests or agriculture do not
currently take them into account. This research will therefore contribute to the
ongoing effort to characterize the Northern Hemisphere C budget and will provide
baseline data about C cycling in this overlooked component of the land base. An
extensive grassroots educational effort will be conducted as part of the site
selection process, and graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in
the work. &lt;br/&gt;
