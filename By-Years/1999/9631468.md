Studies, Phase 2 program and provides the program services and data management
necessary to conduct this large multi-- disciplinary multi-PI program. The
Program Service and Data Management Office is responsible for providing basic
services, logistical support, and data management required by scientific
investigators as they conduct their field research, analyze the data from their
individual efforts, and integrate these results with the various research
components of the GLOBEC program. During the research period the office will: 1)
manage several data sets (CTD, biomass, meteorological, satellite, model, etc.)
and make these data available via an on-line, World Wide Web based, data
management system; 2) work with principal investigators on quality control;
maintain an inventory and program thesaurus; support field operations; 3)
distribute program documentation including cruise and data reports as well as
data acquisition procedures and protocols; 4) ensure final submission of data to
a national data archive center; and 5) facilitate national and international
exchanges of data and program-related information. ***
