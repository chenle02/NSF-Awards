9701785 Abrams The primary objective of the Mid-America Earthquake (MAE) Center
is to reduce potential earthquake losses in the central and eastern United
States by concentrating on problems associated with low-frequency seismic events
and the consequences these have for the people, economy, and civil
infrastructure. Research and implementation projects are in two focus areas: (a)
identification and evaluation of possible seismic hazards; and (b) development
of loss reduction strategies for the built environment. Research projects
address seismic source modeling, ground motions (i.e., synthesis,
instrumentation, catalogs), site characterization and response, ground failures,
soil-structure interaction, assessment and strengthening of foundations and
structures, risk and reliability, societal response, and economic impact. The
initial focus is on essential facilities (i.e., buildings that support functions
related to post-earthquake emergency response and disaster management) and
transportation networks (i.e., highways, railroad systems, major waterways and
shipping facilities, and airports). Research teams will use recent advances in
networking technology to interact. The MAE Center's World Wide Web
communications link the core institutions, as well as earthquake research
centers around the world, and include public education features. Center goals
include educating the next generation of seismologists and earthquake engineers,
attracting under-represented minorities and women to these technical
disciplines, and implementing research results in practice. The MAE Center will
be one of three EERC's networked with an overarching governing board to provide
synergism in creating new knowledge, educating the next generation of earthquake
engineers and scientists, and providing outreach to industry, government, pre-
college schools and potential user groups.
