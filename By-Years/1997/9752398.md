This is a two-year project to develop curriculum materials to teach the concepts
of Visualization, i.e., the use of computer graphics to display information. It
is a joint project between the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the ACM
SIGGRAPH Education Committee (SEC) and is international in scope. This project
builds on several previously funded NSF and SEC projects, and on a project
funded by the United Kingdom Advisory Group on Computer Graphics (AGOCG). While
in one sense Visualization has been around for hundreds of years TUFT83 , in
another sense, it began as a formal discipline only recently MCC087 . It was
initially specific to scientific computing applications, but has been extended
to many other areas such as general data or information visualization. The basic
concepts of Visualization are transferable to, and important for, many different
areas such as mathematics, science, business, education, and others. An
estimated fifty percent of the brain' s neurons are associated with vision and
Visualization exploits this "gigabit bandwidth of the eye/visual cortex system"
MCC087 to facilitate the understanding of both simple and complex concepts in
many different application areas. While Visualization has been previously used
in many different areas, such as education, it has only been in the past few
years that a large amount of research has gone into many of the underlying
principles and components of the field. We are proposing to take the knowledge
gained in these research efforts, create instructional materials that capture
this knowledge, and make them available to a wide audience. The successful
implementation of this project will provide the basic materials to teach the
important concepts of Visualization and can be used at many different levels in
college and K-12 courses.
