9419263 Hudson This project is part of the Southern Hemisphere Marine Aerosol
Characterization Experiment (ACE-1), which will be conducted in the remote
Southern Pacific in 1995 using aircraft, ship-board, and ground-based
measurements of a wide variety of chemical species, physical and meteorological
parameters with the central goal of investigating the formation, evolution, and
optical properties of atmospheric aerosol. In this component, cloud condensation
nuclei will be measured onboard the NCAR C-130 aircraft, as well as at the
ground in Cape Grim, Tasmania. These CCN measurements constitute one of the
central objectives of the ACE-1 project, and provide a link between atmospheric
chemistry and cloud research. The continuous airborne CCN measurements can be
used to gauge the indirect aerosol effect, i.e. the suggested increase in cloud
stability due to increased CCN concentrations. CCN spectra will be compared with
physical and chemical aerosol characterizations to determine if CCN spectra can
be predicted from chemical and physical properties of the aerosol. This is
important for aerosol modeling, climate modeling, and determinations of the
origin of atmospheric aerosol. Comparisons between CCN and cloud droplets
provide the opportunity to separate macrophysical and microphysical cloud
properties and to distinguish between the effects of cloud dynamics and the
effects of the physics and chemistry of the aerosol. The ACE-1 data will
constitute an extension of other CCN and cloud droplet data bases with the
ultimate goal of understanding the role of aerosols in the global cloud systems.
