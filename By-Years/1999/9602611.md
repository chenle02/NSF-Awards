This award will provide partial support for the creation of a Plasma
Spectroscopy Laboratory for the College of Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences
(COAS) at Oregon State University, recognized as one of the ten major -JOI+
oceanographic institutions. Three outdated, interconnected laboratories in Burt
Hall will be renovated to provide integrated management and sample preparation
for an existing emission plasma spectrometer and two existing atomic absorption
instruments. An adjoining laboratory will be converted into an electronics shop
and clean room. Current laboratories are not suitable for the low level work
conducted in the facility. Renovations will include: remodeling space,
refurbishing existing cabinets and counters, replacing corroded metal sinks and
fixtures, and installing new ductwork, fume hoods and air conditioning units. To
make the facility safe and more cost-effective to operate, an uninterrupted
power supply and a central recirculating water chiller will be included. This
project will elevate the quality of science produced by reducing the possibility
of contamination, and guaranteeing the integrity of samples during sample
preparation and analysis. Research training for students will be enhanced, as
well as accommodating more students, faculty and visiting scientists conducting
research in the facility.
