This funding provides for a first renewal of a CISE Research Experiences for
Undergraduates site at the University of California-San Diego (UCSD). The focus
of the multidisciplinary site is on cyber-physical systems research motivated by
real world challenges in exploration and scientific discovery. The site expands
the successful UCSD Engineers for Exploration program to include students from
other universities. The program aims to provide a unique experience for
motivated students by providing an intimate mentored lab environment at UCSD,
and a structured collaboration with scientists, explorers, and engineers at the
UCSD partner organizations. These partner organizations include the National
Geographic Society, Hubbs SeaWorld Research Institute, San Diego Zoo Global,
NOAA, USDA, the California Wolf Center, and the Scripps Institute of
Oceanography. The program provides undergraduates with a unique opportunity to
develop technology that will be deployed across the world; the projects involve
scientific research that literally spans across every continent and into the far
corners of the globe. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project is led by an
outstanding team offering state-of-the art facilities and professional mentors
to guide undergraduates in explorations of real-world problems. The REU
participants will be exposed to exciting research projects centered on
exploration and scientific discovery while utilizing a vast array of engineering
disciplines across a wide range of research topics. They will work with
accomplished faculty and scientific mentors using state-of-the-art facilities to
perform cutting-edge cyber-physical systems research. In addition, they will be
exposed to extensive professional development activities through weekly research
skills workshops and participation in an undergraduate research conference.
