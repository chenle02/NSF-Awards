In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Prof. Dor Ben-Amotz of Purdue University and his graduate
research students will study the interactions between water and other molecules
using multivariate vibrational spectroscopy, computer simulations and liquid
theory. The aim of this program is to obtain a molecularly detailed view of
changes in water hydrogen bonding, as well as the formation of dangling OH
bonds, induced by non-polar, polar and ionic solutes. This work will contribute
to the fundamental understanding and utilization of water in driving important
biological, geological and environmental processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides
the broad impact of the research on several areas of science, Prof. Ben-Amotz
will continue to provide his research students with excellent training in
experimental as well as theoretical methods.&lt;br/&gt;
