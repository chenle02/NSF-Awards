0208196&lt;br/&gt;Malin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, Duke's seismology
group will participate in the collaborative analyses of the passive and active
seismic data that will be collected in the SAFOD Pilot Hole. The group's
research will include investigations of the near-borehole fault and velocity
structure, improved earthquake locations using this structure, studies of
earthquake-to-receiver path effects and earthquake source effects. The group's
participation in this research is based on their previous work on the structure
and seismology of the SAFOD site and their involvement in development of
borehole instruments for the SAFOD program. The active seismic profiling portion
of their proposal is linked to a complimentary proposal (recommended for
funding) by the University of Wyoming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Duke Univ. group
will instrument the Pilot Hole with: 1) a multilevel string of 3-component 12 Hz
seismometers; 2) a high sensitivity, large dynamic range, 3-component 2 Hz
seismograph, installed at the bottom-of-casing. The seismic array string and 2
Hz seismograph have been developed in collaboration with oil-exploration
instrumentation companies. The new casing-bottom seismograph, seismic array
string, and pressure monitor system will provide unique 3rd and 4th dimension
(depth and time), spectral content and volumetric strain information on the
microearthquakes that are the targets of the main SAFOD
hole.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
