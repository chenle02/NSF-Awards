This project will investigate the problem of providing better access
&lt;br/&gt;to web information and services to a rapidly growing user population.
&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to take the next step toward scalability by performing a
&lt;br/&gt;systematic study of architecture, problems, and performance issues
&lt;br/&gt;in content distribution networks. New ways to reduce response time
&lt;br/&gt;and the load imposed on the network will be explored. An integrated
&lt;br/&gt;approach is adopted to study the synergetic effect of different
&lt;br/&gt;components in content distribution systems. Specifically the
research&lt;br/&gt;will include developing dynamic content delivery techniques,
designing&lt;br/&gt;application-level multicast delivery protocols, developing
dynamic &lt;br/&gt;server selection algorithms, and studying dynamic replica
placement &lt;br/&gt;methods.
