Bass Professors Bass and Burdzy propose to study some problems in the areas:
boundary behavior of Brownian motion and harmonic functions, reflecting Brownian
motion, diffusions on fractals, occupation times for random walks in two
dimensions, exceptional points of planar Brownian motion, intersection local
times for planar Brownian motion, iterated Brownian motion, and numerical
results for Fleming--Viot processes. Brownian motion as studied in probability
theory is a mathematical model of what one sees when one watches how cream gets
mixed into coffee or how smoke diffuses through the air of a room. It is not
surprising that the study of Brownian motion has applications to physics,
chemistry, engineering, and quantum mechanics; however, it is also extremely
useful for filtering noisy signals, studying the growth of populations, the
behavior of the stock market, and a whole host of other applications. Professors
Bass and Burdzy propose to study how Brownian motion and related objects can be
used in solving problems that come up in mathematical physics. Many of these
problems can be reduced to the solution of certain partial differential
equations, which in turn can be resolved through the use of Brownian motion and
other diffusions.
