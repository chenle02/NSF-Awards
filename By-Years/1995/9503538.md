9503538 Batiza This area of the EPR has been extensively studied and Batiza has
collected an impressive set of samples from three transects that cross the ridge
axis. These allow him to evaluate the evolution of the magma chamber over a
period of about 1 m.y. Results to date indicate that one of the ridge transects,
the one with less magma, only erupted MORBs but the two other erupted a mixture
of N-MORBs and E-MORBs. There are a number of alternatives for these differences
and Batiza wishes to do additional analyses of the rocks in hand to evaluate
these alternatives. ***
