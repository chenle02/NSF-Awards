With support from this grant the PI will construct and deploy, at CEDAR and
other field sites, a multiwavelength, computer controlled and pointed, stellar
photometer to monitor the condition of the sky during airglow observations. Data
will be obtained on atmospheric extinction at eight wavelengths including a
water vapor absorption band. These data will permit the correction of airglow
photometric data for absorption in the earth's troposphere. In addition, the
background sky brightness will be monitored at each wavelength. Two wavelengths
will be set at emission lines due to mercury and sodium which are emitted
strongly by outside lights at night. Clouds illuminated by such lighting
produces a strong source of sky pollution which reduces the quality of night sky
observations. Results from this instrument will be invaluable to other observers
who must operate their instrument in an unmanned automatic mode. With data
corrected for extinction better agreement between observations and model
predictions should result; likewise agreement between various observers' results
should improve. Commercial devices will be used as far as possible to reduce
development time. The resulting data set will be provided to campaign observers
and will be deposited in the CEDAR data bank.
