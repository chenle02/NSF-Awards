Morelli This award funds the research of Professor Robert Morelli into toric
varieties and lattice point counting. The work is a combination of ideas from
several parts of number theory and combinatorics. The work includes developing
general techniques for counting points in convex polytopes. The investigator
also intends to explore connections between these problems and problems
involving zeta functions and modular forms. This work falls into the general
areas of Number Theory and Combinatorics. Number Theory is the study of
properties of the whole numbers and is the oldest branch of systematic
mathematics. Combinatorics is the study of problems involving the counting of
complex collections. The research involves establishing general methods for
counting regularly distributed points within regular boundaries. This has
important application in many different areas of mathematics and science.
Recently both Number Theory and Combinatorics have found applications in
theoretical computer science and modern communication. ***
