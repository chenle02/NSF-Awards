The purpose of the research is to develop improved methods for handling liquid
metals through the use of electromagnetic forces. Specific thrust areas of the
research include: source coil design, including development of the three-
dimensional boundary element inverse problem and forward problem solvers and
development of an optimization methodology for choice of specific source
configuration; three-dimensional levitation, confinement and shaping, including
experimental documentation, through digital image analysis, of position and
shape of liquid metal interfaces; studies of whole-body, surface-coupled and
bulk- coupled instability mechanisms, and studies of solidification structures
of electromagnetically cast metals, with comparisons to conventionally cast
structures. The modeling work centers upon development of self- consistent
numerical tools for the design of source coil configurations and excitations,
based upon desired geometries of levitated liquid metals and criteria which
discriminate among alternative source options. The experimental work is aimed
toward validation of modeling concepts and results, as well as investigation of
practical electromagnetic configurations for flow control and shaping. If
effective techniques for handling liquid metals without physical contact can be
developed, it could greatly increase the efficiency of the conventional casting
industry.
