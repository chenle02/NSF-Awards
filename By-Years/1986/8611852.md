The PI proposes to integrate the piosecond photoconductors directly on the
microelectronic devices made from semiconductor quantum wells and superlatives.
This effort will collaborate with the Army Electronics Technology and Device
Laboratory (ETDL) to develop efficient piosecond photoconductors on MBE
materials and to devise on-chip piosecond measurement techniques for high speed
electronic devices.
