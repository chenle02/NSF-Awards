This research addresses the taxonomic relationships among birds that cache food
for future recovery using extraordinary brain capacities for spatial memory. The
seed-caching abilities of the titmice (Paridae), nuthatches (Sittidae), and
crows/jays (Corvidae) appear to be independent evolutionary acquisitions. Drs.
Gill and Sheldon will test the validity of the currently controversial
classification of passerine birds by a series of comparisons of the genetic
material DNA. In particular, the proposed biochemical analyses will address the
historical basis of profound memory capacities of the avian brain and associated
changes in feeding and social behavior.
