This dissertation research will investigate the heavy quark content of b-quark
jets produced in the ATLAS detector at CERN. The research will be conducted in
collaboration with CERN Laboratory under the auspices of Dr. Maria Smizanska.
This study will probe the fragmentation properties of b-jets with reconstructed
charmed hadrons in their most efficiently detected decay modes. The analysis
will use data streams sensitive to events containing muon + jet and Z + jet
which will be captured by unbiased ATLAS triggers based on muon + jet and dimuon
patterns in the ATLAS subdetectors. This will be the first test of the
fragmentation models encoded in Monte Carlo generators against data at the
energy frontier of the Large Hadron Collider. It will allow ATLAS to calibrate
its energy scale. The reconstructed charm particle decays can be useful in
disentangling the contribution of g-&gt;b anti-b splitting processes from
single-b contributions. The correct fragmentation model is essential to the
description of b-jet spectra and is consequently crucial for a proper
subtraction of backgrounds to searches for new physics including the Higgs. This
proposal will support the international dissertation research for one graduate
student.&lt;br/&gt;
