To be successful in the electronics and robotics fields, students must
understand the fundamental control devices used in modern industrial electrical
systems. Through this project, a new industrial controls laboratory promotes
curricular reform, allowing the presentation of concepts and applications in a
setting more conducive to promoting "learning as an active process" as
recommended by the National Science Educational Standards. Such a laboratory
also directly responds to the needs of industrial clients who have participated
actively in the redesign of the engineering technology program.
