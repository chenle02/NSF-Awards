Model selection, parameter estimation, and spectral analysis are three important
areas in statistical signal processing. This research explores some difficult
and unresolved problems in these disciplines by exploiting Bayesian theory.
Topics of interest include the derivation of model selection rules based on
asymptotic assumptions and their applications to problems in array processing,
rank determination in time series analysis, and segmentation of vector fields;
analysis of transient signals and parameter estimation of highly nonlinear
models such as threshold signal models and bilinear models; and, Bayesian
spectral analysis of nonstationary signals. This effort primarily consists of
three equally important components. The first is a theoretical investigation
into these problems that leads to an improved understanding of various signal
models and concepts. The second is the practical application of the solutions,
which includes automatic segmentation of medical images and the processing of
single channel patch clamp currents. The third is purely educational. Students
are given a practical exposition into the versatility of Bayesian inference and
its applicability for solving a wide range of signal processing problems.
