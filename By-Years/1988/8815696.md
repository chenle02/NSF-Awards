This award will enable Dr. William E. Carter, of the Geodetic Research and
Development Laboratory of the U.S. National Geodetic Survey, and his research
group, to collaborate with Dr. Koichi Yokoyama and co-workers of the
International Latitude Observatory of Mizusawa, Japan, over a period of two
years. They will work on problems related to the interconnection of the North
America and Europe Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) network with the
Japan and North America VLBI network. Software used by the two systems will be
rationalized, joint test observing sessions will be conducted, and special
observing sessions will be conducted to ascertain optimum sampling frequencies.
The purpose of this research is to facilitate the interconnection of these
continent-scale VLBI networks, thus greatly enhancing the precision of geodetic
measurements. VLBI, in which simultaneous observations taken by widely-spaced
radio telescopes can be correlated to achieve angular precision under a
millisecond of arc and terrestrial distance references to within a centimeter,
is the most powerful method of monitoring variations in the earth's polar
motion, precession, and nutation. Observations will be taken by both the U.S.
and Japanese teams on their respective VLBI networks, and the raw data will be
processed by the U.S. team. The results will be presented in joint research
papers.
