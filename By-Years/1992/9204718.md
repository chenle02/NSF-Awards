This project is to continue a series of Re-Os isotopic investigations designed
to address the formation of Archean cratons; the composition and age of
lithospheric mantle, the interaction between the lithosphere and asthenosphere
and the chemical evolution of the mantle. Diverse samples of different ages will
be analyzed: 1.8 - 3.3 Ga komatiites to basalts; 2.7-3.8 GA trondhjemites-
tonalite-granodiorites; peridotitic mantle xenoliths; orogenic lherzolites; and
continental mafic and alkalic lavas. Partitioning experiments for Re and Os
between carbonatite-silicate liquids will be conducted to understand the
behavior of Re and Os during mantle enrichment processes. The research will
combine Re-Os isotopic data with data from one or more of these conventional
isotopic systems (plus major and trace element data). Re and Os abundances and
Os isotopic compositions will be analyzed at DTM by negative thermal ionization
mass spectrometry (NTIMS). The results should not only shed new light on crust-
mantle relationships, but also contribute significantly to the development of a
new and exciting analytical technique.
