A 200 MHz Gemini Fourier Transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometer is
being integrated into the undergraduate chemistry curriculum for chemical
analysis. Chemistry laboratory instruction is being improved in six regularly
offered courses, one interim course, and the undergraduate research program of
the department. Students are being introduced to the FT-NMR in the sophomore
organic chemistry course and receive hands-on experience with this state-of-the-
art, computer-controlled laboratory instrument as juniors and seniors. The high-
field NMR technique produces simplified proton NMR spectra allowing for a more
thorough interpretation of spectra by the students and thereby enhancing their
ability to use NMR in the identification of compounds they have prepared. They
are also becoming familiar with Carbon-13 NMR as an important tool for
structural elucidation of substances. Computer control of the instrument is
allowing for collection, manipulation, and rapid analysis of data including two-
dimensional NMR. The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources.
