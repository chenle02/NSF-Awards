9501145 Prieve This project is on research to use total internal reflection
microscopy (TIRM), which was developed in the Principal Investigator's (PI)
laboratory to measure colloidal interactions, to determine: (1) the forces
between single receptor-ligand pairs; and (2) the elasticity of single bonds. In
addition, the magnitudes of forces at large separations will be correlated with
the measured adhesion between the receptor and ligand coated surfaces. The model
cells for the adhesion experiments will be immunoglobulin-G-coated latex beads
and a protein-A-coated glass plate. ***
