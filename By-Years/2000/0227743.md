This project will provide partial support for the Conference on Quantum Phases
at the Nanoscale (NANOPHASE) which will take place in Erice, Sicily, Italy, July
15-20, 2002. The Conference will consider recent advances in the study and
applications of novel states in systems of nanoscale dimensions. Main goals are
to bring together scientists that are playing key roles in this research field,
along with young researchers, in order to evaluate recent developments, and to
create visions that will guide future interdisciplinary research in nanoscale
science and technology. The Conference will include approximately 30 plenary
lectures and 100 participants. The core funding for this project is from the
European Community. US support is provided by the Office of Naval Research and
the National Science Foundation. The NSF support will provide travel expenses
for young US scientists to attend the Conference, and later to visit selected
European laboratories to explore and develop international collaborations in the
area of nanoscience. The project is supported by the Western Europe Program of
the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering.
