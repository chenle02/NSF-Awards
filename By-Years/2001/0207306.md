0207306&lt;br/&gt;Blythe&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The San Andreas Fault zone
Observatory at Depth (SAFOD) Pilot Hole will provide an excellent opportunity
for exploring the relationship between fault slip and the thermal evolution of
the crust by studying core samples from varying depths using two complementary
thermochronologic methods. The Pilot Hole, located in Parkfield, CA less than
two kilometers from the San Andreas fault will reach a depth of 2.1 km. The
borehole will intersect Salinian granite rocks at a depth of less than 1 km and
similar granitic rocks outcrop at the surface within a few kilometers of the
Pilot Hole. The Principal Investigators will analyze samples from borehole
cuttings at depth intervals of 100 - 200 m and from the surface outcrops. They
will determine the thermal history of the samples using apatite fission track
and U/Th-He thermochronometers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will explore the
complex interplay between uplift, erosion, and heat flow by using multiple
thermochronologic systems on samples from a vertical profile. These data will
allow the PIs to separate the effects of uplift from changes in the geothermal
gradient, such as those resulting from the long-term frictional heat generated
along the San Andreas fault. Because the uplift history at Parkfield is
controlled, in part, by slip along the San Andreas fault, their work will also
provide information about the kinematics of the
fault.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
