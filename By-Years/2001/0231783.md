This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project investigates and
develops techniques to determine the privacy risk to databases and data sets.
The research results in the implementation of a suite of techniques, Privacy and
Risk Mitigation Assessment Tool (PARMAT), to quantitatively assess data privacy
and to mitigate risk. A prototype implementation is developed to test and
demonstrate the feasibility of the techniques and methods.

Privacy is a growing concern especially with the proliferation of personal
information in electronic format, making it easier to access and gather
individual-specific information. The tools and techniques developed during Phase
I will be of interest to a wide variety of users that must protect the privacy
of personal information stored electronically. The Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act (HIPAA) provides a set of standards for protecting the
privacy of Americans' personal health records. The new regulation requires the
protection of personal health information maintained by health care providers,
hospitals, health plans, health insurers, and health care clearinghouses. The US
Department of Health and Human Services estimates the cost to industry
associated with the privacy regulation implementation for HIPAA to be $17.6
billion. While the company only addresses one segment of healthcare information
privacy, the market potential for the proffered technology is considerable.
