Recommended project is for measurement of the platinum group elements (PGE),
chalcophile elements, and Os isotopic compositions on well-characterized dunites
and harzburgites from the Oman ophiolite, representing relict samples from
obducted oceanic mantle. The major goal is to determine the Os isotopic and PGE
composition of the mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) mantle source, principally to
test whether it has chondritic Os and PGE signatures that are fractionated from
chondrites (as are abyssal and massif peridotites). The proposal will also
examine PGE mobility during magmatic and alteration processes, considering
specifically whether wall-rock interaction during melt transport and weathering
of exposed rock can change PGE values. This work will provide important
constraints regarding the origin of the MORB source, and should help to resolve
geochemical contraditions presented between ophiolites and abyssal peridotites
regarding whether they are both residues of MORB melting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
