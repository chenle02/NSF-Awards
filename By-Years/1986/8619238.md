This is a recommendation for renewal of support of research on the roles of
fungi and oligochaetes in the removal of pollutants from wastewater as it passes
through organic humus. Prior work conducted under NSF Grant No. CEE-8312184
characterized the fungi, oligochaetes and bacteria found in a sphagnum peat
onsite wastewater treatment system that has been in successful operation since
1978. These investigators found that between 60 and 80 percent of the total
respiratory activity within the moss was attributable to fungi. Isolates from
this prior work will be used to inoculate a new peat-based treatment system
which will be compared with a control to determine the effects of selective
inoculation on the efficiency of the process and lagtime associated with the
placement of these systems into service. On-site wastewater systems continue to
provide a solution to wastewater management for a large fraction of the Nation's
population. Their failure to operate acceptably after relatively short periods
of satisfactory service is well-documented. NSF supported the 1983 workshop at
Colorado State University on soil absorption of wastewater that identified
research needed to improve the engineering design of soil leaching systems. This
project has the potential of improving our understanding of how passage through
soil removes contaminants from wastewater and thus lead to better design and
operation of these systems. The objectives of this project are consistent with
those of the Environmental Engineering Program and the qualifications of the
investigators are appropriate for the work to be done. Award is recommended as a
24-month Continuing Grant, the initial increment of which is in the amount of
$69,411 for 12 months starting on February 1, 1987.
