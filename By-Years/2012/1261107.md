The goal of this project is to advance understanding of the spectrum of large-
scale ionospheric electron density irregularities commonly observed in the
nighttime equatorial and low-latitude ionosphere, known as Equatorial Spread F
(ESF), as a function of varying geophysical conditions. The result will be an
improved understanding of the processes responsible for ESF development,
variability and morphology. The approach is to use in-situ ion density
measurements made by the Planar Langmuir Probe (PLP) onboard the C/NOFS
(Communication/Navigation Outage Forecasting System) satellite. The observations
made by the C/NOFS-PLP can provide a characterization of the spatial (in the
zonal direction) spectrum of large-scale ESF structures under different
geophysical conditions. Analysis of the PLP measurements will also make it
possible to identify the occurrence of periodic structures, and the occurrence
of a dominant wavelength (or a dominant range of wavelengths). PLP measurements
will allow the estimation of the occurrence rate of large-scale ESF structures
as a function of season and longitude sector. The project will investigate
possible explanations for the variability in ESF periodicities.
