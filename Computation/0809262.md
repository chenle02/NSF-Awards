Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods are becoming important techniques for the
computational solution of partial differential equations. With discontinuous
finite element bases, they capture discontinuities in, {\it e.g.}, hyperbolic
systems with high accuracy and efficiency; simplify adaptive mesh refinement,
order-variation and lead to efficient parallel solution procedures. The PI
proposes to study the superconvergence properties of DG solutions of hyperbolic
systems and local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) solutions of convection-diffusion
and higher-order problems in one and multiple space dimensions. The PI will
investigate several aspects of the superconvergence phenomena, including the
effects of numerical fluxes, stabilization schemes, mesh structure, and order
variation on superconvergence properties. The PI will use superconvergence
properties to construct simple and asymptotically exact {\it a posteriori}
estimates of discretization errors and very accurate functions of interest. Both
of these provide valuable accuracy appraisals and guidance for an adaptive
solution strategy. Stabilization or limiting is necessary with high-order DG and
LDG methods to remove spurious oscillations near discontinuities and sharp
transition layers. The PI will investigate several stabilization strategies
based on residual dissipation, solution moments, and ENO schemes with a goal of
discovering those that provide optimal performance in specified circumstances.
Furthermore, superconvergence properties can be used to locate discontinuities
and sharp transitions and, as such, provide the possibility of developing
adaptive stabilization techniques that need only be applied where necessary to
avoid oscillations and loss of accuracy caused by unnecessary stabilization in
smooth solution regions.

Computer simulations of complex and realistic problems from a variety of
disciplines still require a very long time on the fastest available computers.
Efficient, reliable and accurate discontinuous Galerkin methods for partial
differential equations will be developed by the investigator and implemented in
numerical software that can be used to address large-scale problems arising in
many critical areas such as energy and environment. The reliability provided
through {\it a posteriori} error estimation, will additionally enable advanced
adaptive software to be used in educational settings to help students understand
delicate and intricate phenomena and prepare the next generation of scientists.
