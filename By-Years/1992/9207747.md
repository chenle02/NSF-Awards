This new research project will study issues concerning dynamical electronic
response and many-body effects of real metals, both at the surface and in the
bulk. The emphasis will be first-principles treatment of the electron-density
response function and the electron self-energy. The goal is the realistic
treatment and description of electronic excitation in real metals, and through
such understanding obtaining explanations for numerous experimental results
which deviate strongly from the results predicted by simpler (density-
functional) theory. %%% The mechanical properties of materials are determined
primarily by their static electronic structure. Calculations of the static
electronic structure is more-or-less routine for a wide range of materials.
However, dynamic properties, such as the response of a material to light or to
rapidly moving ions, are generally not within the scope of these conventional
approaches. This project intends to develop new classes of techniques which are
both accurate and tractible when applied to such dynamical phenomena.
