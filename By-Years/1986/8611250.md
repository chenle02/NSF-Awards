The newly-evolving area of biotechnology involves an attempt to use
microorganisms to produce new products. Essential is the development of novel
configurations of large bioreactors that utilize the microorganisms more
efficiently than the reactors of the past which had to be run in batches and
consisted of very dilute aqueous systems (and therefore had to be followed by
very expensive separation sections). Immobilizing enzymes on a solid support
structure permits continuous operation and is aimed at alleviating the first of
the above limitations. The design of large scale bioreactors, utilizing such
immobilized enzymes is in its infancy. This research is attempting to use
methodology developed in heterogeneous chemical catalysis for such bioreactors.
The system to be used for these experimental studies are immobilized enzyme
systems which behave as pseudo-first-order reacting systems. The solid phase, in
this care a bioparticle, (analogous to the catalyst in chemical systems) is
where the reaction occurs. The specific systems that will be used include
immobilized glucose isomerase, immobilized invertase, and immobilized lactase.
