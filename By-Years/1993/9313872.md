Frank 9313872 Vertical migration has been described as one of the dominant
behavioral patterns on earth. The influence of this phenomenon on the structure
of marine ecosystems is well documented, and defining the environmental
variables which control this behavior is critical to developing predictive
models of animal distributions in the ocean. It is generally accepted that light
is the variable which exerts the greatest influence over migratory behavior.
This study will conduct experiments on deep-sea species, whose ambient light
field contains few variables and is therefore more easily reproduced. Due to the
recent discovery of near-UV light sensitivy in several species of deep-sea,
vertically migrating shrimp, in situ measurements of both visible and near -UV
light will be made and utilized to provide a calibrated light field for
behavioral and electrophysiological experiments designed to define the critical
photic determinants of vertical migration. ***
