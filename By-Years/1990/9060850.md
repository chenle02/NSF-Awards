The proposed research will develop ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) waveguide
components for optical switching, beam steering, and non- linear optics (NLO)
applications. The optical switching and beam steering FLC components will take
advantage of the fast switching, the low power consumption and the large
electro-optic effect of FLCs. The switches will be small in size and can be
densely packed to yield large switch arrays which can be continuously
reconfigured without encountering the limitations of power dissipation or size
that hinder other approaches. The beam steerer will have large deflections and a
large number of addressable angles using low drive voltages. The FLC NLO
components will utilize the permanent polar order of the smectic C* state to
orient the molecular hyperpolarizability of the FLC molecules, resulting in a
medium with a thermodynamically stable 2 non-linear susceptibility. The 2FLC
medium can be used to frequency double near infrared radiation from a laser
diode. The proposed phase I research will develop waveguide technology for FLCL
thin films. In phase II, the FLC wave guides will be incorporated into beam
steerer, optical interconnection switches, and media for second harmonic
generation.
