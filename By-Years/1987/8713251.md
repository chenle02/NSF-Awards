During the past five years much progress has been made in elucidating the
molecular basis of the immune response. The organization of genes encoding the
specficity of the antigen receptor of B and T cells, as well as of genes
encoding various lymphokines, was unravelled. Moreover the rearrangement of
genes encoding lymphocytic receptor during the development of lymphocytes was
demonstrated to be a unique and particular molecular event characteristic for
lymphoid lineage. Important progress also occurred in understanding the
organization of genes of the MHC locus, whose products function as genetic
restriction elements that control the magnitude and affinity of antibody
responses. The knowledge obtained from these fundamental studies has been
extended to diseases and contributed to the understanding, function and the
characteristics of V genes encoding antibodies and the role of MHC products in
autoimmune diseases. The Conference on the Molecular Basis of the Immune
Response, organized by Dr. Bona for the New York Academy of Sciences will review
some of these advances as well as provide new insight on the function of
lymphocytes in physiological and pathological conditions.
