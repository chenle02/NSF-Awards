Control strategies for many large-scale engineering applications are often
formulated as constrained optimization problems as exemplified by the optimal
power flow (OPF) formulation for power system security. At present, only
simplistic models of the OPF, using d.c. load flows, can be solved in a time-
frame fast enough for real-time control. When reactive power and voltage along
with more complex constraints are considered, solving the OPF problem becomes
too time consuming. The goal of this project is to enhance the computational
throughput of OPF and similar problems by applying two new approaches to
constrained optimization which can how be implemented efficiently using nascent
ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) technology. These new
optimization approaches are the simulated annealing algorithm (Astochastic
state-space search algorithm) and the computational concept of neural networks
(massively parallel, redundant, computational structures which are very
conducive to VLSI implementation.) The project objectives are to first find a
strategy for mapping the OPF and similar problems into the energy and constraint
functions for simulated annealing and neural networks. Then, simulations for
extracting the performance and cost benefits of these approaches will be
developed. Finally, implementation of these systems in dedicated hardware using
the latest ASIC technology will be assessed.
