Narrative: The International Symposium on Multiphase Flows will be held on
August 3-5, 1987, at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China. The symposium will
provide a medium for technical communication between China and the United States
and will provide an overview of the rapidly emerging multiphase flow technology
in China. The symposium will feature sessions on fluidized beds, combustion in
multiphase systems, pneumatic transport, erosion, slurry flows, granular flows,
separation technology, experimental methods, developments in numerical modeling
and fundamental concepts. Papers from the international community will be
presented at the symposium with the majority coming from the United States and
China. This grant supports the travel of seven academic engineers who are
uniquely qualified to represent the U.S.A. at this international symposium.
