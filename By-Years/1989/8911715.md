A general model of coping with threatening events, the person-event model, is
used to generate predictions concerning the impact of a particular type of
communication, the negative threat appeal, on earthquake preparedness. Previous
research suggests that exposure to this type of communication can increase level
of earthquake preparedness. Using the person-event model as a theoretical
framework, the proposed research extends these findings by determining which
combinations of levels of the variables typically included in the content of
negative threat appeals are most effective in increasing earthquake
preparedness. Three studies using experimental methods are planned. The first
two studies will be conducted in a laboratory setting with student populations
while the third study will be conducted in a field setting with a homeowner
population.
