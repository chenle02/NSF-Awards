The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation â€“
Research Partnership (PFI-RP) project is far-reaching for both the commercial
space industry and the biomedical industry. The proposed product addresses a
critical technological gap and bottleneck in complex three-dimensional (3D)
tissue biomanufacturing on Earth and in low-Earth orbit. The proposed
technology, which combines a microgravity-optimized culture vessel with advanced
cryopreservation capabilities, would be transformative for the in-space
biomanufacturing community and open a broad range of on-Earth biomedical
applications for space-made biologics. The innovation may accelerate the
establishment of a new space-based biomedical industry and motivate further
innovation to develop self-sustaining and fully automated biosatellites to
produce space-made biologics for Earth health benefits. This project represents
a training opportunity for the affiliated graduate students to gain hands-on,
real-world, biotechnology entrepreneurial experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed project is based on the proposed integration of two cutting-edge
technologies: microgravity-facilitated tissue self-assembly and isochoric
supercooling tissue preservation. This project, if successful, will determine
the thermodynamic and biological parameters that will enable isochoric
supercooling cryopreservation of complex 3D bioengineered tissues within a
microgravity-optimized tissue culture bioreactor. The goal is to develop a
commercialization-ready tissue engineering system with advanced cryopreservation
capabilities that can generate, store, and transport living, complex, 3D
bioengineered tissues between low-Earth orbit and
Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
