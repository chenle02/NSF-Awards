9311857 Burby Credible arguments can be made for both deterrent and cooperative
approaches to code enforcement, but at present we know relatively little about
the extent to which agencies are using deterrent or cooperative enforcement
techniques, or about their antecedents and their consequences for improved
compliance. Much of the discussion in the literature is normative and anecdotal,
and focused mainly on federal regulatory programs. Thus, there seems to be a
clear need to begin examining empirically strategies local governments are using
to enforce building codes. This research has five main aims: (1) to determine
the degree to which deterrent and cooperative enforcement techniques are being
used in enforcing building codes in areas subject to seismic hazards; (2) to
isolate agency and community characteristics that facilitate the use of each
approach; (3) to document the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, based
on the perceptions and actual experiences of code enforcement personnel; (4) to
isolate factors associated with successful and unsuccessful experiences with
deterrent and cooperative enforcement (in other words, in what circumstances
does each work well and less well?); and (5) to assess the implications of these
findings for federal and state efforts to foster more effective enforcement of
the seismic provisions of codes and for future federal and state hazard
mitigation programs. These goals will be accomplished through a national survey
and community case studies. ***
