This research project focuses on the modeling and mathematical analysis of
nonlinear systems arising in physical and biological science as well as
engineering applications. The models under investigation include hyperbolic
balance laws for the investigation of nonlinear systems arising in continuum
physics, mixtures of fluids for the study of fluid-particle and fluid-solid
interaction as well as kinetic models for the investigation of the collective
self-organization of agents. Specific themes include: (a) Structure and
stability of solutions to hyperbolic balance laws and models of fluid mixtures.
(b) Diffusion and hydrodynamic limits for collisional kinetic equations. (c)
Large-data existence theory for polymeric fluids. (d) Self-organized dynamics:
long-time behavior and stability of models capturing flocking behavior.
Mathematical models that directly address fluid-particle interaction and
collective self-organization of agents are very relevant to a variety of
problems: biological, and non-biological (social networks). Progress in this
investigation will enhance our understanding of complex systems. Furthermore, a
successful completion of the proposed activities will contribute to the
development of new analytical and numerical techniques and to the design of high
performance computational algorithms. The project includes a substantial
educational component that reflects an ongoing commitment to education on all
levels (undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate education). Special attention
is given to outreach activities, minorities, and to developing programs that
foster and encourage training in the field of applied mathematics.
