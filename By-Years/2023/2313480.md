As areas with an unusually high degree of interaction between peoples
participating in different cultures, borderlands have been of interest to
scholars of many disciplines. However, most research has focused on situations
in which borders are already defined and present, as well as interactions
involving at least one state or empire. This research trend leaves several
issues poorly understood, including: the influence of already existing forms and
contexts of interaction on the development of a border, the role of
borderlanders, and the entanglement of social groups through interaction in
zones of contact. This project leverages archaeologyâ€™s unique access to data on
human actions over long periods of time to investigate the fluid creation and
deconstruction of borders as scales of social interaction change. By focusing on
a pre-state context, this project highlights conceptual tension in the social
sciences between what is and is not a border, encouraging reflection on cross-
border interactions in the strictly bordered world of today. The results of the
project are shared with inhabitants of the nearby modern communities as well as
the international academic community, providing the vital data needed to
reconsider our understanding of long-term borderland interactions.

In this doctoral dissertation project the research team investigates the
intersection of social interaction and the formation and deconstruction of
borders in in a region in which interaction has persisted for centuries. The
boundary persists until the current time. However the sharing of technologies
and styles of decoration of material culture, across both regions suggests
cross-border interactions must have occurred with some frequency. This project
examines recently excavated public architecture, ceramics, and non-local
materials to test models of the intersection between the creation and
maintenance of borderlands and cross-border interaction. The multi-scalar,
multi-disciplinary approach emphasizes the union of archaeological expertise and
specialized analysis: the project weaves together stylistic and technological
analysis of ceramics and architecture; petrographic and chemical sourcing of
ceramics; aDNA and isotopic analysis of camelid remains; radiocarbon dating of
organic remains; and chemical and habitat sourcing of other non-local materials
to clarify the presence or absence and characteristics of the border as well as
its manifestation at a local scale during its first supposed appearance.
