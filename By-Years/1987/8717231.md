The distribution of particulate matter is a sensitive indicator in surface and
botton waters of physical and biological processes such as primary production,
upwelling, large-scale eddies, resuspension and advection of sediments, and
boundary- layer mixing. This proposal requests funding to participate on five
(5) cruises in the South Atlantic Ventilation Experiment (SAVE) and a McCartney
et al. hydrographic cruise in the South Atlantic to determine the three-
dimensional distribution and size spectra of particulate matter in the South
Atlantic by interfacing a transmissometer with a CTD for hydrographic profiles
and analyzing water samples for particle concentrations and size distributions
throughout the water column using a Coulter counter. These data will be combi>ed
with transects of transmissometer data collected this year during two other
cruises in the South Atlantic. The particle data will be used >o determine the
location and intensity of the processes mentioned above and will be correlated
with other hydrographic data to study their causes and effects.
