Funding is provided for a seismic and structural geology experiment to delineate
the geometries and patterns of crustal extension and rift magmatism along three
main conjugate margins across Alarcon, Guaymas and Delfin Basins (to study the
south to north seafloor-spreading to non-spreading mode) and a E-W profile along
Wagner Basin (to study the low-angle detachment fault at depth). The questions
to be addressed include, strain partitioning, volumetric and emplacement style
of rift magmatism, along-axis differences in extension style and the influence
of sedimentation on deformation. An integrated land-based and at sea study is
planned for the next three years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
