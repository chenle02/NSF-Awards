Three faculty members will continue their research in elementary particle
physics. In collaboration with others they are using facilities at Fermilab to
perform experiment E672. The object of their research is to study high energy
collisions in which pairs of muons are produced in association with other
particles and thereby elucidate the current theory of the strong interactions,
quantum chromodynamics. They are collaborating with other NSF groups and they
share apparatus with E706, performed with a large contingent of NSF supported
physicists.
