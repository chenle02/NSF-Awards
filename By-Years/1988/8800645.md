The first part of this research is concerned with some problems in the theory
of metaplectic forms on the general linear group. These problems are related to
convolutions of theta functions with cusp forms and with other theta functions
and to the nature of the Fourier coefficients of theta functions and parabolic
Eisenstein series. The second part of this research is concerned with an
extension of this work to the study of metaplectic forms on the double cover of
the four dimensional spin group and with some applications to number theory.
