ABSTRACT CTS-0238873 S. Bhatia U. of Massachusetts Amherst

This project is focused on investigating the structure and rheology of soft
attractive gels. The specific system proposed is water-in-fluorocarbon emulsions
in which the gel transition is produced by attractive polymer bridging
interactions. The PI will perform rheology, neutron scattering and dynamic light
scattering measurements to determine the nature of the interaction forces and
the gel structure. The concentration and molecular weight of the polymer will be
varied to control the magnitude and range of the bridging attraction.

In addition to the experiments, the PI proposes theoretical experiments to
predict the magnitude of the bridging attraction and to improve the available
model to include interactions between the polymer chains themselves.
