9412436 Hadjimichael We plan to continue investigations in electroweak physics
and hadron structure, and in the framework of lepton interactions with light
nuclei. One facet centers on the interpretability of high accuracy experimental
measurements which are now feasible, or will soon be so, at several
laboratories: CEBAF, MIT/Bates, Mainz, TRIUMF, NIKHEF, and elsewhere: The second
facet concentrates on electro and photo-reactions in the A+3,4 systems, with
special emphasis on kinematical areas where correlated NN pairs in the initial
state in nuclei can provide information on the nature of shell NN systems. ***
