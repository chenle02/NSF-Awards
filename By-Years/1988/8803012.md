The Systems Research Center, an Engineering research Center at the University
of Maryland and Harvard University is pursuing theoretical and experimental
studies and educational programs in systems aspects of manufacturing,
communications and signal processing, chemical process systems, intelligent
servomechanisms, and expert systems and parallel computer architectures. New
approaches to optimization-based design of engineering systems have been
developed in the intelligent servomechanisms area, and these have been found
useful in several of the other thrust areas. In the coming period, the Center
will build on its significant accomplishments in each of these areas, and will
continue the process of integration of project efforts across all of the
research areas. This action is a five-year renewal.
