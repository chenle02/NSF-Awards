This award supports a Conference on Evolutionary Ecology of Tropical Herbivores
to be held in Campinas, Brazil from March 27 to April 2, 1988. It will be hosted
by the Brazilian counterparts Woodruff W. Benson and Thomas M. Lewinsohn of the
Universidade Estadual de Campinas. The speakers represent the top people working
in plant-herbivore interactions although not all in tropical systems, a plus in
bringing knowledge from other areas to application to the tropical system. The
meeting is on an excellent topic for Brazil and will improve communications
between the U.S. and Brazil. Campinas is the best university to host such a
meeting. With international concern for the loss of tropical ecosystems, this
meeting represents an ideal opportunity for cross-fertilization between those in
a country containing some of the largest such ecosystems and those scientists
who have been thinking about such systems conceptually. There is an urgent need
to improve communications between U.S. and Brazilian scientists. Support is
recommended particularly for promoting information exchange and future
U.S./Brazil collaboration.
