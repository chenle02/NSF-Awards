Filamentous fungi are unique organisms - rivaled only by Actinomycetes and
plants - in producing a wide range of natural products called secondary
metabolites. These compounds often have obscure or unknown functions in the
producing organism but have tremendous importance to humankind in that they
display a broad range of useful pharmaceutical activities as well as less
desirable phyto- and mycotoxic activities. Insight into the molecular and
cellular regulation of fungal secondary metabolism has come largely from studies
of sterigmatocystin and penicillin in the genetic model Ascomycete Emericella
nidulans (i.e. Aspergillus nidulans). Efforts on deciphering regulatory conduits
of sterigmatocystin biosynthesis have been particularly insightful in revealing
the complexity of secondary metabolite regulation. Like most fungal secondary
biosynthetic genes, the biosynthetic genes of sterigmatocystin are clustered and
their transcription requires activity of the sixth gene in the cluster, aflR
encoding a sterigmatocystin-specific C2H6 transcription factor. aflR is both
transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally regulated by members of a G
protein/cAMP/protein kinase A signal transduction pathway. The focus of this
project is a gene, laeA (for loss of aflR expression), that is regulated by
protein kinase A and required for aflR transcription. LaeA appears be a novel
protein methyltransferase that regulates not only expression of ST biosynthetic
genes but also PN biosynthetic genes. This research will explore the hypothesis
that LaeA is a global regulator of secondary metabolism gene clusters.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project will involve training of
graduate students. The outcome of this research will be applicable to several
fields of biology. These include diverse fields as food safety, agricultural and
pharmaceutical sciences, ecology and pathology.
