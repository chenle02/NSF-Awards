Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Job Posting in Recession and Recovery project
will develop near real time indicators of labor demand for new workers by
occupation, geographic area, and firms using job postings downloaded daily from
company websites by a job search engine. The project will link postings of a
firm's economic activity to state and local economic policies and postings that
will help firms and governments make informed decisions about ways to speed the
recovery of employment. This is a rapid response proposal because the project
will have the data and analyses available in the next six months to be able to
respond quickly to requests for information from decision-makers and to support
evidence-based decisions about economic policy that can be drawn from this
crisis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unprecedented discontinuous collapse in
employment that began in March 2020 challenges analyses of labor demand in
normal economic times. The project will explore non-linear patterns in firm
employment responses in the crisis and to extract signals of recovery from
changes in postings in the summer and fall of 2020. Using difference-in-
difference methodologies, the project will examine the effect of state or local
government policies and of firm human resource policies on changes in postings
for different occupations. Using daily data, the project will apply high
frequency econometric and statistical techniques to develop indices of labor
demand. The project will complement supply side unemployment claimant reports by
constructs on labor demand using high frequency near real time data and by
differentiating on firm, occupation, industry and
area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
