A conference on low dimensional topology will be held in Moab, Utah, May 13-15,
2009. The conference will focus on the areas of hyperbolic geometry, 3
manifolds, and geometric group theory. These areas have had significant
development and much overlap in recent years. Speakers will present current
research and new results in these fields.

The conference aims to bring together established experts, junior
mathematicians, and graduate students, to explore recent developments and their
potential connections. Speakers include both well-known researchers and early
career mathematicians. Participants include many graduate students and early
career mathematicians, as well as mathematicians from underrepresented groups,
smaller colleges and universities in the western United States. The conference
will provide the participants an opportunity to interact, to present their
research, and to cultivate new ideas and dialogue.
