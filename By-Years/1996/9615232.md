This proposal is to participate in a new ice core deep drilling effort in North
Greenland (NGRIP). The effort will be led by the Danish ice core group with
participation for scientists from six other nations. This proposal is to measure
stable isotope ratios of snow and ice in collaboration with scientists in
Denmark and France. Stable isotope ratios in snow record changes in air
temperature, and are thus a basic component of ice coring efforts as they
provide a temperature record of the past. The focus is on the isotopic record
from the last millennium, and from sharp transitions in the past. Comparisons
with historical records of climate change have shown that isotopes in Greenland
ice record regional scale climate change. As the ice core records are extended
into the past and compared with other proxy records of climate change, we are
seeing that different modes of climate behavior may have existed prior to the
historical record. Thus, ice cores contain and annually resolvable record of
past climate which can help form the baseline against which future climate
fluctuations and shifts can be measured. Also, previous ice cores from Greenland
have shown that large and rapid climate changes, as much as temperature changes
in only a few years, have occurred in the past. These changes need to be
confirmed and models constructed to explain how they occurred in the past, and
if they could occur in the future. Finally, the nature of interglacial climate
is an unresolved issue that needs to be addressed. Past results from ice cores
have suggested that the last interglacial was highly variable. This result is
questionable, however, and needs to be confirmed with a new deep ice core in
Greenland.
