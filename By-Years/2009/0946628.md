The project is supporting two workshops intended to help engineering and
computer science faculty at minority serving institutions (MSIs) develop
proposal writing skills so that they can compete more effectively for support
from NSF programs. For the first workshop, which will be presented at an
introductory level, the deans at selected MSIs are being asked to nominate up to
three faculty members and the 55 participants are being selected from these
nominations based on an application outlining a planned proposal. The two-day
workshop will discuss proposal writing strategies and how to deal with broader
impact and project evaluation. For the second workshop, which will be presented
at an advanced level, the project team is inviting those who attended last
year's introductory workshop or submitted an unsuccessful CCLI proposal to
apply. The 45 participants are being selected based on the description of a
proposed project in the application. The two-day workshop is presenting material
on writing effective and convincing goals, expected outcomes, rationale, and
implementation, dissemination, and evaluation plans. The project is based on
prior successful efforts and it is being evaluated by monitoring the
participants' proposal writing activity after the workshop.
