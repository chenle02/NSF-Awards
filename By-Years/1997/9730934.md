Herbig, George AST 97-30934 Dr. Herbig continues his observational studies on
star formation and early stellar evolution. His research program follows two
main lines of investigation 1) detection and study of new T-Tauri stars in star
forming regions, to determine if young star-forming regions always contain low-
mass stars in the proportions specified by a universal initial mass function,
and 2) high resolution spectroscopy FU Ori stars to test current theories about
their structure.
