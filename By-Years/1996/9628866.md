Paraconsistent information is information that may be incomplete and/or
inconsistent. The goals of this project are to develop data models for
representing and manipulating two kinds of paraconsistent information, namely
temporal and quantitative. The first is for paraconsistent information that
evolves with time, and the second for information involving belief and doubt
factors. As part of the project, a declarative programming language based on
paraconsistent data objects is developed and implemented. Also, the new data
models are applied to existing and newly identified application domains. This
project will construct a formal framework and tools for handling information
that may have contradictions in it, thereby laying the basis for information
systems in diverse areas, such as medical, scientific, business and military
applications.
