Several classes of biological and synthetic lipids from hydrated membrane
systems that display a variety of lamellar and nonlamellar phases as a function
of temperature, pressure and concentration. This proposal focuses on inverted
cubic phases which are found between lamellar and hexagonal phases. The inverted
cubic phases of interest are those which are bicontinuous with respect to the
polar (aqueous) and nonpolar (lipid) phases. The interpenetrating network of
aqueous channels and lipid surfaces of the bicontinous cubic phase permit the
passage of water soluble species through the structure. These free standing
structures have the morphology of zeolite only with biocompatible lipid
surfaces, and as such can be envisioned to have many applications in
bioseparations and membrane reactor techniques. Once formed, cubic lipid phases
are sometimes stable for weeks, however their temperature range is usually
narrow and frequently occurs at temperatures higher than room or even
physiological temperatures. The PI has pioneered the technique of stabilizing
lipid bilayers and vesicles by attaching polymerizable reactive groups,
particularly diacetylenic groups, to the constituent lipids, and then initiating
a polymerization after the supramolecular assembly has formed. The aim of the
proposed research is to apply this technique to the stabilization of cubic
structures. In particular, the proposed research will design and synthesize
polymerizable lipids which are expected to display a bicontinuous cubic phase
characterize the polymerized and unpolymerized phases by differential scanning
calorimetry, X- ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy.
