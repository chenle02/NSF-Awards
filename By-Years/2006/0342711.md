With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program, the Department of Chemistry at Miami University in Ohio will purchase
an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). This equipment will
enhance research in a number of areas including 1) the role of metal ions in the
reaction mechanisms and chemical behavior of biomolecular systems; and b)
thedevelopment of new nanomaterials for environmental remediation or sensors.

Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural details
and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic,
and organometallic molecules. This instrument will be used in advanced
biochemistry and instrumental undergraduate courses as well as undergraduate,
graduate and post-doctoral research. In addition, these studies will have a
significant impact in environmental sciences and biochemistry.
