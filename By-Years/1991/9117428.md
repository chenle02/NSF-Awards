Investigations are proposed of two-parameter bifurcations, wavenumber-selection
processes and phase dynamics in non-linear dissipative systems that are driven
far from equilibrium. Experiments will concentrate on the rotating Couette-
Taylor system, with either axial flow or external rotation. Results are expected
to have a bearing upon the general problem of pattern-formation and the
evolution of non-periodic phenomena in systems of significant spatial extent.
This research aims at developing a clearer understanding of pattern formation in
non-linear, non-equilibrium systems.
