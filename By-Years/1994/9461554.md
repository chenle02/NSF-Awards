Ultrafine TiO2 is a well known photocatalyst which, when activated by UV light,
catalyzes the oxidation of organic species in water or in gas streams. The
immobilization of high surface area TiO2 (anatase) on an efficient and
inexpensive substrate would significantly expand its use for detoxification
purposes. Existing substrates, such as glass fibers and beads, present technical
and/or economic drawbacks. SELEE Corporation proposes the development of a UV
transparent glass or fused silica open cell foam as TiO2 substrate. The foam
struts would be either dense or porous, depending on the firing temperature. The
main advantages would be low manufacturing cost, high catalytic activity due to
the high surface area, durability, and low resistance to liquid or gas flow.
