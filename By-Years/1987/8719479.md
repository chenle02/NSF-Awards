The University of Hawaii College of Engineering proposes to host an
international meeting of ocean technologists in Kailua- Kona, Hawaii during
January 11-13, 1988. Ocean technology represenatives from noted universities,
government agencies, and private companies from around the world will assemble
to: 1) organize the newly established International Ocean Technology Congress
(IOTC) and 2) plan the proposed IOTC conference to be hald in January 1989.
Hawaii as the site for the second meeting, is the appropriate choice since it
has come to be recognized as the international proving grounds for deep ocean
resources activities.
