If high voltage impulses could be produced with low jitter and high repetition
rates, an increased number of applications for baseband radar would become
feasible, and new business would result. In Phase I, an impulse generator will
be constructed in which charge from an intense pulsed electron beam is deposited
onto a transmission line. Impulses produced on a 50 ohm line are ultimately
expected to have peaks in the range of several kilovolts or more, and half
widths of 100 picoseconds or less, with jitters of less than one picosecond, and
repetition rates of one kilohertz or more.
