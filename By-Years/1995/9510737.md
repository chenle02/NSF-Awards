9510737 Wilson Abstract This award is for an international Travel Grant to allow
participation by US researchers in the 7th International Symposium on Antarctic
Earth Sciences. The Symposium will be held in Siena, Italy, in September 1995.
It is convened under the auspices of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic
Research and will be hosted by the University of Siena. The US, through the
Office of Polar Programs at the National Science Foundation, maintains a strong
research program in Antarctic earth sciences. Representation in this meeting is
in the best interests of both the US research community and the US Antarctic
Program's Polar Earth Sciences Program. This meeting is one of the few
opportunities for the international earth sciences research community to focus
on research problems in Antarctic earth sciences and to share information about
recent progress in Antarctic earth sciences. This meeting has historically been
an excellent venue for exchange of scientific information and it has led to new
lines of research and new collaborations. Furthermore, the Antarctic Treaty
requires each member nation to share and disseminate information resulting from
Antarctic research activities. Participation of US researchers in this meeting
is a meaningful way to meet this requirement of the Antarctic Treaty.
