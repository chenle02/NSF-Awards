This project will cover three basic interrelated areas of applied mathematics.
The first is concerned with large amplitude motions both quasi periodic and
almost periodic in dynamical systems of many degrees of freedom. The principal
investigator will develop new methods of study, going beyond the KAM theory for
small perturbations, that utilize a novel nonlinear p.d.e. approach. The second
related topic involves vortex dynamics of an ideal inviscid fluid. Here the
principal investigator will research the outstanding problems of leapfrogging of
vortex rings, classes of vortex cores, and vortex breakdown of bubble and spiral
type. Finally, the principal investigator will study of "flux phenomenon" in the
new theories of high Tc superconductivity, an area of prime importance in high
technology. All these areas require deep understanding of nonlinear science and
its associated mathematical structures. This has been the central focus of the
investigator's research for over two decades.
