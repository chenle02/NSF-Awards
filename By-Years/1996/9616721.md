This project researches radio remote sensing of the solar corona and inner parts
of the solar wind. This portion of space is extremely important since the solar
wind originates here, and conditions determine its characteristics. Radio remote
sensing consists of "distortions" of radio waves propagating through this part
of space; in this study, radio waves will be generated by natural sources such
as radio galaxies and quasars. The PI can determine the amplitude of turbulence
in the solar wind and corona from measurements of scintillations of amplitude
and phase of the received radio waves. This will help determine the importance
of turbulence in the structure and dynamics of the solar wind. Specifically, the
PI will measure coronal Faraday rotation with the VLA radiotelescope and
scintillations of interferometer phase with the VLBA. The Faraday rotation
observations measure an integral of gas density and parallel component of the
magnetic field through the corona. Therefore, these measurements establish the
magnetohydrodynamic state of the solar corona. In addition, the PI will closely
examine data for time variation of the Faraday rotation due to turbulence in the
corona. These measurements will: develop a new means of remotely measuring the
speed of solar wind, determine if the turbulence is elongated by the
interplanetary magnetic field, and determine the potential of such measurements
for remote and early detection of interplanetary disturbances of their way to
Earth.
