Deines&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0229551&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cycling of rocks between
the Earth's surface and interior affects everything from the evolution of the
crust and mantle to the composition of the atmosphere. To quantify the processes
occurring during subduction and exhumation of rocks, geoscientists utilize a
broad range of tools, one of the most important of which is the distribution of
stable isotopes. The fractionation of stable isotopes of carbon changes
significantly with temperature. The carbon isotope distribution between calcite
and graphite is particularly important because it has the potential to provide
temperature information about metamorphic processes. Recent developments in
secondary ion mass spectrometry have lead to new insights into graphite
precipitation during metamorphism and hold promise to advance our understanding
of the temperatures and rates of metamorphic processes. However, these
interpretations rely on graphite growth data that has been extrapolated over
significant temperature and pressure ranges, as well as empirically calibrated
fractionation relationships that have not been experimentally verified. This
work will provide direct experimental measurements of these factors, and will
help understand the cycling process within the Earth.&lt;br/&gt;
