Dr. Odom and his colleagues at Charles Evans and Associates recently completed a
Phase I study to evaluate the feasibility of laser mass spectrometry providing
quantitative and qualitative elemental and molecular microanalysis of thin
dielectric films. The research in the Phase II study will involve preparation
and characterization of thin film standards, enhancement of the linear dynamic
range of the ion detection system and qualitative and quantitative analytical
investigations. The technique, if successful, will have a major impact on the
fabrication and characterization of thin film devices.
