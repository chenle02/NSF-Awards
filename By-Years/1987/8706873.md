Research will be carried out to explore the nature of fundamental interactions
of physics at high energy. Recently there has been a great deal of activity in
theoretical high energy physics on the development of the superstring theory,
which one expects may unify all the fundamental interactions of nature. Research
to be carried out will explore both the fundamental questions such as
compactification and symmetry breaking mechanisms in superstrings as well as
implications of superstrings for particle physics, such as fermion masses,
proton decay, etc. Further, an active interest will be maintained in the data
coming from the CERN SPPS collider as well as from high energy machines such as
Tevatron, SLC, etc., which are expected to begin operation in the near future,
with a view to identifying possible signals for "new physics" particularly with
regard to supersymmetry. The work, to be carried out by a very highly-regarded
theoretical elementary particle physicist, is very important to the furthering
of our understanding of the elementary particles and the basic forces.
