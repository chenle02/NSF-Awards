This project is being supported under Phase II of the Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Program. It will support the development of a reliable and
effective software system for the design and analysis of composite multilayered
shells. The system should be capable of modeling both linear and nonlinear
behavior in three dimensions, assessing the quality of the solution, and
providing feedback so that the quality of the solution can be improved. Its
hierarchical structure should allow the selection of models of increasing
complexity in an adaptive manner, so that the goals of computation are satisfied
within the required accuracy and with minimal effort. The investigation will be
focused on hierarchical sequences of models for laminated shells and the issues
of implementation of these models into the structure of the p-version of the
finite element method. In the Phase I effort, the scope was limited to the
bending of laminated plates and addressing their extension to shells. Phase II
will involve utilizing the results of Phase I to assess the problems associated
with bending/membrane coupling and curvature, and to extend those concepts to
the nonlinear (small-strain large- deformation) solution methods for laminated
plates and shells.
