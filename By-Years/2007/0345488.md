This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports research by Professor Robert G. Bergman at the University of California
at Berkeley to obtain a basic mechanistic understanding of the reactions of
metal complexes and organic compounds in homogeneous solution using both new and
known late transition metal complexes that bear metal-heteroatom single bonds.
The project builds on potentially general methods for the synthesis of parent
(i.e., N-unsubstituted) low-valent, late transition metal amide complexes and
extend it to others involving nitrogen or phosphorus. Specific research goals
include: (a) the synthesis and study of a wider range of parent metal amides,
(b) the preparation of related compounds, such as metal hydrazido complexes and
an examination of their reactivity, (c) the development of new methods for
catalytic alkene and alkyne hydroamination, (d) the use of metal amides in the
selective synthesis of primary amines, (e) the study of metal amide-catalyzed
isomerization reactions, and (f) the extension of methods developed in amido
chemistry to the synthesis of parent phosphido complexes, including their use in
the asymmetric synthesis of P-chirogenic phosphines. The projects will be
carried out by undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral
fellows whose training obtained during the performance of this research will be
useful in their future work.

This research probes fundamental aspects of homogeneous catalysis and prepares
undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students for participation in the
advanced scientific workforce.
