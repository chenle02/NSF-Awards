The University of Kentucky will initiate a three-week, residential Young
Scholars project in Engineering which will offer science enrichment activities
for 30 precollege students entering grades 11,12. This summer program will
emphasize research participation in chemical, civil, electrical and mechanical
engineering. Lectures and demonstrations in basic engineering principles, hands-
on computer experiences, field trips featuring a day of shadowing an engineer in
an industrial plant, and mini-research group projects all integrated with one
another will form the core of the program. Students will complete an individual
project of engineering relevance during the Fall semester at their home schools.
