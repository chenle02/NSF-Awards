Project Summary Lou/ATM-9320357 This project will focus on magnetohydrodynamic
physical processes likely to be involved in solar chromospheric and coronal
activity. The research is a continuation of past efforts to understand the
mechanisms by which waves generated in the convective zones of stars propagate
into the magnetized outer atmospheric layers, and the physical effects arising
from this wave propagation. Specific goals of this continuation are: (1) to
model the extended heating of the inner solar wind via resonant absorption of
Alfven waves; (2) to construct analytical models for the reflection and
transmission of Alfven waves in inhomogeneous atmospheres, all outside the WKB
approximation; and (3) to develop numerical experiments for the simulation of
both resonant absorption and reflection of Alfven waves, and compare results
from these experiments to the analytical results.
