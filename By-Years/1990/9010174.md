User interaction with computers has long been on an individual basis with little
or no help to support cooperative work. Applications such as office information
systems, design endeavors in CAD/CAM and VLSI, programming in-the-large, and
decision support systems require users to collaborate. Currently, there is no
framework to specify correctness of concurrent actions in a cooperative
environment and to design protocols for cooperating transactions. The goal of
this research is to use semantic information to develop a framework for
controlled sharing of information, i.e., transaction-oriented cooperation. A
preliminary version of a framework for transaction-oriented cooperation has been
developed. In this project, this framework is extended to include different
types of transactions and to handle failures of individual transactions in a
cooperative environment. In addition, the aim is to build a prototype
application that uses an object-oriented database to validate the framework and
demonstrate its practicality. Results of this work, are expected to provide an
effective approach to developing distributed applications that require
cooperation.
