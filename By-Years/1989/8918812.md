This award provides funds for the planning of an enlarged Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) on Material Handling, Packaging and
Processing. It would be in furtherance of one of the goals the I/UCRC Program,
namely to increase the scope and depth of research at I/UCRC's by encouraging
the formation of multi-university consortia. The University of Cincinnati, the
University of Arkansas, and Florida Atlantic University each have expertise
which can be added synergistically to that at the I/UCRC at the Georgia
Institute of Technology to form a "national" center. Material Handling,
packaging, and processing are a major cost element in both discrete product and
process industries as well as the distribution and transportation of goods. The
selective automation of these tasks promises both economic and social benefits,
such as lower service and manufacturing costs, higher product quality and fewer
employee injuries. The research topics to be addressed at such a center include:
automated pelletizing; bin-picking; bin-packing; high speed/volume packing; unit
load forming/cargo loading; simulation models for packaging and processing;
shipping/logistics; automated kithing; carton standardization; new concepts for
warehouse design; and design of versatile grippers. Industries which would be
affected by the research performed at this type of center are: food distribution
centers; freight companies; the U.S. Postal Service; machine tool/equipment
manufacturers; and the U.S. military and their contractors. A grant of $75,000
for one year is recommended for award to the University of Cincinnati.
