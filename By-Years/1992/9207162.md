In this project, the PI will collect water samples to measure helium isotopes
and tritium on seven sections in the Pacific, contributing a tracer component as
part of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) Hydrographic Program
(WHP). The overall goal of the WHP is to determine the long-term mean
thermohaline and wind-driven ocean circulation and its relation to climate
change. The He-3/Tr pair provides a means of determining the age of shallow
waters on time scales of months to decades.
