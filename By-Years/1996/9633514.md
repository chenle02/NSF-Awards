BANERJEE/9633514 ABSTRACT The PIs propose to hold an interdisciplinary workshop
that focuses on high-resolution magnetic techniques to address issues related to
understanding the geomagnetic field and paleoclimate. The workshop goals
include: 1. Constructing high-resolution geomagnetic paleointensity and
paleodirectional databases as inputs for paleomagnetic and magneto-hydrodynamic
modeling, especially of geomagnetic field reversals and secular variations. 2.
Establishing cross-validated rock magnetic proxy records of environmental and
climate change for input to and validation of Global Change Models and Regional
Change Models.
