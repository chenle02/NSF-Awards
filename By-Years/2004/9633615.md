ABSTRACT Three-dimensional radiative heat transfer in a finite medium will be
studied theoretically and experimentally. The emphasis of the investigation is
to determine the effects of multiple scattering and polarization in media that
contain Mie-scattering particles. The theoretical work will involve solving the
vector radiative transport equation written in terms of the Stokes parameter and
the scattering phase function expressed by a 4x4 phase matrix. Double Fourier
transform will be used to transform the transport equation into one-dimensional
form and the resulting equation will be solved by Ambartsumian's method. Back-
scattered radiation from a medium composed of latex microspheres suspended in
distilled water will be measured and the results will be used for model
validation.
