This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project proposes to
develop the fabrication technology for an astronomical holographic multi-
spectral filter that increases the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of ground-based
observations at near-infrared wavelengths by suppressing the narrow lines
emitted from atmospheric OH radicals. Many astronomers have recognized that
large gains in SNR can be obtained if the OH background could be suppressed. SNR
is proportional to the diameter of the telescope. The potential threefold gain
in SNR achieved by adding the proposed filter to the Keck 10 meter telescope
would thus be equivalent to increasing its diameter to 30 meters, which is
estimated to cost five hundred million dollars. In contrast, the cost of the
proposed efficient multi-spectral filters is three orders of magnitude
less.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project should have a direct impact on
applications requiring fine multi-spectral information for accurate substance
identification in remote sensing and life sciences. In remote sensing, the
design and fabrication of arbitrary narrow multi-band filter profile are
powerful tools for global measurements of atmospheric gases of Earth and other
planets as well as remote sensing of toxic gases for Homeland Security. The
spectral response of the holographic filter can be tailored to match precisely
the absorption spectrum of given gases with high sensitivity. With multiple
absorption or emission peaks detected simultaneously, the detection sensitivity
will be increased greatly compared with traditional methods, and the required
data volumes will decrease by several orders of magnitude, which makes it very
attractive for remote sensing applications. &lt;br/&gt;
