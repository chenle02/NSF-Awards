This project involves laboratory investigations of homogeneous nucleation on
sulfuric acid and its co-reactants water, ammonia and amines. The objectives are
to: (1) measure the nucleation rate of particles formed from amines and sulfuric
acid over a range of conditions with a bulk source flow reactor; (2)
characterize the experimental flow reactor with a photo-chemical source for
sulfuric acid and nucleation rate measurements for a few amines at low sulfuric
acid concentrations, (3) develop and use computation fluid dynamic (CFD)
simulations of the flow reactors, and (4) develop the use of amine sources and
detection techniques. The laboratory results will be compared to CFD simulations
that treat the cluster chemistry in detail, yielding thermodynamic information
for the formation of acid-base clusters.

Nucleation is the driving force for new particle formation in the atmosphere.
Newly formed particles can serve as cloud condensation nuclei, important for
their role in the indirect effect of atmospheric aerosols on climate. The
ultimate goal of this project is to test models for nucleation rates that can be
incorporated into global climate models. Undergraduate students will participate
in the construction of laboratory apparatuses, running experiments, developing
mathematical models, analyzing data, and authoring publications.
