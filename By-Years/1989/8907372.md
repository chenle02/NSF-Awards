The objective of the investigation is to study the nature of the defects in
cadmium telluride and cadmium telluride with zinc and manganese using x-ray
diffraction techniques. The study concentrates upon the use of dynamic
diffraction extinction distance for delineation of subgrains, the measurement of
absolute diffracted intensities to assess the relative contributions of primary
and secondary extinction, and the use of triple crystal diffraction techniques
to separate the dynamic and kinematic diffraction intensities. The specimens
will be grown as bulk crystals using the vertical Bridgement method.
