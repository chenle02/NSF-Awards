0112266&lt;br/&gt;Hirth&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides partial support
for acquisition of EBSD hardware and software for microstructural observations
of deformed rocks. The EBSD will be installed on a SEM at the Marine Biological
Laboratory (MBL) in Woods Hole, MA. The PI, Greg Hirth, is a tenured Associate
Scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI). The EBSD facility
will be available to a diverse range of research projects being pursued by
scientists in the Woods Hole community. The EBSD is now becoming a powerful
phase identification tool. This capability will be particularly useful for
petrologists and geochemists at WHOI that analyze fine-grained experimental
charges and fine-grained metamorphic assemblages produced during hydrothermal
processes in the oceanic crust. The EBSD also has important applications for
geomicrobiologists (the analysis of crystallographic control on the attachment
of microbial material to mineral surfaces) and scientists studying global
climate change (the identification of daily growth regions in corals). Finally,
education opportunities for applications of EBSD, which would be installed on an
SEM at the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL), will be enhanced by the
microscopy short courses held each summer at the MBL. Support for this grant is
shared between the Earth Sciences Instrumentation and Facilities Program
(EAR/IF), and the Division of Ocean Sciences (OCE).&lt;br/&gt; ***&lt;br/&gt;
