9312219 Rayson This proposal in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program
involves the investigation of a new biologically-derived heavy metal recovery
agent for extraction of heavy metals from contaminated wastewater. The recovery
medium consists of cultured cells from the anther from the native flower Datura
innoxia. The long term goal of the proposed research is the development of a
practical system for the in situ removal of heavy metals from contaminated
water, such as industrial and mining wastewater streams. Professor Rayson and
his students will use solid state NMR, fluorescence and infrared spectroscopy to
characterize the metal ion binding sites on the biologically-derived materials.
A thorough characterization of the binding sites will lead to the identification
and synthesis of model sites on ion exchange media for the extraction of heavy
metal ions. %%% Professor Rayson will investigate the potential applications of
biologically-derived heavy metal recovery agents for the remediation of
contaminated water. The technique has potential for significant impact in the
global problem of contaminated wastewater cleanup. ***
