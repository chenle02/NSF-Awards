This award supports Professors Gary Hachtel and Fabio Somenzi, and a graduate
student, all from the University of Colorado, to collaborate in computer science
research with Professor Christoph Meinel and others of the Department of
Computer Science and Complexity Theory and VLSI-Design of the University of
Trier, Germany. They are working in the area of computer-aided circuit design,
focusing on the synthesis and verification of digital systems using `binary
decision diagram` data structures. Together they will explore new classes of
these efficient data structures and their behaviors in specific applications.
Previous work by the group at Trier on Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDs)
has focused primarily on the theoretical foundations and the connection with
complexity theory. The US group has been motivated by real problems of
electrical engineering such as sequential circuit verification, optimization and
testing. The plan for collaboration will transfer and combine the complementary
knowledge and experience of the two groups. The resulting synergism should
result in contributions to both theoretical and practical aspects of circuit
design.
