9453817 Anderson The Vermont Center for the Book in collaboration with the
Vermont Council on the Humanities, Montshire Museum, and other Vermont science
activity centers propose to develop a national model of a four-part book
discussion/science activity program of early science literacy for parents of
preschool children. Parents will be trained to gain confidence in their ability
to do science activity kit to keep. The project expects to reach 1200 parents
and 240 professionals during this three year project.
