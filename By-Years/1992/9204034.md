More accurate meteorological data is required for many of the research efforts
planned as part of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE), which will
begin field experiments in 1992. Although many sensors are available
commercially, their accuracy and calibration for ships and buoys had not been
tested until recently. Work completed in an initial grant to the PI's (OCE-87-
09614) quantified the performance characteristics of some buoy and ship sensors,
and cooperation between the PI's and manufacturers resulted in improvements to
these sensors. Development of a data logging system that is applicable to any
sensor was also completed and licensed to a commercial manufacturer. The
improved sensor system is known as IMET, for Improved METeorological. This grant
provides funding for the final documentation of the recently developed IMET
sensor system. This documentation will allow the rest of the oceanographic
community to install and maintain the IMET system on a variety of research
vessels.
