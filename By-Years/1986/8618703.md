This project involves support for the Chief Scientist of the Salton Sea
Scientific Drilling Project. In Phase I of the project the research borehole,
State 2-14, reached 3,219 m deep, encountering temperatures &lt;355oC and metal-
rich brines containing 23 wt% TDS. The drill cores obtained demonstrate a
transition from unconsolidated sediments to greenschist facies metamorphism.
More than 40 different groups of investigators participated, funded by an
interagency agreement (NSF, DOE, USGS). The Phase II program will focus on
reservoir engineering and geochemical sampling. A new well (Wilson 1-12) will be
drilled approximately 1.5 km north of the State 2-14 with a target depth of 900
to 1,800 m where temperatures of 210-305oC should be reached. Rock cuttings,
temperature, pressure and wireline logs will be obtained and a short-term flow
test of the first producible zones penetrated will permit sampling lower
salinity fluids from the shallow reservoir. The Wilson 1-12 will then be used as
a disposal well for long term flow tests (up to 30 days duration) of the deep
reservoir in the State 2-14. The new data and samples obtained from these two
wells will conclude the original objectives of the SSSDP. The work to be
performed in this project includes: (a) scientific input to planning and
implementing sampling and testing of the two wells; (b) liaison with the DOE,
the Science Experiments Committee and the interagency committee, as necessary;
(c) obtaining, describing and curating drill cuttings from the Wilson 1-12; (d)
coordination of on-site scientific sampling and measurements, as necessary; (e)
collection of fluid samples for other investigators who cannot be present; and
(f) editing the conference proceedings on the scientific results of Phase I of
the SSSDP.
