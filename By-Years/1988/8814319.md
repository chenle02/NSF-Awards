This analytical research project investigates the nonlinear problems of
building collision during strong-motion earthquakes. Several representative
arrangements of buildings with different stiffness and impactive characteristics
including column to slab pounding will be examined. Current code provisions for
estimating the requirements for gaps at seismic joints will be verified.
Remedies to mitigate the pounding effects will be suggested. The recommendations
drawn from this study will be of great value for retrofitting of closely spaced
adjacent buildings in seismic areas.
