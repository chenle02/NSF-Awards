This award focuses on theoretical aspects of commutative algebra and seeks to
make use of them to break the logjam of complexity in several problems of
computational algebra. The principal investigator will: (a) extend the role of
Koszul homology in the structure theory of Cohen-Macaulay singularities, (b)
investigate the structure of algebras of linear type, (c) examine the equations
of Rees algebras of various kinds, (d) study the invariants and singularities of
commuting varieties of Lie algebras and their representations, and (e) exploit
some novel means of converting graph-theoretic data into ideal-theoretic
structures. Concomitantly, he will investigate roles for the recent discovery of
closed formulas for computing radicals, equi-dimensional decompositions and a
method to compute normalization that is free of generic projections, with
accompanying algorithms, in the development of algebraic/numerical equation
solvers. This project is in the general area of commutative algebra and the
computer-aided computational aspects of this field. There is a growing interest
in using computers to answer theoretical questions in algebra and conversely,
algebra is quite useful for the development of algorithms. This project makes
serious use of both the theory and practice of symbolic calculations to solve
real problems in commutative algebra.
