ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;12 July 2011&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
1119644&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Scripps Institute of Oceanography&lt;br/&gt;PI:
B. Appelgate&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: Z. Kelety&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
proposal requests Shipboard Scientific Support items for the vessels operated by
Scripps Institute of Oceanography (SIO) namely; the R/V REVELLE, MELVILLE, NEW
HORIZON, and SRPOUL. Requests include: (1) a quick-acting emergency escape hatch
for NEW HORIZON, (2) new RADAR and refrigerator for SPROUL, (3) a Doppler speed
log for REVELLE. All items requested will either enhance safety, bring vessels
into current regulatory compliance, or provide greatly improved science support
capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: SIO vessels support
federally-funded scientific research throughout the world?s oceans and routinely
expose graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography. SIO
participates in a large number of outreach programs including open house events,
student tours, and hosting of government officials, dignitaries, and science
communities while in foreign ports. All told, Scripps vessels are scheduled to
complete nearly 400 NSF sponsored days in 2011.
