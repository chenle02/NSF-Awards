The Gram-negative gliding bacteria have the ability to move over solid
surfaces, but not to swim through liquids. The mechanism by which they
accomplish this has not been established. With support from a previous NSF grant
entitled "Sulfonolipids and Their Functions," Drs. Leadbetter and Godchaux made
the fortuitous discovery that sulfonolipid-deficient mutants of the Gram-
positive gliding bacterium, Cytophaga johnsonae, are unable to carry out normal
gliding motility, and also lack a specific type of non-LPS outer membrane-
associated polysaccharide. These mutants phenotypically revert with respect to
all three traits (sulfonolipid content, polysaccharide content, and gliding
motility) when provided with exogenous L-cysteate, the metabolic precursor of
the sulfonolipid "head group." Other nongliding mutants, which are not
sulfonolipid-defective, are deficient in this surface polysaccharide, which
implicates the polysaccharide in gliding motility, and the sulfonolipids as
necessary for the biosynthesis of this polysaccharide. Experiments are planned
to biochemically characterize the outer membrane polysaccharides, identify the
specific polysaccharides involved in motility, and begin biochemical
characterization of the peptidoglycan of the bacterial cell wall. These studies
may well result in the unambiguous determination of the biochemical mechanism of
gliding motility in Cytophaga.
