9321224 Gleason Fundamental materials science issues related to the chemical
passivation of electronically active states on porous silicon surfaces will be
investigated for the first time by H,F, and Si NMR. The approach pursued will
allow unique, quantitative, and non-destructive chemical information to be
obtained. Effects of anodization conditions, substrate doping and orientation,
thermal treatments in a variety of ambients, additional etching, and film growth
on top of porous silicon layers will be studied. Photoluminescence measurements
will directly link surface composition to optical properties. the goal is to
produce stable surfaces with low defect densities and enhanced photoluminescence
and electroluminescence properties. %%%% Microscopic spacings in porous silicon
may provide unique quantum- confinement effects giving rise to very desirable
optoelectronic properties. This material can be readily produced by anodizing
single-crystal silicon wafers in concentrated HF, and research of this type has
potential to provide the fundamental basis for development of inexpensive
optical devices which are compatible and useful for enhancing the capabilities
of silicon-based integrated circuitry used in computers, information processing,
and display technologies. ***
