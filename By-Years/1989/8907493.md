Dr. Lynmarie A. Posey has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Posey's doctoral degree was from Yale University under the
supervision of Professor Mark A. Johnson. Dr. Posey intends to continue research
at Stanford University under the sponsorship of Richard Zare. Dr. Posey's area
of postdoctoral research will be a comparative study of the reactivities of
methane and silane with vibrationally excited ions such as NH3+ and O2+. The
Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important
infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new
Ph.D's and attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical
research and teaching.
