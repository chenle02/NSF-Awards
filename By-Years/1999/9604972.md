9604972 Richards Technical Mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana which have a decrease
in DNA methylation (ddm) were isolated and characterized earlier. The ddml
mutant has only about 30% of the wild type methylcytosine although it has wild
type levels of methyl transferase. Moreover, it has been found that if these
mutants are continuously selfed, progressive abnormalities appear. One such
abnormality was reduced plant size and apical dominance (ball). The ball
mutation, which is stable, has been mapped to a genome site different than the
ddml mutation. During the tenure of this project, the DDMl gene will be isolated
and characterized. Additionally, the BAL locus will be isolated by a map-based
cloning approach and characterized at a molecular level. The phenotypic,
genetic, biochemical and molecular analysis of ddm2 mutants will also continue.
Non-technical It has been observed that there are described genetic phenomena
which cannot be explained by Mendelian genetics and suggestive evidence
implicates DNA methylation. It has been difficult to document cause and effect
but the information resulting from this work should provide greater insiqht into
basic qenetic mechanisms.
