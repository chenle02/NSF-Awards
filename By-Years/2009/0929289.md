&lt;br/&gt;This award provides continued support for the Tucson Drosophila
Species Stock Center, a publicly-supported collection of living stocks of
Drosophila species which moved to the University of Arizona in 2000. The
collection consists of over 1000 strains representing approximately 250 species
of the small insect commonly referred to as the fruit fly. On request, the Stock
Center provides sample of live flies to researchers and educators at a modest
charge that defrays only a portion of the cost of operation. In the four years
since the Tucson Stock Center opened, the number of strains provided annually
has increased by about 50%; continued growth in usage is projected as the number
of drosophila species whose genome sequence has been determined increases. Areas
of expected growth in the Stock Center's collection include expanded species
representation, addition of newly collected wild type stocks for species already
represented in the collection and addition of genetically marked strains for
those species whose genomes have been sequenced. Availability of these sequences
is expected to stimulate comparative genomics studies and thus the demand for
samples of the collection. In addition to its role in enabling research, the
Stock Center provides samples for educational uses in high schools, colleges and
museums. The Stock Center also conducts an annual workshop for students and
researchers who wish to learn more about the varied species in the collection
and to acquire the special knowledge needed to work with them.&lt;br/&gt;
