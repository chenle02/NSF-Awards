Prior studies in the Kigluaik Mountains of the Seward Peninsula, Alaska have
raised the possibility that Cretaceous granites were emplaced in a large-
magnitude extension event, rather than during a compressional, crustal
thickening event as previously thought. This project involves age dating and
chemical and isotopic petrogenetic studies to test between the two different
hypotheses. Results will assist other studies in the area by providing age
control, and will give insight into processes leading to the production of
granitic melts in several tectonic environments.
