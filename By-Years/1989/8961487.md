Efforts at utilizing the optimum photovoltaic properties of CuInSe2 have been
focussed on the p- CuInSe2 /n-CdS cell primarily due to lack of an appropriate
window material for the n-CuInSe2. We propose to fabricate a new n-CuInSe2 based
solar cell with a p-CuIn2Se3I/CuISe3 window. The new window will be
electrochemically grown on n-CuInSe2 in I-I2- CuI-HI solution, ohmic contacted
with a suitable conductor and fabricated into a solid state solar cell. The cell
will be electro-optically characterized and process parameters optimized to
yield maximum power output. In addition to processing and cost advantages
expected from an electrochemical approach to heterojunction formation several
other benefits are anticipated for the proposed cell over the present
p-CuInSe2/n-CdS cell. Improved adhesion to ITO/glass substrate, optimum lattice
match between CuInSe2 and the CuIn2Se3I transition layer, higher mobility of
electrons in n-type absorber, greater stability due to similar components
(except I) on both sides of the junction should lead to a more efficient and
stable solar cell.
