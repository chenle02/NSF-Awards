This grant is for participation in the conference "Type Theory, Homotopy Theory
and Univalent Foundations", at the Centre de Recerca Matematica in Barcelona
(Spain), September 23-27, 2013. The grant will enable selected mathematicians
affiliated with U.S. institutions to participate in the conference. The
allocation of funds will favor graduate students, postdocs, junior faculty, and
faculty with no current NSF support.

The topic of the conference are the recent connections discovered between type
theory and homotopy theory based on the interpretation of identity types as path
spaces. These connections provide a new topological intuition that facilitates
working with type theories and allow for new computational tools for
manipulating homotopy-theoretic structures. Furthermore, Voevodsky's Univalent
Foundations program provides a solid logical basis for the practice of
identifying isomorphic structures, common throughout mathematics even if it is
not allowed by standard set-theoretic foundations.

The topic of the conference has an unusually wide impact since it involves
several areas: mathematical logic, theoretical computer science, homotopy theory
and category theory. In particular, the developments offer a new perspective on
computer-assisted formalization of mathematical proofs and verification of their
correctness, which promises to benefit all mathematical endeavor, and further
influence on design of programming languages.
