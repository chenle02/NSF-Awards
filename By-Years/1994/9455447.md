The Computer-Integrated Introductory Biology Lab (CIBL) project is a four-year
development effort to combine an innovative format for undergraduate biology
laboratories with a thematic, cross-curricular approach to content instruction
that integrates biology, physics, chemistry, atmospheric sciences, and
mathematics. The CIBL laboratory supports and extends hands-on "wet" laboratory
experiences using computer-based multimedia (interactive video, graphics,
animation, sound and computer simulation), while the thematic, interdisciplinary
approach to the curriculum unifies the enormous diversity of scientific content.
This effort transforms Biology 5L, the large introductory biology class taken by
virtually all life-science majors attending UCLA (currently over 800 per year)
from a "barrier course" to a "facilitator course" as part of a larger effort at
UCLA to recruit and retain student enrollment in science, especially within
minority groups whose members are under represented in scientific careers. The
project develops and will publish eight laboratory modules (in addition to two
currently under development through a pilot grant from the Hughes Foundation),
and will serve as a model for change in other large introductory science courses
across the country. Students preparing to be science teachers will be involved
with design, testing and evaluation of the course.
