9303150 Cohen This award is for the acquisition of a parallel computer and
several high performance work stations to support research in the Computer
Science Department of Brandeis University. The department is engaged in three
major areas of research: Parallelism and Languages, Data Compression, and
Artificial Intelligence. The department is part of the Brandeis Center for
Complex Systems and the theme of parallelism and the study of large complex
systems is common to all three groups. The research topics to be explored by the
parallel programming group include the design and analysis of parallel
algorithms; and the design and implementation of high level parallel languages
which facilitate the rapid construction of programs that can easily be verified
to be correct and which can be compiled to run efficiently on MIMD and SIMD
machines. Research topics of the data compression group include adaptive vector
quantization with variable size vectors, adaptive video compression, issues in
coding theory that include error resilient communication, the design of high
speed data compression hardware, and context prediction for lexicography.
Research topics for the AI group include data extraction from existing databases
and text corpora, the role of memory in storing extracted data, and the
construction of integrated agents that are data driven and exhibit goal directed
behavior.
