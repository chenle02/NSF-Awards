Selective attention is the process whereby a subset of the incoming sensory
stream is selected for further processing. In the case of visual attention, this
process can be subdivided into two distinct types of selection. The first type
entails the establishment of a spatial focus, for preferential processing of a
single, circumscribed area of the visual field as needed for object analysis or
recognition. The second type involves the establishment of a filter which
selectively enhances one or more distinct visual channels across the visual
field as a whole, such as to facilitate perception of all stimuli of a specific
color, spatial frequency, or direction of motion. The principal investigators
will study the neurobiological mechanism of selective visual attention, through
computer modeling of the correlates of attention at the single cell level and
the integration of visual processing and attentional control at the systems
level.
