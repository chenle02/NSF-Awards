The purpose of this project is to study the formation and evolution of large
scale plasma structures in the high latitude ionosphere. The plasma structures
to be studied are 100 to 1000 km scale enhancements of the F region plasma
density. The program combines observations with numerical modeling. The
observational program consists of coordinated measurements using the Sondrestrom
and EISCAT radars, as well as other ground-based instruments. The modeling
effort involves simulations guided by both specific observations and various
theoretical scenarios. In support of this effort, an existing high-latitude
F-region model will be improved as needed to include multi-species, E-region
chemistry, and calculations of the ion and electron temperatures. The primary
goal of this effort is to understand the mechanisms that control the appearance,
size, and shape of the plasma patches in the polar cap and the ionization
enhancements in the auroral oval. The results will provide valuable insights
into the physics of magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling.
