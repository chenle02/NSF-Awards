The investigator and his colleagues continue their study and development of
highly accurate finite element methods for computing solutions of partial
differential equations. They have shown in previous work that high degree
methods, such as the h-p version of the finite element method, are very
effective. Recently these methods have been implemented in various engineering
programs (inclusive of commercial). The research will concentrate on
mathematical and numerical problems leading to the reliable solution of problems
of solid mechanics with important applications in engineering, such as fractures
in 3- dimensional bodies, modelling of plates and shells, etc. The goal of the
research is to establish mathematical results that will be used in the computer
analysis of engineering problems. These results will allow to be developed
highly effective computational methods for broad applications in research and
commercial computer codes that are widely used in engineering science and
practice.
