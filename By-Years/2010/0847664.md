Current networking protocols have been designed with the assumption
&lt;br/&gt;that an end-to-end path between source and destination is almost
&lt;br/&gt;always available. However, this assumption does not hold for an
&lt;br/&gt;entire class of wireless networks. In Delay or Disruption Tolerant
&lt;br/&gt;Networks (DTNs), lack of continuous connectivity, network
&lt;br/&gt;partitioning, and very long delays are the norm, not the exception.
&lt;br/&gt;Such networks have recently found applications in challenged
&lt;br/&gt;environments, such as space communications, military operations,
&lt;br/&gt;and sensor networks. Routing in DTNs is very challenging as it
&lt;br/&gt;must handle the time-varying and unpredictable availability of
&lt;br/&gt;links, long delays, and a dynamic topology.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project contributes theoretical models and algorithms
for &lt;br/&gt;routing in DTNs with semi-deterministic mobility. In such
networks, &lt;br/&gt;node trajectory is either tightly controlled, but affected
by random &lt;br/&gt;deviations from the environment, or it is socially driven.
In both, &lt;br/&gt;opportunities for communication can be predicted using
knowledge on &lt;br/&gt;node mobility. These networks, underrepresented by
current research, &lt;br/&gt;have immediate applications in mobile sensing (e.g.
littoral &lt;br/&gt;underwater monitoring), disaster management, or in campus
environments. &lt;br/&gt;This research develops prediction models with Markov
processes for &lt;br/&gt;node mobility and methods for contact probability
estimation. &lt;br/&gt;Performance limitations and optimal parameters for the
routing &lt;br/&gt;protocols and algorithms are also investigated.&lt;br/&gt;The
research will produce a set of protocols suitable for operation &lt;br/&gt;in
conditions of sporadic connectivity and limited resources,
&lt;br/&gt;emphasizing local information exchange and adaptation techniques.
&lt;br/&gt;The protocols will be evaluated with detailed simulations at the
&lt;br/&gt;Florida Atlantic University Wireless and Sensor Network Laboratory.
