The day-long Computational Structural Bioinformatics Workshop will bring
together researchers and students working on a diverse set of problems including
biomolecular structure representation, prediction, and alignment, biomolecule
interaction and docking, and data mining and analysis of structural and genomics
data. At the core of all these endeavors is the goal to establish and explore
the relationships between protein sequence, structure, and function. The
workshop will be held on December 09, 2021 and will coincide with the IEEE
International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM). This award
will support the development and dissemination of advances in computational
structural bioinformatics, and will fund workshop registration for undergraduate
and graduate students who are co-authors of manuscripts or poster abstracts
accepted for presentation and inclusion in the conference
proceedings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A main objective of this workshop is to
provide a forum for undergraduate and graduate students, and especially students
from under-represented groups in computer science and bioinformatics, to present
ongoing work, and to exchange project ideas and facilitate collaborations across
labs and disciplines. The workshop will include several sessions for oral
presentations of accepted manuscripts, as well as two poster sessions during
which students will have the opportunity to explain their projects and answer
questions. A career and hot topics round table discussion will provide students
the opportunity to learn from each other and discuss current research challenges
and opportunities. A synopsis of the student discussion session will be
disseminated to the workshop website after the conclusion of the
conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
