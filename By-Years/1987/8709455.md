Bird-archosaurs (the Ornithosuchia) have played major roles in terrestrial
ecosystems for over 200 million years, and they continue to do so in the form of
9,000 living species of birds. But very little is known of the early evolution
of bird- archosaurs. This grant will enable a more comprehensive investigation
of this problem than has yet been possible. Clearer understanding of
genealogical relationships among the early ornithosuchians will serve as a basis
for evaluating major aspects of their evolutionary history.
