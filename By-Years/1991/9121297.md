This Science in Developing Countries award will support an international
symposium, "A Patagonia Gem: The Ecology and Natural History of a World
Biosphere Reserve: Torres de Paine National Park, Chile," to be held in
Santiago, Chile, January 10-12, 1992. The organizers are Professor William
Franklin of Iowa State University and Agustin Iriarte of the Chilean Ministry of
National Parks. The purpose of the symposium is to assess the current state of
knowledge about this little-known region; highlight the importance of high-
latitude ecosystems as represented by this World Biosphere Reserve; and identify
future research priorities. Open to the public, the symposium will include over
20 presenters whose papers will be published in a book for worldwide
distribution. Topics will include geology, glaciation, climate,
paleoenvironments, archeology, grasslands and steppes, forests, limnology,
wildlife, history, and ecotourism. Participation by international and Chilean
scientists, Chilean students, resource managers, and park rangers will be
emphasized. Benefits to both the U.S. and Chilean sides include the exchange of
important information about the field ecology of this site and the development
of research themes for future international collaboration.
