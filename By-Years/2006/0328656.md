SES 99-11203 - Anne C. Fitzpatrick (George Washington University) "War by
Numbers: Computers, Nuclear Weapons, and the Arms Race"

This project embodies a comparative history of computing in the American and
former Soviet nuclear weapons programs. This award supports travel to and
research at several scientific institutions and archives through-out North
America, Russia, Ukraine, and Armenia, as well as interviews with numerous
participants in the nuclear weap-ons communities. This research will provide the
scholarly basis for a book that will be published by a university press. This
study will greatly enhance public understanding of the role of technology in the
nuclear arms race, and in science and society.
