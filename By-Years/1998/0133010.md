Summary: This research requests funding for an exploratory field effort to
confirm the existence of and date the extent of laminated sediments in Norwegian
fjords. Multicorer samples will be taken in seven selected fjords. Radiometric
dating and assessment of benthic foraminifer faunas in recovered sediments will
be done to determine suitability of the material for detailed paleoclimate
studies.&lt;br/&gt;
