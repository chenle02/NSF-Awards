This award provides funds to subsidize the travel and housing expenses of
students selected to participate in the sixth SIGART/AAAI Doctoral Consortium,
which will be held on July 28 and 29, 2002, in Edmonton, Canada. The consortium
will be collocated with the Eighteenth National Conference on Artificial
Intelligence (NCAI), which will be held from July 28 to August 1 in Edmonton.
ACM/SIGART and AAAI together organized the first six Doctoral Consortia, which
have also been collated with NCAI (except for last year, when the consortium was
collocated with the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence
(IJCAI)). At the consortium, Ph.D. students who are doing their dissertations on
AI-related topics present their proposed research, and receive feedback from a
panel of established researchers as well as from the other students. This
provides the students with invaluable exposure to outside perspectives on their
work, at a critical time in their research, and also enables them to explore
their career objectives. There will also be a panel on career options as part of
the consortium. This workshop contributes to the professional development of
young scientists who will lead this growing field in the coming decades.
