This project supports the running of a two-and-a-half day event, a Strategic
Summit on the Computing Education Challenges for Community Colleges, designed to
frame the challenges of the next five years and beyond of computing education. A
diverse group of experts, from industry as well as from academia, is brought
together to engage in focused round table discussions to address just one
question: "What are the major challenges confronting computing programs in
community colleges spanning the next five to ten years?" This then constitutes
the primary goal of this project and the core intellectual merit. The
proceedings from this event serve to steer and influence initiatives and funding
proposals to NSF in the coming years. A secondary goal, arising naturally from
the first, is to subsequently share these conclusions widely - to achieve the
highest level of broader impact - in order to spur initiatives and grant
proposals which respond to these challenges.
