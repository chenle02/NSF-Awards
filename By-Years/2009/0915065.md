Logics for describing properties of labeled trees, along with automata operating
on such trees, have been studied extensively in connection with hardware and
software verification. More recently they have been the subject of research on
specification and query languages for XML documents, and this has focused
attention on unranked trees---those in which there is no fixed bound on the
number of children a node may have. However, many fundamental questions about
the expressive power of such logics remain unanswered; for instance, we do not
yet possess an effective description of the properties of trees that are
expressible in various versions of first-order logic. This research project
approaches these questions by means of a new algebraic theory of automata
operating on unranked trees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While much of the motivation
for this work comes from logic, the difficult questions encountered are
algebraic in nature: what is required is a deepened understanding of the ideal
and decomposition structure of a new kind of algebraic invariant ---called
forest algebras---for tree automata. The project will draw on a very rich theory
of the structure of finite semigroups developed in connection with the study of
automata on words. One of the principal challenges entails generalizing what is
already known about the structure of finite semigroups to this new and more
complex setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will further the development
of new mathematical tools to determine the expressive power of logics on trees.
Successful completion of the project should ultimately lead to the application
of these tools well beyond the problems that originally motivated the study, and
has a potential practical impact in the development and analysis of languages
for software and hardware verification, and of query languages for XML and
related schemes for representing data.&lt;br/&gt;
