This project deals with register optimization techniques for modern computer
architectures. In modern pipelined architectures code is carefully scheduled to
avoid unnecessary delays. However, some delay slots may be unavoidable. This
project will develop techniques to `glean` unfilled delay slots to perform work
normally considered not worthwhile, such as splitting live ranges into shorter
ranges. Shorter ranges induce fewer register conflicts, allowing registers to be
used for other purposes. Normally,registers are not used across procedure
boundaries. The project will develop techniques to optimally allocate registers
at the interprocedural level. More specifically, the techniques will attempt to
avoid unnecessary register spilling on caller/callee boundaries. The project
will also investigate the use of idle processors to perform a variety of program
correctness analyses. This is achieved using a `shadow` process which executes
only when a processor becomes idle.
