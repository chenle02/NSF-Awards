9423298 Nasar The global and overall objective of the proposed research is to
launch and establish a research program in short-stroke linear reciprocating
machines operating as generators and motors. These machines may be field-excited
or may have permanent magnets (PMs) for field production, or may be reluctance
type synchronous machines. Numerous topologies are feasible for such machines.
The proposed phase of study will focus on permanent-magnet short- stroke linear-
motion reciprocating synchronous machines operating as generators and motors.
