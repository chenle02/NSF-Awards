9412394 Storm Support is provided for the 1994 Gordon Research Conference on
Physical Metallurgy "Time-Dependent Behavior in Metals: Measurement and Modeling
for the Long Term". The goal of this conference is provide a forum for active
discussions on state-of- the-art experimental and modeling techniques aimed at
understanding complex damage phenomena that evolve in metals over long times.
Such damage often involves the coupling of microstructural changes, surface
chemical or electrochemical reactivity, plastic deformation, solute segregation,
microdamage evolution and hydrogen interactions leading to crack formation and
growth. The speakers and discussion have been organized around critical topics,
including microstructural evolution under applied stress and strain, crack
formation and growth at elevated temperatures, the interaction of environment
with such cracking, the effect of solute elements on deformation and fracture,
environmentally-induced cracking, as well as localized corrosion under stress. A
focus of this program is the integration of physical and mechanical metallurgy
perspectives which have been separated in previous years. %%% There is a
pressing need to consider these problems from an interdisciplinary and
scientific perspective because the national infrastructure is aging and long-
life systems are being contemplated and designed with advanced materials.
Although such problems are complex from a scientific viewpoint, researchers in
universities, industry and national laboratories are now addressing them with
exciting high resolution experimental tools, theory and simulation modelling.
