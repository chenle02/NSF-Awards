Us companies file R&amp;D data with the Census Bureau on Form RD-1, and the
data are used to create industry aggregates published annually by NSF. Many of
those companies also file R&amp;D data with the SEC, on form 10-K. The purpose
of this project is to investigate the differences between these two sets of
data. We expect the results of this project to lead to improvements in the
quality of reported R&amp;D data. R&amp;D-1 is the only source of R&amp;D data
for 2600-2800 companies, those that do not report to the SEC. It is also the
only source for the breakdown between basic and applied research, and between
company funded and government funded industry performed R&amp;D. The definition
of R&amp;D on the RD-1 survey is restricted to the hard sciences and
engineering, so the survey is unique in that sense. It is the main source of
industrial sector R&amp;D data for US government policy makers, and is also the
source for the multi-country R&amp;D presentations of the OECD. Whether the
unique features of RD-1 are worth preserving, and in what forms, and whether
there should be changes in the survey, are data quality questions that are
clearly important for both public and private science and technology policy
determination. The SEC 10K R&amp;D data results are reported by name of firm and
are very up to date, these are advantages over the current RD-1. The project has
two parts: a detailed investigation into the differences at the company level,
and a set of field interviews with firms in order to discover the sources of
unexplained differences in the two R&amp;D reports. The final technical report,
executive summary, and abstract should provides a stronger basis for deciding on
future industry R&amp;D data collection strategies and more effective government
and private use of the resulting data.
