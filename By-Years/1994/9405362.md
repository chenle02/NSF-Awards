9405362 Dove This research will elucidate the rates and mechanisms by which
aluminum interacts with silica surfaces. Specifically it will quantify the
kinetics of quartz dissolution in characterized aluminum-bearing solutions and
relate this kinetic information to in situ observations of reaction processes
occurring at the mineral surface in aqueous solutions. This work is possible due
to the development of techniques that directly measure mineral-solution reaction
rates to 300oC (MFR) and techniques that directly observe reaction processes
occurring at the mineral surface in aqueous solutions (SFM). Results of the
study will find application in botn mineral-water geochemical systems in both
low temperature and hydrothermal environments.
