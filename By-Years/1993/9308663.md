9308663 Wang This project deals with an efficient modeling, design and control
method for high speed flexible machines. Impacts within the clearances of such
devices can seriously degrade their performance and generate excessive noise and
vibration. In this research program, the dynamic behavior of machines is modeled
incorporating design parameters such as link elasticity, link lengths, clearance
values, and material properties. Practical methods are developed to reduce and
control the effects clearances via optimal use of geometric and material
properties; an on-line technique for clearance estimation and diagnostics using
machine vibration response; and an innovative application of piezoelectric
actuators and sensors bonded to the machine links to actively suppress
clearance-induced vibration and impact forces. A coordinate reduction procedure,
in conjunction with the methods of finite element and harmonic balance, are used
to the methods of finite element and harmonic balance, are used to assist in
arriving at optimal designs of flexible mechanisms. ***
