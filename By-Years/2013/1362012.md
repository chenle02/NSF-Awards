The research of the planned I/UCRC for Atomically Thin Multifunctional Coatings
aims to focus on fundamental understanding of synthesis, integration,
properties, processing and scale-up of novel 2D material systems of application
importance. The proposed Industry-University partnership plans to build on a
foundation of scientific innovation in 2D materials at Penn State and Rice
University in such materials as graphene, MoS2, WS2, hBN, and WSxSe1-x. The
planned research activities of the center are student-centric, and will include:
performing transformational and applied research, developing intellectual
property, low cost nano-manufacturing, doing internships at the industry, and
undertaking technology transfer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planned I/UCRC will
closely coordinate joint activities to involve underrepresented students at all
levels of education; for example, through the new Penn State - Millennium
Scholars Program, supporting research summer stays at both universities.
Undergraduate students will be provided opportunities to take part in ongoing
interdisciplinary research in the center. In order to encourage young people to
pursue science-technology research, the center will jointly conduct activities
such as the Upward Bound Math and Science (UBMS) and leverage ongoing PSU/Rice
MRSEC REU and RET programs. The center also intends to generate strategies to
remediate current technology drawbacks and spur local and regional economic
growth through Penn State's Innovation Park and The Rice Alliance for Technology
and Entrepreneurship.&lt;br/&gt;
