Nutrient loading from watersheds to coastal waters leads to many effects on
nature some of which are drastic enough to attract public attention such as with
fin- or shellfish kills. Increased nutrient loading from anthropogenic sources
has major impacts on the structure and function of shallow coastal ecosystems.
To understand the processes driving nutrient flux in the land/sea margin
ecosystems, it is necessary to determine how rates of nutrient loading from
watersheds are coupled to the responses of the receiving system. Dr. Valiela and
scientists from five other institutions will investigate the coupling in Waquoit
Bay, Massachusetts. They will model and measure both the terrestrial and the
aquatic components of the area in order to trace the effects of the nutrient
supply on the Bay.
