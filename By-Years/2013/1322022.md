Understanding both the chemical and physical processes that contribute to the
early differentiation of planets into rocky (silicate) mantles and metallic
cores is fundamental to the understanding of Earth's evolution. It has been
proposed that the early Earth experienced wide spread melting, and the resulting
metallic liquid segregated from the remaining silicate material at high
pressures and temperatures forming the core. A comprehensive framework for core
formation mechanisms in a partially molten silicate at the grain scale has not
yet been fully established. This project utilizes recently developed
experimental methods and imaging techniques coupled with numerical simulations
to determine the physical processes that allow for segregation of metallic
liquids from partially molten silicates at conditions relevant to the
differentiation of the planet Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will address
the rate(s) of metal segregation for several equilibrium and non-equilibrium
core formation scenarios at the grain scale. Specifically, the effect varying
degrees of partially molten silicate melt, different compositions of metallic
melt and the influence of sustained deformation on the distribution and mobility
of metallic melts will be quantified. The combined approach of experimental
measurement and numerical simulation adds a new way of quantifying the three
dimensional geometry and grain scale mobility of core forming melts that has not
been available through traditional estimates of permeability and migration
velocity.
