This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in mathematics
involves Robin Thomas of Georgia Institute of Technology, Paul Seymour of
Princeton University, G. Neil Robertson of Ohio State University and the
research group of Bruce Reed of the University of Paris VI. The award provides
travel support and living expenses to the three U.S. researchers. They intend to
develop a theory of digraph minors with particular emphasis on tree
decompositions. This theory will be analogous to graph minor theory which has
led to efficient algorithms. The project takes advantage of French expertise in
graph minor theory and will contribute towards a new structural theory.
