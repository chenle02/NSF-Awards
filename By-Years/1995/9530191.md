This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, examines the detailed mechanisms of hydrocarbon conversion reactions on
well characterized transition metal surfaces. Ultra-high vacuum spectroscopic
methods are used to probe the reaction chemistry of alkyl and metallacycle
intermediates deposited on nickel and platinum surfaces using halide precursor
molecules. The reaction chemistry of alkenes and oxygenates on these surfaces is
also explored. The results of these studies provide basic information which is
useful for the understanding of heterogeneous catalytic processes relevant to
the production of fuels and commodity chemicals. The understanding of the
reaction mechanisms of hydrocarbon conversion reactions on transition metal
surfaces is important to the development of catalytic materials and processes.
This research project uses spectroscopic methods to examine the mechanisms of
these reactions in detail. Mechanistic studies of hydrocarbon and oxygen
containing molecule reactions are the focus of this work.
