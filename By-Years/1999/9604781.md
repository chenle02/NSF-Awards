A user group consisting of twenty principal investigators and their research
staff at Boston Biomedical Research Institute, is requesting a MALDI- TOF mass
spectrometer, the Voyager Elite BioSpectrometry Research Station from PerSeptive
Biosystems. These investigators are conducting a diversity of research projects
such as the investigation of protein-protein interaction and structure-function
relationships of various proteins in both striated and smooth muscle and the
role of Ca++-binding proteins in muscle contraction, the study of submit
interactions in membrane associated energy transducing and transport systems,
the design of immunotoxins and nativiral agents, the elucidation of catalytic
mechanisms in enzymes, and the control of gene expression.
