This project supports the pre-preparation activities for the 18th Inuit Studies
Conference, "Learning from the top of the World," to be hosted by the
Smithsonian Arctic Studies Center in October 2012. The Inuit Studies Conference
is a premier international forum attended by over 500 Arctic scholars that
includes Inuit representatives from Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Ruissia, and
this is the first time it will be hosted by the United States. The five day
conference will cover a wide range of topics including: indigenous knowledge in
understanding global environmental change; international cooperation in Arctic
research; the roles of museums and museum collections in preserving Inuit
languages, heritage and cultures; Arctic governance and more. The conference
planning agenda includes robust public engagement through musical performances,
literature and poetry readings, a film festival, evening lectures for the
public, and exhibits in Inuit Art, photography, and science. In addition, a
website will be developed that will not only publicize and facilitate the
conference but will ultimately provide educational materials and opportunities
for students and teachers.
