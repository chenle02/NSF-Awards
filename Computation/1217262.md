Many applications are based on nonlinear partial differential equations in which
stability is not a result of an energy estimate. This is the case in nonlinear
conservation laws, convection-dominated or multiphase flows, and free-boundary
problems, where shocks fronts and discontinuities are important features and
pose significant difficulties for numerical methods. The natural setting for
these problems involves the physical notion of entropy and requires the
positivity of quantities like mass, temperature or density. The investigators
propose to continue the development of a new nonlinear approximation technique
for solving the above class of differential equations. This new approach
consists of computing the so-called entropy residual and use it to design a
stabilization mechanism to the Galerkin formulation of the problem at hand. This
is a different point of view than that of standard stabilization techniques. The
investigators propose to design a nonlinear viscosity based on the second
principle of thermodynamics and respect positivity/boundedness of the relevant
quantities at the same time. Even though the nonlinear algorithms are more
complicated and difficult to analyze, they yield great benefits when working
with rough solutions, complicated geometry, and strong nonlinearities.

In the past several decades, a large amount of work has been dedicated to the
development of robust numerical methods modeling nonlinear phenomena.
Significant advances have been made in many areas, but the current state of the
art is far from providing accurate and faithful numerical representations of the
complex physical processes. For instance, accurate approximation of interfaces,
sharp fronts, and shock formations is still an enormous challenge. The proposed
project has a broad impact in many fields. In mechanical and aerospace
engineering, the proposed method improves on numerical models for simulating
high velocity gas dynamics, nonlinear elasticity and phase transition problems.
In petroleum engineering the new set of methods is beneficial for more accurate
simulation of multiphase flows in reservoirs with complicated geometry.
Moreover, the project will also have significant impact in other fields such as
geophysics, nanotechnology, and environmental problems where reliable
simulations for resolving shocks, sharp interfaces, and other nonlinear
phenomena are needed.
