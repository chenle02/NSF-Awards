This dissertation research addresses three basic questions: (1) What is the
organizational structure of the broadcast media of Jamaica, and how is that
structure penetrated by outside interest groups? (2) What are the
characteristics of the individuals who conceive and produce broadcast messages,
both inside and outside formal mass media organizations? (3) How much of the
content of broadcasting is related to issues of national development, and what
is the extent of foreign media penetration? Several methods will be employed.
She will interview relevant communications and government employees, analyze
demographic information on communications and government workers, and analyze
the program content of Jamaica's two radio networks and one television network
longitudinally.
