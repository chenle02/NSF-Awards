The investigators posit that students' mastery of complex and conceptually
difficult mathematics in the middle and high school years can be vastly
improved. The tools they have chosen to advance this goal include (1) access to
powerful hardware and software and (2) a strong professional development that
focuses on the mathematics content, knowledge of how students learn, and the use
of powerful technological tools. The proposed intervention includes both
components by building on comprehensive teacher professional development to
support teaching with SimCalc, Geometer's Sketch Pad, and Fathom-data analysis.
There is evidence supporting the efficacy of SimCalc to improve learning
outcomes; this project would test the robustness of the intervention for
teachers whose content and technology background varies in representative ways.
The focal topic in this intervention is rate of change. The experimental design
proposed in this Phase I proposal is cast as pilot work for Phase II research
because it uses a design that would be fitting for a Phase II
project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
