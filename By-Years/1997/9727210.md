Proposal Number: ECS-9727210&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Peter
H. Handel (U. of Missouri St. Louis)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Quantum 1/f
Noise and Limitations of All-Optical 2-D Spectral-Holographic TDM Technology
with Quantum Well Devices&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt
;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is to refine and simplify the quantum 1/f noise
theory developed previously for applications to HFETs and FETs, and to further
develop the connection between the coherent and conventional quantum 1/f effects
in microstructures and devices. This is a revised version from the original
proposal with the "Limitation of All-Optical 2-D Spectral-Holographic TDM"
portion deleted for a limited funding. &lt;br/&gt;
