Title: Topics in Mathematical Analysis

ABSTRACT

Research will be conducted on a broad array of problems in harmonic analysis,
linear and nonlinear partial differential equations, several complex variables,
Schroedinger operators, and ordinary differential equations. In harmonic
analysis proper, the decay properties of multilinear oscillatory integral
operators will be investigated, and Lebesgue space mapping properties of
generalized Radon transforms will be analyzed in terms of underlying geometry.
Techniques from harmonic analysis will be used to develop a theory of almost
everywhere WKB asymptotics for solutions of ordinary differential equations
depending on a parameter. In complex analysis, compactness of the d-bar Neumann
problem, the analytic hypoellipticity of related operators, and Toeplitz
operators will be investigated. The Cauchy problem will be studied for nonlinear
evolution equations, with the aim of clarifying phenomena involving instablility
and growth of norms of solutions. The spectra and generalized eigenfunctions of
time-independent Schroedinger operators, in one and higher dimensions, will be
investigated.

The most fundamental laws of physical science are formulated as partial
differential equations. These equations are sometimes linear, and sometimes
nonlinear, modeling various types of self-interaction. The nonlinear Schrodinger
equation arises in connection with Bose-Einstein condensates, fiber optics, and
assorted other physically different phenomena. Time-independent Schrodinger
operators with long-range potentials model the quantum properties of disordered
electrical media. Other sources of problems concerning differential equations
are internal to mathematics, such as complex analysis in several variables. One
of the most basic tools for the analysis of differential equations is harmonic
analysis. This research will focus both on the use of harmonic analysis methods
to further the understanding of the nature of solutions of differential
equations, and on the development of new tools within harmonic analysis which
may ultimately provide further insight into differential equations, as well as
solving problems within harmonic analysis itself.
