Nearly a quarter of all red-algal species occur as parasites of other red
algae. Previous NSF-supported research by Dr. Lynda Goff and her colleagues has
established that parasites form direct cellular connections with host cells, and
may in the process transfer their nucleus into host cells. Dr. Goff, at the
Santa Cruz campus of the University of California, will continue to study the
process of parasite nucleus transfer and the subsequent cytology and
developmental events that occur in the host's transformed cells. In addition,
Dr. Goff will analyze plastid DNA using restriction endonuclease techniques to
determine the phylogenetic relationships between host species and parasites, in
a pioneering application of these new molecular phylogenetic methods with red
algae. This research will thus advance understanding of basic cellular
interactions in a novel system of red algae, and will add powerful new tools of
analysis to the problem of determining algal evolution.
