RENEWABLE AND RESOURCE EFFICIENT COMPOSITE MATERIALS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING

Abstract A program aimed at development of renewable and resource efficient
composite material for affordable housing is proposed. Fiber reinforced polymer
(FRP) composites offer inherent advantages over traditional materials with
regard to high strength-to-weight ratio, design flexibility, corrosion
resistance, low maintenance, and extended service life. FRP materials can be
used for both new construction and repair/rehabilitation of existing structures.
One such application involves creating durable and affordable housing products.
It is well known that properly designed FRP materials and systems can improve
product durability. High cost has been the key barrier to wide spread use of
composites. Two of the major cost drivers for composites are labor and raw
materials. Automated manufacturing processes can substantially reduce labor
hours and improve material utilization. Use of plant derived materials such as
soybased resin system and soyhull derived foams offer low cost and
environmentally benign raw materials. The research will focus on the following
challenging issues: Development of composite structural components using
resource-efficient and durable materials, and performance evaluation of these
components are the key goals of the proposed research. To achieve these goals,
an interdisciplinary team has been formed with backgrounds in materials,
composite manufacturing, chemistry, and structural engineering. Pultruded glass
fiber composite using soybased resin system for floor, roof, and wall panels
Natural fiber reinforced insulation panels Variable density soybean hull based
foam core Manufacturing of panels using core-filled pultrusion and vacuum
assisted RTM processes Experimental testing and analysis to provide the basis
for safe use of these new materials.

To accomplish the goal of transferring viable technologies from the laboratory
to housing industry, we will collaborate with construction industries to
evaluate the performance of products in the field. The successful completion of
this project will generate data to initiate construction of a composite house
and enhance technology's general acceptance. The project is expected to have
significant impact on research, education, technology transfer and
interdisciplinary activities.
