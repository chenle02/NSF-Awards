9529838 Swart This award will support purchase of a mass spectrometer for
analysis of light stable isotopes (CHON). The system will be coupled to a CN
analyzer to permit analyses on organic samples using continuous flow, and will
include an automated system for water equilibration for oxygen and hydrogen
isotopes. ***
