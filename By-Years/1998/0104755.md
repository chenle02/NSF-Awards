This award supports purchase of boats, diving equipment and facility at the Long
Marine Laboratory (LML) of the University of California Santa Cruz. These
improvements in facilities and equipment will allow the Diving and Boating
Safety Programs (DBSP) to meet the growing numbers and needs of students and
researchers. Funds will be used to equip a new Marine Support Facility with
scuba cylinder racks, Nitrox tank-charging equipment, cabinets, and heating and
ventilation systems. The new facility will provide students and researchers with
areas for staging, fabrication and maintenance of diving and scientific
equipment. The award will augment institutional funds to be used for site
preparation, foundation, rough carpentry and minimal interior finish work. In
addition, the award will support purchase of a 16' inflatable boat, a 22'
fiberglass vessel and 3 outboard engines. A forklift will also be purchased to
move boats and heavy gear on the grounds of the facility.

Since 1976, the LML has been the coastal research laboratory for the
University's Institute of Marine Sciences. The laboratory is located on a
coastal bluff adjacent to the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, the
nation's largest National Marine Sanctuary. The LML Education Program (K-12) and
aquarium displays serve 35,000 visitors each year. The Diving and Boating Safety
Program provides support for faculty, staff, student and visiting researchers in
biology, chemistry and earth sciences. Approximately one-third of the
University's 300 undergraduate Marine Biology students use the scuba diving and
small boat facilities in classes or as part of their research.
