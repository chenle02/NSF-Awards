9311269 Orin The Department of Electrical Engineering at The Ohio State
University will purchase a High Performance Graphics Platform which will be
dedicated to support research in engineering. The equipment will be used for
several research projects; each project addresses a critical problem associated
with unmanned underwater robotic systems. Interest in underwater robotics is
growing because of its potential for use in a range of applications, including
ecological studies, salvage operations, geophysical exploration, rescue and
recovery operations, and maintenance and repair of man-made underwater
structures. In particular the supported projects focus on issues related to the
simulation, control and monitoring of underwater robotics in hazardous and
unstructured environments. The primary projects are: 1) real-time dynamic
simulation of an unmanned underwater vehicle and manipulator system and its
associated controller, 2) real-time dynamic simulation of an underwater walking
vehicle, 3) dynamic simulation and neural control of enveloping power grasps,
and 4) real-time display of video data compressed using a technique which
employs artificial neural networks.
