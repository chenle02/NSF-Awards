This action funds John Pardo of Penn State University to conduct a research
project in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences area during the summer of 2013
at the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST) in Nomi,
Ishikawa Prefecture in Japan. The project title is "Classifying the Theoretical
Strength of Ramsey's Theory." The host scientists are Drs. Mizuhito Ogawa and
Keita Yokoyama.

This project extends current research in the area of Reverse Mathematics
regarding combinatorial principles and specifically Ramsey's Theory for pairs.
In general, Reverse Mathematics is a program which focuses on classifying the
proof-theoretic strength of mathematical theorems from all area of mathematics
as subsystems of second-order arithmetic; interestingly it is the case that a
large number of theorems fall into one of five major such subsystems known as
"the big five", however many of the known exceptions to this are combinatorial
principles - the goal is to advance what is known about Ramsey's Theory for
pairs. Dr. Yokoyama has had significant success in this area before using model
theoretic methods, in particular relating to approaches used in non-standard
analysis, so this research begins work with these techniques in mind as well as
considering proof-theoretic and recursion-theoretic methods in the work.

Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce. Furthermore, this collaboration will strengthen the
connection between mathematical researchers at Penn State and JAIST. Ideally
this bond will continue to grow in the future and ultimately culminate in many
additional collaborations that would have otherwise not existed.
