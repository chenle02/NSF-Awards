Northwestern University supports a Research Experiences for Science Teachers
activity that hosts 15 teachers for each summer in 2002-2005. The goals of the
activity are to facilitate meaningful interactions between college professors
and pre-college teachers, to translate those interactions into practical
classroom tools, and to develop a resource network for disseminating the insight
and tools that teachers acquire. The RET activity, which continues throughout
the school year and involves pre-college teachers as well as community college
faculty, includes development by the teachers of "toolkits" or teaching tools
that draw from the teachers' research experience and that relate to classroom
curricula. The "toolkits" are made available online.
