This workshop brings together researchers working on the foundations of
computational learning theory. Computational learning theory is a significant
and growing activity, at the boundary of artificial intelligence and theoretical
computer science. Its results affect both the design and validation of computer
learning techniques and systems. The workshop is important in that it will aid
in the rapid dissemination of computational learning theory results and
experimental data, encourage collaboration among researchers, and facilitate the
interchange of computer algorithms and systems.
