The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a method to remove oxygen from food storage and transport
containers to decrease produce spoilage. Every year $160 billion worth of food
is wasted in America at every stage of the supply chain. Improving food storage
would improve this figure and enable environmentally sustainable transport
options. The proposed technology may be implemented in several possible stages
of the supply chain from farm storage, transportation (truck or ship), grocery
store coolers, and for home use in personal refrigerators. This project will
explore various paths for technology translation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
I-Corps project is based on the development of a reversible reaction of excited
oxygen with a novel material. The material acts like an oxygen sponge, absorbing
oxygen when irradiated with light, and releasing oxygen under warm, dark
conditions. This allows the consumption of oxygen to be controlled using light,
while the release can be manipulated with heat. The reaction occurs at low
partial pressures of oxygen and can create oxygen-free environments. The oxygen
may be stored in the material and released under gentle heating. This material
and process may be used to remove or reduce oxygen from a space, creating an
anerobic environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
