Further study of the process of organic matter adsorption by marine sediments
will focus two areas: the effect of the composition of peptides on their
adsorption and decomposition, and the further investigation of the
"irreversible" adsorption of amino acids observed in earlier work. The approach
is to observe the adsorption of radiolabeled peptides of varying composition and
chain length, synthesized for this study. Longer-term studies of the adsorption
of radiolabeled amino acids by sediments and extracted sediment organic matter
will also be done. A broad objective is better understanding of the processes
leading to the preservation of organic matter in marine sediments, which remains
a poorly-understood phenomenon.
