*** ABSTRACT 9661471 Kim This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
will develop a MEMS device for fast switching of high frequency signals such as
RF. The mechanical switching will achieve virtually no parasitic leakage when
the switch is off. The device will utilize a piezoelectric actuator which was
originally developed for a display application. The MEMS device developed will
find application as a fast RF switching device in the field of microwave
communications. ***
