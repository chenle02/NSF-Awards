Duke University's Summer REU Program in "Mechanisms of Behavior" provides an
emphasis on integrative, systems, and behavioral neuroscience. The focus on the
study of animal learning and behavior unifies faculty research interests within
this interdisciplinary field and serves as the common theme for the individual
projects available to student participants in the program. The program is
designed to provide opportunities for highly qualified individuals; including
women, minority, and disabled undergraduate students who would like to expand
their laboratory skills. Each summer, undergraduate students will participate in
a 10-week research program that includes a one-on-one mentorship with a
participating faculty member. In addition, 3 weekly seminar series including
"Research in the Neurosciences", "Science Basics", and "Science Ethics and
Practice" will serve to integrate the individual laboratory experiences. The
primary goal of the program is to provide opportunities for undergraduates to
receive training in the cutting-edge methodologies of behavioral neuroscience
and genomics. Mentors for the program are prominent researchers in their fields
and have substantial experience in supervising and training undergraduates. The
students will work on research projects that are within their grasp, and which
present real opportunities for new discoveries that will be of value to the
neuroscience community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Warren H. Meck will be the
point-of-contact for student recruitment (Department of Psychological and Brain
Sciences, 103 Research Drive, Box 91050, Duke University, Durham, NC 27708.
