9709959 Dorgan The aim of this research is to study the modification of
stainless steel surfaces by the adsorption of novel block copolymers for the
purpose of improving biocompatibility for better cardiopulmonary products. This
research will be carried out with collaboration between the principal
investigator's laboratory at the Colorado School of Mines and COBE
Cardiovascular Incorporated, a leading corporation in the manufacture of blood
oxygenators. Also, the laboratory of Professor M. Sefton in Canada will also be
involved in biocompatibility studies. Funds will be used to partially support
one graduate student for one year, for materials and supplies and for analytical
instrument fees. The rest of the student's support will be provided by COBE. ***
