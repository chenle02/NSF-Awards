Bock 9405934 The objectives of this research are to continue to serve as a
University NAVSTAR consortium (UNAVCO) facility for the archiving and analysis
of GPS global tracking data to support regional crustal deformation projects.
Improve the timeliness of global products from the present 7- to 10-day delay to
a 1- to 2-day delay to support in-the-field data analysis, particularly in the
presence of Anti-Spoofing (AS) and Selective Availability (SA). The research
will also develop and implement methodoloies to integrate regional and global
geodetic networds in order to improve estimates of plate motions and map plate-
boundary deformation. Develop strategies for distributed analysis of large
metworks of global and regional extent. Finally, to expand the scope of the
facility to assist investigators in the analysis of regional networks in a
globally defined reference frame. ****
