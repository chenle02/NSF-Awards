9614789 Rubin This research is to build on recent success with precise
earthquake locations at Kilauea, Hawaii, to learn more about the interaction
between magmatic and tectonic processes within the volcano. Seismicity combined
with high deformation rates and good geodetic coverage permit quantitative
interpretation of the earthquake relocation results using two- and three-
dimensional elastic boundary element models. Earlier relocations from the
volcano's east rift in 1991 delineate a left-lateral strike-slip fault zone that
is 2.5 km long but only 100 m tall over much of its length. Both this remarkable
ribbon-like geometry and the long-term pattern of moment release are in
quantitative agreement with a mechanical model in which the rift-zone stress was
"reset" by dike intrusion in 1982, and subsequently loaded by geodetically-
inferred motion of Kilauea's deep rift. These types of models are of importance
to estimation of earthquake hazards in this seismically active zone. This
research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
