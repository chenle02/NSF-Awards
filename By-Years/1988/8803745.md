The role of hematite in the post-cooling alteration of subaerial basalts is
largely unspecified. When hematite is present in a basalt, it is often
attributed to deuteric alteration during cooling of a lava without any solid
petrographic evidence. The most oxidized portions of flows, the flow tops, are
often avoided during paleomagnetic studies. However, important information
regarding the different stages of alteration and the role of hematite is
available in the direction of the hematite magnetization. This project is to
study hematite genesis in subaerial basalts, using paleomagnetism and oxide
petrography. The PI will sample basalt piles which have experience varying types
of alteration. The ultimate goal is to formulate a conceptual model of post-
cooling, oxidation so that petrologists, geochemists and paleomagnetists will
have a foundation with which to interpret the presence of hematization.
