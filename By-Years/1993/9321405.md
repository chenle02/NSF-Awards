This award supports a project to extend predictive frost heave models to full
3-D forms in an effort to better understand the processes involved in
development of patterned ground, such as earth hummocks, that occurs in
periglacial environments. Of the 19 mechanisms thought to be important, either
singly or in combination, for formation of patterned ground, only two have been
incorporated into mathematical models. The objectives of this work are: 1) to
use published laboratory frost-heave data to test a simplified form of the 1-D
secondary frost-heave model of O Neill and Miller which can be generalized to
3-D; 2) to ascertain the ability of a new differential frost-heave model based
on this simplified form of the O Neill and Miller model to describe earth
hummocks whose relevant properties have been characterized; 3) to refine this
differential frost-heave model based on the laboratory and field observations;
and 4) to explore the applicability of this model to describe features of other
forms of patterned ground. In addition to improving models of periglacial
processes, this work will benefit researchers correlating ancient geomorphic
features with past climate as well as engineers developing construction projects
in periglacial regions.
