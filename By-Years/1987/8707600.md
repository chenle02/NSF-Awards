3He accumulates in minerals exposed at the earth's surface because cosmic rays
cause spallation of smaller nuclei from target nuclei. Because the cosmic ray
flux and production rates are fairly well constrained and the cosmogonic
component of 3He in minerals can be determined, measurement of 3He and 4He
abundances in minerals at the earth's surface can be used to calculate the
exposure ages of minerals. This knowledge can be used to study a variety of
processes that take place at the earth's surface on a time scale of 100 years to
several million years. Measurements involve the 3He and 4He abundances in rocks
whose exposure ages are fairly well constrained by geologic evidence and by
conventional K-Ar or 14C dating methods. Samples will be cored from glaciated
surfaces (Sierras) and recent Lava flows (W. United States, Hawaii). In the
Scripps Isotopic Laboratory, researchers will test radiogenic gas separation
techniques and the possible efficacy of neon for radiogenic dating. Knowledge of
the exposure age of surfaces will have important applications in Quaternary
stratigraphy and geomorphology, in the study of chemical and mechanical erosion
rates, and may have applications to understanding seismic recurrences and other
mass movement phenomena.
