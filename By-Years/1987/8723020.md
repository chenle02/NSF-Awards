This project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program concerns the
study of certain fundamental processes affecting chemical reactions. In
particular, new algorithms will be developed and tested to calculate phenomena
that couple the detailed motions of electrons and nuclei. Such interactions are
often neglected, but can have important effects that are only beginning to be
understood. Applications will be made to several problems of current
experimental interest, including the spectra of lithium hydride and nitrogen
molecules, the quenching of electronically excited sodium atoms, and charge
transfer reactions.
