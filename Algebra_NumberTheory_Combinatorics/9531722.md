Rodger 9531722 This award is for a study of several problems that will be
considered over the next three years. Two of the problems will take a major
effort to solve. The first problem is to find necessary and sufficient
conditions for a given edge-colored copy of the complete graph on n vertices
(Kn) to be embedded in an edge-colored copy of Kv in such a way that the
subgraph induced by the edges of each color form a connected spanning k-regular
subgraph of Kv. This would be a companion to existing results with either drop
the requirement that the subgraphs are connected or replace it with the
requirement that they be 2-edge connected. The second problem is to show that
any partial Mendelsohn triple system of order n and index l can be embedded in a
complete Mendelsohn triple system of order v and index l for some v not
exceeding 2n+1. This is a directed version of Lindner's conjecture, a conjecture
which has now been proved for triple systems of even index using amalgamation
techniques. This progress in the undirected case suggests that the directed
analogue is ready to be solved. Amalgamation techniques are of interest in their
own right, and warrant further study. Other problems will be studied. The
investigator will consider the graph H(C) naturally arising from a Hamming code
C and attempt to show that H(C) has a hamilton decomposition and is pan-cyclic.
The investigator also plans to make contributions to the growing literature on
graph designs. This research is in the general area of Combinatorics. One of the
goals of Combinatorics is to find efficient methods to study how discrete
collections of objects can be arranged. The behavior of discrete systems is
extremely important to modern communications. For example, the design of large
networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the design of
algorithms in computer science deal with discrete sets of objects, and this
makes use of combinatorial research.
