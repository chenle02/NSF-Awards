The Section of Birds of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History was founded in
1898. Its collections are worldwide in scope, covering all major taxa, and are
among the largest and scientifically most important in North America. A previous
NSF award provided new, compactorized storage facilities for the bird specimens.
This award will provide funds to complete rearrangement of the collections in
the new facilities, to complete computerization and cross-checking of specimen
data, and to eliminate the backlog of specimens awaiting preparation.
