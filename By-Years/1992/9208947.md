This award funds a research planning workshop on machine learning and computer
vision, to be held in Harper's Ferry, West Virginia, on October 15-17, 1992.
Research in some laboratories is beginning to make progress toward introduction
of learning capabilities into computer vision systems. There is a growing
interest in interaction between the learning and computer vision research
communities. This workshop will provide a forum for leading researchers from
both fields to come together to identify concepts and approaches in machine
learning that have promise for application to vision, and to develop a research
agenda to advance the use of learning in computer vision systems. A report
summarizing the current state of the art and outlining research opportunities
and priorities will be produced and widely distributed.
