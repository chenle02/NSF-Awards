Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
OISE-0912669&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: James
Murray&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of
Washington&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: International Collaboration on the Black
Sea&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs plan to develop a new research partnership with
Prof. Bahar Ince of Bogazici University and Prof. Orhan Ince of Istanbul
Technical University. The goal of this partnership is to develop a new
integrated study of the roles of bacteria and archaea on nitrogen
transformations and other reactions in the Black Sea. A graduate student will be
able to establish contacts for his current doctoral research on the Black Sea.
Developing closer collaboration should also open the door to future graduate
student exchanges between the University of Washington and Turkish universities.
The new studies on anoxic microbial ecosystems will integrate work on
bacterially mediated processes with those mediated by archaea. There are few
other such integrative efforts trying to interpret the chemical distributions in
the context of the biological organisms mediating the reactions. &lt;br/&gt;The
carbonate system model studies will provide fundamental knowledge about the
distribution of carbonate species in the Black Sea and how these respond to
perturbations of carbon dioxide added from the atmosphere (ocean acidification)
and liquid carbon dioxide injected at depth. The sequestration model results
will be particularly useful if one of the Black Sea countries develops a plan to
sell carbon credits for this process.
