This research involves the design and testing of instrumentation for the study
of the composition and altitude distribution of the positively and negatively
charged ionic species in the stratosphere in a series of balloon flights. Each
payload carries separate cryogenically pumped magnetic sector- field mass
spectrometers for positive and negative ion measurements. Mass ranges examined
extend from 35 to 700 amu with a resolution of + 1 amu to 500 amu and a
sensitivity of 1 ion/cc. Specific project objectives include (a) positive
identification of large cluster ions in the region 20-40 km, (b) determination
of trace gas (pollutant) concentrations from recorded ion spectra, (c) and a
systematic search for multi ion complexes (because of their suggested importance
in linking solar activity and the earth's climate). This grant provides
supplemental funding to extend work under Grant ATM-8503560. Instrumentation
developed under that grant was balloon-flown twice, but ballooning problems
prevented the acquisition of data. Combined with funds residual from the earlier
grant, this award will provide for another balloon flight.
