Combinatorial Screening of Materials for Cesium Sensing and
Separation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Electrodes coated with nickel hexacyanoferrate
(NiHCF) are known to absorb, or intercalate, cesium selectively and in
preference over all other alkali, rare earth, and transition metal cations. This
affinity for cesium gives rise to an electrochemical signature that can be used
to detect cesium even in the presence of large excesses of interfering cations.
When synthesized as a bulk powder, NiHCF is known to possess a wide range of
vacancy defect structures, resulting in changes to its ion intercalation
properties. No comparable research has established the ability to grow
structural variants of NiHCF on electrodes, nor is it known what influence these
variants will have on sensor performance. This exploratory research projecct
seeks to develop an inkjet-printer-based combinatorial synthesis strategy for
the growth of NiHCF variants on electrodes, to assess the role of structure on
the performance of cesium sensors, and to identify conditions that will optimize
the cesium sensitivity. &lt;br/&gt; Cesium is one of the most likely
radiological agents to be used in a terrorist "dirty" bomb, owing to its common
use in modern society (for medicine, test instruments, and remote generators).
This research program is aimed at developing high-performance, low-cost cesium
sensors. Such sensors could be widely deployed in the urban environment in an
effort to detect anomalous cesium levels prior to the detonation of a dirty
bomb, giving public officials an opportunity to intercede. Should a cesium dirty
bomb scenario play out, this sensor technology would permit widespread
deployment of instruments around the contaminated site to help ensure
containment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
