This award provides support for a two year cooperative research project on
dense astrophysical plasmas, between Professor Hugh M Van Horn, Department of
Physics and Astronomy, University of Rochester, and Professor Setsuo Ichimaru,
Department of Physics, University of Tokyo, Japan. In dense astrophysical
objects, such as neutron stars, white dwarfs, low mass stars (brown dwarfs), the
solar interior, and giant planets, collections of ionized nuclei and electrons
constitute dense plasmas, which exhibit various kinds of phase changes. In
recent years, due to advancements in condensed-matter theories coupled with
progress in computer-simulation capabilities, it has become possible to carry
out detailed analyses of those phase-transition processes in dense astrophysical
plasmas. The aim of this proposal is to undertake theoretical and computer-
simulation studies on a number of those phase transition processes. The
processes to be studied include: (1) the possibility that neutron stars may have
glassy rather than crystalline crusts, and what the consequences are of that;
(2) the possibilities of phase separation in binary carbon/oxygen and
iron/carbon mixtures, which have been suggested as energy sources in very cool
white dwarfs; (3) iron/hydrogen phase separation, which may have interesting
consequences for the evolution of low mass stars and "brown dwarfs"; and (4)
hydrogen/helium phase separation in giant planets and brown dwarfs, which may
prove a significant energy source in these bodies. The two groups involved in
this collaboration complement each other well. The Japanese scientists have a
long history of important contributions in areas of dense plasma physics and
condensed matter physics relevant to this collaboration, and also have a strong
interest in astrophysical applications. The US group has a similar interest in
astrophysics, together with a strong interest in the relevant properties of
matter at high densities. If successful this project will make a significant
contribution to research problems at the interface between the disciplines of
dense plasma physics, condensed matter physics and astrophysics.
