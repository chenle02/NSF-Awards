This research project concerns analytical investigation of exactly-solvable
models of quantum spin systems, with particular emphasis on study of entropy and
correlation functions for quantum spin chains using the Fisher-Hartwig formula
for the determinant of a Toeplitz matrix. The work has implications for measures
of entanglement in quantum information science. The project will: (1) study
entropy and entanglement in the XXZ spin chain model of statistical physics; (2)
evaluate space-, time- and temperature-dependent correlation functions in the
XXZ model in a critical regime; (3) calculate asymptotics for the spectrum of
the density matrix in the XXZ model in the large-number limit; (4) study the
density matrices of blocks of spins in a model of interacting spins due to
Affleck, Kennedy, Lieb and Tasaki; and (5) calculate the entanglement entropy in
models generalized to other Lie groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is an
investigation of fundamentals in the physics of information. The project studies
entanglement, a central concept in quantum information science. Because of its
applications to cryptography and secure transmission of sensitive information,
quantum information science is important for national security and is an area of
federal strategic interest. This project is related to an approach to quantum
computation based on measurements in quantum spin systems. &lt;br/&gt;
