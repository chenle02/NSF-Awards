The Chemistry Department acquired a Fourier Transform Infrared spectrometer to
implement a plan for curriculum reform that encourages students to integrate
diverse perspectives within the discipline of chemistry. The spectrometer is
used in a three- semester advanced laboratory sequence that combines
laboratories from instrumental analysis, advanced organic chemistry and physical
chemistry. The spectrometer is also used in a recently revised microscale
organic chemistry, an instrumental analysis course for non-majors, and senior
student research projects. In addition the Chemistry Department offers a
workshop on Analytical Instrumentation for area high school teachers that
includes FTIR spectroscopy. The institution contributed to this project in an
amount equal to the NSF funds.
