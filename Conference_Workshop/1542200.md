This grant provides partial support for a conference on "Mathematics and
Mechanics in the 22nd Century: Seven Decades and Counting..." to be held October
23-25, 2015, in Eugene, Oregon. The interaction between mathematics and
mechanics, with ensuing applications to materials science and biology, will be
the central theme of the conference. The grant will support travel expenses of
young scientists to participate in the conference and present a poster in the
blitz and exhibit sessions. The late 1940s saw the beginning of new trends in
the development of a continuum theory of complex materials and the foundation of
theories that bridge continuum mechanics and molecular and atomic structure.
These new areas of inquiry were catalytic to the development of new mathematical
and mechanics theories at the basis of design of new materials and devices, with
applications from medicine to advanced manufacturing. The conference has two
main goals. First, it will explore recent developments and new trends and will
identify prospects for future research on nonlinear materials, devices,
biological modeling, and related mathematical and computational ideas and tools.
The interdisciplinary school of scientists at the forefront of such developments
during the last seven decades has mentored and produced new generations of
outstanding scientists, which include a large number of women, who have
themselves reached leadership roles in the field. Thus, another main goal of the
conference is to discuss mentoring strategies for future generations to ensure
the continued scientific and human development success and to reach out to
members of underrepresented groups. The participants will explore tools to
overcome the challenges of an incipient career in interdisciplinary research and
identify new educational demands. Another organizational task will be
identifying an academically diverse pool of junior researchers across the USA
and oversees, with a very strong presence of women and members of
underrepresented groups.

Nonlinear elasticity emerged in the mathematical community as a result of the
works by Ericksen and Rivlin, from the late 1940s to 1960s. This initiated a
golden period of research in the calculus of variations and partial differential
equations, from the points of view of both analysis and geometry. These
developments also lead to outstanding success in the field of complex materials,
such as the theories of phase transformations in crystals, shape memory alloys,
ferroelectric and magnetic materials, composites, and liquid crystals. While the
selection of conference speakers is made in connection with these themes of
research, the emphasis will be placed on new and prospective mathematical and
materials developments and applications. These will include topics on materials
research leading to new sources of clean energy, as well as new mathematical
tools to understand and compute defects in liquid crystals and ensuing
applications to electrolytic transport, and mechanical studies of viruses
towards research on antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The conference also envisions
a scientific panel on strategies for new materials development, accompanying
mathematical tools, and interdisciplinary and educational challenges. The
