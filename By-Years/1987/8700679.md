There are specific areas of the brain that are known to regulate a number of
bodily functions. One such area is the medial preoptic area (MPOA) of the
hypothalamus. In the male rat, this brain area has been shown to monitor body
temperature and allow response of the body to changes in environmental
temperature. In addition, the MPOA processes sensory information and, in the
presence of testosterone, this area mediates hormonal and behavioral aspects of
reproduction. Given this duality of function within the MPOA, experiments were
begun to investigate a relationship of temperature, both in the body and in the
MPOA, reproductive function. Using sophisticated telemetric thermosensors, the
MPOA and deep body temperature in male rats will be monitored relative to
physiological and reproductive status. Preliminary data have shown that there
are changes in MPOA temperature independent of changes in body temperature, but
related to reproductive processes. Further, rapid and selected cooling of the
MPOA was not related to general changes in body temperature related to exercise.
The experiments will examine this phenomena in more detail. The information
gathered in this research will be of great interest in terms of technological
developments of instruments used in the research. In addition, the study of the
duality in function of the MPOA will elucidate some of mechanisms involved in
the regulation of temperature and reproductive function.
