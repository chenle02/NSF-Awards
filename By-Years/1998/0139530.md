Pennsylvania State University's Astrobiology Summer Program supports 10
undergraduate students from colleges and universities across the U.S. to
participate in unique interdisciplinary research that combines biology,
chemistry and geology to better understand the early evolution of life on Earth
and elsewhere in the universe. Students spend 10 weeks over the summer
performing independent research under the supervision of a faculty member at the
main campus of Penn State. After a day of orientation, the summer program begins
with a three-day field trip to an unusual salt-water lake in New York State
believed to be analogous to early oceans on Earth 3-4 billion years ago. The
lake is part of active astrobiology research and therefore data will be
collected during the trip. After returning to Penn State, students spend the
remainder of the summer engaged in astrobiology research in faculty
laboratories. They also attend weekly seminars, give oral presentations, are
involved in tours of laboratories, and present their research in a symposium at
the end of the summer. Women and minorities are encouraged to apply to this
program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
