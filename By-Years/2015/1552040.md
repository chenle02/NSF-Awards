Meiotic recombination is the process by which genetic information is exchanged
between paired chromosomes during gamete formation. This exchange is central to
reproductive success and the generation of genetic variation, thereby providing
the raw material for evolutionary change. If recombination goes awry, gametes
can be formed with missing or extra copies of genetic information. Such
chromosomal errors are the leading genetic cause of fetal loss, mental
impairment, and developmental disability in humans. The number and location of
recombination events varies within and among species for largely unknown
reasons. This project will examine what determines variation in the frequency
and chromosomal region of recombination events. Educational efforts associated
with this research provide training in genetics and bioinformatics for students
belonging to under-represented groups at different grade
levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One goal of the project is to determine the nature,
extent, and genetic basis of intra- and inter-specific variation in the
distribution of meiotic recombination events along a chromosome using a
combination of classical genetics and next generation sequencing. Computer
simulations will be used to determine the consequences of this spatial variation
in the distribution of recombination events for patterns of genetic variation
within and between species. Finally, bioinformatics approaches will be used to
determine how crossover distribution changes in response to natural selection.
Broader impacts of this work include training of students and a postdoc, broad
dissemination of the results, generating recombination data that will be
valuable to the community, and working with the NC Museum of Natural Science to
communicate our work to the public.
