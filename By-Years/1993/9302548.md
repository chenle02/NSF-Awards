One of the most amazing feats that the nervous system performs is stabilization
of the perceived visual world when the retinal display is continually shifting
because of eye, head and body movements. If our neural representation of the
world did not remain steady, we would be subjected to continual nauseating
displacements. We do not understand how the nervous system transforms and
coordinates all the incoming signals about body position in order to perform
this feat. Dr. Berkley has discovered a fascinating phenomenon that offers a new
paradigm for understanding this question which he will explore with this small
grant for exploratory research. Unexpectedly, in the midst of experiments
designed to answer another problem, he discovered that paralyzing the muscles
that move one eye causes paralysis in the muscles that move the other eye, even
though anesthetic used for the immobilization was confined to one eye. He will
investigate how feedback from the muscles of the paralyzed eye is used to
control the actions of the intact eye. The information obtained in this
investigation will be helpful to physicians treating eye movement disorders as
well as to the designers of robot systems for visually guided reaching.***//
