This is in support of the Sixth International Machine Translation Summit to be
held October 29-31 and November 1, 1997 in San Diego, California. This year, the
summit celebrates the 50th anniversary of machine translation as an area of
research and development. Given the special nature of this celebratory
conference, NSF is assisting in the conference support in order to express in
public the support of the Foundation for machine translation as a field of study
and in order to support the travel costs of 5 conference attendees who will
constitute a panel of Pioneering Researchers in Machine Translation. The chosen
panelists will provide a retrospective on the history and developments of
machine translation in the late 1940's until today.
