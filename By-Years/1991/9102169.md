Recent work on representation of both casual relations and statistical relations
by directed independence graphs, and even more recent discoveries concerning
search algorithms, offer the prospect of automated systems that will reliably
extract causal information from large data bases, even when the number of
variables is a hundred or more, and even when there is very little prior
knowledge about the causal relations underlying the data. This work will
systematically test the reliability of new search algorithms on simulated data
to study the extension of graph representation to feedback processes using
cyclic graphs, and to investigate the possibility of reliable automated
dependencies in a data base. Reliable algorithms for inferring causal structure
from statistical data will have widespread applications in engineering,
epidemiology, the social sciences, and any other discipline where experimental
controls are often limited or absent.//
