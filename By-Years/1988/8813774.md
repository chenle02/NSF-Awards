Western medical techniques have been introduced to most indigenous communities
worldwide. Yet they are not always used and the reasons why individuals choose
to use or not use these treatments is not understood. This project explores the
relationship between choice of medical treatment and perceived health outcomes
in Chugurpampa, Peru, an Andean community where peasants have access to both
western and indigenous medicines. The researcher will look at cultural variables
and external forces with regard to perception, thereby refine current choice
models that ignore these variables. This study will contribute to medical
anthropology by determining the factors that account for the medical choices of
indigenous peoples and by improving the means with which scientists measure
health outcomes. It will also contribute to better health care planning for
indigenous populations.
