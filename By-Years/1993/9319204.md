9319204 Hearn The use of a structural reliability criterion for evaluation of
inspection techniques can provide a rational basis for the design of inspection
programs; specifically the selection of inspection techniques and inspection
intervals to meet joint demands of ensuring structural safety and of providing
sufficient data to support planning of maintenance. A reliability basis for
design of inspection programs differs from the simpler consideration of minimum
defect size that specific inspection techniques can detect. A reliability basis
recognizes critical members in a structure and demands successful detection of
damage in these. The basis promotes a selection/evaluation/selection cycle in
which inspection programs are tailored to meet specific performance goals. An
emphasis on instrument-based NDE techniques and an integration with bridge
management systems (BMS) will be followed. Data from instrument-based
inspections will be related to structural reliability and will be used to
generate parametric measures of structural condition. ***
