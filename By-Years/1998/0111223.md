This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I (SBIR) project will develop the
means necessary to adapt the Local Electrode Atom Probe (LEAP) to provide three-
dimensional atomic-resolution imaging and elemental analysis of biochips and
other nanoscale biotechnological specimens. Hard lithography used in the
microelectronics and biotechnology industries already produces nanostructures
that are extremely difficult to evaluate with current instrumentation. Soft
lithography, self-assembly, and other methods will produce even smaller features
from biological and organic materials. Structural characterization for bio-
nanotechnology is already problematic because analytical electron microscopy has
substantial limitations in the quantitative imaging of carbon and other low
atomic number elements. Further compounding this problem is the fact that unlike
the simpler geometries of microelectronics devices, the biomacromolecules
intrinsic to biotechnology are three-dimensional. Without analytical
instrumentation better suited to the evaluation of 3-D bio-organic structures,
industry will be "flying blind" as it develops complex nanoscale
biotechnologies. Our project is designed to adapt and develop methods for the
LEAP to perform atomic-scale analysis of bio-organic biotechnological specimens.
After adaptation, LEAP should be able to rapidly image 3-D structures at atomic
(0.2-0.5 nm) resolution, while providing quantum-level elemental composition of
synthetic polymers, proteins, and nucleic acids critical for biochips and other
biomacromolecular nanoengineered devices.

The primary commercial application of the technology and the product developed
in this project will be as a supplement to the existing analytical
instrumentation used for the determination of structure and composition of nano-
biotechnology devices and components. Additional applications are envisioned in
academic and industrial research in the areas of structural biology, cell
biology and pharmaceutics.
