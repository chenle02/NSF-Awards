The project will study and compare various methods to detect clusters or `hot
spots'. It will establish rigorous results about the average likelihood ratio
statistic, which has recently been claimed on empirical grounds to be superior
to the scan statistic. The investigator will derive guidelines for deciding when
one is preferable to the other. The project will also examine how various
approximation schemes affect the performance of the average likelihood ratio
statistic in terms of power and computational complexity.

The problem of detecting spatial clusters or `hot spots' has received
considerable attention in recent years, due to emerging important problems in
various areas such as biosurveillance, the detection of radioactive materials,
or the detection of illicit container shipments. Recent empirical findings
suggest that the statistic that is commonly used for these purposes is
suboptimal and can be improved upon by a different criterion. This project will
perform a rigorous mathematical investigation of this empirical finding and will
derive guidelines for deciding in which cases one methodology is preferrable to
the other.
