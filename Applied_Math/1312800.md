This project is devoted to a mathematical study of some nonlinear partial
differential equations in multi-dimensional conservation laws and related
applications. In particular, the study focuses on the following topics from the
theory of inviscid and viscous compressible flows and related applications: (a)
Mixed-type PDE problems for transonic flows past an obstacle. (b) Mixed-type PDE
problems for isometric embedding. (c) Existence and regularity of global
solutions to the compressible multi-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. (d)
Global solutions to the viscous flows of related applications in liquid
crystals. The goals of the research are: (a) To develop novel analytic methods
and efficient techniques for solving some important problems in multi-
dimensional inviscid and viscous conservation laws and applications. (b) To
explore the qualitative behavior of flow motion. (c) To establish new
connections of the isometric embedding problem with elastodynamics. (d) To gain
insights into other multi-dimensional problems of conservation laws and emerging
applications.

The aim of this research program is to develop new methods of analysis and
techniques for studying some nonlinear partial differential equations governing
the motion of compressible fluid flows and related applications. Compressible
fluids such as gases are important in nature. Their study is crucial for
understanding aerodynamics, atmospheric science, astrophysics, plasma physics,
biology, elastodynamics, etc. While the one-dimensional problems are rather well
understood, the general theory for the multi-dimensional case is mathematically
underdeveloped. The project will advance the mathematical understanding of the
multi-dimensional equations of compressible flows and related problems in
emerging applications, and will provide education and training to students in
this important field.
