Peracarids are an extremely large and diverse group of crustacean animals that
are found everywhere on Earth, from deserts to the deepest ocean trenches. The
most familiar peracarids are the terrestrial isopods, commonly known as roly
polies, that are frequently found under rocks or plant pots. There are deep sea
and freshwater versions of roly polies. They come in the most amazing body
shapes and sizes - peracarids do just about everything except fly. Despite being
found everywhere, very little is known about the relationships within
Peracarida, limiting understanding of how the group came to be so species-rich
and variable. The central goal of this project is to resolve the relationships
within Peracarida. At least 30 undergraduate students, three graduate students,
and a postdoctoral researcher will be trained in molecular laboratory
techniques, bioinformatics, peracarid taxonomy, identification and description
of new species, data management, and career development. Three workshops will be
held to train 31 graduate students and early career professionals in peracarid
systematics, collection, identification, preservation, bioinformatics, and data
management. Project outreach will include social media, outreach to schools in
diverse districts (Anchorage, Los Angeles, and western Alabama), museum
exhibits, and bilingual (Spanish/English) outreach in traditional broadcast
media and a short documentary film.

The central goal of this project is to provide a robust phylogenetic framework
for Peracarida based on broad taxon sampling. Currently, no such framework
exists, which impedes research into important questions raised by the extreme
diversity displayed across peracarid morphology, ecology, systematics and life
history. The project will use a target capture phylogenomic approach with probe
design informed by three new genomes and 50 new transcriptomes, as well as
publicly available transcriptomes and genomes. Biodiversity across the order
will be assessed using an integrative taxonomic approach combining DNA barcoding
of COI, 16S and 18S and traditional morphological approaches. Beyond the
immediate scope of the current proposal, this work is expected to catalyze
research across Peracarida by providing a phylogenetic framework and a
comprehensive set of phylogenomic tools specialized for Peracarida.

This project is jointly funded by the Division of Environmental Biology and the
Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).
