Richard Byrd and Robert Schnabel of U. Colorado, and Teresa Head-Gordon and
Silvia Crivelli of UC-Berkeley are supported by the Chemistry Divsion through
the Information Technology Research Initiative to develop a global optimization
package for protein structure prediction. Their approach combines optimization
research from numerical computation, energy-modeling research from computational
biophysics, and parallel computation research from computer science. Key
features of this research include a novel representation of the aqueous solvent,
incorporation of secondary structure prediction, and energy-smoothing models to
increase accuracy and efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The prediction of the
three-dimensional shape, or native state, of a protein given its sequence of
amino acids is one of the fundamental challenges of modern science. Protein
structure knowledge is fundamental in understanding protein function, and
important to many biomedical and biomaterial applications. This research will
result in advances in large-scale and parallel numerical computation, and models
and prediction methods for computational biophysics.
