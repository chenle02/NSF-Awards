The Division of Science and Mathematics is acquiring equipment for use by
undergraduates in the study of sedimentary processes, Quaternary deposits, the
fundamentals of laboratory analysis, and in an ongoing student research program.
The instruments are enabling curriculum changes to be made that promote the
understanding of sedimentary processes, and develop fundamental skills of
analytical techniques via a three stage curricular approach: introduction of
concepts and skills; skill development, and; application. Undergraduates
engaging in research are studying the origin and history of glacial deposits in
west central Minnesota using sediment and provenance analysis.***//
