The research supported by this award investigates the relationship between
transnational cultural movements and local culture and social structure. The
researcher will go beyond standard questions of cultural adaptation to ask if
and how introduced foreign cultural practices might be repurposed to ends
antithetical to the goals of the original introducers. This is an important
question for policy makers working across cultures who seek to produce short
term compliance, such as to facilitate disaster response, as well as for
scientific understanding of long-term socio-cultural
change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be undertaken by Brandeis
University doctoral student, Douglas Bafford, with the guidance of
anthropologist Dr. Janet Mcintosh. The research is to be conducted in South
Africa where religious forms and ideologies from the United States have been
introduced and refashioned for local political purposes. This history makes this
an ideal site for the project's overarching question: what happens when a
particular set of philosophies, practices, and moral stances is applied in a
starkly different cultural context? Data will be collected through extended
participant observation, semi-structured interviews, social network mapping and
analyses, and archival research. Findings from the research will contribute to
scientific understanding of social holism and globalization. In addition, this
project will train the student researcher in the methods required for a research
and teaching career in anthropology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
