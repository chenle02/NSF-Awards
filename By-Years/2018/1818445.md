This project will support attendance of young faculty, under-represented
minority scientists, PUI faculty, along with graduate students and post-docs at
the 2018 Cellular and Molecular Fungal Biological Gordon Research Seminar and
Conference to be held in Holderness, NH June 16-22, 2018. The meeting will
consist of short talks, poster sessions, communal dining, and conversations that
will provide ample opportunity for sharing latest research results and for
exploring collaborative possibilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fungi display an
incredible diversity of forms and functions; they are master recyclers of
nutrients in natural ecosystems, devastating pathogens of humans, animals, and
plant crops, and superb chassis for synthetic biology. The Broader Impacts of
this project involves both the importance of the topic to our understanding of
cellular and molecular biology as a whole, as well as the training of new
scientists to pursue research in this important and industrially relevant field.
Sessions will be developed to specifically provide opportunities for young
researchers to present and receive constructive feedback on their work. The
primary purposes of this conference are to promote discussion between scientists
with common professional interests, including those from non-research-intensive
colleges and universities, to facilitate the exchange of ideas across
disciplines, and to catalyze the pursuit of new scientific collaborations.
