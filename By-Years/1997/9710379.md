Simpson, Caroline AST 97-10379 Dr. Simpson will investigate the evolution of low
mass dwarf irregular galaxies. Radio observations of blue compact and low
surface brightness dwarf galaxies will be augmented by optical and infrared
observations of their stellar components. The new data will be combined with
data acquired previously to investigate whether these two types of dwarf systems
evolve sequentially or separately.
