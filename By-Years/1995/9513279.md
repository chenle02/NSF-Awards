9513279 Bradlow A U.S.-Brazil Workshop on Geometry, Topology, and Physics will
be supported to take place in Aguas de Lindoia, Brazil in 1996. There would be
several distinct special sessions and is expected to initiate an on-going
collaboration between the Institute of Mathematics, statistics and Computer
Science (IMECC) at the Universidade Estadual de Campinas, and the US
universities of Texas-Austin, Oklahoma Norman, and Illinois-Champaign-Urbana.
Led by Steven Bradlow at Illinois and W. A. Rodrigues at IMECC, a bilateral
committee of 7 will organize and run the week-long workshop. Both the Division
of International Programs and the Division of Mathematical Sciences contribute
to the support of the workshop. The quality of the participants, the isolated
locale for the workshop, and the focus on the interface between methods and
applications promise to stimulate new areas of research and new international
collaborations. Both recent graduates and renowned researchers are included in
the list of invitees, contributing to strength and continuity. ***
