Abstract 9705667 de Zafra Many atmospheric gases radiate energy in the
millimeter wavelength region of the radio spectrum, with each species have a
spectrum which is unique to it. The shape of each individual species' spectrum
provides information on the temperature and pressure of the gas; thus, one can
use the mm wave spectrum of the atmosphere to determine the relative abundances
and height distribution of a number of trace species. In this particular
investigation, mm spectroscope will be used to monitor ozone , carbon monoxide,
nitrous oxide, nitric acid, water vapor and nitrogen dioxide above South Pole,
Antarctica over the period of a year. Several of these gases play important
roles in the formation of the annual Antarctic ozone hole, while others,
particularly water vapor and carbon monoxide, can provide information of the
dynamics, particularly vertical transport, of the upper stratosphere and
mesosphere. ***
