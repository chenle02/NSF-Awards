In the physics and engineering of composite materials, it is natural to use
models based on partial differential equations with highly oscillatory
coefficients. The mathematical theory of homogenization was formed to answer the
large class of analytic questions that arise from studying such equations. The
general subject area has seen tremendous progress in the last ten years.
However, despite the many past advances, some basic and fundamental phenomena
still elude rigorous mathematical analysis. The principal investigator (PI) will
develop new techniques and new perspectives for some of these remaining
problems, with a focus on problems in statistical physics that can be viewed
through the lens of homogenization. This includes models of semiconductors,
fluid mixing, and droplet formation on rough surfaces. The project provides
research training opportunities for graduate students. The PI will apply
techniques from analysis and probability to study problems in statistical
physics. The main focus will be on the large scale behavior of solutions of
partial differential equations with highly oscillatory coefficients. This will
include heat and wave equations with random coefficients as well as their
lattice discretizations and related free boundary problems. Many of the proposed
projects are inspired by Anderson localization phenomena. Another unifying theme
is homogenization, where rough microscopic structure ?averages? over large
scales and gives rise to non-trivial smooth macroscopic effects. The primary
goal is to obtain both qualitative and quantitative estimates for the large-
scale behavior of solutions. The PI will utilize recent advances in
homogenization and large scale regularity theory in order to attack a number of
open problems. The primary areas of interest are Anderson localization, the
Abelian sandpile, particle models for fluids, the mixing of fluids, and droplet
formation.
