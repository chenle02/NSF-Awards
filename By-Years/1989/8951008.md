This award provides funds to the Department of Zoology at the University of
Washington for the purchase of 8 nearly identical computer stations for
physiological data acquisition and processing. These units will be used in a
variety of courses from elementary to advanced, as well as in undergraduate
research. The principal pedagogical goal is to enhance the technological
sophistication of students, and to inculcate an appreciation for a facility with
quantitative approaches both to original data and to its conceptual
interpretation. The Department appreciates the use of computers in a tutorial
context, in modelling, and in providing partial substitutes for experimental
work on live tissues. The programs available for these applications are growing
in number, variety and quality and the PI plans to make increasing use of them.
However, the main use of the instruments would be directly in the laboratory,
interfaced to a variety of recording devices and transducers for measuring
electrical activity of nerve and muscle, mechanical properties of muscle, gas
concentrations, temperature, etc.. Students would acquire the data, write them
to disk, and perform analyses that far exceed anything that can be taught with
present instrumentation. Students would thereby acquire a far richer
appreciation of the dynamic workings of living organisms as well as become
sophisticated in methodologies that have wide application in science generally.
