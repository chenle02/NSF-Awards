0323453 Dickson By combining biological diversity and materials science, the PIs
will simultaneously optimize our dendrimer-encapsulated nanodots and screen
peptide libraries to identify specific peptidesequences that bind and stabilize
Ag nanoclusters. Through genetic optimization of peptides that specifically bind
fluorescent Ag nanodots of different colors and characterizing their
photophysics, they will create very small, genetically programmed biolabels with
nearly ideal optical properties. The very strong Ag nanodot emission will enable
single molecule dynamics to be directly observable with weak mercury lamp
excitation to produce extremely high photon fluxes for several hours of
continuous illumination. Avoiding high excitation intensities and the
autofluorescent background currently limiting in vivo single molecule
experiments, both short time (sub-msec) and long time (hours) responses will be
characterizable with genetically encodable multicolored ultrabright labels.
Through these experiments, they will provide the foundation for utilizing these
important nanomaterials as probes of multiple single molecule dynamics within
living systems.
