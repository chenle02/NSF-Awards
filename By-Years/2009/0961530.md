This award provides start up funding for the establishment of a Research Data
Center in the Atlanta Metro area. Research Data Centers provide academic
researchers with secure access for research that uses confidential data from the
Census Bureau. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new RDC is housed in a secure site at
the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and is sponsored by a consortium of
institutions including Georgia State University, Emory University, Georgia
Institute of Technology, the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and the
University of Georgia. The Centers for Disease Control will also contribute to
the funding and management of the RDC. The center will be open to researchers
from anywhere in the United States; the location makes this RDC especially
attractive to researchers in a large multi-state area. This Research Data Center
will join a national network of Census RDCs. Each is operated by a hosting
academic institution and each provides secure access for qualified
researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A large and broad community of researchers
will use this RDC, including researchers in Economics, Public Health, Sociology,
Management, Demography, and Geography. The projects undertaken by these
researchers will provide a variety of broader impact, including improvements in
the Census Bureau's data programs and assistance to the CDC as it considers
whether or not to adopt the sample frame of the Census Bureau's confidential
American Community Survey for the National Immunization Survey.
