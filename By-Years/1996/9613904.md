Abstract 9613904 Chase and Jacobs Akron University This a GOALI "Industry on
Campus" project where Dr. K. Jacobs, an expert in bulk solids handling from Dow
Chemical Co. (Midland, MI) will team with Dr. G.G. Chase, a professor at the
University of Akron (OH), to teach and develop corresponding notes for a course
on solids processing. The course will cover areas of special interest to
particle sciences and industry, including gaseous suspension and liquid slurry
processing, and handling and storage of bulk powders. The industrial partner
will bring to the classroom phenomena and mechanisms of relevance to
applications, and analyze case studies of significance to chemical processing
industry. The visiting expert from industry has extensive industrial experience,
is internationally recognized for his expertise, and taught numerous courses on
particle technology. A unique feature of the proposed activity is the
preparation of a set of case studies showing how basic principles apply in
practice.
