The primary research interest is in the area of opertions research, especially
as applied to problems in the transportation/logistics area and in reginal
planning. In the area of operations research methodology, emphasis is on large-
scale nonlinear programming and variational inequality theory, a theory which
unifies the fields of mathematical optimization, complementarity theory, fixed
point theory, and the theory of partial differential equations. In the area of
transportation/logistics planning, the main areas of interst are in the
management of freight ransporation systems, especially railroad and intermodal
operations and the modelling of hazardous materials movements.
