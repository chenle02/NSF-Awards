This research provides for a systematic evaluation of the distribution and rates
of deformation at Merapi volcano over the next two years -- a period during
which a significant explosive eruption is considered likely. Deformation data
will be interpreted in correlation with conventional telemetered seismic data
obtained by the Volcanological Survey of Indonesia, and is expected to provide
fundamental new information on Merapi behavior. An acceleration in the rate of
edifice deformation preceding sector collapse, or of dome extension preceding
dome collapse and generation of nuees ardentes d'avalanche, should be
detectable, and may enable tests of the deformation and failure prediction
method of Voight (1988a). Thus, this research will enable use of Merapi as a
natural laboratory to both understand crucial volcano deformational processes,
and to test and refine deformation monitoring techniques.
