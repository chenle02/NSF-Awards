The purpose of this award is to support student travel to the Rocky Mountain
Summit on Quantum Information, which aims to bring together leading scientists
in the broad field of quantum information science. The focus of the workshop is
on quantum information theory, in particular quantum Shannon theory, as well as
quantum information methods employed in high energy physics and condensed matter
theory. This is an important emerging research area, with a growing strength in
US. The topic of focus is most closely related to Information Theory. A major
venue in Information Theory, IEEE Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT), also
supported by NSF, and this workshop are collocated, providing a unique
opportunity to the workshop attendees to benefit from the participation of
Information Theory community at large. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will
support travel for up to 15 students and postdoctoral scholars to this workshop,
focusing on those needing the support most and giving the priority to
underrepresented groups. The workshop is to be held at the University of
Colorado Boulder, from June 25 to June 29, 2018. Workshop website,
http://jila.colorado.edu/rmsqi, provides general information about the
workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
