Protein kinases are ubiquitous enzymes that qare frequently involved in signal
transduction processes. The major focus of the proposed work is to elucidate the
roles that protein kinases may play in photoregulated leaf development in
plants. A suite of partial cDNA clones from the garden pea have been sequenced
and found to encode protein serine/threonine kinase homologs. Messenger RNA
levels corresponding to the five cDNA clones accumulate differentially when pea
seedlings are exposed to white light. Experiments are proposed to understand the
photoregulated expression of these putative kinase genes at the RNA and protein
level. Full-length cDNA clones will be isolated and sequenced in order to
understand more fully the structure of the putative kinases. The photoreceptor
system(s) controlling mRNA accumulation and gene transcription will be
determined. The polypeptides encoded by the pea cDNA clones will be isolated
after expression in bacteria and used to generate antibodies. The antibodies
will be used to study the accumulation, distribution, and biochemical properties
of the protein kinases. Transgenic tobacco plants expressing the pea cDNAs will
be produced in order to understand the potential role these enzymes play in the
transduction of light signals.
