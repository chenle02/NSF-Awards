Funds are provided in partial support of an international, interdisciplinary
Workshop on Ice Sheet/Ocean/Atmosphere Interactions in Greenland. Core funding
of the workshop from U.S. CLIVAR has already been secured. The objective of the
workshop is to bring together observationalists, modelers and theoreticians from
the oceanographic, glaciological, meteorological and climate communities to
discuss the challenges and requirements for improving observations, and process
understanding and modeling of this problem. The prospective attendees include
U.S. scientists, funded by major US agencies (NASA, NSF, NOAA, DoE, ONR), and
international experts, who are studying processes in Greenland, adjacent ice
caps, similar Arctic environments (especially Alaskan tidewater glaciers), and
surrounding seas (especially Nordic Seas and subpolar North Atlantic). The major
meeting outcomes are envisioned to be:&lt;br/&gt;1. Advancement of the science,
improved coordination, and synergy of national and international
projects.&lt;br/&gt;2. Interaction and network building across disciplines for
all and especially students and&lt;br/&gt;early career scientists.&lt;br/&gt;3.
A document describing a prioritized set of recommendations to make progress on
this urgent and complex interdisciplinary problem, including a plan for a long-
term Greenland observing system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ice sheet-ocean-atmosphere
interactions in Greenland represent a new research frontier that is critical to
understanding the ice sheet?s evolution, its mass balance, and contributions to
global sea level rise. Recent observed changes in Greenland show that these
processes are important in the context of decadal-to-centennial climate
variability - time scales relevant to major infrastructure planning and design.
