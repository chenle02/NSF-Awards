The Maryland Science Center is producing a 40-minute large format film about the
discovery and scientific interpretation of dinosaurs based on fossil finds from
the Gobi Desert. The film will follow the summer 2004 expedition of the American
Museum of Natural History (AMNH) and the Mongolian Academy of Science led by
paleontologists Dr. Michael Novacek and Dr. Mark Norell. It will present the
scientific evidence for how we know what we know about dinosaurs and will
examine such questions as what types of dinosaurs roamed the Gobi, what their
environment was like, and what they tell us about the evolution of life on
Earth. Greg Andorfer will be Executive Producer. The film will be produced by
David Clark and co-directed by Clark and Bayley Silleck.
