A comprehensive analysis of data collected during one year in the Gulf of Maine
will be performed. Emphasis will be placed in the evolution of the density field
and its relation to the basin scale thermohaline circulation. Hydrographic,
nutrients, and oxygen data from five seansonal Gulf-wide surveys and time series
data from four mornings will be analyzed. Comparison with pre- vious data
collected within the Gulf of Maine should lead to a more complete understanding
of the oceanographic cycle in the Gulf of Maine.
