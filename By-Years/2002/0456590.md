Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0456590&lt;br/&gt;Principal
Investigator: Bo'az B. Klartag&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores
several challenging directions in the study&lt;br/&gt;of high dimensional convex
bodies. The unifying theme of the&lt;br/&gt;project is that high dimensionality,
when viewed correctly, may&lt;br/&gt;entail simplicity and order, rather than
enormous diversity which&lt;br/&gt;is impossible to control, the so-called
``curse of&lt;br/&gt;dimensionality''. In particular, the PI will address
the&lt;br/&gt;fundamental questions regarding distribution of mass in
high&lt;br/&gt;dimensions, the typical shape of lower-dimensional sections of
a&lt;br/&gt;given convex set, and the interplay between convex-
geometric&lt;br/&gt;inequalities and functional inequalities, mostly in the
category&lt;br/&gt;of logarithmically concave functions. While classical
convexity&lt;br/&gt;focuses on fine properties of bodies or shapes in a
fixed&lt;br/&gt;dimension, in the asymptotic theory one views the dimension
as&lt;br/&gt;being finite, yet tending to infinity. We aim at
bridging&lt;br/&gt;between these two disciplines, both by applying classical
tools&lt;br/&gt;to the study of asymptotic questions, and by drawing
corollaries&lt;br/&gt;of a classical flavor from asymptotic results. These
corollaries&lt;br/&gt;are often of an almost-isometric nature, not only
isomorphic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of high dimensional objects is common
to various&lt;br/&gt;scientific disciplines, including statistical mechanics,
the&lt;br/&gt;theory of machine learning and asymptotic combinatorics, to
name&lt;br/&gt;a few. Connections between these areas and asymptotic
convex&lt;br/&gt;geometry have already begun to emerge. A better understanding
of&lt;br/&gt;the high dimensional phenomena from the geometric viewpoint
has&lt;br/&gt;the potential to contribute to the development of
the&lt;br/&gt;aforementioned fields and to others&lt;br/&gt;
