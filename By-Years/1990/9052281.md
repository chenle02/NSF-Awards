This project modernizes and improves the program of energy conversion required
of all engineering technology majors. The equipment acquired includes electrical
power supplies and rotating machines with controls and an engine test cell
complete with printer and plotter. This equipment greatly enhances the teaching
of applied thermodynamics and rotating machines. The equipment also provides
opportunities for independent study activities. The award is being matched by an
equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
