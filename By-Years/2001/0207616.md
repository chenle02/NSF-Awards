&lt;br/&gt;Through the QUEST program, Central State University (CSU) will
enhance STEM access, student retention, curricula, undergraduate research,
transition to graduate school and faculty development positively impacting its
largely African - American student population. STEM student learning will be
improved by the adoption of a hybrid combination of the Learning Communities and
the Peer-Led Team-Learning systems. Student and faculty research opportunities
and student internship opportunities will significantly increase through
arrangements with partner institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Program activities
will impact more than 1000 on-campus students and 150 pre-college students
through bridge programs. QUEST efforts will result in a 60% increase in freshman
STEM enrollment, an increase in freshman retention from 63% to 70%, and STEM
graduation rates of at least 54 students per year above current rates, including
an additional 22 students per year graduating with GPAs of 3.0 or higher. CSU
STEM students in the graduate school pipeline will increase by a factor of 3
above current levels. The number of students engaged in research projects and
internships will increase by at least 20% per year.&lt;br/&gt;
