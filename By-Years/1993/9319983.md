9319983 Gorman This project will develop a course module that can be used in a
wide variety of classes to illustrate how environmental ethics can be integrated
into the invention and design process. The module will begin with a case study
of an inventor of solar heating systems who is motivated both by environmental
and market concerns. Students will then be given a chance to design their own
technology that meets the criteria of environmentally sustainable development;
they will have to evaluate their design both for its ecological soundness and
from a practical economic perspective, demonstrating how their technology could
be marketed. Afterwards, students will analyze and compare their own design
processes, focusing especially on the role of ethical concerns in making design
decisions. To determine its effectiveness, this module will be piloted and
evaluated in a special course on invention and design intended for students from
both engineering and the liberal arts. It will then be prepared for
dissemination to instructors nationwide. ***
