This is an individual award in the Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Plant
Biology Program for 1988. Dr. Coleman will conduct research on "Directed
Mutagenesis of the Quinone-Iron Binding Sites in the Photosynthetic Reaction
Center" in the laboratory of Dr. Douglas C. Youvan at M.I.T. This award provides
training in research in a critical area of plant biology to a promising young
scientist. It should help to contribute to the future vitality of the Nation's
scientific effort and lead to advances in the knowledge and understanding of the
basic biology of plant systems.
