This project is aimed at strengthening and modernizing academic preparation in
Electrical and Computer Engineering Technology. Employers have increased
academic hiring requirements commensurate with revolutionary developments and
growth of emerging computer related technology. Minorities who are expected to
account for a growing percentage of the workforce are grossly underrepresented
in technical occupations. This exemplar project employs a comprehensive strategy
to improve student mastery of engineering technology, heighten student academic
participation and achievement, emulate an industrial workplace environment, and
enhance academic and employment opportunities. Activities in two fundamentals
laboratories will be restructured to foster improvements in the mastery of
laboratory skills. Project activities include the design and development of
online instructional resources on the departments' local area network, computer
based data acquisition and analyses, and multimedia courseware for presentations
and lectures. Also included in the activities is an extensive evaluation
component and a national and regional program for dissemination of project
methodologies and results.
