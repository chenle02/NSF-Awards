We are undertaking a program to construct a world-class,
superthermal&lt;br/&gt;ultracold neutron (UCN) source at a low power,
university-based&lt;br/&gt;reactor. In the past five years, research groups at
Los Alamos National&lt;br/&gt;Laboratory and the National Institute of Standards
and Technology in the&lt;br/&gt;United States have made great strides in the
development of superthermal&lt;br/&gt;UCN sources, demonstrating convincingly
that the physics of these&lt;br/&gt;sources is understood. Orders of magnitude
improvement in available UCN&lt;br/&gt;densities with superthermal sources may
be within reach. The proposed&lt;br/&gt;source will be comparable in strength to
essentially all of the&lt;br/&gt;facilities currently being planned in the U.S.
and abroad, and&lt;br/&gt;considerably stronger than any presently operating
source. The&lt;br/&gt;collaboration comprises nuclear physicists involved in
fundamental&lt;br/&gt;symmetries research and nuclear engineers who specialize
in reactor cold&lt;br/&gt;source and moderator development. Research programs
using low-energy&lt;br/&gt;neutrons are driven by the proven usefulness of UCNs
for fundamental&lt;br/&gt;nuclear physics measurements, such as placing limits
on the static&lt;br/&gt;electric dipole moments of nucleons and the measurement
of the charged&lt;br/&gt;weak current form factors of the nucleon. These
measurements have&lt;br/&gt;impact on some of the deepest and most fundamental
questions confronted&lt;br/&gt;by physics today. With the increased UCN flux
available at superthermal&lt;br/&gt;sources, the development of new applications
for UCN as non-destructive&lt;br/&gt;probes of surface hydrogen layers and large
biological molecules may&lt;br/&gt;also be posssible.&lt;br/&gt;
