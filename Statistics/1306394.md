The investigator has two-fold purpose in this project both relate to cost-
effective methods of collecting high-efficiency data in Phase I, Phase II and
Phase III pharmaceutical trials involving drug discovery/drug abuse, heart-
related QT/QTc studies, evaluation of new drugs for unwanted effects and also in
experiments dealing with processing of minerals involving chemical reactions.
Akin to PK/PD models, one requires complex non-linear models in dealing with
medical/chemical/environmental studies. In this context, dwelling on Klimpels
floatation recovery model, chemical kinetic model and compartment model, the
investigator develops analytically sound and innovative techniques for
optimal/nearly optimal estimation of the underlying model parameters with
constrained experimental conditions.

The aim of this proposal is to provide research practitioners in fMRI studies,
medicine, and pharmacy with ready-to-use statistical/computational software for
carrying out cost-effective experiments. Research outcomes on compartment models
will allow formal rigorous inference and analysis based on clinical or
experimental data for complicated HIV dynamic models. Research practitioners in
fMRI studies, medicine, and pharmacy can save time and money by using the new
to-be-developed software-based crossover designs.
