&lt;br/&gt;ATM 0332269&lt;br/&gt;Extratropical Stratosphere and Tropical
Troposphere Interaction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A
series of numerical experiments with a troposphere-stratosphere model will
be&lt;br/&gt;undertaken to better understand the dynamical interactions between
the extratropical stratosphere and tropical troposphere during winter,
especially during sudden stratospheric warmings. Long simulations will be
performed to obtain reliable results. These dynamical connections are important
in understanding known modes of climate variability, and in assessing the
possible connections between stratospheric ozone depletion and tropospheric
climate. Both the effect of sudden stratospheric warmings on tropical climate
and the effect of tropical changes such as ENSO warm events on stratospheric
climate will be addressed. The roles of radiation and convection in these
processes will be addressed by comparing (GCM) general circulation model results
with results from a model with simplified physics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;These experiments will help interpret observed trends in
tropical and stratospheric climate, and may be important for assessing the
relative contributions of natural and human induced causes for these trends. The
work will be conducted by a post-doctoral researcher from Japan, and will
contribute to his training and to collaborations between Japanese and American
researchers. &lt;br/&gt;
