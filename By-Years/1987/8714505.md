This is an Expedited award. The purpose of this research is to produce an
Anatomical Atlas for the Blind. This research will, primarily, produce tactile
anatomical diagrams of sufficient clarity that a blind student will achieve a
vivid understanding of intricate structural details. In addition it will address
the issue of computer and automated technology to be used in the production of
graphic illustrations to produce detailed tactile diagrams that would permit the
blind to study anatomy. This research will give to the blind a new and important
avenue for intellectual development by opening up the field of anatomy; however,
it has much broader implications. It is very possible that this research will
initiate the development of computer means to produce tactile graphs from two
dimensional pictures. Thus, this research could initiate a whole new field of
technology which could permit three dimensional figures, which the blind and
non-blind could perceive, to be constructed from flat pictures, which are
completely unaccessible to the blind persons senses.
