This research involves (1) the development of procedures for consideration of
member inelastic stability effects in practical second-order inelastic analysis
of steel frame structures, (2) the consideration and characterization of various
methods for practical second-order inelastic analysis; (3) the investigation of
appropriate limit state provisions that would need to be satisfied for proper
design based on different methods of inelastic analysis, and (4) the definition
of flexible computer- aided design methodologies which will allow the engineer
to incorporate inelastic analysis in the process of proportioning steel frame
members and connections.
