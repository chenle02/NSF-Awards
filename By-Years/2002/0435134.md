In the ideal world, we would have Personal Information Management (PIM) tools
that would enable us to have the right information at the right time, in the
right place, in the right form, and of sufficient completeness and quality to
perform the current activity. However, significant challenges must be met if PIM
is to approach this ideal. Notwithstanding the importance of PIM, the field of
PIM research is currently fragmented. The NSF Workshop on Personal Information
Management will bring together participants selected to represent a range of
perspectives on PIM in order to assess PIM as a need and as a field of inquiry
with special focus on the ways in which computing technology can help. The
workshop will produce a detailed report outlining a roadmap for PIM research and
describing: (1) the current state of PIM as a practice and a field of research;
(2) major challenges that must be addressed if PIM is to improve and if the
field is to advance; (3) approaches that promise to meet these challenges and
specific suggestions on how these approaches can be nurtured, including PIM
education. The report will be widely disseminated and is expected to have a
major influence on the conceptualization of PIM and on the direction of PIM
research. Special care will be taken, in the selection of workshop participants
and in the content of the final report, to represent a diversity of user needs
including the needs of minorities, the economically disadvantaged, students, the
elderly and the disabled.&lt;br/&gt;
