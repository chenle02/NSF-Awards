The Burgers Program for Fluid Dynamics and the Center for Scientific Computation
and Mathematical Modeling at the University of Maryland and the Center for
Environmental and Applied Fluid Dynamics at Johns Hopkins University jointly
offer a School on Fluid Dynamics: Topics in Turbulence designed primarily for
advanced graduate students, i.e. students who have had an introductory course
and who would find it beneficial to go deeper into the subject. It will also be
beneficial to beginning post-doctoral researchers who have the need for further
instruction. Thirty-seven student and post-doc participants have accepted our
invitation to attend the School. Of these, 17 are from U. S. universities other
than Maryland and Johns Hopkins and 11 are from abroad. The program fills a need
since almost no universities in the United States, or even abroad, can afford to
offer graduate instruction in aspects of turbulence beyond introductory courses
of one or two semesters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The School will focus on recent
developments in the understanding of turbulence, its prediction and control
using modern experimental and analytical techniques and powerful numerical
simulation capabilities. Tutorials on turbulence theory, experimental and
simulation methods, turbulent transport in single and two phase flows and
applications of turbulence will be given by lecturers from the University of
Maryland, Johns Hopkins University and elsewhere. Ample open discussion time
will provide opportunities for student and faculty participants to have a rich
exchange of ideas. Afternoon experiential learning sessions will be conducted at
workstations and in laboratories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The turbulent motion of liquids and gases is a
ubiquitous phenomenon in nature and engineering. Such fluid motion is
fundamental to the formation of planets from interstellar clouds of
particulates, to the dynamics of the earth's atmosphere and oceans that
determine weather systems, to the mixing of reactants in combustion, to the
dispersion of pollutants from smokestacks and storm sewers, and to the health
risks caused by diseased arteries, to name but a few
examples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impact:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding and modeling the physics of turbulent
motion is the basis of predicting its effects in a wide variety of natural
occurrences important to human welfare and controlling it in engineering
applications such as the design of air and surface vehicles, efficient engines
for propulsion, heat exchangers and stents and heart valves.
