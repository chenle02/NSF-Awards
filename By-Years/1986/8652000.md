This Leadership Activities project is a joint venture of the Baltimore City
Public Schools and the Johns Hopkins University School of Continuing Studies.
The project involves 40 middle school and 10 high school teachers in activities
to increase the application of computer technology in the science classrooms of
the Baltimore City schools. It is an outgrowth of a successful pilot project
involving high school science teachers during 1986. The target population
contains a high percentage of minority and disadvantaged students. Two groups of
20 middle school science teachers will receive 12 days of instruction in
computer awareness, operating procedures, word processing, database and
spreadsheet use, software evaluation, labortory interfacing, programming, and
individual project development. Teachers will have ample opportunity to
"practice with feedback" and will receive follow-up coaching by a support
coordinator and leader teachers after the training program. Leadership training
will be provided to 10 high school and 10 middle school teachers who will
provide peer support in the school setting. In addition, 15 leader teachers will
develop a series of model science lessons that integrate computer technology
into the present curriculum during a five-week summer session. Project staff
from Johns Hopkins will also provide continuing assistance to the project
teachers. Formal associations of the teachers to continue the work of the
project will be established. Participants will be selected in pairs from middle
schools that feed the high schools involved in the pilot project. Criteria have
been established for the selection of the middle school trainees, the leader
teachers, and the curriuclum developers.
