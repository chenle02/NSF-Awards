Abstract

Award: DMS-0406314 Principal Investigator: Crichton L. Ogle

This award provides partial support for participant costs of a conference on the
"Geometry and Topology of Manifolds" at Ohio State University. The main themes
of the meeting are invariants of manifolds arising in square-integrable
cohomology, K-theory, and geometric group theory. Invited speakers and other
participants include a number of female mathematicians, recent PhDs, and
graduate students.

A manifold is a geometric space in which every point has neighborhoods that can
be identified with Euclidean space of some dimension. For example, every point
on the surface of a 2-dimensional sphere lies in an open hemisphere that can be
flattened onto the Euclidean plane by a map projection. An example of a higher
dimensional manifold would be the space of physical coordinates for three
particles moving in the plane without collisions: each particle's dynamical data
consists of two position and two velocity coordinates, thus each of the three
particles requires four numbers to record its dynamics and to report all three
moving particles simultaneously calls for twelve coordinates. "Invariants" of
manifolds are computable objects (not necessarily numbers) that help us tell one
space from another, and some of the known invariants can be constructed by
methods of calculus (such as square-integrable cohomology), algebraic tools
(K-theory), and by looking at very long-range behavior of the manifold or of
algebraic objects associated to it (geometric group theory).
