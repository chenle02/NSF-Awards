Partial funding will support purchase of a high temperature mechanical test
system with 1600 C capability and computer control. The equipment will support
research on the effects of microstructure and processing variables on the
mechanical properties of carbon-carbon composites, ceramic matrix composites,
and carbon-based alloys.
