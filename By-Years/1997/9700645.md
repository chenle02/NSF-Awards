The objective of this project is to produce a book on the history of field
biology in the United States between 1890 and 1940, focussing on the continuing
tensions between laboratory and field. In the 1890s and 1900s, field biologists,
spurred by their recent loss of status in comparison with physiologists and
morphologists, borrowed laboratory methods and applied them to field work. At
the same time they reasserted their belief that authentic knowledge of plant and
animal life could only be produced in nature. In its methods this project
extends the tools of environmental historians to the history of science.
Environmental historians know how to treat the varied ways in which humans
inhabit, use, change and understand the natural world. They restore to history a
powerful sense of natural places and their effects on human actions, but without
losing sight of `Nature` as a cultural representation. They study how people
know the natural world by making a living from it. These methods are ideally
suited to the history of field biology. Several specific topics will be treated
in the book. First, how did ecologists and evolutionary biologists devise ways
of experimenting in nature without losing the rigor and control that
experimentalists expect of authentic knowledge? Second, how did field biologists
invent the instrumentation (vivaria, field stations, biological farms) necessary
for their research? Finally, how was the work of these biologists shaped by
cultural factors, including the nature movements of the early 1900s and the
problematic cultural meaning of field work (which appears unscientific as it
takes place outside the clean, well-lighted laboratory). This project extends
the well-developed study of laboratory life and experiments to the less-studied
field sciences. It enriches the history of science and environmental history by
bringing them together. And it contributes to our understanding of the field
sciences as a cultural and social activity.
