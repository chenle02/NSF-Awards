Abstract

With advances of computing technology, scientific and engineering investigation
becomes increasingly complex. Powerful statistical techniques therefore are
needed to exploit data with complex structure. The proposed project will be
centered at design and analysis of inferential and prediction methods for
problems involving complex statistical modeling that arise in, for instance,
machine learning and data mining. The problems to be investigated include
inference about a modeling process to account for modeling uncertainty in a
modeling process, as well as prediction and inference in the contexts of multi-
class margin classification and semi-supervised learning. The specific aims of
the project, motivated by characteristics of complex modeling processes in our
targeted applications, are focused on (1) the development of a novel theory of
inference, as well as inferential procedures and computational tools, for
comparing complex modeling processes; (2) the development of multi-class margin
classification techniques; (3) the development of novel techniques for semi-
supervised learning; and (4) the specific development of techniques for the
targeted applications including object tracking, cancer genomics classification,
and text categorization. For the targeted applications, the PI will collaborate
with other scientists and engineers.

The proposed educational program will train graduate students for research in
statistics. Success of this project will bring tremendous benefits to
fundamental scientific and engineering research, particularly in automatic
machine processing to combine humans' intelligence with machine's speed, in
mining data with complex structure, and in biomedical research.
