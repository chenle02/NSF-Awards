A multi-dimensional effort to develop high tech engineering skills among current
and future workers has been initiated. This project, which is only one component
of a broad approach to workforce preparedness, develops a CIM lab that will link
the design, production, and inspection of machine parts, using industry-standard
equipment and processes. The CIM lab provides high-quality engineering education
to young and older students whose future job potential depends on high tech
skills.
