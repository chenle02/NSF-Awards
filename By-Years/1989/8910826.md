The goal of this project is to develop an algebraic computation system that
treats algebraic objects in a uniform manner. Users of this system will be able
to introduce new objects using straightforward syntax and determine the
properties of existing objects. There will be no distinction at the user level
between system and user introduced types. Moreover, dynamic type checking will
be the default, but static type resolution will be introduced in cases with no
semantic ambiguity. The system will be divided into separately compilable
modules. Collections of modules will form packages that follow a standard
interface protocol, easing the task of interfacing other code or constructing
special purpose systems from these packages. Transformations can be expressed
either as rewrite rules or procedures, and code written in either form will
coexist uniformly. The system evaluator will allow for the asynchronous parallel
processing of calculation sub-tasks. In particular, it will be possible to
distribute across workstations calculations with coarse- grained parallelism. An
electronic mail server will be extended to provide for the evaluation of
expressions as well as the distribution of documents and code.
