A researcher from Clark University has been funded to investigate the effects of
reduced sea ice cover - resulting from climate change - on the marine ecosystem
of the Bering Sea. The relationships between sea ice cover, polynyas, and
biological productivity will be investigated using satellite imaging of sea ice
and primary productivity. Satellite measurements of sea ice cover and melt dates
will be integrated with measurements of phytoplankton also measured by
satellites and validated on research cruises. The results will be used to
predict future impacts of climate warming on the productivity of the Bering Sea,
an ecosystem that supports Native subsistence harvests, over half of the United
States' commercial fisheries landings, and populations of endangered marine
birds and
mammals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
