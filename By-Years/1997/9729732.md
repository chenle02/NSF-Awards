This award is made under the high performance connections portion of NCRI's
"Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64. It provides partial
support for an OC-3 connection to enhance and accommodate research needs for
Drexel University by establishing a connection to the Very High Performance
Backbone Network Service (vBNS). The award, coupled with existing vBNS
initiatives at the University of Pennsylvania, will leverage resources and
facilitate research in the greater-Philadelphia region. Projects in this
proposal include: GRAPE-6 (research into areas of star cluster dynamics and
stellar dynamical simulations), Sources of Gravitational Radiation, Numerical
Modeling, Computational Astrophysics, DMS chemistry in the marine atmosphere,
Aerosol Characterization Experiment, Pacific Exploratory Mission, Advanced
Cluster Computing, and the Hospital University Business School (HUBS)
initiative. With this high performance network capability Drexel University will
expand current research and collaboration with both academic institutions and
federal laboratories. Collaborating institutions on this project, include:
Princeton University, University of Tokyo, University of Maryland, NCSA,
JPL/Caltech, University of Texas at Austin, Syracuse University, LSU, SDSC,
NASA/Goddard, University of Chicago, Argonne National Laboratory, Rensselear
Polytechnic Institute, University of Arizona, and the Office of Naval Research.
