Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project studies policy interventions that
alleviate the costs of firm market power and income inequality. This research is
motivated by the observation that firm profits and concentration in the United
States are at their highest levels in history, and income inequality is rising.
An important issue is understanding the effects of firm concentration and
profitability on wealth and income inequality. Firm market power generates an
efficiency-equity trade-off. Production efficiency requires that labor and
capital flow towards larger, more profitable firms. This in turn further
increases these firmsâ€™ profits and largely benefits wealthier individuals,
contributing to the wealth inequality. This project examines the effects of this
trade-off using granular data and models of market power and
inequality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this project evaluates the
consequences of product market interventions such as sales subsidies and taxes,
limits on firm size and markups, anti-trust enforcement, as well as profit and
income taxes aimed at reducing the distributional costs of markups. The project
employs a dynamic general equilibrium model parameterized to reproduce salient
facts about U.S. wealth and income inequality, as well as markups and product
market concentration. The research considers a variety of market structures,
including monopolistic and oligopolistic competition between heterogeneous
private businesses and corporate firms in the product market, as well as
monopsony power in the input market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
