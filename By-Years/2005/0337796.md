Supercritical water and carbon dioxide, the two principal volatiles in Earth's
mantle, affect most geochemical and geophysical processes. Despite the
importance of these fluids, few experimental data exist concerning their
properties in high-pressure, high-temperature environments. The purpose of this
research is to gather precise and accurate thermodynamic data on these two
fluids at pressures up to at least 10 GPa and temperatures of at least 900K. The
results will improve our understanding of a variety of mantle processes,
including the geochemical segregation of minerals, the formation of hotspot and
other volcanoes, and the Earth's carbon budget. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
