The Principal Investigators in this case, Drs. Gary Zank and Jim Spann, are
members of the organizing committee for the Thirteenth International Solar Wind
Conference ("Solar Wind 13"), being convened by the Center of Space Plasma and
Aeronomic Research (CSPAR) of the University of Alabama and the NASA Marshall
Space Flight Center in Huntsville.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Solar Wind 13
meeting will take place at Sheraton Keauhou Resort on the Big Island of Hawaii,
USA, from 17 to 22 June 2012, and it represents an important community
conference in the field of solar and heliospheric physics. Approximately 200 to
250 scientists and students typically attend these Solar Wind conferences, which
alternate between a US and a European location every 3 to 4 years. The Solar
Wind meetings have become a unique and valuable element of solar and space
physics research, being organized exclusively to address major problems and
progress in the fields of coronal and interplanetary space physics over the
preceding 3 to 4 years. These meetings and the scientific publications they
ultimately produce have had significant impact on many solar and space
scientists in the community today.
