This exploratory research proposal will use the novel technique of internal
multiple Bragg scattering to address the problem of phase determination of
structure factors of a quasi-crystal (QC). The QC is from the Al-Cu-Fe system.
The object of the multiple scattering technique is to relate changes in
intensity of x-ray reflections to relative phases of the structure factors
involved in the multiple scattering. The technique has been used for organic
crystals but has not been applied to QCs. The second part of the project deals
with absolute measurements of selected structure factors. This is an
indispensable step towards a complete determination of atomic locations. The
project will involve determination of the ratio of elastic scattering to
inelastic Compton scattering. If successful, the information so obtained would
then be used to distinguish between competing models of QCs.//
