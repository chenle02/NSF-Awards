This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and
evaluate a delivery platform for interactive rich media and effective
simulation-based e-learning. The platform will interface with learning content
authoring and management systems that are scaleable to commercial operation
without further development. Interoperability is achieved through verified
compliance with the Advanced Distributed Learning Initiatives Shareable Content
Object Reference Model, and the ability of the platform to directly admit and
reuse e-learning assets in all pervasive formats. Rich media is represented in
an object-oriented fashion that retains the identity of each media asset in
order to: (1) facilitate courseware maintenance and reuse; (2) allow refined
server bandwidth and storage utilization, and system scalability; (3) enable
data rights management of individual assets and diverse revenue models; (4)
render content as an interactive multimedia engagement that promotes attention
retention and the refinement of learner skills without the need for special
hardware; (5) tailor content to diverse client platforms, distribution channel
configurations, and the individual demographics, curriculum certification, and
physical handicap of the learner; and (6) enable client-side rendering of high-
definition content not possible to deliver pre-rendered over conventional
Internet access.

The proposed system enables learners to receive courseware of higher audiovisual
quality, greater interactivity, more refined personalization, and with greater
learner retention than that possible with current streaming technologies.
Interoperability with existing learning content management systems, and
scalability to large and diverse audiences strengthen commercialization
potential. Enabling technologies that rely on rich-media delivery, such as
collaborative visualization and distributed interactive simulation, are also
supported by the proposed object-oriented rich media representation.
