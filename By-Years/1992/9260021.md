Development of a novel optical imaging system for studies of the nervous system
is proposed. The concept is based on the use of acousto-optic tunable filters as
spectral selection elements in a confocal fluorescence microscope. In
conjunction with the use of multiply labeled specimens the proposed instrument
will permit investigation of neurochemistry-specific three-dimensional
architecture of nervous tissue. The rapid bandpass switching time of the
acousto-optic devices will permit dynamic studies to be performed on a time
scale commensurate with the electrical signaling of neurons.
