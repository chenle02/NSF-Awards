The Geophysical Fluid Dynamics (GFD) Program is a 10-week program of
interdisciplinary research and graduate training which has been held each summer
since 1959 at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. GFD promotes an exchange
of ideas among the many distinct fields that share an interest in the nonlinear
dynamics of rotating, stratified fluids. These fields include classical fluid
dynamics, physical oceanography, meteorology, astrophysics, planetary
atmospheres, geological fluid dynamics, hydromagnetics, and applied mathematics.
The topics for 2004-2008 will likely be selected from: Fine scales and fast
times, Flow in the Earth's interior, Boundary layers in the ocean and other
geophysical flows, Ice and Tides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
