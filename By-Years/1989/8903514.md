Dr. Cochran plans to continue his studies on concordance of links and on
invariants of manifolds of dimensions three and four. The linking phenomena he
is seeking would be indicative of new phenomena relating to the classification
of four-dimensional spaces. He will study invariants of three and four-
dimensional manifolds which have a differential-geometric interpretation and
have significance in the context of physics.
