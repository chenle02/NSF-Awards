This award provides support for the application of recent advances in high speed
imaging technology to confocal microscopy. The goal of the effort is the
development of a spinning disk confocal microscope with the combination of speed
and sensitivity required to enable imaging and tracking of individual
fluorescently labeled proteins rapidly diffusing in three dimensions. Optical
imaging of subcellular processes is a critical tool in cell biology, but rapid
dynamical processes involving small numbers of proteins are difficult or
impossible to visualize using existing instruments. The development effort faces
significant challenges for systems integration, image processing, and data
handling. Performance goals include the acquisition of high resolution confocal
images at up 1000 frames per second with fast z-scanning in order to allow for
full 3-dimensional image stacks at high rates. Integrated software and hardware
will be developed for imaging near the fundamental detection limits, and for
handling and processing the prodigious amounts of data to be generated. The
capabilities of the instrument will be tested by imaging previously unobservable
dynamics in cytoskeletal networks, growth and development of axons, and other
fundamental cell biological processes. As part of the effort, graduate students
and postdoctoral fellows will be trained in relevant aspects of instrument
development and software development.
