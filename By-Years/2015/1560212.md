This award supports the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site in
Physics &amp; Astronomy at Louisiana State University. The impact of this
program is fostering interest in careers in science by introducing students to
the nature of research-oriented careers in physics and astronomy and by
developing research-related skills and knowledge. REU students are recruited
nationally; students can be of any academic year and need not have a declared
major, but must have completed the general physics sequence at their school. For
the ten-week program, the participants are matched with faculty mentors based on
student interests. Students join their mentors in active research projects, such
as:&lt;br/&gt;- characterizing optical components for long-baseline
gravitational-wave interferometer detectors;&lt;br/&gt;- performing analysis on
data from the long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment T2K;&lt;br/&gt;-
simulating black hole mergers and supernova explosions; and&lt;br/&gt;-
investigating the magnetocaloric properties of new
materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weekly seminars and workshops introduce the
students to faculty research, to skills development, to common research
resources, and to professional development topics such as ethics and
patents/intellectual property. Students participate in field trips and other
activities, some of which are coordinated with concurrent LSU summer science
programs in computer science, biomedical science and other areas. Students from
all programs are lodged in proximity at on-campus apartment-style housing to
foster group interactions and a sense of community.
