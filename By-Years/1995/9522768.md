9522768 Mouring This is a planning award. IN 1993, the Committee of Marine
Structures concluded that research in advanced composites was strongly
recommended and crucial to the future competitiveness of the U.S. ship-building
industry. This project will investigate the feasibility of using advanced
composites in one such area, large surface ship hulls for both military and
commercial use. The knowledge gained would be useful to the construction
industry as well as the marine industry. ***
