The College of St. Scholastica proposes to develop, implement, and evaluate
TeachIT-CSP, a CS10K project designed to provide computer science education
professional development to high school teachers throughout the nation. This
project will adapt the Mobile Computer Science Principles (Mobile CSP)
curriculum developed by Trinity College and offer it to teachers via a summer
online course, complemented by ongoing online mentoring and support during the
school year. TeachIT-CSP will scale the Mobile CSP professional development to
reach at least 180 teachers over three years, and possibly many more. The
planned online format will be particularly helpful in allowing teachers from
rural and underfunded schools to participate in professional development and a
supportive learning community, as they achieve mastery of new teaching content
and methods. This project will prepare participants to teach the Computer
Science Principles (AP CSP) curriculum in their classrooms and provide support
to them in this process.

TeachIT-CSP goals include (1) bringing teacher professional development to scale
with an engaging and effective open online course that focuses on computer
science concepts using Mobile CSP curriculum, (2) providing pedagogical support
to help teachers incorporate best practices that improve student learning
outcomes in computer science and support underrepresented populations, and (3)
developing an open and sharable repository of video exemplars of computer
science teachers demonstrating evidence-based practices. The evaluation will
compare results between online and face-to-face PD focusing on the significant
areas identified by the Mobile CSP project and the CSP framework. The project
will evaluate teacher performance using videos and teacher reflections instead
of classroom observations. An external evaluator will adapt surveys for use with
teachers engaged in online PD.
