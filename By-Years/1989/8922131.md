This grant will provide support for graduate students and young facultywho do
not have alternative means of support to attend the Third IEEE Workshop on Micro
Electro Mechanical Systems, to be held at Nappa Valley, California, February
12-14, 1990. This workshop is the premier workshop of this emerging field, and
it has contributed to the rapid advance of the field. This support will enable
many young researchers who are just beginning research in the filed to attend.
It is important because the field is so new that researchers have yet to
establish funding that would enable them to attend the workshop without this
grant.
