The ten week summer REU program at Clemson University is intended to provide a
group of eight outstanding students with an opportunity to participate in highly
individualized bioengineering research activities. Although the program is
geared to undergraduate engineering students who may consider graduate training
in bioengineering, exceptional students from other pertinent physical and
biological science disciplines will be encouraged to enroll in the program, as
future bioengineers. The program is designed to provide the students with a
step-wise scenario of a mini-research project. This will entail: a) having basic
topical instructions pertinent to bioengineering; b) hands- on exercise in
literature search and outlining of plans for a research project; c) exposure to
general and specific laboratory techniques used in bioengineering research; d)
observing and taking part in the planned research activities, recognizing
important aspects of being a team member among research experimentalists, and
making on the spot decisions in the laboratory environment; and e) recording,
analyzing, presenting technical data, as well as making technical judgements on
results with supported conclusions. Program attributes and associated impact
include encouraging outstanding engineering and science undergraduate students
to pursue graduate training in bioengineering and preparing undergraduate
students who are to seek the job market with valuable research experience.
