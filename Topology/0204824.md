DMS-0204824 Takashi Kimura

The goal of this proposal is to investigate geometric constructions inspired by
the analogy between the moduli space of curves together with higher spin
structures and the moduli space of curves together with maps into orbifolds. The
former is related to higher KdV integrable hierarchies while the latter is
related to the quantum cohomology of orbifolds. We will analyze the resulting
algebraic structures suggested by integrable systems and the topology of these
spaces.

The KdV equation is a nonlinear equation modeling the behavior of water waves in
a straight channel and is the first of a hierarchy of equations whose solutions
are mutually compatible. Such hierarchies and their generalizations are
intimately related to surfaces endowed with additional fields possessing
internal symmetries. We will investigate this relationship and its
ramifications.
