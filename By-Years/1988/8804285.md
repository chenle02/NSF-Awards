This research addresses the problem of interorganizational coordination under
the uncertain conditions of disaster. The primary goal of the research is to
analyze the interactions of public managers with emergency responsibilities
during the October 1, 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake in order to identify
coordination and thereby increase the efficiency of emergency operations. The
research addresses three basic questions: (1) How do the content and exchange of
information affect the decision- making capacity of public managers engaged in
disaster operations? (2) What kinds of information are required by public
managers to coordinate actions of their respective organizations in a disaster
situation? and (3) In what ways can information content and exchange be
structured to maximize adaptive performance within and between organization in a
disaster environment? Sources of data will include interviews with officials and
archival data.
