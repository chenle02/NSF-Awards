Buckley In the general area of Source Localization Estimation (SLE), this
research will: 1. continue SLE algorithm performance evaluation(s); 2.
investigate algorithm improvements based on considerations of analytical
performance expressions derived during the course of this project; and 3.
address the combined issue of robust estimation and high resolution in the
presence modeling errors. In the area of acoustical/biomedical digital signal
processing, specifically hearing aids, effort will be directed towards the
specification of algorithm constraints and appropriate cost functions,
incorporating robustness and real- time testing both in the laboratory and in
the field. Adaptive methods will be examined for use in active noise
cancellation of undesired nonstationary noise.
