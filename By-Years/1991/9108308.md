The American Physical Society and the Physical Society of the Soviet Union
joined in supporting this cooperative program in physics. The U.S. physicists
will lecture at an International School of Physics planned for September 1991 in
Leningrad on the theme of "The Standard Model in High Energy Physics". This
funding will cover the travel expenses of the U.S. physicists; the Physical
Society of the Soviet Union will cover their living expenses while lecturing.
There will also be partial funding from UNESCO. The International Organizing
Board will select 30 young post-doctoral physicists for admission to the School
including a third to be nominated by the American Physical Society from
countries other than the U.S.S.R. This project fulfills the program objective of
advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in the United
States and the U.S.S.R. to combine comple- mentary efforts and capabilities in
areas of strong mutual interest and competence in the field of basic scientific
research on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
