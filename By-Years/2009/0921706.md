Aggression is found in a wide range of species. Reactive aggression is triggered
by a perceived threat to oneself or one's resources and accounts for high levels
of aggression across species. Maternal aggression (also called maternal defense)
is a powerful form of reactive aggression that is produced in the defense of
offspring. It is found in species ranging from humans to mice and is notable
because females can be peaceful and nurturing one moment and then fiercely
aggressive the next. An understanding of how fierce aggressive outbursts can
occur in an otherwise peaceful individual is still missing and maternal
aggression therefore provides an excellent model for understanding the
biological basis of this form of aggression. This project will examine the
neurobiological basis of maternal aggression and will focus on the
neurotransmitter neurotensin. This work is expected to provide novel insights
into the regulation of aggression because, until recently, no studies had linked
neurotensin to aggression. It is expected that the results from these studies
will determine where and how neurotensin acts in the brain to regulate maternal
aggression. Behavioral, pharmacological, and biochemical approaches will be used
in a mouse model system. Because this research examines aggression during
reproduction, another possible benefit is that the research will provide
insights into emotional changes that occur during the postpartum period. These
studies will provide training opportunities in neuroscience for undergraduate,
graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows. Underrepresented minority high
school and undergraduate students will participate in these projects as part of
programs that promote the involvement of underrepresented minorities in science.
The studies will also strengthen links within and outside the scientific
community and results from studies will be disseminated to a broad audience via
press releases and other media outlets.
