The ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Systems, Programming, Languages and Applications:
Software for Humanity (SPLASH) is a conference that brings together researchers
and practitioners in the intersection of programming languages and software
engineering. SPLASH, formerly known an OOPSLA, has had a long history beginning
in 1986. SPLASH 2017 will be held in Vancouver, Canada from October 22 -27,
2017. This year, the conference is organizing a mentoring workshop for
undergraduate and graduate students. This grant supports travel and attendance
at the workshop, also enabling attendance at the main
conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will attract a more diverse set of
undergraduates and junior graduate students to participate in the field, offer
practical advice about graduate study, give a perspective on where the field is
going, and help students navigate the SPLASH conference to gain as much from it
as possible. The overall goal is to create the needed pipeline of trained
researchers, academics with expertise in programming languages and software
engineering.
