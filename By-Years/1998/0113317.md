Title: ITR Award: Creating One to One Learning Opportunities across the
Internet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will study a new kind of "anytime" learning
system, based on one to one peer interactions shielded by and facilitated on the
Internet. Our pedagogical hypothesis is that students learn best when
continually challenged in a diverse environment. Matching students with
appropriate learning partners and curricular material can be done with today's
Internet technology and peer to peer software. Existing technologies from
machine learning and game theory - specifically those related to mediocrity as
an equilibrium phenomenon in self organizing systems - will be implemented as
practical technologies that can adapt automatically as students learn. The
technology is based on simple techniques to bring humans together to learn,
rather than domain-intensive knowledge-based tutoring of a single human, and can
work with the existing technology infrastructure of most public schools.
Internet multi-player gaming environments have been proven to scale to millions
of users, as well as having high intrinsic motivation. The research incorporates
fundamental research in Information Technology, sound experimental research on
motivation in multi-player games, and a novel and scaleable distributed
community for learning.&lt;br/&gt;
