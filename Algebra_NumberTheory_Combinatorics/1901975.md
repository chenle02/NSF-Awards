The award supports research in the field of algebraic geometry, the discipline
devoted to the study of polynomial or algebraic equations. Algebraic equations
are both beautiful and ubiquitous, as they describe many natural phenomena, from
the motion of planets to the shape of leaves and flowers, to the behavior of
microscopic particles. The goal of this research project is to study the deeper
properties of the solutions to more complicated algebraic equations (called
algebraic maps). The investigator plans to continue long-term investigation of
the topology, Hodge theory, and cycle theory of algebraic maps. The close
connection between the two main threads of the research, namely the discovery of
new and deep aspects of the general theory and the study of fundamental
examples, are the motivating principle behind the work. It is anticipated that
the results will be of use to mathematicians (in algebraic geometry,
combinatorics, and representation theory) and to mathematical physicists (in
string theory).

The investigator will explore the fundamental aspects of the general theory as
well as important examples through five projects: to determine the supports of
Hitchin fibrations in the case of the general linear group; to compactify the
moduli space of Higgs bundles on a curve for every reductive group; to initiate
a theory of perverse truncation and specialization with application to the
algebraic topology of Hitchin systems; to determine, via the Ngo support
theorem, the Betti and Hodge numbers of the only known remaining irreducible
symplectic manifold for which these are not known; to establish and explain
certain remarkable hidden symmetries on the cohomology of the moduli spaces of
Higgs bundles.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
