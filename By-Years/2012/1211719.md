The PI and his collaborators plan to collect and analyze data of white dwarfs in
star clusters in order to investigate two of the most important outstanding
issues in star formation: the amount of post-main-sequence mass loss as a
function of initial mass and the critical mass separating white dwarfs from Type
II supernovae. They will observe white dwarfs in star clusters in order to
control the variable of stellar age, and thus, stellar mass. The investigators
will conduct the work primarily using photometry from 4-m and 8-m class
telescopes. They will involve students from high school, Johns Hopkins
University and a postdoctoral research associate and generate a significant
educational and public outreach effort. The scientific results from this project
will be important to other fields within astrophysics, such as stellar
populations, interpretation of the mass-to-light ratio of galaxies, galactic
chemical evolution and stellar population synthesis modeling.
