9418771 Bodycomb This award supports a 12-month Japan Society for the Promotion
of Science Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Jeffrey Bodycomb, Department of
Materials Science and Engineering, Rutgers University, at the University of
Kyoto, Japan. Dr. Bodycomb will work with Dr. Takeji Hashimoto in the Division
of Polymer Chemistry, on a research project entitled, "Temperature Dependence of
Phase and Morphology Transitions of Diblock Copolymer/Homopolymer Blends." This
research will study the effect of temperature and homopolymer concentration on
the behavior of diblock copolymer/homopolymer blends. Such a study will be
important in driving theoretical work in this field, assessing the importance of
temperature in processing these materials, and confirming the usefulness of
temperature in controlling the structure of these materials. Dr. Hashimoto is a
world-leader in studying the behavior of block copolymer/homopolyner blends. At
Kyoto University Dr. Bodycomb will utilize state-of- the-art equipment including
a small-angle x-ray and TEM. ***
