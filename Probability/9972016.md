In this research project, the investigator plans to study second-order
stochastic parabolic equation in bounded domains. The traditional approach,
based on compatibility conditions, provides only partial results about
solvability and regularity of the solutions of such equations and often excludes
equations appearing in applications. The investigator's goal is to establish
solvability and regularity results for a wide class of linear and quasi-linear
parabolic equations without using compatibility conditions. To control the
solution near the boundary of the region, special Sobolev-type spaces with
weights are introduced. These spaces can also be of independent interest in the
classical theory of deterministic elliptic and parabolic equations.

Many natural phenomena are modeled by equations with randomness. The random, or
stochastic, component in the equation accounts for the uncertainties in the
model. Successful analysis of the real life models is impossible without a
rigorous mathematical theory of these stochastic equations. The aim of the
proposed research is a comprehensive study of a major class of such equations
using various probabilistic and analytical tools. Some of these tools have been
developed by the investigator and his colleagues and successfully used to study
the equation of optimal nonlinear filtering, the main equation used in target
tracking and target recognition. The results of the proposed research could be
used to develop better navigation and air traffic control systems.
