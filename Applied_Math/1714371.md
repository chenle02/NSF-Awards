Pattern formation is an orderly outcome of self-organization principles.
Morphological phases are complex geometric structures that form as structured
patterns in physical and biological systems. Examples include morphological
phases in block copolymers, animal coats, and skin pigmentation in cell
development. Common in these pattern-forming systems is that a deviation from
homogeneity has a strong positive feedback on its further increase. In addition,
pattern formation provides a longer ranging confinement of the locally self-
enhancing process. Studying pattern formation reveals the mechanical, optical,
electrical, ionic, barrier, and other properties of these systems. In this
project, the investigator studies morphological phases in biological and
physical systems having multiple constituents. Often these phases have been
observed in experiments where no current theory or models predict them. The
investigator aims for a rigorous analysis that not only predicts the existence
of these structures but also their particular properties. Morphological phases
are important in modern materials such as block copolymers, which are
commercially used as thermoplastic elastomers: wine bottle stoppers, outer
coverings for optical fibre cables, adhesives, bitumen modifiers, or in
artificial organ technology. Graduate and undergraduate students participate in
the work of the project.

The investigator studies morphological phases in physical and biological
systems. Systems of particular interest are the Ohta-Kawasaki, FitzHugh-Nagumo,
Gierer-Meinhardt, and tri- and tetrablock copolymers. Typically a morphological
phase consists of micro-domains separated by narrow interfaces. Often, narrow-
interface morphological phases can be approximated by their sharp interface
limits, where constituents are fully separated by interfaces with no thickness.
In the sharp interface case this project investigates assemblies of tori, Hopf
links, double bubbles, and triple bubbles. Analytical methods are developed to
use sharp interface morphological phases as skeletons to reconstruct
morphological phases with narrow interfaces. Through renormalization and an
infinite-dimensional reduction technique, where Coulomb forces are treated as
long-range interactions, free energies of lower-dimensional structures are
derived. Graduate and undergraduate students participate in the work of the
project.
