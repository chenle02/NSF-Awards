9633510 CAPONE N2 Fixation as a Source of New N in the Oligotrophic Tropical
Oceans This project will examine the importance of the nitrogen-fixing
cyanobacteria, Trichodesmium, in providing nitrogen to support biological
production in tropical oceans. Nitrogen (N2) fixing bacteria are intensively
studied worldwide, particularly in agricultural systems, reflecting their
importance as sources of fertilizer nitrogen. Trichodesmium, the best known
marine nitrogen fixer, is widely distributed throughout the tropical oceans, can
form massive blooms, and possesses a number of unique metabolic adaptations for
fixing nitrogen. Global nitrogen fixation by Trichodesmium may rival that in
agricultural systems. Recent evidence indicates that the rate of nitrogen
fixation by Trichodesmium has been severely underestimated, and this may account
for the severe imbalances in the nitrogen budgets of several tropical oceanic
biomes. This research will provide fundamental information on the physiology of
Trichodesmium, will quantify its importance in the global carbon and nitrogen
cycles, and will yield information to more accurately assess the biological
capacity of tropical oceans to take up atmospheric carbon dioxide.
