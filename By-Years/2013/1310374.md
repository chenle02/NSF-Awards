With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program, Prof. Janet
Morrow and her group at the University at Buffalo, State University of New York
are developing new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents that utilize
the biologically relevant metal ions, Fe(II), Co(II) and Ni(II). Coordination
complexes of these transition metal ions produce contrast through paramagnetic
chemical exchange saturation transfer (PARACEST). The primary goal is to design
PARACEST agents with exchangeable proton resonances shifted far from those of
bulk water (> 100 ppm) and to optimize exchange rate constants for enhanced
contrast. Second, the extensive coordination chemistry and accessibility of
different oxidation states of transition metal elements facilitates the design
of contrast agents that are responsive to biological environment. For example,
PARACEST agents that are switched on by a change in pH or redox potential will
be prepared. CEST NMR experiments and CEST MRI experiments on a 4.7 T scanner
will be conducted with the goal of developing imaging protocols for optimizing
contrast. Experiments for undergraduates and high school teachers and their
students will be developed to make the connection between magnetic properties of
metal ions and MR imaging.

MRI is a clinically important diagnostic procedure, with about half of MRI scans
using contrast agents in order to better image differences in tissue. The
development of contrast agents that switch on in tissue which has
characteristics of a disease state could be extremely useful for improved
diagnostics and treatment. The proposed research will focus on the development
of such switchable contrast agents that contain iron, cobalt or nickel. These
metal ions, especially iron, may be potentially safer than currently utilized
rare earth contrast agents because they may be metabolically recycled. This
project will develop the coordination chemistry and imaging protocols that are
necessary to tap into the significant and unexplored potential of these new
contrast agents for imaging applications.
