There are two themes to the proposed project. The first is the study of
A-infinity algebras that arise naturally in algebraic geometry. While originally
introduced in topological contexts, A-infinity algebras have proven essential in
the understanding of structures arising in both algebra and geometry, and the PI
proposes to study them from an algebraic-geometric point of view. Of particular
interest is the study of their Hochschild theory, which governs the way
A-infinity algebras deform. The second theme is the study of explicit examples
of numerical invariants, known as Pandharipande-Thomas invariants, which have
been recently introduced to understand counting-of-curves problems in geometric
and string-theoretic situation. The PI proposes to try to explain certain
unexpected coincidences observed by physicists between invariants of apparently
unrelated spaces.

Algebraic geometry, which is the geometric study of solutions of polynomial
equations, has seen in the last few years major developments, especially in
terms of its applications in other fields of science. Of particular importance
are applications to modern theoretical physics, in particular in string theory.
The present project will increase our general understanding of algebraic
structures that arisein algebraic geometry and physics.
