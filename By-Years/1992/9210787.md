Elasmobranch fishes (sharks, skates and rays) have an extremely sensitive and
specialized sensory system that is critical for the detection of weak electric
fields in their marine environments. This sense is used in finding prey and in
orientation. A significant problem is that the fish's own activities such as
swimming and respiration, stimulate these electroreceptors. Therefore,
mechanisms must exist within the brain for separating responses to important
external electric fields as distinct from this self-generated "noise". Previous
experiments from this laboratory have shown that such a process is accomplished
in the first stages of sensory information-processing in the hindbrain region. A
series of physiological and anatomical studies are being conducted to better
understand the mechanisms responsible for this noise- reduction process. In
general, separating signal information from noise is a problem that has broad
significance for understanding how all vertebrate sensory systems operate.
Therefore, the results obtained from these experiments are relevant for other
sensory systems in all vertebrates species, including humans.
