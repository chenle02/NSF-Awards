Dr. William J. Evans, Chemistry Department, University of Califonia-Irvine, is
supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
of the Chemistry Division to define and develop new types of chemistry and
chemical transformations which exploit the special properties of
organosamarium(II) and related complexes. The project's general purpose will be
to expand the limits of lanthanide chemistry and to develop new reaction and
reagents. By utilizing the tetrahedral reaction cavity which exists in
decamethylsamarocene, size selective hydrocarbon reactions such as C-H
metalations, C-C coupling and other novel reactions will be developed. Using the
reducing power of Sm(II), main group-carbon bonds with energies as high as 215
kJ/mol can be cleaved. This property will be utilized to produce unusual
compounds containing main group clusters. These studies will then be extended to
a variety of additional Sm(II) species in order to systematize the chemistry of
this oxidation state. Metal compounds are used to effect many chemical
transformations. While the importance of many metals has been well established,
there is a group, called the lanthanides, whose chemistry is not well developed,
even though tantalizing hints of important behaviors have emerged over the past
few years. In this project the ability of a series of samarium compounds to
activate hydrocarbons and to break bonds between carbon and other elements will
be assessed. This will contribute both to the overall understanding of the
lanthanide metals and to the discovery of new uses for samarium, which is an
inexpensive metal readily available in the United States.
