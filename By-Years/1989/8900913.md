This award will provide support for a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
Site at The Jackson Laboratory. Undergraduates selected from a nation-wide group
of applicants will conduct independent hands-on research for 9 weeks in the
summer under direct supervision of staff scientists. Working in their sponsors'
laboratories, the students conduct original basic research on problems in
mammalian genetics and development that are components of their sponsors' on-
going research programs. Students thereby gain experience in all aspects of
doing a research project from project design to reporting the results. Inbred
and mutant laboratory mice are utilized in many projects. All students are from
outside the host institution; historically, about half are from baccalaureate
colleges, and two-thirds have been women. Students with a wide range of science
preparation are accepted, with each participant's research project tailored to
his or her individual background and interests. Several follow-up activities are
in place to help maintain former students' interest in science and research.
Informal studies of program alumni indicate that a high percentage receive
doctoral degrees in the biological sciences or medicine.
