This award supports Dr. Gary Hachtel, the co-PI, Dr. Fabio Somenzi, and a
graduate student from the University of Colorado-Boulder in a collaboration with
Christopher Meinel of the Department of Information Technology at the University
of Trier. Both groups are working on the efficient representation and
manipulation of Boolean functions, primarily through the development of Ordered
Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDs). The German group has focused primarily on the
theoretical foundations of OBDDs and the connections between OBDDs and
complexity theory. The U.S. group has focused on the development of efficient
BDD manipulation techniques and their application to synthesis and formal
verification. The combined and complementary expertise of the groups promises
progress in the efficient implementation of Very Large-Scale Integrated (VLSI)
systems. The research is also of importance to current academic and commercial
interests in computer-aided instruction.
