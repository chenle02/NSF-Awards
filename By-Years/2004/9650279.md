The purpose of this project is to establish a mathematics technology laboratory
in which to teach and develop curricula for two newly designed and required
courses in the preservice middle school and elementary education majors. The two
courses, Foundations of Probability and Statistics for Teachers and Foundations
of Geometry for Teachers, are expected to serve 300 students each year and are
undergoing major curriculum development for technology-based laboratory
experiences. The technology laboratory is being equipped with Power Macintosh
8500 multimedia computers, together with appropriate software and Internet
access, for student use. The laboratory also contains the new TI-92 graphing and
symbolic algebra calculators, together with Calculator Based Laboratory units,
for `real` data collection and display. This state-of-the-art technology offers
opportunities for future teachers to experience learning mathematics through
cooperative problem solving on-line, collection and simulation of real data,
visualization and exploration of geometric and algebraic patterns, and
communication of concepts and strategies through written and verbal processes.
Since research indicates that people teach as they were taught, it is expected
that these mathematics experiences will influence methodology used in their own
classrooms. The technology also offers opportunities for instructors of these
courses to create new and revise existing mathematics curricula to reflect
student responses to laboratory activities. Dissemination efforts can proceed
through the mathematics experiences of these students and through presentations
at conferences and publications. Evaluation plans include concurrent assessment
of curricula, student attitudes, and student mathematical progress as the
technology laboratory is used, together with informal interactions with student
teachers and their cooperating teachers.
