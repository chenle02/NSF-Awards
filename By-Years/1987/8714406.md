This support is for operation of the Indiana University Cyclotron Facility and
for research in experimental nuclear physics for the 1988-1990 period. During
this time an electron-cooled storage ring (the Cooler) will be completed. The
Cooler will serve as a post accelerator for the existing cyclotron beam,
increasing the energy by a factor of 2.5, and providing beams with unusually
high energy resolution and readily variable energy. The research focuses on
studies of free and effective interactions in nuclei and of nuclear response
functions. Nuclear structure problems and nuclear reactions at high momentum
transfer and high excitation energy are also being investigated. Research in
accelerator physics is part of the Cooler development program. The Indiana
University Cyclotron Facility (IUCF) is a national facility for basic research
in intermediate energy nuclear physics.
