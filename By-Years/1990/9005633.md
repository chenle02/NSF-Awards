The state of the art in parallel programming is characterized by a wide variety
of process models, communication mechanisms, and patterns of sharing and
protection. Experience suggests that no single model of parallelism will suffice
in every case. Unfortunately, traditional operating systems tend to enforce a
single model by embedding it in the kernel. Overcoming this limitation is the
principal goal of the Psyche operating system. It is expected that Psyche will
allow each programmer to use the most appropriate model for the task at hand,
and will open up previously unavailable opportunities to use multiple models
within a single application. This research focuses on Psyche as a testbed for
multi-model parallel computing -- evaluating the extent to which the Psyche user
interface makes multi-model programming possible, and determining the sorts of
user-level tools, techniques, and conventions that are required to make it
practical. Building on an existing multiprocessor implementation of Psyche,
progressively more complicated user-level programs, beginning with coexisting
but independent models of parallelism and working up to system servers that can
interact with many kinds of clients, and applications that use more than one
model of parallelism internally will be used in experiments. In the later phases
of this work, expertise in our department's computer vision, robotics, and
planning groups will be drawn on for the construction of large, multi-model
reactive applications.
