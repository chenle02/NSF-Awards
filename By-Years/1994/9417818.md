Abstract ATM-9417818 Wake, Cameron University of New Hampshire Title: Ice Core
Records from Monsoon Asia The highlands of central Asia possess a diversity of
natural archives from which detailed paleoclimatic records can be developed
(e.g., lake sediments, loess, tree rings, ice cores, glacier fluctuations,
geomorphologic features). Despite this potential, relatively little is known
concerning climatic changes in the region over time scales ranging from
centuries to hundreds of thousands of years. The primary objective of this
project is to develop multi-variate, well-dated, high-resolution (annual)
paleoclimatic records for monsoon Asia for the last 500 to &gt;1000 years. This
project will focus on the chemical and physical analysis of deep (approximately
200m) firn/ice cores recovered from two high elevation (&gt;6000m) glaciers in
the Nepalese Himalaya. Time-series developed from the physical and chemical
analysis of the ice core will form the basis of a regional paleoclimatic record.
The proposed ice core research in monsoon Asia represents a key component of the
Himalayan Interdisciplinary Paleoclimate Project (HIPP). HIPP is aimed at
improving our understanding of the behavior of the Indian and Plateau monsoons
over the past 2000 years, 20,000 years, and beyond. Multi-variate paleoclimatic
records from a wide variety of natural archives in the highlands of Central
Asia. In addition, multivariate, high resolution ice core records from the
Himalayas will be compared directly with similar detailed ice core data records
recovered from Tibet, Peru, Greenland and Antarctica, thereby developing a
broader, more globally comprehensive ice core data base from which to
investigate global change.
