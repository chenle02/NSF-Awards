Transportation costs account for 15% of the U.S. Gross National Product. A major
element of transportation involves the management, routing and scheduling of
vehicle fleets such as the routing of school buses and the dispatching of trucks
delivering consumer goods, supplying fast food restaurants or just in time
delivery to industrial manufacturers. Progress on optimizing the utilization of
truck fleet operations can have very significant economic payoffs. Further
progress, however, depends on the development of new powerful combinatorial
optimization algorithms. This award will support research to develop and
validate such algorithms for several vehicle routing problems. The research
draws on recent methodological advances in Langragian relaxation, optimization
of travelling salesman problems and polynomical algorithms for certain graph
problems. The resulting models will be tested and validated on very large truck
fleet operations of several major corporations.
