This award is to fund acquisition of an ABI 310 automated DNA sequencer and a
Biolog microbial identification system to improve the capacity for environmental
microbiology research in Central Michigan. While the primary use of this
equipment will be for environmental microbiology research at CMA and Alma
College, a secondary but equally important use of this equipment will be for
research and teaching by additional CMU Biology faculty. The equipment will meet
the needs of a growing number of researchers utilizing molecular techniques.
Further, the instruments will be integrated into a number of courses that will
reach students at a wide range of levels in their academic preparation. Through
additional programs, including the Ronald E. McNair Post Baccalaureate
Achievement Program, students underrepresented in the sciences will continue to
be encouraged to participate in research projects utilizing the requested
instrumentation.
