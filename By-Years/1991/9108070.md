The genes at the W and S1 loci encode a tyrosine kinase receptor and its
ligand, respectively. W and S1 mutations cause defects in development of
primordial germ cells and later germ cells, as well as of hematopoietic cells
and melanocytes. Dr. Bachvarova has shown that c-kit (encoded at the W locus) is
expressed on the surface of oocytes from the stage of stored primordial oocytes
through oocyte growth, meiotic maturation, and in development to the 2-cell
stage. The principal aim here is to elucidate the role of c-kit in oocyte
growth, survival, development and/or adhesion. Expression of ligand in the ovary
will be examined by in situ hybridization, immunocytochemistry and functional
assays. These results may elucidate what function is involved. She will
determine whether functional c-kit is present on oocytes using an
immunoprecipitation and autophosphorylation assay. Using in vitro culture
systems, she will test whether addition of the ligand promotes aspects of oocyte
development. The effect of adding KL to oocytes cultured under suboptimal
conditions will be tested, as well as the effect of culture on cell lines
expressing transfected or genetically mutated forms of KL. Effects on oocytes
growth, survival, and time to undergo meiotic maturation will be examined. She
will also determine whether added KL can induce the initiation of oocyte growth
in vitro. Finally, she will determine whether blocking antibodies directed
against either ligand or receptor can inhibit these processes.
