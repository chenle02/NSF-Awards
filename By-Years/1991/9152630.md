Industrial applications of digital and computer controlled small, large and
fractional horsepower electronic motors have dramatically increased in the past
decade. Therefore, the need for well-trained technicians to implement and
maintain these high tech motor schemes is increasing dramatically. This project
will enable John Tyler Community College to purchase the laboratory equipment
necessary to implement successful training in industrial digital and computer
control of motors, the work horses of modern industry. The equipment requested
provides the students with a firm foundation in AC and DC motor theory,
operating characteristics, and control theory. Training in power semiconductor
control builds on this foundation. Modules equip the students with computer
control experience using programmable logic controllers and direct digital
computer control. This educational opportunity will enable graduates from the
Electronics and Instrumentation programs to make a significant contribution to
the industrial community.
