The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
project is to accelerate the digitization of the AEC (Architecture, Engineering
and Construction) industry, while democratizing the use of sustainable building
materials. The technology is a first-of-its-kind Computer Aided Design for
Manufacturing (CADfM) software. It enables architects to design for code
compliance, cost management, and environmental sustainability. The proposed
software will enable greater flexibility, lower cost, greater project speed,
wider product selection, and enhanced human creativity in design.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
project will enable architectural design-for-manufacturing. Current design
processes lack the pre-rationalization of manufacturing. To deliver sustainable,
economically efficient and high-density buildings, architects need tools to
quickly test design options in a data-rich space. Manufacturers need their
products digitally integrated into architects’ early designs, to prevent value-
engineering and rework. This software is uniquely built on a game engine, and
hosts a geometry kernel with smart building elements (façade, corridor, spaces,
etc.) aware of their type, purpose and adjacencies, permitting data
communication between assemblies and integration with data libraries for rapid
evaluation of potential design changes and estimation of associated costs and
effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
