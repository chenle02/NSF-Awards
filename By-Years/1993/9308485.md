9308485 Pugh Bis(rotaxane) monomers and polyrotaxane networks based on
oxyethylene repeat units will be synthesized. This is a new topology for both
monomers and polymer networks. Comparison of statistical and directed threading
under standard conditions, as well as under conditions which induce hydrophobic
and solvophobic interactions will provide a through study of the extent of
threading the bis(macrocrown ether)s to form monomers and polymer networks. The
extent of threaded vs. dangling macrocrown ethers will be determined from model
systems containing hydrolyzable crosslinks. Absolute molecular weight of the
linear polyrotaxane precursors and hydrolyzed products will be determined.
Previously undetermined solution properties of linear polyrotaxanes, including
size, shape and second virial coefficients, will be determined by micro-batch
light scattering measurements. The non-covalent nature of the bicyclic
crosslinks should provide the networks with maximum microscopic mobility, and at
the same time, maintain the macroscopic shape. This structural design should
therefore result in an amorphous network of low glass transition temperatures.
The polyrotaxane networks will be composed almost exclusively of oxyethylene
repeat units, which is the optimum chemical structure for ion mobility in
polymer electrolytes. The minimal topological constraints could potentially
result in polymer electrolytes with unusually high room temperature ionic
conductivities. Solid polymer electrolytes are of interest for chemical sensors
and devices, and for thin film battery applications, including expensive uses
such as laptop computers, pace makers and electric automobiles. ***
