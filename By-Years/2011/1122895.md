1122895 (Matthews). This symposium is being organized by the Student Chapter of
International Society for Industrial Ecology (ISIE) with mentoring from Dr. H.
Scott Matthews, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, CMU. The aim
is to encourage and financially support participation by students and post-
doctoral researchers in the symposium and the ISIE 2011 Conference immediately
preceding it. The theme isdealing with uncertainty in industrial ecology (IE).
An objective is to promote communication among graduate students and post-
doctoral researchers in industrial ecology (IE) about their research ideas and
experiences. Members of groups underrepresented in IE are especially encouraged
to apply for support. The symposium is an opportunity for students and young
professionals in IE to present their ongoing research, receive constructive
feedback from their peers, and network with senior professionals in their field.
In particular, the event will enable young professionals in the U.S. to
establish an international network of IE researchers for ongoing exchange and
future collaborations
