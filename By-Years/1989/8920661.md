This award will support a collaborative project in plasma physics between Dr.
Abraham Bers, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Professor J. L.
Delcroix, Laboratory for Plasma Physics, University of Paris XI. Studies of the
plasma state of matter, particularly over the past three decades, have evolved
into a new and important scientific and technological discipline, encompassing a
unified body of theoretical and experimental techniques for a wide range of
applications, such as gas lasers and the treatment of semiconductor surfaces. In
this project the investigators will incorporate past research efforts to produce
the basis for a new and comprehensive basic text in plasma physics for first-
year graduate students. The following topics will be addressed: 1) hierarchical
descrip- tions of micro-to macro-dynamics 2) collisional and kinetic transport
phenomena 3) waves in magnetized plasmas 4) instability theory and applications
5) nonlinear dynamics and 6) radiation. Both Dr. Bers and Professor Delcroix are
well recognized as contributors of long standing to the field of plasma physics.
This project will benefit from their joint expertise in both fully ionized and
weakly ionized plasmas.
