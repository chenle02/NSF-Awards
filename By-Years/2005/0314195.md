College&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SGER: Silver Bullets in Digital
Government&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal would conduct exploratory research
to help lay the foundation for systematically understanding critical success
factors for digital government research projects. Specifically, the PI proposes
to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Use a case study methodology, consistent with the
exploratory phase of this research, to select three digital government projects
that have succeeded beyond reasonable expectations.&lt;br/&gt;2. The success
criteria used with be 1) most striking results, 2) most generalizable, and 3)
willingness to the principals to participate in the research.&lt;br/&gt;3.
Prepare a case study for each project based on interviews with the principle
partners and stakeholders for the research project.&lt;br/&gt;4. Develop a
research proposal to extend this research to a broader set of
projects.&lt;br/&gt;
