The Joint Spring Topology and Dynamical Systems Conference will be hosted by
the Department of Mathematics at the University of Southwestern Louisiana from
April 10-12, 1997. This will be the 31st annual meeting of the former conference
and the eighth annual meeting of the latter conference. The conference will
cover topics in general topology, geometric topology, continuum theory,
topological algebra, and dynamical systems. There will be a mix of one-hour and
half-hour invited talks and contributed talks in these areas. This conference
has an established history as a large and successful topology conference that
covers a wide scope of traditional areas and has expanded to include important
areas of application such as dynamical systems. The integration of this area in
1986 was formalized in 1987 and has remained an important emphasis of the
conference.
