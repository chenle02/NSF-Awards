The goal of this project is to develop through a consensus-building process, one
or more models for technical and conceptual assistance to educators and
implementers of school networks. These models will be used by technology
planners and managers in many different settings to inform their decisions about
the use of computer- mediated communication in schools. To build credible and
effective models, participants in the process will examine underlying
assumptions about what school networks can and can't accomplish, and how
services can best be delivered to a broad national audience. Stakeholders from a
broad range of federal, professional, state and local educational communities
will deepen their understanding of issues and choices surrounding school
networking.
