Research will be undertaken on a number of problems in electronic many-body
theory, complexity and disordered systems. Topic to be studied include: high
temperature superconductors and related problems such as the Hubbard model in
one and two dimensions; disordered electronic and magnetic systems including
breakdown of Fermi liquid behavior in quenched random systems; physics of
complexity and problems of early evolution. %%% Electronic many-body theory as
usually practiced has been challenged by phenomena such as high temperature
superconductors in which usual /perturbative techniques haved been found
lacking. The complex interactions in these materials between magnetism,
disorder, superconductivity and metal-insulator transitions have led to the need
for new paradigms. The research proposed here will address the fundamdental
behavior of electrons in these highly usual systems. Addition work will be
devoted to the application of spin glass models to pre-biotic evolution.
