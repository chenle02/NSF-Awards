AMASSEDS (AMAzon Shelf SEDiment Study) is a large collaborative effort to study
the freshwater discharge of the Amazon River over the adjacent continental
shelf. Both geologists and chemists will work together with physical
oceanographers to address processes involved in the transport of sediment and
dissolved chemical species. The focus of this component will be on the water
structure, circulation, internal mixing, and bottom boundary-layer processes in
the frontal zone where strong gradients of salinity, density and suspended
sediment form. Shipboard hydrography and current measurements, a moored current
array, satellite-tracked drifters, and satellite AVHRR (Advanced Very High
Resolution Radiometer) data will be used.
