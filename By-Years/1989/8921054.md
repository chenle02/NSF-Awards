The redistribution of heat, momentum and moisture within the lowest one to
three kilometers of the atmosphere (boundary layer) is of importance for
understanding the evolution and nature of phenomena from local scale weather to
climate. There are gaps in our knowledge of exactly how the convective boundary
layer and the accompanying convective clouds redistribute these quantities in
the vertical. For atmospheric numerical models, it is important that boundary
layer processes be accurately parameterized. In an field expedition in 1985, the
Principal Investigator studied the nature of entrainment/detrainment in cumulus
clouds in the marine boundary layer in rainbands off the coast of Hawaii. The
Principal Investigator will extend her previous work will use the results to
test existing parameterizations of the marine boundary layer. Further, she also
plans to investigate suggestions emanating from recent studies that macroscopic
properties of the marine boundary layer are determined in part by cloud
condensation nuclei.//
