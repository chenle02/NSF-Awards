This project establishes an REU site at Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU) in
several areas of computer science research: computing foundations, human-
centered systems, information, intelligent systems and robotics, software, and
software engineering and systems. The site will engage 8 interns per summer for
10 weeks in the on-going research projects of TAMU computer science faculty.
Each intern will be mentored by a 3-person team consisting of one faculty
member, one graduate student, and one undergraduate ("peer mentoring"). In
addition to the formal research projects, the site will sponsor weekly seminars
on a number of research topics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will focus on
recruitment of interns from other TAMU campuses as well as HBCU's, with which
she has already established relations. Her TAMU campus already has a summer
undergraduate research program funded by the General Electric Foundation that
she will leverage with this REU award to increase the number of resident
interns-concomitant with an expansion of the TAMU CS faculty. Site activities
will include not only the research projects; interns will also receive coaching
in how to apply to graduate school. Organized group activities will help develop
a sense of community among the interns. &lt;br/&gt;
