Occurrences of closely related, terrestrial vertebrates at mid- latitudes in
North America and Asia suggest that Alaska was part of an intercontinental route
of overland dispersal and supported diverse faunas during the late Cretaceous.
Until recently the composition of these faunas was unknown. Discovery of
concentrations of dinosaur fossils on the Alaskan North Slope opens the
possibility for the first assessment of the composition of this Cretaceous
fauna. Field work in this area will allow thorough sampling of the vertebrate
fauna preserved in North Slope localities. Members of the U.S. Geological Survey
are investigating the invertebrate paleontology, paleobotany, tephrachronology,
and magnetostratigraphy of this geological section. Correlated with these and
other lines of investigation, the occurrences should yield information on the
tolerances of some dinosaurs to extremes in temperature and light conditions.
Most current hypotheses concerning dinosaurian extinction invoke either
catastrophic or gradual environmental change as a causal factor. Determination
of the probable ranges of environmental tolerance of Alaskan dinosaurs will
contribute to the evaluation of these hypotheses.
