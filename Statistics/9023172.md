The construction of appropriate estimators is complicated when data are sampled
according to complex rules, or when multiple measurements with different
inherent biases are available. This research will develop estimation procedures
for certain of these cases. Then their statistical properties will be
investigated when sampling is multistage, or when estimates are obtained by
combining biased and unbiased estimators. Constructions of admissible estimators
for spherically symmetric families will also be sought using extensions of
James-Stein procedures.
