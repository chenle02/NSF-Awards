In strategic situations, people, firms, or nations care about what others are
likely to do. Examples of such situations include bargaining, business decisions
which require coordinating various activities, or 'signaling games' in which the
actions people take signal something about their abilities or intentions. In the
last few decades, a large body of mathematical 'game theory' has developed about
how people will make choices in these situations. However, these theories
generally assume that people know or can figure out how other people in the
strategic situation are likely to behave. In fact, people usually figure out
what others are likely to do by learning from experience. Our project proposes a
general theory of how this learning occurs. The theory combines two very
different forces - 'reinforcement,' which means that successful strategies will
be repeated, and 'belief learning,' which means that players keep track of what
other people have done to figure out what those people will do in the future,
then they choose strategies which will give the biggest payoff if their guesses
are right. These different types of learning were thought to be different for
about 50 years. In earlier NSF-funded research, we discovered that the two
theories are actually special kinds of a single kind of learning, 'experience
weighted attraction' (EWA) learning. The current research proposes to extend the
EWA theory in three ways -- to incorporate the obvious fact that different
people may learn in different ways; to extend the theory to cases where people
aren't sure what the payoffs from different choices are (which is of course more
realistic); and to allow the possibility that people realize, as they learn
about what their opponents do, that their opponents are learning also. When the
extensions are incorporated we will have a very general theory of learning which
can explain the way people bargain, coordinate, and signal to each other changes
over time in response to experience.
