ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;0819073 AUI/NRAO, LO, K.Y. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;U.S.-China
Bilateral Workshop on Future Collaborations in Radio
Astronomy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is made to National Radio Astronomy
Observatory (NRAO) under the direction of Dr. Fred K. Lo, to organize a
bilateral workshop on radio astronomy April 21-25, 2008 in Beijing. The goal of
the workshop is to substantially strengthen the institutional and individual
research ties in radio astronomy and engineering. The counterpart organizers are
Dr. ZHAO, Gan, Deputy Director of the National Astronomical Observatory of China
(NAOC), and Dr. XUE, Suijian of the National Astronomical Observatories of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences, both in Beijing, China. Specific topics to be
covered include star and galaxy formation, the epoch of re-ionization and first
galaxies, pulsar observations, to test strong field General Relativity and to
detect gravitational wave radiation, compact objects and high-energy
astrophysics, as well as technical subjects relevant to future new telescopes.
The proposal includes two early-career scientists and one graduate
student&lt;br/&gt;
