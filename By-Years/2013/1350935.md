The evolution of reproductive isolation is central to both the process of how
new species arise and the origin of biodiversity on the planet. One important
criterion for classifying two organisms as separate species is their inability
to interbreed. However, little is known about the particular genes that prevent
different species from forming viable offspring. The goal of this research is to
identify the genes that cause hybrid sterility between two closely related
species of the model plant Mimulus (monkeyflowers), a genus of wildflowers
native to western North America. With innovative crossing designs and field
experiments, this work will determine which genes maintain species, as well as
characterize the molecular functions and evolutionary dynamics of these genes in
nature.

This project represents a significant contribution toward understanding the
molecular, genetic, and evolutionary mechanisms that underlie the origin of
species. This research will generate valuable plant collections and genome
sequence data that will add to the general utility of the Mimulus model system.
In addition, this proposal details a plan for engaging a broad audience in
evolutionary genetics research, including local high school teachers who will
develop hands-on Mimulus lab activities for use in their own classrooms. The
proposal also includes a plan to reform undergraduate biology education by
integrating research into the learning experiences of a diverse student
population. In collaboration with a team of education specialists, the principal
investigator will develop a Mimulus undergraduate research project for use in
the University of Georgia's large enrollment introductory biology course series
with the long-term goal of improving student learning and retention in the
sciences.
