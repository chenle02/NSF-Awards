A laboratory is being developed for teaching two concentration courses: Computer
Organization and Principles of Design for Large Systems. The laboratory consists
of a network of three NeXT workstations, with an additional workstation for
faculty development work. The new lab uses a combination of the C programming
language, with its low-level features, together with MC68040 assembly code in
the Computer Organization course. Simulators are used to work with microcoding
and I/O and interrupt facilities. The new equipment enables the use of UNIX
tools for controlling the development of large projects. In the Design course,
C++, which comes with the NeXT, is used to introduce and provide the facilities
of object-oriented programming in the design process. By having the workstations
connected via an ethernet, students are better able to coordinate their work for
large system design projects. A new course, Computer Modeling: A Tool for the
Mind is being developed. In this course, the computational speed and the
accessible user interface of the NeXT enables the non-science students to be
introduced to the important current applications of computer science such as
artificial intelligence, cognitive science, chaos theory, and, in general, the
"information processing" paradigm for thought.
