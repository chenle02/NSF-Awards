This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research in solar
physics between A. Gordon Emslie of the University of Alabama and Jean-Claude
Henoux of the Paris Observatory in Meudon. The objective of their research is to
modify and develop a conventional thick-target model of the solar flare. They
will investigate the flow of electric currents and plasma during solar flares
using the Polarimeter for Active Region Instability Studies (PARIS) telescope in
Meudon. PARIS data and soft X-ray line data from the Yohkoh satellite will be
compared. The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in the
computational studies of solar flares. This is complemented by the French
investigator's expertise in solar physics and his studies of electric current
generation. The project will advance understanding and knowledge of the
mechanisms of solar flares and the conditions leading to this phenomenon.
