The objective of the proposed research is the investigation, development,
optimization, manufacturing and testing of a completely novel class of actuators
and sensors for structural health monitoring (SHM). Periodic cellular
configurations are proposed as effective means to provide actuators and sensors
with strong, frequency dependent directional characteristics, which allow beam
steering to occur through a simple sweep of the excitation frequency. Beam
steering is achieved by exploiting interference phenomena generated by the
periodicity of the array and the simultaneous actuation of its components. Such
interference phenomena produce waves with frequency dependent directional
characteristics which allow scanning of an area or volume, as well as focusing
of the acoustic energy through a simple frequency sweep. This concept introduces
a paradigm shift in the design of actuators and sensors for ultrasonic and
guided wave inspection. Major reduction in hardware complexity will allow small
and micro packaging of sensors/actuators, whose application can be extended well
beyond the filed of SHM.
