Avigad and Danks will direct a three-week summer school in Logic and Formal
Epistemology at Carnegie Mellon University during the summers of 2009 and 2010.
The three-week program will draw approximately 30 talented undergraduates from
across the United States and abroad, in fields such as mathematics, computer
science, and philosophy, and expose them to topics in logic, causal and
statistical inference, formal veri fication, and decision theory.

The summer school will thus introduce students to important areas of research at
the interface between philosophy and the sciences, forge substantial connections
between a number of disciplines, and support the use of formal methods in
technology and the sciences. The program has been offered since the summer of
2006, and has been highly successful.
