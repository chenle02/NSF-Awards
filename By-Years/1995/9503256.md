9503256 Taylor This project will collaborate with French scientists to drill
coral terraces in the western tropical Pacific. Three sites will span the center
and southern margins of the Western Pacific Warm Pool, and will be drilled to
about 30,000 yr BP. Samples will be analyzed for stable isotopes, U, Sr and
radiocarbon. The project will address two objectives; (1) a record of warm pool
thermal stability at several scales of climate change ( with implications for
circum-Pacific climate) and (2) calibration of the radiocarbon age scale
(relevant to all science which depends on radiocarbon dating).
