Abstract CTS-0121053 M. Moskovits, UCSB

Partial travel support is requested for the U.S. academic speakers at the IBM
Almaden Laboratory workshop on "Grand Challenges of Nanotechnology" to be
organized on April 23-25 in San Jose, California. The main purpose of the
meeting is to develop a set of scientific and technological challenge issues for
the future development of nanotechnology. The deliberations and conclusions will
be made available to the scientific and engineering communities and to the
interested government agencies. The workshop will bring together leading senior
and young scientists from academe, industry and government from U.S. and several
invited leading experts from abroad. A group of young scientists will be invited
to participate at the workshop based on nominations received from the community
at large. The information collected at the meeting will help community to guide
the research in the most rewarding area, help industry and government agencies
in setting up their priorities. The IBM Journal or Research and Development will
publish a selected number of contributions. The speakers will address issues
related to the scope of various grand challenges and the way to solve them, the
role of technology, their implications, and the priority in funding future R&D
projects.
