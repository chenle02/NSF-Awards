The "subfactors" in the title arise in quantum physics as part of the
mathematical machinery needed to describe the universe compatibly with the
requirement that information can travel no faster than the speed of light.
Subfactors have numbers associated with them that can be used to parametrize
possible physical theories. One such parameter is known as the "statistical
dimension." It measures the complexity of what happens when particles in a
system are changed amongst one another. If space-time is low dimensional this
particle exchange is very subtle because particles have no room to go around
each other. This causes the numbers associated to subfactors to be useful, as
well, in the description of space-time itself. Such ideas are thought to provide
possible architectures for quantum computing.

The project will focus on the following three main areas, all related to
subfactors: (1) Advancing research in planar algebras. Bigelow's jellyfish
technique is a close cousin of the Yang-Baxter equation. Generaliztions of this
technique should allow one to push the classification of low-index subfactors to
index 6 and possibly beyond. (2) Low-dimensional quantum field theory.
Wassermann showed that the fusion operation in WZW conformal field theory can be
interpreted as the Connes fusion of bimodules over algebras of local
observables. This work will be extended most importantly by establishing the
existence of a manifestly unitary version of Segal conformal field theory. (3)
Continuum limits for arbitrary planar algebras. The principal investigator will
study the question: Do all subfactors come from conformal field theories? He
proposes a first naive approach to this question using the planar algebra
picture. Letting the boundary points on the circle become dense is the continuum
limit process in statistical mechanics.
