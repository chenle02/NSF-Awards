9803166 Mrowka This project will continue Mrowka's investigations into the study
of three- and four-dimensional manifolds (mathematical models for space-time).
These investigations center on relating properties of solutions and spaces of
solutions of the various equations of mathematical physics (primarily the Yang-
Mills and Sieberg-Witten equations) to the topology of the space-times that
carry the equations. This strategy has been very successful in the past twenty
years, as evidenced by work of Yau, Schoen, Taubes, Donaldson, and Uhlenbeck.
Mrowka hopes in joint work with Kronheimer to resolve a 30-year-old conjecture
about the topology of three-dimensional spaces known as the Property P
conjecture, an important step towards Poincare's conjecture that the simplest
model of a closed three-dimensional space-time is characterized by the property
that every closed loop is contractible to a point without leaving the space-
time. ***
