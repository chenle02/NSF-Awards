0334982&lt;br/&gt;Radic&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A complex physical process that
combines degenerate and non-degenerate four-photon mixing describes two- and
three-pump interaction in highly nonlinear optical fibers. High confinement
architectures with two- and three pumps will be investigated in order to develop
a new, unifying theory and practice of parametric fiber processors. Parametric
fiber processors provide a set of fundamentally new functions that include
banded signal manipulation and conjugation, rate-independent regeneration,
switching and amplification. The feasibility of qualitatively new types of
broadband wavelength converters with tuning speeds that are independent of
tuning distance will be studied using this new technology. The proposed work
will explore fundamental limits of multiple-pump interactions in highly
nonlinear fibers and their impacts on both device and system performance.
General multiple-pump design rules will be outlined for the first time. The
physics of modulation instability coupling in imperfect high-confinement fiber
will be studied and used to devise mitigation procedures for practical
processing devices. Two- and three-pump interactions in birefringent,
dispersion-fluctuating and dissimilar fiber constructs will be investigated both
theoretically and experimentally. Generalized methods for Brillouin suppression
and unimpaired idler generation will be investigated using both passive and
active methods. The use of practical fiber parametric processors will be studied
both in conventional, phase-independent and coherent communication links. The
feasibility of all-optical ring architecture utilizing banded wavelength
conversion and transport penalty reversal will be investigated using a two-pump
fiber parametric device. Performance of bit-level switching in fiber parametric
processor will be explored with newly developed theoretical and experimental
tools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
