The generation of alternative fuels, particularly from non-edible feedstocks
such as cellulose has become a topic of great national interest in recent years.
The focus of this effort has been primarily on conversion of cellulose to useful
products or intermediates. However, for the biorefinery concept to achieve its
full potential it will be essential for new separation paradigms/processes to
emerge. Decomposition of cellulose typically leads to a complex mixture of
highly oxygenated compounds that are not thermally stable and quite hydrophilic.
The PI hypothesizes that organic-inorganic nanocomposite membranes offer one
route to achieve these separations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To test this
hypothesis the PI will explore key separations that will facilitate
processing/conversion of cellulose into usable chemical feedstocks: 1. Selective
separation of low molecular weight components (e.g. pentoses/hexoses) from
residual solids formed in cellulose hydrolysis via microfiltration. 2.
Separations of low molecular weight (e.g. acetic acid) components from model
bio-oils obtained from pyrolysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Separations of bio-oils
and cellulose hydrolysis mixtures have been sparingly studied, yet these types
of separations are essential to advancing towards the goal of a biorefinery to
reduce the nation's dependency on oil.
