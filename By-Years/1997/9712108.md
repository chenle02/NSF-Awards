Many commercial database products and application tools are beginning to support
data replication to provide ready access to data in distributed, mobile, and
disconnected environments. Most of these systems have chosen to use asynchronous
replication schemes in which updates to replicas are not synchronized. Although
these schemes perform reasonably well for single object updates (i.e.,
environments such as file-systems), they are not suitable when a single update
involves multiple objects (i.e., transactional environments). This project
investigates the benefits of using synchronous and asynchronous broadcast
mechanisms for managing replicated databases. Broadcast primitives, viz.,
reliable broadcast, causal broadcast, and atomic broadcast, will be used to
design new protocols for synchronous replication. In synchronous replication,
transactions accessing replicated data are synchronized with other transactions
in the system. In asynchronous replication, transactions execute locally and
other means are used to disseminate their effects globally as well as to detect
and correct inconsistencies. The epidemic model of communication will be used as
the transport mechanism here. Pessimistic as well as optimistic replication
protocols will be developed to maintain replicas asynchronously. Finally, a
simulation framework will be developed to evaluate the protocols for synchronous
and asynchronous replication.
