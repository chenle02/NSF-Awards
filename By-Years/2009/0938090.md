This research investigates the ways that citizens and policy makers attend to
stimulus funds under the Recovery Act of 2009. The research develops new methods
to estimate the impact of stimulus funds on the perceptions of citizens and the
choices of local community decision makers. The project leverages another
research design that is preparing to go into the field. That project draws a
sample of citizens and public officials across matched communities and builds a
panel. The research added here will increase the size of the panel of subjects,
changes how often we return to the communities and allows us to study
expectations for stimulus spending and, subsequently, the short-term impact of
stimulus spending under the Recovery Act of 2009.

Substantial research will debate the economic effects of the Recovery Act of
2009. The social and political aspects of the influx of money into government
institutions will be less understood. This research will enable us to understand
how citizen trust in government is related to stimulus spending and the actions
of public officials. This relates to broader questions of citizen confidence in
democratic institutions.
