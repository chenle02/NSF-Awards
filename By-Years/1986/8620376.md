The project is to study problems associated with the scattering of acoustic
waves. The two basic problems are (1) the direct problem, where one attempts to
predict the wave structure based on a knowledge of the source and the medium
through which the wave passes and (2) the inverse problem, where one attempts to
characterize the source or scattering obstacle or properties of the medium based
on a knowledge of the wave structure. Both of these questions are examined.
