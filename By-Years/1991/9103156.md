Professors Powers and Pimsner will study aspects of the theory of C*-algebras
and von Neumann algebras. Professor Powers' work will concern continuous one
parameter semigroups of *-endomorphisms of C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras
with particular emphasis on the von Neumann algebra of all bounded operators on
a Hilbert space. Professor Pimsner will study the K-theory of operator algebras,
especially that of group C*-algebras of crossed products by certain classes of
groups. The notion of a C* algebra is an abstraction of the idea of a family of
linear transformations on a space. These transformations can also be thought of
as having values in the states of the space, and the property of this family
which is responsible for the symbol * is that the algebra is generated by
transformations whose values in these states are real numbers. The fact that
these objects appear naturally in many branches of mathematics and physics makes
them important to study.
