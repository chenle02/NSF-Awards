Phosphorus losses from many oligotrophic forests are extremely low due to a
high level of biological control over P cycling within the forest floor.
Mineralized phosphorus is quickly taken up by roots and microorganisms,
preventing its leaching from the rooting zone or its fixation by mobil aluminum.
As a student of Dr. Vogt, Mr. David Publicover will examine the role of
ectomycorrhizae in the cycling and conservation of P within the forest floor of
an upland pitch pine forest in the New Jersey Pine Barrens. He hypothesizes that
mycorrhizal tissue acts as an important storage reservoir for P released by
decomposition outside of the main growing season. This storage minimizes
formation of insoluble P- Al compounds and leaching of P in organometallic-
phosphate complexes. Monthly sampling is used to determine seasonal patterns of
P and Al storage and movement. Sampling includes measurement of plant biomass
accumulation, root and mycorrhizal productivity and turnover, input to and
leaching from soil horizons, and P and Al fractions in soil horizons. Primary
factors controlling P leaching from the rooting zone will be determined.
Experimental manipulations undertaken to investigate specific aspects of P
conservation include: removal of ericaceous plants, augmentation and removal of
litterfall, P fertilization, and augmentation of available Al. This work on P
conservation mechanisms in the root and mychorrhizal system addresses important
issues in the area of forest management and conservation. This information will
help in the preservation of both temperate and tropical forest ecosystems. Dr.
Vogt is a very experienced and productive scientist who is well qualified to
direct the doctoral research of David Publicover. Mr. Publicover is also highly
qualified with experience in forestry, forestry management, forest research and
instruction. The School of Forestry and Environmental Studies at Yale University
has exceptional resources for supporting this research effort.
