This is an observational project devoted to measuring stellar and disk
properties for a hundred young multiple star systems using high-resolution
spectroscopy and imaging techniques at infrared wavelengths, mainly using Keck
Observatory. She will use the data to determine effective temperatures, radial
velocities, rotation rates and surface gravities of stars, as well as accretion
rates and magnetic fields associated with surrounding disk material. The data
will be used to test models of binary formation and angular momentum
distribution of planetary systems and circumstellar disks.

Broader impacts include training a postdoctoral researcher, and updating a
website with a database on visual binary stars for the community. The PI also
plans to continue giving astronomy presentations to local senior centers.
