SF Proposal 0204248 Type Refinements Frank Pfenning and Robert Harper An
important aspect of software development and maintenance is to understand
properties of a complete system, its individual components, and how they
interact. There is a wide range of properties of interest, some concerned only
with the input/output behavior of functions, others concerned with concurrency
or real-time requirements of processes. Upon examining the techniques for
formally specifying, understanding, and verifying program behavior available
today, one notices that they are almost bi-polar. On the one extreme we find
work on proving the correctness of programs, on the other we find type systems
for programming languages. Both of these have clear shortcomings: program
proving is very expensive, time-consuming, and often infeasible, while present
type systems support only minimal consistency properties of programs. The
proposed research is intended to help bridge this gap by designing and
implementing more refined type systems that allow rich classes of program
properties to be expressed, yet still be automatically verified. Through
careful, logically motivated design the research combines the best ideas from
abstract interpretation, automated program analysis, type theory, and
verification.
