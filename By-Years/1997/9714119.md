A new, state-of-the-art 600 MHz NMR spectrometer and an upgrade for an existing
500 MHz spectrometer is requested for shared use by six major users or major
user groups at the Department of Biochemistry at Tufts University School of
Medicine and the Department of Medicine at The New England Medical Center. The
new instrument and the upgrade will be incorporated into the existing biological
NMR facility at Tufts University School of Medicine and will be located in the
Department of Biochemistry. The major user groups are currently working on
eleven NIH or NSF sponsored projects that require modern NMR instrumentation.
The new instrument and the upgrade are therefore needed for application in a
wide range of basic biological and biomedical research. The projects include:
(i) Structural analysis of the domain from SV40 T antigen that bind to the
origin DNA replication, including structure determination of the protein origin
DNA complex. (ii) Structure and mechanism studies of serine proteinases. This
includes work on the type A hepatitis virus 3C proteinase and the glutamic acid
specific proteinase from S. griseus. (iii) Development of improved NMR
sensitivity through electron-nuclear cross polarization. (iv) Structural
analysis and characterization of synthetic crosslinkers of T cell surface
receptors. (v) Structural analysis of papillomavirus E2 protein and its complex
with DNA. (vi) Structural analysis of human papillomavirus inhibitor proteins.
(vii) Structural analysis of SH2 domains and other signal transducing elements.
(viii) Structural analysis of blood coagulation proteins and their interaction
with phospholipids. (ix) Structural analysis of cellular adhesion domains. (x)
Structural analysis of the extracellular domain of the thrombin receptor. (xi)
Structural analysis of an anti-DNA antibody.
