This conference will be devoted to the study of a variety of topics in geometric
and combinatorial group theory, with special emphasis on asymptotic and
probabilistic methods and their applications. More specifically, this includes:
group actions, quasi-isometries, isoperimetric functions, growth, asymptotic
invariants, random walks, algorithmic problems, etc.

Applications will be emphasized, especially those concerning complexity theory
and information security, in particular theoretical cryptography. Cryptographic
protocols have become a key element of information systems, protecting data and
communications to ensure confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of data.
While most symmetric key systems have relatively modest mathematical
requirements, asymmetric or public key cryptosystems have become increasingly
mathematically sophisticated, and, in particular, the emerging ``non-commutative
cryptography" exploits various properties of non-commutative infinite groups in
very non-trivial ways. Building a solid mathematical foundation for the use of
infinite groups in cryptography inevitably involves operating with various
asymptotic and statistical aspects of infinite groups, and this is where modern
group theory finds its important applications. More information an be found on
