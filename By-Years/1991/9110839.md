Parallel computation has the potential for accelerating the solution of
combinatorial search problems. Universal randomized methods, with provably
effective speed-up, have already been developed for parallel backtrack search
and parallel branch-and-bound computation. Also previously developed was a
paradigm for parallelizing the sequential alpha-beta pruning algorithm and its
variants for evaluating game trees. This project continues work on the theory of
parallel search algorithms, with the following objectives. First, the
performance of the randomized methods will be analyzed for hypercube and
butterfly networks. This analysis will demonstrate the effectiveness of the
algorithms in practice. Second, network routing methods in which messages are
issued periodically and asynchronously will be studied, since these methods
provide a mechanism for implementing backtrack search on networks. Third, a new
type of probabilistic performance analysis, competitive analysis, will be
applied to parallel algorithms. Finally, experimental work on the proposed
algorithms will provide insight for the theoretical investigations.
