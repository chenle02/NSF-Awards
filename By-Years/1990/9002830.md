This grant is primarily for graduate students travel to the Gordon Research
Conference, entitled "Modelling in Solar TerrestriaL Physics." which will be
held at the Plymouth State College, in Plymouth New Hampshire on July 30th
through August 3rd, 1990. This conference on the physical and mathematical basis
for the various modelling efforts underway is very timely. By inviting
atmospheric scientists to describe and review the methods used in their already
successful modelling efforts, the conference has the potential of simulating
rapid progress in the task of unifying fast microscale phenomena with slower
macroscale phenomena in computational models of geospace. This conference will
provide an excellent forum for informal exchange between space and atmosphere
physicists that will enhance greatly our understanding of the issues and
processes involved. ***//
