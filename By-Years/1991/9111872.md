Work concerned with excited negative ions and with Rydberg states of neutral
molecules is continued with the objective of clarifying issues raised in recent
work, and pursuing some new avenues in studies of He2- vibrational
autodetachment, and predissociation product distributions from Rydberg states of
diatomic and triatomic molecules. In addition, the first studies of the
predissociation of molecular ion Rydberg states will be carried out using high-
resolution techniques. The work will yield important properties and decay
pathways of these states, and new information on the electron capture processes
by which the Rydberg states are produced.
