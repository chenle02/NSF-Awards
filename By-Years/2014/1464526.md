Bierman&lt;br/&gt;1464526 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will support 1.5-day
workshop to held fall 2014 on the campus of UC-Irvine that will bring together
experts that use Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) to determine the abundances
AMS of cosmogenic nuclides 10Be and 26Al for application to geomorphic processes
research. The workshop will focus on the possible use of new generation, lower
voltage, highly automated, and far less costly AMS systems than have been
traditionally used in the U.S. to date. It is envisioned that lower cost, low
voltage (1 MeV) AMS systems will allow for high throughput cosmogenic nuclide
analysis at modest cost enabling hundreds of measurements that can be used to
characterize the probability distribution of isotope concentrations ? allowing
greatly enhanced reliability for dating moraines, for isochron burial dating of
sediments, and for tracing sediment across the landscape.
