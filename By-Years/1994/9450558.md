9450558 Walker The Marine and Aquatic Mini-Camp For Female Secondary Students is
a series of several-day, field-based, inquiry-focused, hands-on educational
experiences designed to modify an existing, successful program at the Gulf Coast
Research Laboratory to meet the specific needs of a population of secondary, at-
risk-for-science female students. The Principal Investigators believe that the
proposed effort will contribute to a realistic change in the academic and
professional ambitions of participating students, thus enhancing their
scientific literacy and career aspirations. A more specific goal is for the
participants to continue their formal science education through enrollment or
re-enrollment in high school science courses. The residential programs will be
composed of four major conceptual sections: oceanography and hydrologic
processes; marine and aquatic biology-fauna; marine and aquatic biology-flora;
and, beach and barrier islands. The effort will build upon an established
relationship with local schools to ensure selection of students who could most
benefit, as well who could be tracked over time. Selected students from the same
school would attend at the same time. Schools are in northwest Florida, Alabama,
Mississippi, and Louisiana. ***
