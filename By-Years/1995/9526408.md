9526408 Tubbesing This award renews support for the Earthquake Engineering
Research Institute's Learning From Earthquakes Project (LFE). The primary
purpose of the LFE Project is to observe and document the effects of earthquakes
on the built environment and the resulting social, economic and policy impacts.
Over the years the project has led to considerable new knowledge and changes in
practice and has stimulated important research in each of the disciplines
involved in earthquake loss reduction. This award will underwrite field
research, report preparation and the dissemination of lessons learned. ***
