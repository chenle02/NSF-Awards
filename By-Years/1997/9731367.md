9731367 Oberem This project, sponsored by the California State University at San
Marcos, will carry out a three-year project to teach teachers of high school
physics an inquiry approach to learning of basic physics concepts. The basis of
the project will be to use the University of Washington's Physic by Inquiry
approach supplemented by Real-time Physics and the CPU (Constructing Physics
Understanding) program. Each summer 36 teachers will be enrolled in a three-week
program. During the academic year project staff will aid in the implementation
of the program by electronic communication and by biweekly seminars. Specially
selected, experienced master teachers will mentor the participants and aid in
the delivery of the program. In addition pre-service teachers will be selected
to help with the project so that they will enter the teaching profession with
background in teaching using the inquiry approach. A full evaluation program
will assess teacher knowledge, the change in how the teacher teaches physics and
student achievement.
