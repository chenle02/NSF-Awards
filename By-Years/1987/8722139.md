The goal of this work is to build upon and implement a recently begun theory of
the cognitive processes of expert software engineers. Specifically the principal
investigator will address the issue of how designers are able to mentally
simulate designs- in-process during the early stages of the design process when
the design is only vaguely specified. The work has implications for design
theory and methodology; the principal investigator expects that it will be
useful in understanding, supporting, and automating the design process. The
model of the software designer will be implemented using cognitive modelling
techniques; but the implementation will be built on Soar, a new production
system architecture. This is a novel combination of methodologies that will
generate theoretical and applied issues of interest to engineering, systems
architecture, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science. This award is made
