This investigation is based primarily on the analysis of existing energetic
particle observations from detectors on IMP-8, ISEE-1, ISEE/3/ICE spacecraft in
the interplanetary medium near Earth, and from detectors on the Voyager deep
space probes. Specific studies to be undertaken include: 1. Solar Flare Particle
Acceleration. Sensors on IMP, ISEE, Helios, and Voyager spacecraft have
collected data that will be combined to construct particle spectral forms over
~2.5 decades of energy to test spectral predictions of acceleration models. 2.
Interplanetary Shock Accleration. Energetic particle, plasma and field data from
the ISEE/ICE and Voyager spacecraft will be used to probe the sites and
mechanisms of particle accleration by (a) examining the role, if any, of shock
acceleration in solar particle event decay phases, (b) constructing broad energy
spectra for heavy nuclei in co- rotating interaction regions observed at both 1
and 4 AU, (c) searching for electron acceleration at both quasi- parallel and
quasi-perpendicular shocks, and (d) examining water group ion spectra over a
broad velocity range for the 1985 observations near comet Giacobini-Zinner. 3.
Particle Transport. Data from several spacecraft will be used to (a) study the
transport of 10-20 MeV protons over different radial distances from the sun, (b)
investigate the relation between sunward anisotropies of ~1 MeV/nucleon
particles in solar flare event decay phases with topological features of the
interplanetary magnetic field, and (c) test simple models of particle scattering
using energetic particle, field, and plasma observations near interplanetary
shocks.
