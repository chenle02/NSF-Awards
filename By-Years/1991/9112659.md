The process by which candidates for the presidency are selected is central to
the relationship between the American people and their leaders. Yet, although
the behavior of voters in the general election has been studied extensively,
research concerning the behavior of candidates in the primaries is embryonic.
This research attempts to correct this neglect by developing and testing a
dynamic, process model of presidential nomination campaigns. Specifically, a
model is proposed of the relationship between candidates' resource decisions
across the primary campaign, the results of the primaries, and the candidates'
success. The model will be tested using data on candidate spending and election
outcomes during the past six and the 1992 presidential primary campaigns.
Interviews with the candidates in 1992 will provide a further test of the
model's validity. When completed this ambitious research should greatly increase
our understanding of presidential campaigns. The results should be of
significance in helping to evaluate reform proposals to alter presidential
primaries by creating regional or national primaries or by altering public
financing.
