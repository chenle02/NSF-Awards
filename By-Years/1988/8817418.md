This research program centers on the mechanisms of enhanced mechanical strength
and modulus in superlattices of the transition metal nitride type. Growth,
chemistry, structure, and mechanical properties are measured as functions of the
processing variables, which include composition modulation, layer perfection,
wavelength, and crystallographic orientation. Initial research is limited to the
titanium nitride/vanadium- niobium nitride system. Variations in lattice
mismatch are accomplished through control of layer compositions.
