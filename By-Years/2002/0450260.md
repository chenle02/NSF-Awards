Arrangements of genes along the chromosomes are often conserved after hundreds
of millions of years of divergence in vertebrates, but comparisons of the
Arabidopsis sequence to partial gene orders of other angiosperms (flowering
plants) sharing more recent common ancestry have yielded conflicting results.
This difference may be due largely to the propensity of angiosperms for
chromosomal duplication and subsequent 'diploidization', evolutionary mechanisms
with profound consequences for comparative biology. This project will advance
knowledge of the ~200-million year course of angiosperm evolution, tracking
changes in gene repertoire and organization that contribute to plant
biodiversity. Better understanding of the history of angiosperm duplication will
be of importance both by improving basic knowledge of botanical diversity, and
also in using burgeoning genomic information from botanical models in the
improvement of many leading crop plants that have large genomes which are
difficult to study and therefore less-well characterized. Key deliverables
include information about gene repertoire and arrangement that adds new
dimensions to angiosperm comparative biology, and will be web-available in
formats readily used by others. This project provides training opportunities at
both pre- and postgraduate levels. The research and education infrastructure
will be improved by Web-based dissemination of deliverables valuable to present
and future US and international initiatives. Together with a NSF GK-12 program
at UGA, this project will develop and implement new research-based educational
materials, with specific focus on biodiversity. Materials developed with the
GK-12 program will be suitable for broad dissemination to enhance scientific
understanding by the public, directly and via museums, nature centers, and
similar institutions. This research is closely tied to strong outreach programs
with a successful history of engaging under-represented groups.
