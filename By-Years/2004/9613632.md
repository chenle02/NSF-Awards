Abstract - Enrique Iglesia CTS-9613632 Environmental impact during processing
of fuels and their precursors can be reduced via efficient utilization of
hydrogen. This critical component of many petroleum processing operations is
used nonselectively in reactions such as isomerization (those that involve
hydrogen-transfer steps), dehydrocyclization, desulfurization and hydrotreatment
in general. A limit to the selectivity of current catalysts used for those
reactions is the insufficient knowledge about catalytic sites requirements. This
proposal formulates a study of cationic sites exchanged into pentasil zeolites,
in terms of structure, spectroscopy, and catalytic reactions, as means of
characterization. The author has produced related work in recent projects, and
successfully demonstrated the use of the techniques to be exploited in this
project. The structure of exchanged cations will be determined by X ray
absorption spectroscopy. The H-transfer and disposal by those sites will be
examined using kinetic and H-D exchange reactions and in-situ infrared
spectroscopy. Coupled dehydrogenation-hydrogenation reactions will be enhanced
by addition of hydrogen scavengers such as O2, CO2, CnHx, etc., and the role
that such coupling has on alkane dehydrogenation selectivity will be determined.
Sulfur-containing compounds will be explored as hydrogen acceptors for
activation of alkanes, and the hypothesis will be tested that more efficient
hydrodesulfurization of such compounds is possible by means of coupled hydrogen
transfer. Infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed thiophenic compounds on Lewis acid
sites in ZSM5 in the presence of light alkanes or H2, isotopic exchange and
chemical test reactions with sulfur-containing molecules will also be part of
this study.
