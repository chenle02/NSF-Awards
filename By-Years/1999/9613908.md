This award is made under the high performance connections portion of NCRI's
"Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64. It provides partial
support for an OC-3 connection to the Chicago NAP and to Fermilab for two years.
Among the numerous applications are those involving distributed high performance
computing, remote visualization, gigabit imaging, network-based collaboration,
simulations and modeling in astronomy and astrophysics, and advanced digital
video. Collaborating sites include Argonne National Laboratory and Fermi
National Accelerator Laboratory.
