9550020 Prigo The Continuous Assessment in Science Project's main goal is to
pilot and evaluate a model of professional development aimed at advancing
teacher's skills in conducting everyday assessment of students and improving
their science content knowledge. It is hoped that through this model teachers
will build an understanding of continuous assessment: its position in the
context of documenting and reporting student growth; and its match with the use
of hands-on, inquiry-based approaches for developing scientific concepts,
processes and dispositions. The elementary school teachers are expected to
develop strategies for conducting such everyday assessment of student learning
that are integrated and compatible with instructional activities and classroom
management. The project will begin by working closely with twelve teachers to
plan, practice, document and evaluate strategies for continuous assessment and
the professional development necessary for preparing teachers to use them.
During the second year the project will work with working a larger number of
teachers to evaluate the model. During the final year of the project an action
guide will be published to support the dissemination of the model through
Vermont's SSI project. The cost sharing will be 18 percent of the NSF portion.
