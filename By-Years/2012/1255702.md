The objective of this research is to create a new failure-resistant architecture
for high-speed digital links to enable the next generation of high-performance
communication and computing systems. The failure-resistant architecture is based
on maximum a posteriori (MAP) detection and overcomes not only challenging
channel impairments, but also deterministic impairments incurred in the
interface and timing circuitry. The system-level protection given by MAP
detection offers new opportunities in the design of power-efficient analog-to-
digital converters (ADCs) and timing generation based on seas of digital gates
that exploit the variations and errors in unreliable, deeply scaled devices. The
MAP detector itself is enhanced using an iterative, soft message-passing
algorithm to unleash its full throughput potential while providing tolerance
against underlying circuit failures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new link
techniques developed in this research will improve both the computing capability
and the energy efficiency of large data centers needed for cloud computing. The
techniques also impact personal and mobile computing by delivering more
efficient serial links such as the next-generation universal serial bus (USB).
The interdisciplinary nature of this project encourages a tight integration of
mixed-signal circuits, digital circuits and signal processing research and
provides excellent training to students through research and industry
internships.
