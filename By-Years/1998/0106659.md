Hervig&lt;br/&gt;0106659&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The isotopes of boron have been
shown to fractionate from one another as boron is lost from a silicate melt into
coexisting water vapor. Work funded by this proposal will measure the amount of
boron isotope fractionation between melts and a variety of fluids for melts of
basaltic, andesitic, and granitic composition. Fluids will be water or carbon
dioxide, or mixtures thereof. A range of temperatures will be studied to mimic
natural conditions. The evolution of silicate melts (magmas) during generation,
transport, and cooling (either at the surface of the earth or below) generally
involves (at one stage or another) the formation of a fluid phase. The
experimental data on boron fractionation proposed here will allow the
application of a new stable isotope system to unraveling the history of silicate
melts. A specific application is to magmas formed along volcanic arcs. Study of
these samples can help constrain the varying contribution of the subducting slab
to the source regions of these melts, and can clarify the effects of degassing
during the ascent of magmas. &lt;br/&gt;
