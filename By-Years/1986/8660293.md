This is an SBIR proposal on Pulse Engergy Fabrication of surface composites. The
proposed study is on a novel and cost-effective method for fabrication of metal-
matrix composites, rapid solidified coatings, ceramic phase dispersions and
amorphous phases. The PI proposes in phase I, evaluation of five generic
processing capabilities involving bonding surface alloying, surface finishing,
coating densification, and direct fabrication of fiber reinforced laminates. The
PI is considered a competent researcher and the equipment required for the
research is adequate. A grant for the support of phase I research is
recommended.
