This study will test the hypothesis of escalation by examing the history of the
naticid gastropod predator-prey system. Vermeij has suggested that increased
severity of biologic hazards and, in turn, aptations to such hazards
characterizes the Phanerozoic. This hypothesis is controversial and requires
testing by systematic collection of data. We will analyze the development of the
naticid predator-prey system in the context of this hypothesis of escalation. A
comprehensive survey of Gulf Coastal Plain Cretaceous and Paleogene molluscan
assemblages will be conducted within the theoretical framework of the Kitchell
et al. (1981) energy maximization model of naticid predation. The survey will
determine whether temporal trends in drilling frequencies occurred and whether
naticid-prey interactions differed early in the history of the group compared to
later. Temporal patterns in behavioral stereotypy (selectivity of drillhole site
and prey size and species) and in relative effectiveness of predator and prey
will be determined. Analysis of predation on and evolution of several prey
lineages will explore and process of predator-prey evolution. We will examine
whether escalation is a macroevolutionary phenomenon or occurs within lineages
and (if it occurs) what processes are involved.
