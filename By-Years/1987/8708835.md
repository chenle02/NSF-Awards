The primary goal of the research is to bridge the gap between the growing body
of theoretical research and basic knowledge of how flexible systems respond. A
general modeling technique based on "assumed modes" is investigated which is
general enough to take input from a wide variety of sources. Control laws will
be synthesized using classical and modern design approaches to damp the
vibrations and precisely control the motions of the flexible system. The
technique of "balanced realization" will be investigated as a tool for
estimating the required sizes of dynamic models. Simulations and real time
experiments will examine the accuracy of the dynamic models and performance of
the control strategies.
