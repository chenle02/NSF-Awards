Abstract

Award: DMS-9820904 Principal Investigator: Peter B. Gilkey

Gilkey will study time dependent processes which are controlled by the heat
equation and the short time asymptotics which arise thereby. The first project
involves the heat content asymptotics, moving from the static setting to the
setting where the data (metric, internal heat sources, boundary conditions) are
time dependent. Previous work always assumed smooth boundary conditions; in this
project the boundary conditions are discontinuous. The second project involves
studying the asymptotics of the short time expansion of the fundamental solution
of the heat equation. Most previous studies have involved static geometries, but
it is natural to study these asymptotic expansions for time dependent geometries
for quite general operators of Laplace type and for quite general homogeneous
boundary conditions. This investigation will involve expanding the usual
calculus of pseudo differential operators to establish the existence of the
required short time asymptotics as well as determining how the time dependent
variation of the metric and the coupling constants for Neumann boundary
conditions influences the short time asymptotics of the heat kernel.

There are many physical settings where boundary conditions are discontinuous.
For example, a body floating in ice water satisfies Dirichlet boundary
conditions on the part immersed in the water and Neumann boundary conditions on
the remainder (assuming as a first approximation that there is no heat transfer
from the air to the body); the boundary conditions are discontinuous along the
water/air interface. Understanding additional boundary contributions coming from
the water/air interface are likely to be of great physical importance, and links
the differential geometry of the situation to the physical underpinnings of the
subject. There are also many conditions where the geometry is not static; the
Universe is expanding to cite one example. Boundary conditions in physical
settings may vary with time; for example, the temperature outside a building
varies with the time of day as well as with the season; consequently the
associated heat flow is not well modeled by a static setting. Understanding the
heat flow in this setting has obvious physical applications. The heat equation
asymptotics and heat content asymptotics have proven to be of central importance
in theoretical physics. For example, these asymptotics play an important role in
the renormalization of field theory in curved space and also in string and
membrane theory, and they are related to zeta function renormalization.
