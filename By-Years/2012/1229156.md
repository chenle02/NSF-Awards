With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, Professor
Kent Voorhees from Colorado School of Mines and colleagues Kim Williams, Andrew
Herring, Matthew Posewitz and John Spear will acquire a matrix assisted laser
desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MALDI TOF/MS). The
proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels,
especially in areas such as (a) ionization modes for laser ionization and
analysis of biological materials; (b) field-flow fractionation for biomarkers
for disease diagnostics; (c) characterization of energy hydrocarbons;(d) protein
studies associated with developing algae feedstocks for biofuels; and (e)
environmental proteomics.

A matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer
(MALDI TOF/MS) uses a laser to vaporize a solid sample (analyte) embedded in a
material (matrix) which absorbed the analyte. The plume of matrix and analyte
vapors form ions which flow into a mass spectrometer where their mass/charge
ratio is measured. This highly sensitive technique allows determination of the
masses of the particles, their chemical composition and deduction of the
structure of the substances under investigation. The instrumentation provided by
this award will provide faculty and students the opportunity to pursue research
projects at the Colorado School of Mines. The instrument will also be used by
faculty, students and investigators from nearby NREL, University of Denver,
University of Colorado at Denver, University of Colorado at Colorado Springs,
Colorado State University at Pueblo, Red Rocks CC, and Metro State College.
