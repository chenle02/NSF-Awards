Soils are chemical reactors. In this vast and diverse crucible that covers the
earth surface, minerals undergo a series of physical and chemical reactions with
organic matter. These reactions, by controlling the longevity of organic carbon
in soils, contribute to the global carbon cycle and act as a control on
atmospheric CO2 levels. Little is known, however, about how such reactions are
influenced by the supply of minerals into these soil reactors. This study will
test a hypothesis that tectonic action, by physically and chemically exposing
rock-originated minerals to the Earth's biologically active surface, regulates
carbon-mineral interactions. Conversely, in tectonically quiet places, human
land-use plays a dominant role as plows replace tectonics, physically mixing
minerals and organic matter and facilitating their interactions. This study
ultimately attempts to build and empirically test a universal model of carbon-
mineral interactions over a gradient from tectonically active rugged terrains
(Coastal California and Sierra Nevada California) to tectonically quiet
agricultural plains (Midwestern Corn Belt and Atlantic Coastal Plains). Such a
global survey of soils will be integrated into an experiential learning module
on soil sustainability in an "Environmental Problem Solving" course that is
required for all undergraduate students majoring in Environmental Science,
Policy, and Management at the University of Minnesota. Students will be guided
to build their knowledge base on soil sustainability by collaboratively
developing educational materials and using the materials to inform and engage
the general public on issues of long-term soil sustainability. The researcher
also plans to revise his graduate course on soil formation in order to
dramatically boost graduate students? real world experience in conducting
science.
