Understanding the origins and spread of anatomically modern humans and their
ecological and behavioral relationships to other hominid forms, especially
Neanderthals, has long been a concern in human evolution. Only recently,
however, have appropriate archaeological tools been developed to shed light on
this problem. In this project the researcher will distinguish the activities of
these two hominid groups. Hominid strategies for lithic raw materials
procurement, patterns of tool use and the spatial structure of hominid activity
will be examined at the sites of Kebara, Tabun, Qafzeh, Hayonim, Rosh Ein Mor,
and Boker Tachtit in Israel. Lithic sources near the sites will be sampled to
establish local procurement strategies while wear patterns on known tools will
be reconstructed to assess the role of tool use in shaping tool kit variability.
This project will make it possible to evaluate and differentiate the
paleoecological and technological strategies associated with Neanderthal and
anatomically-modern Homo sapiens.
