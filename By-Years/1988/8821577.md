Accretionary prisms form along the landward side of deep- sea trenches in
response to offscraping of oceanic sediments during lithospheric subduction.
Several interrelated factors influence the evolution of these thick sediment
prisms, including sediment composition, physical properties, rate of
underthrusting and dewatering and fluid migration within the off-scraped
sediment pile. Fluid migration and expulsion play an important role in the
mechanical behavior, fluid pressure and lithification of sediments in the
deformation zone. Previous research along the Oregon margin has identified
significant areas of fluid discharge and venting. The purpose of the present
study is to acquire side-scan sonar and multichannel seismic data with which to
examine the structural setting of the Oregon margin and the vent locations. An
attempt will be made to identify both the source and transport pathways of
fluids in the accretionary prism.
