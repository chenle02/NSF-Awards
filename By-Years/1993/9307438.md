Hislop will continue his study of the interplay of effective geometry and
spectral properties. The first part of the project concerns spectral and
transport properties of random media. He will investigate Anderson localization
for a family of continuous random Hamiltonians and for Maxwell's equations in
disordered media. The second part of the project will concentrate on infinite
volume hyperbolic manifolds. He will complete the characterization of the
Eisenstein series and S-matrix for geometrically finite hyperbolic manifolds.
Modern physics, quantum mechanics and relativity, is a product of the twentieth
century. It is founded firmly in the last century's attempt to address the
microstructure of matter and to come to grips with the concepts of action-at-a
distance, electro-magnetism, and heat radiation. The mathematical foundations
for these developments, collectively called mathematical physics, ranges from
detailed analysis of Schroedinger operators, which governs the dynamics of
particles, to unified field theory, which attempts to unite the four known
forces into a single theory.
