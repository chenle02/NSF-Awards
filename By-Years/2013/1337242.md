Stream processing is an increasingly important application domain; a significant
portion of the data-deluge beleaguering society takes the form of real-time
data, ranging from scientific data to tweets. Fortunately, in the last decade, a
variety of stream-processing languages have sprung up, including WaveScope,
StreamIt, Feldspar, and others. While these languages enable stream-processing
programs (which take the form of flow-graphs of stream operators) to execute
automatically and efficiently on multicores and small clusters of machines, they
optimize assuming an unchanging streaming workload and cannot handle dynamic
conditions found in many realistic streaming situations, such as inside modern
networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal pursues a more adaptive approach:
fast, incremental compilation and recompilation of subgraphs of a stream-
processing flow-graph to support dynamic placement and optimization policies
while retaining high performance. The goal is to allow streaming applications to
start instantly and in parallel, or restart if the program changes, while
adapting to predictable features of the environment over time including streams
of constant rate. Existing just-in-time (JIT) compilers for languages such as
JavaScript are a mature technology, but a new body of techniques are needed to
apply the more radical optimizations of stream compilers in a dynamic context.
This project aims to develop these techniques and evaluate them in a specific
application domain: high-speed in-network processing.
