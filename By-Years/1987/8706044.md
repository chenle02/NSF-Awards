The research from this proposal will create techniques that will enhance the
way in which scientists predict responses from limited amounts of data. The
techniques will be robust in nature thereby precluding unduly restrictive
distributional assumptions. An approach will be taken similar to what has been
done with confidence intervals: robust estimates of location and spread will be
used to create prediction intervals for a function of a set of future
observations. Recent advances in the field of adaptive estimation will also be
used to classify the underlying distribution. This research will go far beyond
currently available statistical methods for predicting responses. Statistical
prediction will be developed for new types of data, types for which existing
statistical methods have been used even though scientists knew they were misfit
because no other methods existed. Since the ability to predict is vital to
scientists and engineers, the results from this research will aid in advancing
the state-of-the-art in a variety of fields.
