A theoretical study of quasiperiodic systems will be carried out by the
principal investigators who plan to investigate electronic, vibrational and
other physical properties of quasicrystals (one-, two-, and three-dimensional);
quasiperiodic semiconductor superlattices; spin dynamics in quasiperiodic
fields; electrons on two dimensional lattices with a magnetic field; and
superconducting networks and Josephson junction arrays built in a quasiperiodic
manner. They will try to elucidate novel and interesting phenomena induced by
the quasiperiodicity and the topological structure of the problem. This project
should simulate experimental activity. In turn, as important experimental
progress is made, they will try to get a better understanding of the
quasiperiodic systems, as well as to develop a phenomenological approach which
may be directly useful for the planning of experiments.
