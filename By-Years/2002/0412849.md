The Department of Physics at Fisk University will host a National Conference of
Black Physics Students February 5-8, 2004 at Fisk University in Knoxville, TN.
This will be the 18th such annual Conference. The goal of the meeting is to
increase the diversity of physics. The focus is on providing undergraduate
physics majors and graduate students stimulation, motivation, and practical
skills to further their education, as well as foster entry into and productivity
in the scientific and technical professions. As part of the meetings, numerous
technical talks will be given, and students will have some course work in
advanced physics problem solving. Students will have informal meetings with
university faculty and researchers, as well, to provide them with a view of
physics from the professional perspective. Funds are provided to cover the costs
of student participation. Many subfields of physics and related fields are to be
represented. Approximately 200 students will attend.
