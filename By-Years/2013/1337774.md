An award is made to Oregon State University to purchase a confocal and two
photon microscope system for life science research, education and training.
Combined with the rapid increase in genomic information, confocal and two photon
microscopy provides an unparalleled ability to identify the cellular components
of living organisms, and to determine their functions. Key new features of this
microscope include: two photon excitation for deep tissue imaging, and
preservation of live organisms and cells; a tunable TiSa laser; 34 spectral
detection channels; and high sensitivity GaAsP detectors for faster acquisition
and dynamic imaging. Research and training programs of over 38 faculty in 12
departments and centers and 7 colleges will be strengthened and transformed by
the novel capabilities of the new instrument. The research will advance
knowledge of plants, animals, microbes, pathogens, symbionts and communities, in
natural, managed, healthy and polluted environments, spanning agricultural,
forest, ocean, and human ecosystems.

The novel capabilities of the two photon and confocal microscope, will advance
solutions to the most complex challenges facing mankind including environmental
health, ecosystem loss, sustainable food and energy production, infectious
disease, and understanding behavior and the mind. A new undergraduate learning
and research program on biological imaging will be enabled by the microscope
acquisition and will provide students with the tools to understand and apply
microscopy and imaging techniques, engage in inquiry-based research, conduct
ethical and appropriate scientific methods. The interdepartmental Ph.D. program
in Molecular and Cellular Biology program will be strengthened by the access
provided students to cutting edge imaging technology. Access to this technology
would benefit the broader Oregon research community, including small regional
companies.
