The solid-gas adsorption system utilizing zeolites has the unique capability of
converting small temperature variations into large pressure variations. This
permits the waste heat to be converted to useful work by small, inexpensive and
efficient devices. The proposal is concerned with identifying the best
zeolite/gas combinations for such applications and generate, through testing,
property information not readily available. Also to be included is the
identification of problems to be investigated in Phase II.
