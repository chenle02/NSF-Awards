An award is made to the University of California San Diego to support the
acquisition of a cryo-dual beam microscope to enable the three dimensional
visualization of cells at the level of the structure of individual biomolecules.
This technology will enable the development of completely novel hypothesis on
how molecules perform their function within the molecular landscapes that they
operate in. This project will realize this potential for laboratories at UC San
Diego, and will extend the training opportunities from technically trained
scientists to non-expert users, effectively democratizing this technology and
training the next generation of instrumentalists from diverse backgrounds.
Furthermore, the molecular landscapes that this project will reveal are great
teaching and dissemination tools for general audiences, including the creation
and circulation of virtual reality and videos that allow users to navigate and
explore cellular territories from within. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The acquisition
of this instrument will support research projects that aim to observe intricate
molecular networks in their natural environment. The scientific projects it will
support span from technical projects that aim to develop new methodologies that
will leverage the use of cryo-FIB milling for structural cell biology, to
biologically driven projects with goals of unveiling the molecular mechanisms
that result from specialized molecular networks in various model systems in cell
biology. Method-related projects include development of novel computational
algorithms to identify proteins within the molecular panoramas and enabling
simulations of entire cells to predict cellular behavior under a variety of
perturbations. Biologically driven projects include: unveiling unexplored
mechanisms in bacterial cell biology, such as how bacterial cells divide and
differentiate, how they respond to viral infection or keep track of time; the
study of fundamental processes in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells such as how
the genome organizes in 3-D and how this architecture determines the state of
the cell. Together with future projects that will be enabled by this technology,
the awarded project has the potential to make transformative discoveries that
will unleash yet-unimagined hypothesis of cellular mechanisms in a wide range of
biological scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
