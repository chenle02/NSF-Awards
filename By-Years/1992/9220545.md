9220545 Kebabian Carbon monoxide and nitrous oxide are important tropospheric
trace gases whose concentrations in the atmosphere are increasing annually. High
precision, simultaneous, measurements of carbon monoxide and nitrous oxide can
be used as a tracer for urban activity within an air mass at remote locations.
This project will attempt to develop a high resolution monitor for both carbon
monoxide and nitrous oxide using infrared absorption form a neutral xenon laser
light source. The pulsed laser, operating on the 4.54um xenon line, can be
zeeman split with a magnetic field of 2700 + 100 gauss to be coincident with
strong absorption lines of both molecules. A reduced pressure multipass
absorption cell coupled with this light source will provide sensitivity to
carbon monoxide of 0.6 ppb and nitrous oxide of 0.12ppb for continuous sampling
with a few seconds response time. The final instrument would be useful in
tropospheric photochemical studies and long term monitoring applications of
carbon monoxide and nitrous oxide. ***
