This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program at Indiana University
Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) will provide eight undergraduate students
from across the United States with the opportunity to conduct research on the
data science of human activity. The students will spend ten weeks during the
summer working with IUPUI faculty on projects related to predictive modeling and
estimation of risk with applications to crime, conflict, political instability
and daily routine activity. The students will also attend a data science
bootcamp as part of the program that will provide training in the foundations of
data science (statistics, machine learning, and software development). Data
science is a rapidly growing field due to increases in the volume and variety of
data being generated. Graduates with skill sets at the intersection of
mathematics, statistics, computing, data analysis, and data modeling are in high
demand, both in industry and academia. The REU site will increase undergraduate
student awareness, preparation, and interest in pursuing graduate degrees in
STEM fields where data science is becoming a larger focus. Students choosing to
pursue a career in industry upon graduation will also be better prepared to meet
the data challenges of the increasing number of companies where data science is
a high priority. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The REU projects address new challenges
in the data science of risk and human activity. Students working in problem area
1 will focus on learning to rank problems for space-time crime prediction.
Machine learning models for ranking crime hotspots according to risk will be
developed that will be tailored to ranking based loss functions that arise in
criminology. The second project will focus on classifying types of activity from
mobile sensor time series. The students will compare existing techniques to deep
learning algorithms employing architectures developed specifically for 3d data
from the accelerometer and gyroscope. The third area of research will focus on
point process models of heterogeneous grievance data. In particular, students
will develop spatio-temporal models for conflict data in Sub-Saharan Africa
coupled with geolocated, relevant Tweets from the same time period.
