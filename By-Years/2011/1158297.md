Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;Flowering plants contain clusters of repeated
genes, many of which are involved in recognition of pathogens. The structures of
these genes are often highly variable and a combination of forces drives the
diversification among repeated pathogen recognition genes. This project
investigates a unique situation in the model flowering plant, Arabidopsis
thaliana (mouse-ear cress), where the divergence between duplicated copies of a
pathogen recognition gene called SNC1 is extremely rapid. The project focuses on
this particular model to define the molecular mechanisms responsible for the
frequent birth-and-death of pathogen resistance genes in
plants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The project contains
three different elements that broaden its impact. First, the research addresses
fundamental questions regarding the ways that genetic change and rapid
evolutionary processes occur. The results of the research will also provide
insight into the forces that diversify a plant's arsenal of genes devoted to
protection against agricultural pests. The second broader impact of the project
will be the training and mentoring of scientists at the postdoctoral, graduate
and undergraduate levels. Finally, the project directly engages high school
students in the central New York region in an authentic collaborative research
project, connecting these students, as well as their teachers, with scientists
at the Boyce Thompson Institute.
