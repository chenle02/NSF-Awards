In this Career project, the investigator creates a software platform (called
NLApack) for Numerical Algebraic Geometry, trains students in the development
and application of mathematical software, and broadens the graduate education of
students in the areas of mathematics, computational science, and engineering. In
a first stage, the algorithms for the numerical irreducible decomposition of the
solution set of a polynomial system are refined and combined into a blackbox
program. Besides software, another outcome of this stage is the development of a
textbook for a course introducing students to symbolic and scientific computing.
The second stage of the project focuses on three specific topics: pole
placement, overconstrained linkages, and multi-body dynamics. A result of this
stage is a collection of software tools specialized for those application
fields, case studies, and benchmarks. Throughout, students are trained in
mathematics and computing and in important applications areas. The principal
investigator, his collaborators, and his graduate students are working in the
areas of numerical analysis and computer algebra. While computer algebra solves
mathematical problems in an exact symbolic fashion, as one would by hand,
numerical analysis calculates with limited precision on input data often only
approximately known. The software developed in this project combines the
symbolic and numeric approach. Most scientists seek insight (not just numbers)
in the form of equations to reveal new relations between the important
parameters in their models. But these models contain approximate data that
cannot be handled directly by current symbolic methods. The investigator
develops symbolic-numeric methods that will make computer algebra more relevant
to scientific computing, and trains students who will adept at both numeric and
symbolic computation, with significant payoffs for disciplines that depend on
large-scale scientific computing.
