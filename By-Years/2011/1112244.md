The PI's request partial funding to support the publishing of a special issue of
Oceanography magazine in September 2011 (volume 24, number 3) on the topic of
Arctic oceanography. The Arctic Ocean is experiencing profound changes,
including shrinking amounts of sea ice, ocean acidification, increasing ocean
temperatures, all of which have consequences for Arctic ecosystems. The proposed
set of peer reviewed papers will cover the geological, physical, chemical,
biological, and human dimension aspects of recent Arctic change as observed
during the recent International Polar Year. These topics represent major
investments by US and international funding agencies.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed focus
on the Arctic is timely and important, given rapidly changing conditions and the
recent wealth of activity related to the IPY. This activity will advance
understanding of the dynamically changing Arctic. With the intense focus on the
Arctic by research funding agencies, government agencies and industry,
publications such as this would be helpful for identifying gaps in research. The
audience of TOS is broader than academic scientists, and is used by K-12 and
informal educators as well as the academic community. And TOS has been a
champion of helping scientists with education and outreach, through partnerships
with COSEE and others.
