Union college is one of a select group of small colleges which has been
particularly successful in preparing undergraduates for graduate work in
chemistry because of our strong curriculum and flourishing program for
undergraduate research in chemistry. Polymer Chemistry, one of the more popular
courses for undergraduates which also draws students from local industries, is a
combination of organic and physical applications. This project replaces the out-
moded instruments with new instrumenttion which is also used in organic and
physical chemistry laboratories, and in senior thesis research. The upgraded
equipment and its uses follow. Gel permeation average and a weight-average
molecular weight for a given polymer sample. Osmotic pressure measurements give
number-average molecular weights; vapor phase osometers are used for molecular
weights below 25,000 and membrane osometers are used for samples with higher
molecular weights. Thermal analysis (TGA) give important physical properties of
polymers which are necessary to match a polymer to a particular industrial
application. The institution is matching the award with an equal amount of
funds.
