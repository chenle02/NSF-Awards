9409816 Stokes A methodology is developed for improving the performance of high-
speed serial manipulators by integrating their mechanical and control system
design. Using this technique, the robustness and accuracy of high-performance
manipulators is increased and the required control authority is decreased. The
method incorporates a combination of mechanical and control design of spatial,
rigid- link manipulators having joint and transmission compliances such as used
in automated assembly of mechanical and electrical systems. An assessment of
improvement is made by evaluating a performance criterion which measures the
system performance over the entire workspace of the manipulators. ***
