Sound recording and analysis equipment (high quality cassette tape recorders,
microphones, a sound pressure level meter, and accessories) will allow both
majors and non-majors to study acoustic signals of animals by recording,
quantifying, and comparing them. A computer- based sound analysis facility will
permit immediate analysis of tape recordings, and the students will then be able
to quickly compare their data with a larger data set and with published results
from other workers. The equipment will be used both in formal laboratories and
in independent student research project projects. The university will provide
50% matching funds.
