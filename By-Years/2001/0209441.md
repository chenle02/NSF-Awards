The aim of this project is to explore the role that developmental regulatory
mechanisms play in producing variation in natural populations. To study this
topic, the investigators are using Heliconius butterflies as a system for
studying the evolution of gene regulation from a molecular perspective. Several
of the color pattern genes in Heliconius that allow regional races to
participate in adaptive mimicry behavior act as simple switches in a pigment
biosynthesis pathway. The biosynthetic pathways that produce pigments in
butterfly wings are well known, and this research will test how simple changes
in the regulation of specific intermediate pigment synthesis and transport genes
may result in wing pattern variation within and between species.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding evolution at the mechanistic level is
critical for effective management of, for instance, the adaptive resistance in
pathogen and pest species. It is of immediate benefit to develop a basic
understanding of the genetic basis of how organisms develop new significant
characteristics over short time spans. Butterfly wing patterns provide a
tractable model system for studying adaptive genetic change at the population
level.&lt;br/&gt;
