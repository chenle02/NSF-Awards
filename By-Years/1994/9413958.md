ABSTRACT NSF support is requested for the purchase of a 600 MHz NMR
spectrometer for high resolution structural studies of biological macromolecules
at Yale University. Studies of macromolecular structure and function using high-
resolution solution NMR has become a major activity for research groups in the
Departments of MB&amp;B and Chemistry at Yale. The research described below
focuses on fundamental questions in structural biology and biochemistry
involving metalloproteins (J. Coleman, L. Regan and J. Caradonna), proteins and
protein-protein interactions (J. Prestegard and L. Regan), RNA (D. Crothers and
P. Moore), membrane proteins (D. Engelman and S. Smith) and the collection of
datasets of proteins and RNA for methodological developments (A. Brunger).
Currently, this research is pursued on two 500 MHz NMR spectrometers. The plan
is to acquire a 600 MHz spectrometer to complement the existing 500 MHz
instrumentation. The 600 MHz instrument will provide important and substantial
improvements in sensitivity, resolution and spectrometer time available. The
projects of the nine research groups described below all have components that
would benefit markedly from the higher magnetic field.
