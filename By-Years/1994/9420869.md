This project advances knowledge about how to give computer users convincingly
real haptic (sense of touch) interaction with computers. While there has been
some progress in this area, chiefly through the use of back-driven robotic-like
manipulators, this is a substantially new approach which promises a qualitative
leap in improvement of such capabilities: A user interacts with the computer by
grasping arigid tool whose behavioral description is computed, employing this
tool to interact with computed environments which are semantically meaningful in
terms of the application. At the same time, the environment exerts realistic
forces and torques on the tool's handle which are felt by the user. The vision
is one of providing the computer user immediate, high-fidelity, convincingly
real interaction with computed environments. The new haptic interface approach
is based on a recently developed magnetic levitation technology, and on recent
strong advances in the art of physically-based simulation. The magnetic
levitation technology uses Lorentz forces to stably levitate and control a rigid
body (which includes the handle through which the user interacts) in six degrees
of freedom, giving a new and heretofore unexplored physical basis for haptic
interaction. The new simulation methods are based on special-purpose techniques
that promise to be simpler, faster, and more robust than their generic
counterparts. Robust realistic physical simulation, coupled with high- bandwidth
six-degree-of-freedom force reflection, has the potential to greatly improve the
state of the art in the feel, performance, and capabilities of virtual
environment systems for use in a wide range of human activities.
