With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Mary Hermes will document the use
of conversational Southwestern Ojibwe. Ojibwe is spoken by about 10,000 people
as a first language. Around the Great Lakes in Canada many indigenous
communities use Ojibwe as a first language. However in the United States, Ojibwe
is spoken by only a handful of Elders on each reservation. These particular
dialects of Ojibwe exist nowhere else and are currently extremely endangered.

This project will document Lac Courte Oreilles Ojibwe Elders using Ojibwe in a
non-formal conversational setting. The researchers will audio and videotape
Elders in different setting, speaking to each other about every day topics. This
kind of resource is extremely valuable for those trying to revitalize the
language. Master tapes will be archived at the Waadookodaading Ojibwe Language
Immersion School. Tapes will be edited into short segments and distributed to
those trying to learn the Ojibwe language, Ojibwemowin.
