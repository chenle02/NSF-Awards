Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are sophisticated computer systems for
analyzing, storing and displaying diverse spatial and non-spatial data. They are
ideally suited for analyzing complex interrelationships among natural resources
and for producing outputs, including maps, used in management. This two-year
campus is purchasing three complete GIS units for their Wildlife Technology
program. These units enhance instruction and introduce students to GIS as an
integral part of natural resource management. The systems allow a greater
variety of data to be collected, analyzed, and mapped. Management decisions can
more easily be made and their impacts compared on a variety of biotic and
abiotic natural resources. As GIS systems are increasingly being used in
resource management agencies, this instruction makes the graduates of the
program more knowledgeable about such systems and therefore more competitive
when they graduate. The school will contribute an amount equal to the award.
