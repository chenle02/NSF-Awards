This award provides one-half the funding necessary to acquire an inductively-
coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) system that will be installed in the
Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Harvard University. Harvard
University is committed to providing the remaining funds needed for the
acquisition. The ICP-MS system will satisfy the analytical needs of a number of
research groups at Harvard, mostly (an estimated 70% of machine time) in the
departments of Earth and Planetary Sciences and Anthropology. The remaining
machine time is expected to be devoted to the needs of researchers in the
Division of Applied Sciences, and the departments of Chemistry and Biology. ICP-
MS is the technique of choice for obtaining both rapid and highly sensitive
analysis of a wide range of elements and concentrations. Research projects at
Harvard in need of such analyses cover a range of subjects from the study of ore
forming processes, to the chemical evolution of the oceans, to river water
chemistry, anthropology and archaeology, and ice cores.
