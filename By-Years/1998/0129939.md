EIA-0129939&lt;br/&gt;Ronald Breaker&lt;br/&gt;Yale
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Engineering Molecular Logic Gates Using
Nucleic Acids&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under this project, test tube evolution is
used to create molecular switches that serve as logic gates, and these
chemically triggered switches are assembled into first-generation biomolecular
computing devices. This project is creating new functional RNA and DNA molecules
that perform as distinct types of logic gates. This advance in "molecular
hardware" design is adding to the repertoire of molecular computing
infrastructure and permitting the construction of more advanced molecular
computing devices. As a demonstration of utility, these logic gates are
assembled into molecular computing systems that can be used to add any two
numbers. &lt;br/&gt;A combination of modular rational design and in vitro
evolution is being used to create nucleic acid molecular switches that are
analogous to electronic logic gates. This design strategy employs the process of
Darwinian evolution, where molecular "survival-of-the-fittest" is used to
identify unique RNA switches that have AND gate function. The kinetic
characteristics of the selected RNAs are examined to identify robust constructs
that can be altered to produce up to 1 trillion different AND gate species. To
demonstrate the utility of these logic gates, they are assembled to create a
functional architecture for a molecular computer that can add any two numbers.
The result of the molecular computation is reported as pixels on a chip-like
surface using radioisotope signaling. In addition, other RNA and DNA switches
are created using similar strategies that perform as representatives of the
remaining common logic gates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
