In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Jin K. Cha of the Department of Chemistry at Wayne State
University will explore synthetic applications of the low valent titanium-
mediated cyclopropanation of esters and related cross-coupling reactions. By
building on the original discovery by Kulinkovich, Professor Cha's group
developed the olefin exchange-mediated variant to broaden the scope of the
Kulinkovich cyclopropanation and pave the way for mechanistically related cross-
coupling reactions. The specific goals include mechanistic studies of the key
cyclopropananation reaction; low-valent titanium-mediated alkylation and cross-
coupling reactions of allylic and homoallylic alcohols; and ring opening of
cyclopropanols with a range of electrophiles in C-C bond forming reactions.
Included are transition metal-catalyzed ring opening reactions. These reactions
represent new uses of the Kulinkovich reagent with a broad scope and the well-
defined stereochemical outcome. Particular emphasis will be placed at high
efficiency and convergence, which is made possible by segment
coupling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Cha's approach lends itself to
environmentally benign syntheses, which offer enabling technology to the
pharmaceutical, chemical, agricultural industry, and materials science.
Additionally, this project will provide training of coworkers, from
undergraduate research participants to post-doctoral, including those from
groups historically underrepresented in the physical sciences.
