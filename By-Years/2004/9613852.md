The objective of this project is to obtain continuous, global, real-time
monitoring of the auroral size, configuration, and dynamics for use in space
weather specification and warning systems and for near-term forecasting as an
input to global circulation models. The method is based upon the observation
that 0.1 - 100 Hz magnetic fluctuations appear to be a good identifier of the
auroral oval at satellite altitudes. It may be possible then to utilize non-
science grade magnetometers used for attitude determination on the suites of
commerical communication and navigation satellites to provide continuous
monitoring of the auroral oval. The project will undertake a more thorough
investigation of the magnetic fluctuations and will examine test data from the
RIDIUM attitude magnetometer to test the efficacy of the proposed method.
