A general abstract theory has been developed for the construction of efficient
estimates of the parameter of interest in semiparametric models when the data
are independently and identically distributed. This project will expand this
theory in two directions. First is the development of a satisfactory calculus
for the construction of the efficient influence function. Second is the
extension of the theory for dependent data. This research will provide a unified
view and a rigorous mathematical basis for constructing estimators for a large
class of statistical models. When models are only partially specified in terms
of the determining features or attributes, the anticipated behavior for new
observations can be modeled nonetheless using so-called semiparametric or
nonparametric models. How well this is done depends on how fully the information
in the data is utilized and on how precisely the model can be expressed given
the data. This research focuses on abstracting the necessary mathematical
properties for good estimates and good predictions for future observations. Then
the mathematical requirements for these desired properties can be derived.
