The major goal of this research is to investigate the role of affect in
persuasion and to examine the utility of the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM)
for understanding and integrating prior research on affect. ELM holds that
affect influences the amount and direction of persuasion by different processes
in different situations. That is, peoples' moods and feelings can influence
attitudes by (a) serving as simple cues; (b) providing issue-relevant
information; (c) affecting the extent of information processing activity, and
(d) influencing the nature of the thoughts that come to mind as a message is
processed. Affect is postulated to have different effects depending upon a
message recipient's overall motivation and ability to think about the
communication. Experiments will be conducted to examine the different roles that
a person's affective state can play in the persuasion process under different
elaboration likelihood conditions. These are the critical experiments for
testing the potential utility of the ELM for understanding the role of a
person's transient moods and emotions in persuasion. When this research has been
completed, we will have a better understanding of the link between affect and
persuasion.
