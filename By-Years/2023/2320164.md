An award is made to Oklahoma State University (OSU) to conduct integrated
hyperspectral and LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensing through the
acquisition of an Advanced Low-altitude Earth Observing System (ALEOS). ALEOS is
an integrated research instrument mounted on an unoccupied aircraft system (UAS)
which will advance the research programs of at least 18 investigators from 10
departments across OSU, who will in turn provide numerous STEM training avenues
for undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers,
many of whom are from groups historically underrepresented in science. The
research driven by ALEOS will captivate students of all backgrounds and increase
job placement of OSU students given the increasing demand for expertise with
drone technology in the job market. Every year, this project will enable more
than 170 students in roughly nine courses to experience first-hand advanced
imaging technologies and to complete class projects driven by real-world
applications, such as assessing the composition of aerosol emissions from
grassland fires and studying how certain crops respond to varying levels of soil
nitrogen. The project team will incorporate hands-on activities related to ALEOS
research into outreach activities supported by OSU, such as National Lab Day and
STEM Teacher Institute events, as well as the Oklahoma State Science and
Engineering Fair which is organized and hosted by OSU.

ALEOS will add new research capabilities to OSU by providing state-of-the-art
remote sensing technology. This project will facilitate innovative research that
will advance agricultural production systems and management of natural resources
with positive economic implications for the region and relevance to national and
global issues. Deployment of ALEOS will enable novel research topics, such as
assessing the linkages between above- and below-ground biodiversity, determining
impacts of climate on carbon and water cycles, developing UAS-based forage
monitoring systems, and constraining uncertainty in the climate effects of
aerosol emissions from prescribed fires. ALEOS can also provide calibration and
validation support for current large-scale monitoring systems, such as the
sensors aboard the International Space Station and forthcoming spaceborne Earth
observing systems, such as NASAâ€™s Surface Biology and Geology mission. As such,
this project will help answer a wide array of important scientific questions
surrounding the issue of scale in remote sensing. The project team will
disseminate this information through scientific publications, course curricula,
and outreach to tribal nations, land managers, and stakeholders.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
