This research project will be conducted as an ancillary program in conjunction
with a large, coordinated, multi-investigator program, Surface Heat Budget of
the Arctic (SHEBA) Ocean. The research program will be conducted for 14 months
from a ship frozen into the ice pack. This investigator will determine the
stresses in the sea ice that result from the dynamics of the permanent ice pack
through a full annual cycle. This research will be important for the
determination of the effects of dynamic stresses created by the thermal stresses
due to the flux of incoming heat radiating onto the ice floe as a function of
changing atmospheric and oceanic conditions. These measurements are important to
understanding how the ice flow responds as heat is reflected or absorbed by the
ice that melts in the summer and thickens in the winter in response to seasonal
variations in climate. The sea-ice dynamic stress measurement program makes an
important contribution to the SHEBA team of researchers who will measure
atmospheric variables with a large array of instruments on the ice floe and from
aircraft flying above as well as ice and ocean property measurements made on and
below the ice floe. The combined set of measurements in SHEBA will allow
refinement of climate models for the Arctic region. Those improved models will
lead to better predictions of the climate and the permanence of the Arctic ice
cap under a proposed global warming that could occur if atmospheric carbon
dioxide levels are increased above present levels.
