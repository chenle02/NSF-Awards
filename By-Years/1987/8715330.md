The principal objectives of the research program are to explore those aspects of
the environment of luminous quasi-stellar ob- jects (QSOs) and powerful radio
galaxies that seem most likely to give insights into the physical mechanisms
responsible for the production of the active nucleus in these objects. Five
specific research projects will be carried out: 1. An intensive imaging and
spectroscopic study of a small sample of steep-radio-spectrum QSOs designed
specifically to under- stand the correlation between the presence of extended
ionized gas and other observed properties. 2. A similar study of three or four
broad-spectral-line radio galaxies showing extensive extended ionized gas. 3. A
survey to detect extended emission-line regions around intermediate-redshift
(greater than 0.6 and less than 0.9) QSOs in order to study the evolutionary
history of this phenomenon. 4. A continuation of a deep-imaging survey of a
complete sample of Third Cambridge Radio Survey (3CR) galaxies and QSOs with
redshifts between 0.8 and 1.3 to explore correlations between the strength and
distribution of the extended emission-line radiation and the continuum
distribution and color (for the radio galaxies) and the radio structure. 5. A
systematic and thorough imaging and spectroscopic investiga- tion of Cygnus A
which will provide data that will result in intensity-ratio maps for diagnostic
emission lines and give a better understanding of the kinematics of the stars
and gas.
