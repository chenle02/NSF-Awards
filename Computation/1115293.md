This study focuses on problems from polynomial optimization and convex algebraic
geometry. The latter is a new research area that concerns convex sets and convex
hulls of sets that are described algebraically and arise in optimization. The
key tool is the use of efficient algorithms in semidefinite programming, a
branch of convex optimization that is used in polynomial optimization. The first
set of questions studies the general phenomenon of when a given convex body is
the linear projection of a slice (by an affine plane) of a closed convex cone.
This phenomena is central to all lift-and-project methods for discrete and
polynomial optimization. This study provides a uniform view of all lift-and-
project methods via new notions of cone factorizations of certain operators
associated to the convex body. The investigator and collaborators have recently
constructed a new hierarchy of convex relaxations for algebraic sets called
theta bodies. Various open questions about these bodies are posed. The methods
from polynomial optimization and convex algebraic geometry can be applied to
problems from computer vision. Here the application is primarily to object
reconstruction from images taken by multiple cameras.

The work of the PI with her collaborators improvies our understanding of the
algebraic and geometric structures that underlie optimization problems that
involve polynomials. Such problems have a wide array of applications and admit
methods from both the algebraic and analytic sides of mathematics. This research
considers both improvements in our understanding of the theoretical aspects of
polynomial optimization, and the application of these methods to problems in
computer vision.
