The object of this study is to acquire a resonant column and a constant rate
strain oedometer device with automatic data acquisition capabilities to assess
integrity and performance of earthen material that has been environmentally
impacted. The equipment will be used to measure low strain stiffness and
compressibility of polluted soils; stiffness/compressibility of stabilized
polluted soils; stiffness/shear wave velocity of stabilized/solidified
industrial residues.
