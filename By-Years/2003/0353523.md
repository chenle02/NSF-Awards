Schlais&lt;br/&gt;Title: Applying Advanced Distributed Teaching and Learning to
Pre-Calculus Mathematics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical Sciences
(21) In this proof of concept (POC) project faculty at a number of the two-year
colleges in the University of Wisconsin System are collaborating with colleagues
at the University of Wisconsin-LaCrosse to explore the creation and use of
shareable content objects (SCOs) targeting trouble spots in a typical pre-
calculus course. Assembly tools are also being made available to faculty so that
they may reuse and repackage these SCOs into larger grained learning modules
without having to author new component objects from scratch. A prototype
repository of these SCOs is under development, and the experiences of faculty in
this creation and assembly process is being captured in the form of case
studies. &lt;br/&gt;
