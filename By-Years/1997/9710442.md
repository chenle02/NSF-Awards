This award is made under the high performance connections portion of NCRI's
"Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64. This project will provide
partial support to expand the Georgia State University and the Georgia Institute
of Technology's network infrastructure and implement a OC-3 ATM connection to be
NSF supported the Very High Performance Backbone Network Service (vBNS). This
proposal augments a previous award made under this program to Georgia Tech.
