Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0124784&lt;br/&gt;Edward Goldberg, Tufts
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is proposed to build
nanostructures by controlled self-assembly: they would be made of unit protein
rods (approximately 50nm long rods) which would be organized in the shape of
equilateral triangles, the sides of which would be made of complimentary binding
pairs. Assembly of these triangles will be carried out by stages in a third
dimension, with the desired order and growth. In this manner, the "bottom up"
parallel manufacture of nanoarrays will become a practical possibility. A
sequential assembly of three binding pairs is used. There are three major
challenges: addressing the relevant binding pairs; positioning them in proper
spacing and identifying the staging procedure for each new desired
nanostructure. The complexity of these tasks, for any truly desirable assembly
of nanostructures, demands a large number of steps (design and produce modular
unit rods, associate one of the rods to a matrix and assemble the unit rods in a
programmatic generation of triangles).&lt;br/&gt;
