Equipment including pyranometers, radiometers, sensors, photodiodes, and data
recording equipment is acquired for an interdisciplinary study team
investigating thermal performance of buildings while examining energy-conserving
operation practices. The purpose of the equipment is to examine irradiance,
illuminance, and longwave radiation presences around existing test facilities.
Six goals determined the choice of equipment: to develop a better model for
transforming global irradiance measured on horizontal surfaces to vertical
surfaces; to create an illuminance database; to examine patterns of sky
luminance and compare measurement data with generalized conventions; to generate
a correlation between hourly values of irradiance and illuminance; to establish
design condition illuminance values for use by architects and engineers; and to
establish data about the longwave radiant exchange between buildings and the
environment, with special attention directed to determining patterns and rates
of nocturnal radiation exchange.
