This work tests the application of Uranium (U) isotopes preserved in carbonate
sediments as a paleo-redox proxy. Significant variability exists in U isotope
composition, due largely to isotope fractionation during redox transformations
of U in solution. This suggests that the U isotope composition of seawater may
be determined by the redox state of the global ocean. This research will involve
laboratory experiments to determine whether U isotopes fractionate during
abiotic precipitation of calcite and aragonite, which will serve as a baseline
against which to compare any biogenic fractionation. A field component will
investigate fractionation of U isotopes in natural carbonates, both biogenic and
abiotic. This will include study of how low temperature alteration during
deposition and burial might affect the preservation of the primary U isotope
signal. Funding provides research opportunities for undergraduates from the
Arizona State University Honors College, and supports a PhD thesis.
