Facilitating economic growth while avoiding damage to health and the environment
concerns both emerging and mature democracies. This collaborative two-year study
will test and further develop the hypothesis that the transition to democracy
and free market economy in Poland has structural characteristics that can in the
long run deemphasize the environment, health and safety (EH&S) interests. It has
three main objectives. One is to identify major barriers to satisfying the EH&S
concerns in Poland. These barriers are grounded in the pursuit of other national
values related to economic growth, improved social welfare, development of civic
society, and so on. The second is to identify regulatory approaches that can
assist in protecting EH&S interests during the current societal transition and
beyond. A final objective is to contribute to theory of industrial EH&S
management in the context of major societal transitions. The research approach
consists of empirical case analysis of the process of licensing of new and
privatized industrial manufacturing facilities. It will be approached by (i)
analysis of the policies, procedures and institutional missions in relation to
permitting industrial facilities, and (ii) analysis of the specific process of
implementation of official policies in the course of licensing four facilities.
A heuristic model of facility licensing guides the faculity-based field work.
Data collection includes interviews, review of relevant documents, analysis of
EH&S performance indications, and observations during site visits. This research
will produce articles and other publications and presentations that will assist
decisionmakers in reconciling growth and environmental protection. It will
contribute to the growing body of research on the adaptability and mitigative
capacity of societies undergoing dramatic change, and generate data for
international comparative studies of environmental hazard management.
