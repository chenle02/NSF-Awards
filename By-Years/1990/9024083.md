The National Science Foundation (NSF) is responsible for fostering, promoting
and facilitating communication and collaboration among members of the U. S.
scientific research and education community as well as with their colleagues
abroad. The objective of the International Connections Project is to provide
integrated management of international data networking connections between the
NSFNET and the national research and academic networks of countries with which
the U.S. community maintains scientific collaborations. Coordinated and
consolidated management of the U.S. side of the interconnections is expected to
achieve more efficient and cost-effective networking solutions. Initially, the
award focuses on links to INRIA (France) and to NORDUnet (Nordic countries),
because NSF has been the sole U.S. agency operating general research
interconnections with those countries.
