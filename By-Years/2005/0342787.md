This award is to continue operation of the Coordinating Office for the U.S.
GLOBEC Scientific Steering Committee (SSC). The national office of U.S. GLOBEC
provides coordination and support for the regional programs, scientific planning
and review, and communication. As the program has developed into a functional
multi?regional program, the emphasis of the Scientific Steering Committee has
shifted from scientific planning for the local field programs to an emphasis on
coordination and planning for comparative studies, and for integration within
and between regional studies. We will continue the Coordinating Office and its
activities at the Institute of Marine and Coastal Sciences, Rutgers University.
The PI will serve as Chair of the U.S. GLOBEC SSC and will direct the activities
of the Coordinating Office.
