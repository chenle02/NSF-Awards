Abstract

Award: DMS 1623977, Principal Investigator: Haynes R. Miller

This award provides support for the next three Talbot workshops to be held in
2017, 2018, and 2019. Since its initial meeting in 2004, the Talbot Workshop has
introduced young researchers in algebraic topology to topics of contemporary
interest. This annual workshop gathers about 35 young participants and one or
two senior mathematicians for a week-long retreat; the participants, who are
mostly graduate students, learn about the week's research topic by exchanging
lectures and discussing the topic under the guidance of the mentors. The
workshop has been extremely successful, inspiring the future research of many
students and establishing numerous collaborations among the participants. The
workshop's unique format, in which participants live and cook together in a
rental house, helps to create and sustain the collaborative atmosphere.

Past Talbot Workshops have focused on a wide variety of topics in homotopy
theory and surrounding areas, from elliptic cohomology (2004) and Fukaya
categories (2009) to non-abelian Hodge theory (2011) and, most recently (2016),
the Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel solution of the longstanding Kervaire invariant problem
(with Hill and Ravenel as mentors). The topics under preliminary consideration
for 2017, 2018, and 2019 include: stability conditions on triangulated
categories, trace methods in algebraic K-theory, conformal field theory, derived
algebraic geometry, applied topology, and Heegaard Floer theory. As many of the
participants are first- or second-year graduate students looking to get a start
in a promising research area, the lectures begin with basics, such as an
introduction to model categories and to equivariant homotopy theory in the 2016
workshop, and lead up to a presentation of open problems related to the workshop
material. The web site for the Talbot workshops is
