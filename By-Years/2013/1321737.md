This workshop will bring together researchers from the US and Indonesia to
discuss the critical issues in biodiversity that affect the Pacific Rim in
general and Indonesia in particular. Leading biodiversity investigators from the
US will integrate with their Indonesian counterparts who are working to
understand the role of Indonesia's extensive and diverse fauna, flora and
microbiota. The waters surrounding the ca. 17,000 Indonesian Islands are home to
over a quarter of the Earth's identified fish species, and more than 60% of the
hard coral species. Most taxa are endemic - these Islands afford many unique
niches for organisms to evolve and interact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nature is
under constant threat as human activity encroaches on the amazingly diverse and
unexplored habitats in Indonesia. The coral reefs, in particular, are at
considerable risk. It is essential that biodiversity scientists explore these
habitats and provide critical data needed to drive conservation efforts and
priorities. The workshop will promote international collaboration to enable
future partnerships and student exchange.
