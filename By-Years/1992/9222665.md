This award is for partial support for a meeting to help train Mexican
engineering evaluators who will later evaluate Mexican engineering programs
using US Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) standards.
Use of these standards by the Mexicans, as well as giving them a uniform minimum
standard for their own use, will facilitate exchange of engineering students
between the US and Mexico, which is expected to increase under NAFTA.
