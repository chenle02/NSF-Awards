This award in the Research Planning Grant for women program is made by the
Chemistry Division to Dr. Ingrid Fritsch-Faules of the Chemistry Department,
University of Arkansas. The long term goal of the research is to prepare three-
dimensional electrode devices with submicron features with controlled surface
characteristics. Electrochemical and molecular self-assembly techniques will be
used to tailor the electrode surfaces for various applications, and to
characterize the operation of the device. During the planning period, the
fabrication approach would be developed, including proof of principle
experiments using thin film layering and patterning methods. These devices may
find application as multifunctional electrochemical sensors or miniature
electrochemical filter devices useful in analytical chemistry.
