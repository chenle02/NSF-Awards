Abstract Solar disturbances produce major effects on the corona, the solar wind,
the interplanetary medium, and the Earth along with its magnetosphere. New
techniques have been developed for studying plasma disturbances in the inner
heliosphere. This research will continue to investigate the physics of these
disturbances, using data from the HELIOS zodiacal-light photometers and a
variety of other coronal instruments. The zodiacal-light photometers have
already provided the first stereoscopic information about the heliospheric shape
of these disturbances. Modelling techniques will also be employed to interpret
and fit the observed results. The HELIOS imaging combined with other
observations should provide a unique opportunity to determine coronal mass-
ejection velocities, streamer material velocities, 3D structures, and total
masses in the interplanetary medium. This can be done with fewer assumptions and
more accuracy than previously possible. Besides mass ejections, solar
disturbances which reach the interplanetary medium also include coronal
streamers, shocks, and co-rotating interaction regions, It has been possible to
view these features with the zodiacal-light photometers on board the HELIOS
spacecraft and these will be studied to determine how they relate to near-
surface solar structures and the heliospheric current sheet. The study will be
extended to include comparisons of the HELIOS photometer observations with other
remote sensing observations including those of kilometric radio bursts and
interplanetary scintillations provided by the Cambridge, England scintillation
array. *** //
