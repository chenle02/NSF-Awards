This award provides one-half the funding required for the purchase of computer
equipment to serve the seismology research group in the Department of Earth
&amp; Planetary Sciences at Harvard University. Harvard is committed to
providing the remaining necessary funds. The equipment includes upgrades of two
fileservers to multiprocessor machines, workstation upgrades, acquisition of a
color graphics workstation, and the acquisition of a tape archive unit. The
seismology research group at Harvard investigates a broad range of problems in
seismology including the analysis of very large data sets for the study of
earthquake source parameters and the determination of earth structure.
