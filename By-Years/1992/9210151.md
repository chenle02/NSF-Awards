Software environments to aid in the prototyping of protocols and distributed
algorithms are increasingly important as networking expands. Powerful techniques
for specification and validation are needed. A prototyping environment called
SPANNER, based on a coupled finite state machine model, was shown to be useful
for precisely specifying and validating small coordination problems. This award
explores the development of a more powerful development environment by extending
the specification capabilities of the SPANNER system and by implementing a
distributed version of the enhanced system. The specification capabilities are
being enhanced by allowing dynamic activation of modules, constraint-based
specifications, and multiple time bases. The goal is to continue to be able to
validate such specifications for safety and liveness properties. The distributed
implementation is designed to be able to validate larger and more complex
protocols in a shorter amount of time. The ideas being developed and tested
during the course of this work should be of use to prototyping environments
developed by other researchers.
