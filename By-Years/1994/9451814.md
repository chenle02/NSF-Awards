9451814 Noble A instruction laboratory is being established for introductory
statistics courses to develop data analysis skills that will be applied in other
laboratories and student research, and to introduce examples relevant to the
curriculum in the social and life sciences. The project will create team taught
multi-disciplinary introductory statistics courses and thereby integrate
statistics instruction in the mathematics department with the curriculum in
economics, psychology, anthropology, government and biology. The laboratory will
provide a hands-on learning environment in which students can practice the
methods and experimentally explore the concepts presented in lecture. The lab
will also provide an opportunity for students to learn computing intensive
methods such as graphical data exploration, resampling techniques, and a variety
of multi-variate techniques.
