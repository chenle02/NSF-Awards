A consortium of institutions in Nebraska, Wyoming, and South Dakota are
adapting, refining and implementing the approach to teaching calculus being
developed at Purdue University. Issues of computer anxiety and cooperative
learning are being examined during the implementation phase. The adaptation
phase will include introducing the use of graphing calculators.
