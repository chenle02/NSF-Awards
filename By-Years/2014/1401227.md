The principal investigator plans to work on several questions, of different
degrees of difficulty, concerning local and global aspects in the study of
algebraic varieties. It has been understood for a long time that even if one is
interested in studying smooth geometric objects, singular ones naturally appear.
It is thus important to be able to measure singularities, and this is done via
various invariants that can be either numerical or can have a more complicated
structure. The projects in this proposal are concerned with some of these
invariants and with their applications to the study of algebraic varieties.
These geometric objects can be studied in two contexts: in characteristic zero,
which is the more familiar context, closer to our usual Euclidean space, and in
positive characteristic, a context that is closer to arithmetic. However, these
two settings have close connections, and sometimes one can prove results in
characteristic zero by proving the corresponding results in positive
characteristic. At this point, however, most of the results concerning the
global properties of algebraic varieties are only known in characteristic zero.
Several of the projects in this proposal are concerned with the extension of
such results to positive characteristic and with the study of the more subtle
phenomena that appear in this setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The common feature
of the questions addressed in this proposal is the study of the connections
between different invariants of singularities and the use of such invariants in
the study of the global properties of algebraic varieties. The PI plans to
explore relations between different points of view on singularities, such as the
connection between spaces of arcs and the Hilbert-Samuel multiplicity and the
connection between spaces of arcs and the Decomposition Theorem. He also plans
to work on questions regarding the positivity properties of adjoint linear
systems in positive characteristic. Such results are already known in
characteristic zero, the fundamental tool in the proofs being Kodaira's
vanishing theorem and its generalizations. The main difficulty in extending
these results to positive characteristic is the failure of vanishing theorems in
the new setting. However, new tools based on the Frobenius homomorphism have
been developed in the past few years. The PI plans to use some of these tools
(for example, his work with Schwede on Seshadri constants in positive
characteristic) to attack several problems in this setting.
