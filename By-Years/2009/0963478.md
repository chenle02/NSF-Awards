The past decade has seen unprecedented interaction between artificial
intelligence and game theory, with exciting intellectual problems, technical
results, and potentially important applications. However, this thriving
interaction has thus far not challenged in a fundamental way some of the basic
assumptions of game theory, to include various forms of equilibrium as the
fundamental strategic concept. Equilibrium specifies conditions under which the
strategic choices of agents are in some sense stable. Equilibria are clever and
beautiful constructs, but they embody strong idealized assumptions and as a
result their applicability to complex, realistic games (i.e., formalizable
'social' interactions) is limited. Arguably computer science can provide
alternative modeling foundations, or at least significantly contribute to them.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores several complementary directions, to
include: alternatives to equilibrium as game solution criteria; replacing
analysis of large, complex games with analysis of their abbreviated or
approximate versions; using machine-learning techniques to model the extent to
which agent behavior is strategic, adaptive, or otherwise intelligent;
investigating the role of strategic reasoning in controlled but rich
environments, such as Computational Billiards, which involves continuous state
and actions spaces as well as control uncertainty. One of the outreach and
educational components of this project is organizing and participating in an
annual Computational Billiards competition. Applications range from electronic
commerce to social networks to peer-to-peer systems to online games, and in
general all settings in which individual interests intertwine with computational
elements.
