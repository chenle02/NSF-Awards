Research is proposed on nucleation processes of vapor and solid in liquid
helium 3 and helium 4 as well as in helium 3 / helium 4 solutions, on the
equation of state of liquid helium 3, and on the surface of solid helium.
Studies of the properties of the two distinct heliums (isotopes) help advance
our understanding of the role of quantum mechanics in the basic structure of
matter.
