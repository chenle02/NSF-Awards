This project will study eigenvalue optimization and robust methods in nonlinear
programming. The research on eigenvalue optimization will consider variational
properties of the spectral radius map and the mapping that yields the maximum
real part of the spectrum. Robust global algorithms and robust local theory
using the behavior of convex composite functions will be developed. Particular
attention will be given to techniques that permit the relaxation of regularity
hypotheses. This research has applications in modeling complex chemical
processes, optimal design of structures, feedback stabilization, and
stabilization of dynamical systems.
