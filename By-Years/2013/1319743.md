The proposed research addresses the algorithmic complexity of very basic
optimization tasks - network partitioning, solving linear equations, satisfying
logical formulas, and other constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). Previous
research on these kinds of problems suggested the existence of either very
efficient algorithms yielding solutions of a certain quality, or very
inefficient algorithms achieving perfect quality. However recent research,
including a newly evolving algorithmic technique called the "SOS method",
suggests the possibility of a nontrivial tradeoff between efficiency and
quality. Specifically, the work has the following three technical
goals:&lt;br/&gt;1. Further understand the power and the limitations of the SOS
Method.&lt;br/&gt;2. Improve the known NP-hardness results for CSPs, with an
emphasis on giving evidence against subexponential-time algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;3.
Find new random families of CSP instances - especially "Small-Set Expansion" or
"Unique Games" instances - which seem algorithmically
difficult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will ultimately have broad impact
on the practice of algorithms; more specifically, on developing (and ruling out)
truly efficient heuristics for solving constraint satisfaction problems. It is
also possible that the research on finding new families of hard-seeming CSP
instances may lead to advances in cryptography.
