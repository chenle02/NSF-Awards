Members of the bacterial genus Frankia enter into a dinitrogen- fixing
symbiosis with several non-leguminous plants; one of the unusual aspects of this
symbiosis is the presence of hopanoid lipids in the root nodules. An aim of this
research is to isolate and examine mutants deficient in one or another aspect of
hopanoid biosynthesis in order to determine the functional role of these lipids
in the symbiosis. A second aim will be to assess the influence of hopanoids in
establishing the symbiosis.
