9413229 Phillips This award to large group of outstanding faculty from Rice
University, Baylor College of Medicine and the University of Houston provides
funds for support of a training program on computational aspects of modern
biology, including experimental and theoretical analyses of macromolecular
structure using crystallographic, microscopic and other experimental techniques,
and computational analysis of genomic structure. The faculty groups from each
institution provide complementary skills in biochemistry, biophysics and
computer science, resulting in a program broader and stronger than could be
provided by the individual institutions. Important aspects of the training
include dual mentorship for postdoctoral trainees, a large summer undergraduate
program and a biannual national symposium on selected topics in computational
biology. This award is also supported by the New Technology Program of the
Division of Advanced Scientific Computing and by the Computational Biology
Activity of the Division of Biological Instrumentation and Resources. ***
