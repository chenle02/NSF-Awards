1515869 &lt;br/&gt;Jay, Steven M. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award supports the
2015 annual Conference of the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles
(ISEV) held in Bethesda, MD. The Conference brings together scientists,
clinicians, industry, and government stakeholders to facilitate dialogue for
establishing new and innovative research platforms and technologies and
identifying new challenges in the field. One of the goals of the meeting is to
educate students, young investigators, investigators from underrepresented
groups, and female investigators in the latest developments of this topic.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting will focus on all aspects of extracellular
vesicle (EV) research, including fundamental research on the cellular processes
that lead to EV biogenesis, EV biomanufacturing, and deployment of EVs as
biopharmaceuticals. Specific Conference topics will include Purification and
Characterization Methods of Extracellular Vesicles (EVs), Scalable
Biomanufacturing of EVs, EVs in Drug and Gene Delivery, EVs as Biomarkers,
Preclinical Animal Models of EV-related Physiology, Mathematical and
Computational Modeling of EV Trafficking and Physiological Roles of EVs.
