ABSTRACT Rayner, J.T. 9319039 This project will construct a 0.9-5.5 um medium
cross- dispersed spectrograph for use as a facility instrument at the 3-meter
NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) on Mauna Kea. In conjunction with a fast
tip-tilt secondary at the IRTF, the spectrograph will accommodate 0.25-0.30"
images at 1-2.5 um and diffraction-limited a spectral resolution of R=1200,
through a 0.3"x5" slit. The instrument will use a 512x512 Insb focal plane
array. The major innovation in this instrument over existing spectrographs is
the capability of observing over the entire near infrared range at high
sensitivity and at very high angular resolution, making it an ideal instrument
for a number of key astronomical projects. These include spectroscopic surveys
of small bodies in the solar system to enhance studies of how our solar system
formed, spectroscopic surveys of young stellar objects in the most nearby
molecular clouds to probe sites of possible planet formation, spectroscopic
surveys of star forming regions to spectrally type young embedded stars to
provide new insights into star formation, investigation of galaxy formation and
early evolution, and distinguishing starbursts and monsters in powerful infrared
galaxies. ***
