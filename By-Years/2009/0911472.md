The Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) program of the Division of Chemistry
will support the research program of Prof. Julia Xiaojun Zhao of University of
North Dakota. Prof. Zhao and her students will develop a series of new near-
infrared fluorescent (NIRF) nanoparticles for sensitive detection and imaging of
trace analytes in biosamples. The resulting fluorescent nanoparticles are
expected to show highly intense and photostable fluorescence signals, clearly
discrete excitation and emission peaks, high water solubility, high
biocompatibility and low toxicity. These particles are likely to find use in
biomedical, environmental and homeland security applications. The project will
provide excellent training opportunities to students in bionanotechnology. Prof.
Zhao will continue her on-going educational and outreach activities aiming to
engage Native American undergraduate students in her research and promote the
field of nanoscience to a wide audience in the State of North Dakota.
