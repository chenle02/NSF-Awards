This REU site project allows eight undergraduate students to
participate&lt;br/&gt;in a ten-week summer program at Computer Science
Department of Utah&lt;br/&gt;State University. This summer program focuses on
several hands-on&lt;br/&gt;stimulating research projects including face
recognition, eye tracking,&lt;br/&gt;digital watermarking, image compression,
and content based image&lt;br/&gt;retrieval. These projects will address the
broad spectrums and the&lt;br/&gt;challenging issues in the field of computer
vision and image processing&lt;br/&gt;(CVIP) and will emphasize on several CVIP
techniques and their important&lt;br/&gt;utilities in some interesting and
crucial applications. The REU&lt;br/&gt;participants will be presented with a
broad range of components in these&lt;br/&gt;research topics so that each
student will be able to choose a component&lt;br/&gt;of a project rather than
have one assigned. This research will ensure at&lt;br/&gt;least four of the
eight participants are underrepresented students and&lt;br/&gt;ensure at least
four students are from other institutions, especially&lt;br/&gt;those
institutions where research programs are limited. This active
and&lt;br/&gt;regional recruitment plan will especially help underrepresented
students&lt;br/&gt;and the students who are limited exposed to research to be
acquainted&lt;br/&gt;with interesting research projects and gain confidence in
pursuing their&lt;br/&gt;degrees, seeking industrial technology related jobs,
and continuing&lt;br/&gt;pursuing an advanced degree in graduate
schools.&lt;br/&gt;
