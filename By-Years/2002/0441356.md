The Romanian site of Graunceanu is a rich Pliocene locale in Eastern Europe but
comprehensive excavations have not been undertaken there in forty years.
Currently, Graunceanu is tenuously correlated with a variety of European sites,
depending on which taxon one uses for comparison. It has the potential to be a
very important biochronological reference locality due to its unique faunal
assemblage and geo-temporal position. However, the biochronological and
paleoecological importance of this site has never been realized due to the lack
of accurate dating. The discovery of putative stone tools at an associated
outcrop raises the possibility that hominins known to have occupied Dmanisi may
have also occupied this site as well. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research could
expand our knowledge of European biochronology while assessing the feasibility
of obtaining paleomagnetic or radiometric dates. It will also enhance
collaboration with Romanian scientists.&lt;br/&gt;
