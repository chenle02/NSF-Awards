The primary objective of the proposed project is to locate study sites at which
alternative models for the evolution of primate social systems may be tested.
One theoretical model postulates that the transformation of one social system to
another involves a discrete and predictable sequence of changes in association
patterns among males and females. According to this model, the transformation
from social systems based upon female kin groups to groups of unrelated females,
involves an intermediate step in which females do not associate with other
females. An alternate model postulates the direct transformation of the typical
female-bonded, multi-male groups of savannah baboons into the non-female-bonded,
one male units of hamadryas baboons. In the latter ecological factors are
identified that alter the nature of asociations among females and the nature of
relationships among females and males. The investigator ultimately will test
divergent predictions derived from these models by studying the relationship
between environmental conditions and social orgnization in two populations of
chacma baboons that vary in their habitat and group structure. The investigator
will survey sites in Namibia, Botswana and the Republic of South Africa for
feasibility and desirability.
