Wireless Internet Center for Advanced Technology (WICAT)&lt;br/&gt;Proposal
#1127960&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks funding for the Wireless
Internet Center for Advanced Technology (WICAT) sites at the Polytechnic
Institute of NYU (lead), Auburn University, the University of Virginia, and the
Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. Funding Requests for
Fundamental Research are authorized by an NSF approved solicitation, NSF 10-601.
The solicitation invites I/UCRCs to submit proposals for support of industry-
defined fundamental research. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Increasing demand for video
services on handheld and other wireless devices has made efficient exchange of
video data using wireless devices a necessity. However the continual changes in
user demand, network traffic and hardware of the wireless environment pose
significant research challenges to achieving this goal. The proposed research
seeks to address these challenges via a three pronged effort to explore wireless
technologies able to adapt to changing communication system states. A test bed
environment for the conduct of the proposed work that will provide system
surveillance and cloud computing infrastructure will be provided by Cisco
Systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Efficient and seamless use of video on wireless
platforms in the emerging cloud computing environment will have major economic
impact in virtually all economic sectors. Ubiquitous implementation and
widespread adoption of these services will also create societal impact through
the degree of communication it will enable. The proposed work has the potential
to inform and define approaches to achieving this video content integration. The
work has the potential to strengthen collaborative ties and link resources among
the four participating center sites to further both research and education in
this critical area.
