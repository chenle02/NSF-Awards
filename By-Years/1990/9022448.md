The phenomenon of accelerated deformation observed during undrained soil creep
as a bifurcation problem will be investigated. A quasi-static linear stability
analysis and a fully nonlinear analysis to analyze the problem of localization
in rate-dependent materials will be performed. The scope of the proposed
research ranges from theoretical formulation, to micro- and macro-mechanical
analyses, numerical modeling, and experimentation.
