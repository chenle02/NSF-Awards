This RAPID project supports the analysis of satellite data following the August
14, 2021, Haiti earthquake (M=7.2) by combining Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 InSAR
observations. The analysis will allow preliminary interpretation of the
interaction of strike-slip and thrust faults that rupture during the Haiti
earthquake sequence. Systematic release of preliminary and refined images as
each new satellite pass occurs (~5-7 days) and as the aftershock sequence and
supporting field work takes place. InSAR, along with aftershock relocations,
will be critical to help define the fault geometry necessary for understanding
the rupture and subsequent stress changes on adjacent faults. Updated images
will be released right after each acquisition
(https://topex.ucsd.edu/haiti_7.2/). Early distribution of these data to local
field scientists informs geologic mapping that will contribute to collecting
ephemeral data on surface slip. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Higher accuracy InSAR
observations produced using the GMTSAR package, with stacking and noise
reduction, combining data from Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2, are critical for future
modeling efforts. The method increases the accuracy of InSAR line-of-sight (LoS)
deformation maps while providing data products to help researchers identify
ancillary fault structures with co- and post-seismic slip that will be
constrained at large scale by available GPS data. The InSAR imagery can help
resolve how significant the component of dip slip on the eastern segment of the
Enriquillo Plantain Gardens Fault is and how its interaction with thrust faults
is a major factor controlling this fault segmentation and thus impacts the
seismic hazard in this trans-pressive boundary of the Caribbean plate. This
project will support a female graduate student who will process the images
weekly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
