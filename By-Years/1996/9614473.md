9614473 Van Schmus This project to continue work on 1100 to 550 Ma tectonic
evolution of NE Brazil and correlative parts of west-central Africa, with
particular emphasis on developing a comprehensive understanding of a major
1100-900 Ma orogen recently defined in this region. The principal methods used
will be U/Pb, Sm/Nd and Rb/Sr geochronology and isotopic geochemistry in
conjunction with other studies by Brazilian collaborators. Results of these
studies will be useful in efforts to piece together a detailed picture of
continental breakup and reassembly during the Neoproterozoic for one of the
largest fold belts formed during the 600 Ma assembly of the West Gondwana.
