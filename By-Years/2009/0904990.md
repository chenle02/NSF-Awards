PetaFlops Acoustic Simulation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Dinesh
Manocha&lt;br/&gt;Department of Computer Science&lt;br/&gt;University of North
Carolina&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project proposes to develop a scalable, petaflop
computational infrastructure for acoustic simulation. The main focus will be on
developing massively parallel algorithms that can exploit the computational
capabilities of many-core accelerators, such as graphics processing units
(GPUs), to achieve the desired performance. The main research components
include: (1) development of highly accurate and low dispersion numerical methods
for solving acoustic wave equation;&lt;br/&gt;(2) massively parallel algorithms
for efficient numeric and geometric acoustic propagation; (3) software libraries
to run millions of threads on GPU clusters to achieve petaflop acoustic
performance based on sound field decomposition; and (4) acoustic analysis of
complex CAD models. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this effort are
interdisciplinary and span across academia and industry, including new
application software libraries for many-core accelerators.
