The program coordinators propose to organize a workshop titled "The Internet as
a Large-Scale Complex System" to be held at the Santa Fe Institute in March
2001. The main purpose of the workshop is to provide a forum for disseminating
relevant accomplishments and discussing future challenges associated with trying
to gain a solid understanding of the dynamics and evolution of the global
Internet from a broad and still unconventional perspective-complex systems
dynamics. The coordinators plan to bring together network researchers with a
group of distinguished researchers with expertise ranging from statistical
physics, dynamical systems theory, and control theory to biological, physical
and social systems. Select contributions from invited speakers will be published
as part of the SFI book series by Oxford University Press.
