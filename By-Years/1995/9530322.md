9530322 Roy The proposed project is to study the possibility of growing single-
crystal diamond in a Czochralski-type process from a metallic liquid at low
pressures. Professor Roy has recently demonstrated precipitation of diamond from
these metallic melts. These metallic melts are alloys of the metal, carbon, and
hydrogen. In the proposed process, the melts would be formed in the 2.45 GHz
microwave plasma furnace or in the hot-filament diamond growth unit. Small seed
crystals of diamond would be touched to the surface of the metallic melt and
then, if diamond grows on the seed crystal, would be slowly pulled from the
melt. In another method, the alloy would be melted on top of a single crystal
diamond seed. Addition diamond would grow onto the seed. Following growth the
diamond would be characterized using standard techniques. %%% Diamond is an
increasingly important industrial material. If successful, the method of growing
diamond at low pressures would dramatically reduce the fabrication cost of
diamond. ***
