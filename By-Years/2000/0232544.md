This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a novel
temperature-adaptive nano-crystalline combinatorial self-lubricating coating for
cutting tools. Solid lubricant and hard phase combinatorial coated tools have
significant potential application for machining applications. Currently
available self-lubricating coatings have a soft lubricant phase deposited over a
hard phase. The soft phase quickly wears out leaving the under layer of hard
phase without lubrication. Also, todays lubricant coatings do not offer
temperature adaptability. Both of these problems are addressed will be addressed
in this project. The commercial potential of this project will be tools that
have an extremely wear-resistant nano-composite coatings which will increase the
life of a tool. This technology will have siginificant impact on the cutting
tool and die industries.
