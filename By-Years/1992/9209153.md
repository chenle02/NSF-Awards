This project will focus on the development of a design environment to rapidly
design and produce toys. This environment aims to help the domestic toy industry
gain competitiveness by speedily designing and producing new toys to meet
changing market demands. The project will first outline an information system
for model kits and their plastic injection molds with regard to the design,
fabrication, storage, and setup of molds to improve the efficiency of the model
kits' design and production. A method for quick mold, for improving the model
design, and for making new molds by redesigning existing ones through structural
information query will be investigated. The system is expected to capture the
design knowledge of existing model kits and their molds, to reduce the cost and
planning time required for a new design, and to reduce overall setup time for
mold production.
