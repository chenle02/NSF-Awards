Funds are provided for a comprehensive and quantitative assessment of:
&lt;br/&gt;(1) the magnitude and variability of the conductive heat flow and the
total winter conductive heat loss through lake ice and its snow cover,
&lt;br/&gt;(2) the proportions of the conductive heat flow and total conductive
heat loss that are due to water freezing on the bottom of the ice cover
(congelation ice formation) and flooding and freezing of slush at the ice
surface (snow ice formation), and &lt;br/&gt;(3) how the magnitude and
variability of these proportions would be affected by a changing climate
manifested by air temperature and precipitation changes. &lt;br/&gt;At four
sites across Alaska, with different weather and climate conditions, snow depth
and density, snow and ice temperatures, snow ice and congelation ice growth, and
total ice thickness will be measured during winter 2004-05 and 2005-06 at three
ponds. At the three sites that are remote from Fairbanks (Barrow, Nome, and
Seward), measurements will be made by teachers and students who are participants
in the ALISON (Alaska Lake ice and Snow Observatory Network) project.
Contemporary processes and the effects of climate variability and change will be
modeled with a one-dimensional numerical model of lake ice growth.&lt;br/&gt;
