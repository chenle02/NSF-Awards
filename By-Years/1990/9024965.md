This research program addresses the need for a numerical model to compute
tsunami propagation and runup. Specifically, it addresses the task of
transferring to the United States a sophisticated computer code developed by
Professor Shuto at Tohoku University in Japan. This model can reproduce the
maximum runup along the west coast of Japan which occurred as a result of the
tsunami (seismic sea wave) generated by the 1983 Nihonkai-chubu earthquake.
Significant experience has now been accumulated by Japanese researchers in
applying the model to field cases. This research project involves the non-
trivial task of transferring this code to run on computers in the United States,
where it will be available for use in tsunami research, and as a predictive
model for determining potential tsunami flooding along coastal areas. Professor
Shuto is assisting in this task.
