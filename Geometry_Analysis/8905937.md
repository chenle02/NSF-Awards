Essential computer studies will be used by the principal investigator to
formulate theories concerning formation of singularities of maps between smooth
Riemannian manifolds. These maps evolve both by harmonic map heat flow and mean
curvature heat flow. Specifically, he will investigate time durations for
singularity formation, the dependence of blow-up times on the singularity's
codimension, and whether such heat flows may be extended in unique fashion past
the singularity. The work extends known theories of nonsingular heat flows and
the special case of non-positively curved target manifolds. Computers will be
used extensively in this project. Equations modeling physical systems such as
phase boundaries in chemical reactions and liquid crystals will be the subject
of a systematic study. The principal investigator will use numerical studies to
suggest quantities which in turn will be used as barrier functions for
theoretical estimates.
