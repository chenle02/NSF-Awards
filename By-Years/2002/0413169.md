This project aims to advance the understanding of energy-based stereo-matching
techniques. Using new stereo data sets with ground-truth disparities, the
research will address the question: "What is the right energy function to
minimize?" The specific goals include developing an automated system for
obtaining highly accurate multi-view stereo data sets with ground truth, and
designing new energy functions whose minimization yields disparities that (1)
accurately model occlusion, (2) align occlusion boundaries with object
boundaries using monocular cues, and (3) create reasonable disparity hypotheses
in half-occluded regions. Stereo algorithms that perform well on these
challenging tasks have important applications in emerging consumer-level
applications, including virtual gaze correction for teleconferencing, and the
creation of image-based object models for 3D visualization. The research will
also focus on developing fast, approximate energy minimization techniques,
including variants of graph-cut and dynamic programming methods. Undergraduate
students will be actively involved in all components of this research, in
particular in the data acquisition and testing stages. The intellectual merits
of the project are to provide the computer vision community with high-quality,
multi-view data sets with ground truth and to improve the state of the art in
energy-based image-matching techniques. The broader impacts of the project
include the improved applicability of computer vision methods to applications
that are becoming central to society, such as telecommunication and e-commerce;
and the opportunity to expose undergraduates at a liberal-arts college to the
world of research, experimentation, and discovery.
