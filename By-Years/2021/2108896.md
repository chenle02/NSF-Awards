Catalyst Projects provide support for Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCU) to work towards establishing research capacity of faculty to
strengthen science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)
undergraduate education and research. It is expected that the award will further
the faculty member's research capability, improve research and teaching at the
institution, and involve undergraduate students in research experiences.
Virginia State University, in collaboration with Dillard University, proposes to
develop mathematical concepts in language, literacy, and discourse as a means of
increasing accessibility to College Algebra. Specifically, the project seeks to
incorporate aspects of the Algebra Project’s approach to content and pedagogy
into experimental sections of College Algebra. The Algebra Project’s emphasis on
shared concrete events and student discourse distinguishes this approach from
the conventional structure of college math courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project seeks to broaden participation in STEM by addressing an underlying issue
in the College Algebra to Calculus Transition. This project aims to produce an
experimental College Algebra course based upon the mathematics content and
pedagogy developed over the past twenty years within the Algebra Project. This
thematic reconstruction of College Algebra – based upon the Algebra Project’s
experiential learning model – holds the promise of deepening student
understanding of College Algebra and simultaneously providing a conceptual and
procedural foundation for the study of Calculus and the quantitative sciences
that depend upon it for student populations that traditionally have not had
access to this course of study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
