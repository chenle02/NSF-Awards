Modern mobile platforms, such as the Google Android and Apple iPhone, are
reinventing the mobile landscape by opening up third-party development and by
providing sophisticated productivity, communication, and application suites. In
addition, mobile devices are increasingly used to store sensitive personal
information such as financial and medical data. Mobile environments face a wide
range of unique security challenges. First, emerging mobile platforms have
vastly different security and trust models. Second, techniques that worked for
securing desktops do not transition well to mobile environments because mobile
devices are highly resource constrained. Finally, mobile devices have inherently
different usability patterns than traditional desktops that impact
security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores a new model for mobile
security based on moving the complexity of malware detection to an in-cloud
security service rather than performing analysis locally on each mobile device.
We will investigate in-cloud security services for mobile devices based on an
architecture that consists of a lightweight agent that runs on mobile devices
interposing on access of applications and data, and a network service that
identifies malicious applications using parallel signature, behavioral, and
reputation-based detection engines. Our approach is structured around three
objectives: (1) functionality across a wide variety of mobile platforms and
security models, (2) minimal on-device CPU, memory, and power resources, and (3)
security that adapts to mobile usability patterns. We will work with our
industry partners to facilitate the deployment of the techniques and methods
developed through this effort on live operational
networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
