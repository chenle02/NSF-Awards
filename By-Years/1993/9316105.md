9316105 Saleeby The emplacement of large batholiths in compressional setting
raises classic arguments about how space requirements are met, and the degree to
which batholiths create their air space. This proposal will investigate the
suggestion that a set of ductile shear zones from the southern Sierra Nevada
batholith may represent deformation related to pluton emplacement dynamics which
are linked kinematically to the Tehachapi-Rand thrust system. A test of this
hypothesis involves establishing a firm physical and temporal link between the
shear zones and the thrust system. Results will help resolve the local debate,
and as the Sierra Nevada is commonly regarded as the type exposure of a
batholithic belt, they will have importance generally.
