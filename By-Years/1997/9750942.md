The department is developing a networked scanning probe microscope (SPM) core
facility to serve students and faculty throughout the state. Access for students
from large introductory laboratories is being provided through a computer
workstation facility. Students from smaller advanced classes, and other
campuses, can access the SPM directly through onsite visitations. Remote access
is being provided through the existing Integrated Services Digital Network and
can also be provided through a new broad bandwidth network. On campus, the new
facility is anchoring general and advanced microscopy courses, supporting
interdisaiplinary science instruction in introductory and advanced science
laboratories, and facilitating interdisciplinary research projects. The campus
is acting as a hub for SPM activity and as a gateway to other remote-access core
microscopy facilities being developed. Specially developed mini-courses (e.g.,
nanotechnology or cell biology), using SPM technology, are being provided for
science teachers on a regular basis.
