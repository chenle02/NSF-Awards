Proposal: DMS 9504485 PI: Frits Ruymgaart Institution: Texas Tech Title: Inverse
Estimation Problems Abstract: Inverse estimation is concerned with indirect
curve estimation: the curve of interest is to be recovered from observations,
subject to random blur, on a transformation of the curve. This class of problems
is very broad and formally contains ordinary, direct, curve estimation as a
special case. Many interesting examples come from physics, signal processing,
statistics, and applied mathematics. The estimation problem can essentially be
solved by inverting the transformation involved. Since this inverse is not in
general continuous, the problem is typically ill-posed and regularization of the
inverse is required. Two important questions are how restriction, due to
limitations in time or space, of the transformation relate to the unrestricted
transformation, and how recovery of irregular curves can be modified so as to
avoid the Gibbs phenomenon. Along with a comprehensive study of deconvolution on
locally compact Abelian groups, this research addresses these questions. Also,
the study of some examples of practical interest are explored. Inverse
estimation arises when an object, e.g., part of the human brain, can only be
indirectly observed, and recovery of information about the object is required
from the indirect measurements. Indirect measurement techniques, such as those
used in medical imagery, are attractive because they are noninvasive. Perfect
reconstruction of the image would, in principle, be possible if an unlimited
number of uncorrupted measurements were available. In practice, however, one can
only obtain finitely many data that, moreover, are corrupted by measurement
errors. Here statistical considerations and techniques play a role in the image
reconstruction process. Aspects addressed in this research include how the
reconstruction depends on the specific way in which the indirect data are
collected, and al so how it should be tuned to prior information about the
object to be recovered.
