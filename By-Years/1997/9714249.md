HACU's National Internship Program is a fully administered and carefully-
managed ten-week program that places college students in stimulating and
challenging professional and educational roles within the federal sector.
Utilizing an intensive summer model, HACU and the sponsoring agencies and
departments provide academically qualified students with experience-based
learning. Student interns are placed federal offices and laboratories in the
Washington, DC metropolitan area and in field sites throughout the United States
and Puerto Rico. Student placements are based upon position descriptions
provided by supervisors which detail the academic preparation, work experience
and special skills required to perform the job. This project is jointly
supported by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, MPS, and the Office of
the Director, Directorate Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences, Directorate
for Computer and Information Science and Engineering, and Directorate for
Engineering.
