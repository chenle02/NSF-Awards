Although governments, academics and policy-makers agree about the large benefits
of education in societal outcomes, investment in education amongst the poor
remains low. One reason, cited by researchers in economics, is that poor people
have low expectations about the value of education when compared to estimates
from data. Another potential explanation is psychological. Work in sociology
finds that poor families have more pessimistic outlooks on the future value of
education due to obstacles like low quality schools, larger financial
constraints and racial discrimination. Perhaps most striking, recent empirical
studies find that providing poor people access to resources increases their
expectations on the value of education, despite no information being provided
about the value per se.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building on these findings, one
possible theory is that low expectations help individuals cope with low access
to an investment. Rather than lamenting a small chance to make a potentially
life-changing investment, individuals feel better by underestimating its value,
a theory called "the sour grapes effect". The goal in this project is to utilize
the economic tools of a laboratory setting to explore this effect, and the
relationship between access and beliefs more broadly. The lab provides a clear
methodological advantage as empirical studies to date suffer from likely
confounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in
attempting to study a real-world problem with a novel psychological intuition
that can be framed using rigorous theory and investigated through experimental
methodologies. The research agenda is grounded in the theory of decision-making
under ambiguity and may document a new violation of (Subjective) Expected
Utility theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research agenda makes some important
contributions and has potentially broader impacts. Exploring the access-based
beliefs could increase our understanding of how perceived (not estimated)
beliefs of the returns to education are formed, an important determinant of
schooling decisions. Furthermore, access-based beliefs may be the source of a
cycle of low access, and investment that traps people in poverty. Lastly, they
would suggest a novel pathway for the efficacy of social programs that expand
access to public goods, namely that optimistic beliefs may play an important
role. Ultimately, research that furthers our knowledge on how subjective beliefs
on the returns to investment are formed can help create better models of
decision-making under uncertainty and inform policy-makers in a variety of
contexts.
