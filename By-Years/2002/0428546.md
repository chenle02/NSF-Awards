Proposal NO: 0428546 - Won
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of
this research is to develop autonomously aligning micro-navigation sensor
network for small satellites. In particular, the PI and his students will
develop a novel laser alignment technique for the autonomous attitude alignment,
a new nonlinear optimal control theory for sensor attitude control, a multi-
sensor integration method for accurate attitude determination, a micro-
navigation sensor network for a group of small satellites, and a testbed for
verification of the new theories and algorithms. Furthermore, the PI will
develop a spacecraft systems engineering course to educate and train students.
The PI will also establish a laboratory to enhance the research infrastructure,
and to integrate research and education.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; As intellectual
merits of this proposal, theories and techniques for an autonomously aligning
micro-navigation sensor network will be developed. Two laser beams will be used
for automatic alignment of the satellite's attitude. A novel optimal control
theory called cost density control or statistical control will be developed and
applied for the search and control of the laser beams. Accurate position and
orientation determinations problems will be addressed using multi-sensor
estimation and integration methods. Then developed theories and algorithms will
be verified by building a testbed. As for the broader impact, this project will
supplement the research goals of the university and it will provide a great
opportunity for engineering students to learn by performing high-quality
research. This proposal will build a research infrastructure through the Control
and Micro-Space Systems Laboratory. Moreover, students will be trained in the
newly developed Spacecraft Systems Engineering course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
