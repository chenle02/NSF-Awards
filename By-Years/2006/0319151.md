This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance
innovative sensing technology to overcome the limitations of a broad range of
undeclared airborne toxic industrial chemicals (TIMs) by incorporating a large
number of arrays of sensing elements numbering in the 100's or 1000's into a
package smaller than a conventional pager, including all data analysis, display,
and batteries. In addition, this innovative technology can be applied to metal
oxide semiconductors, polymer based sensors or any other sensing material. Large
arrays allow much greater breadth as well as sensitivity of electronic nose
devices, making them a viable option for low cost, accurate detector or analysis
tool for personal air quality monitoring as well as for many industrial
applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial applications for a low cost,
small, rugged, simple and accurate sensor, capable of detecting a wide variety
of chemicals, range from personal air quality monitoring to the food and
beverage industry; from the medical field to military units; from permanent
sensor installations (similar to smoke detectors) in hazardous areas to
installation in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV's). The instrument can be used to
analyze a patient's breath to diagnose diseases or on a battle field to detect
chemical warfare agents and can be used in the rapid development and analysis of
new sensing elements. Because the technology is very similar to current standard
manufacturing techniques, the units can be produced in mass for small per unit
price, and sold in a variety of markets. &lt;br/&gt;
