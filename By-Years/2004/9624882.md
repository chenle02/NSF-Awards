9624882 He Semiconductor optoelectronic devices, such as laser diodes, light
emitting diodes, optical waveguides, electrooptic modulators, and
photodetectors, have important applications in optical communication and control
systems because of their convenience, efficiency, and natural compatibility with
modern electronics. Research on high performance semiconductor photodetectors
using low temperature (LT) deposition technology is proposed for the PI's career
development plan. The PI's current research focuses on the study of the
microstructural and electrical properties of LT thin metal films. The most
important characteristics of the low-temperature deposited thin metal films,
compared with conventional room temperature deposited films, are: (1)
tremendously increased Schottky barrier height; and (2) greatly lowered
resistivity when they are very thin (less than 100 A); both of which are
superior qualities for many optoelectronic devices, such as a metal
semiconductor-metal (MSM) photodiode, which is one of the best choices for high-
speed photodetectors. The proposed research plan is to (1) explore the
electrical characteristics of LT thin films on several new semiconductor
materials, including InGaAs, AlGaAs and SiGe, which are often used for
photodetectors; (2) implement this technique to device fabrication; (3) optimize
device design; and (4) carry out the device fabrication and characterization. It
is anticipated that the application of the low-temperature thin metal films will
result in a significant enhancement of device performance. Such a high-
performance photodetector will have an important impact in optoelectronic
integrated circuit (OEIC) technology. The goal of the PI's education plan is to
educate productive engineers for today's industrial and academic needs and to
provide newly developed technology to aid students' professional development.
Concurrently with the PI's research program, two senior elective and graduate
level courses in optoelectro nic devices, as well as semiconductor material and
device characterization are being developed by the PI in the Department of
Electrical Engineering at Northern Illinois University. Innovation in these
courses will focus on the development of laboratory components for both courses,
which will provide a strong synergy between the PI's research program and
education goals. ***
