This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop new
techniques to treat both internal and external surfaces of polymer tubing such
as catheters. The treatments will modify the surfaces to facilitate attachment
of bioactive coatings, clean, sterilize, or reduce friction; similar processes
can also deposit organic or inorganic coatings. Plasmas driven by electron
cyclotron resonance (ECR) will treat the lumen and external surfaces more
uniformly, and over a greater range of parameters, than conventional plasmas and
can be spatially localized to provide different effects on each.

The ECR plasma process should be expandable to large-scale, low-cost commercial
production coating and surface modification of catheters. Surface treatments to
facilitate attachment of bioactive coatings to hemodialysis and other catheter
types would have societal benefits by extending the period between catheter
replacements clear therapeutic and economic.
