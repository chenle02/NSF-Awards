9528439 Ezekiel Massachusetts Institute of Technology "Improving Access to High
Quality Network-Based Education and Training" This project was requested and
funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). NSF is handling the
award because of its interest in this and related projects, some joint-funded
with ARPA. The award supports an 18 month project to investigate seamless
delivery of high-quality interactive multimedia programing using CD-ROM (local)
and server (network) content over a wide spectrum of bandwidths. In addition to
two prmtotypical programs being developed, deliverables include client and
server software, research reports, publications and tutorials and colloquia.
Most of the effort will be performed by Dartmouth College and Medical School
under a subcontract to MIT. MIT is the prime on two related awards and is
coordinating the entire effort. The University of Georgia is providing
assessment of learning outcomes under a subcontract to Dartmouth.
