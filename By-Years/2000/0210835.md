This four-year Nanoscale Interdisciplinary Research Team (NIRT) project at the
University of New Mexico, with Professor Timothy Ward as principal investigator,
will investigate the potential to spatially engineer the structure and
composition of porous composite nanoparticles with functionalities not
previously achieved. The research will focus on particles whose basic
scaffolding is a precisely organized inorganic (oxide) nanostructure created by
self-assembly of amphiphilic molecules and hydrophilic precursors. The synthesis
of silica/surfactant self-assembly will rely on evaporation-induced self-
assembly (EISA) within confined environment of an evaporating droplet as opposed
to nucleated self-assembly conducted in bulk solution. Using the EISA technique,
four general classes of particle architecture, some containing functional
components positioned within or at the surfaces of particles, will be
investigated. The resultant functionalized nanoparticles and composites could
provide a reservoir for sensing or therapeutic agents whose action or delivery
is coupled to molecular recognition functionality at the particle surface and is
mediated by controlled transfer through nanoporous channels.
