This award is for an integrated Scanning Probe Microscope - Raman scattering -
Scanning Near-field Optical Microscopy (SNOM) system for undergraduate research
at Coe College. In addition, it will be used by researchers at Cornell College
and Mt. Mercy University and two local companies. The instrument will allow for
simultaneous spectroscopic and topological measurements in materials, and for
the training of undergraduate students. Scientifically, the hybrid system will
be used on laser modifications of amorphous materials; on measurements of phase
separation and corrosion in technologically useful glasses; on studies of rare
earth doping and clustering; on investigations of biocements; on the study of
functionalized glass microspheres for catalysis applications; and, the bonding
of polyoxometalates and surfaces. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new integrated
scanning probe system will impact over fifty-five undergraduate students, from
the Physics, Chemistry, and Biology Departments, that participate in summer
research at Coe College. Greater than 40% of the students are first generation
college students from rural backgrounds with little access to research. The
impact of the instrument will also extend to the regional Latino High School
population through a new program led by the PI in collaboration with local
Latino engineers, scientists, and educators.
