Minority students graduating from Inner City high schools historically are
computer illiterate, have little exposure to scientific instrumentation and
generally very little interest in science. The objective of this project is to
create a successful high tech chemistry learning environment for the individual
student that can be used as a model for other inner city chemistry students. The
equipment acquired by this project included 14 Apple IIGS microcomputer/Leap
universal lab interface systems. Since theses systems are fully incorporated
into specific laboratory studies, students are able to utilize microcomputers
throughout their chemistry courses. In addition, these computers, when not used
in conjunction with the Leap interface, are used by students for calculations,
laboratory simulations, the writing of final laboratory reports, and the like.
Each semester, the department encounters students with deficiencies in the
following areas: Decision Making, Computer Literacy, Graphing, Computations,
Writing (Lab Report), Understanding Basic Scientific Principles, and Analyzing
Data. This project has provided inner city students with the opportunity and
tools needed to overcome these deficiencies. The institution has contributed to
the project in an amount equal to the NSF funds.
