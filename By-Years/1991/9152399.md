A Unified System Design Laboratory (USDL) to support an innovative approach to
the upper level systems courses in computer science is being developed at
University of North Carolina Asheville. The current operating systems course
sequence is based upon a paradigm that includes formal laboratory sections in
the core classes and project oriented laboratory work in the elective classes.
The new laboratory allows the extension of this paradigm to all of our upper
level systems classes: Operating Systems, Networking, and VLSI Design. Entry
level color Sun workstations and a file server are used. The USDL permits
building upon the faculty's special expertise in each of these areas. Wayne Lang
has taught a well attended VLSI Design class at UNCA for four years. Dean Brock
developed a popular networking class taken by most of the graduate students at
UNC-Chapel Hill. Mark Boyd created UNCA's unique Operating Systems sequence and
has worked with formal laboratories for the past six years. UNCA has a rich
history of support for undergraduate research, and a high percentage of
graduates are attending graduate school. The USDL provides experience for the
students that will enhance their undergraduate research opportunities and
encourage them to pursue further research upon graduation.
