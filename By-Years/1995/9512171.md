9512171 Dow This award provides funding to acquire two measuring instruments at
the Precision Engineering Center at North Carolina State University. The
equipment to be purchased includes an RTH Form Talysurf mechanical profilometer
with an extended vertical range of 6mm and a resolution of 10nm, and an optical
profilometer system consisting of a Zyro Maxim GP/New View 100 Surface Analyzer
and a GPIxps Laser Interferometer with a 2 mm field of view and 1A resolution
over a 100 micron vertical range. The Precision Engineering Center conducts
research and educates students in the area of high-technology precision
manufacturing. Research conducted at the facility encompasses measurement and
fabrication of optical, electronic, and mechanical devices where high precision
is required. Projects include diamond turning and the fabrication of ceramic and
glass surfaces. These instruments will improve research on a number of ongoing
projects ilvolving optical and structural components in glass and ceramic
materials, diamond Turing of brittle materials for infrared optics, measurement
of surface finish and wear of diamond films for tool coatings and tribological
surfaces, and measurement of rotationally asymmetric surfaces for electronic and
optoelectronic spherical optics.
