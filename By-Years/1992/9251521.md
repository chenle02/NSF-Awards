This project develops a laboratory for parallel processing equipped with a
32-processor network of transputers, which can be partitioned to serve four
users simultaneously. An additional transputer runs the software for
partitioning and reconfiguring the system; reconfiguration is under the control
of the users. The network of processors (or a subset) can be configured into a
variety of architectures, such as a pipe, a tree, a HyperCube, a mesh and a
torus. This equipment will first be used in the laboratory portions of three
courses: Programming Language Concepts, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, and
Computer Architecture. Later, this equipment and a network of workstations
running the Mach OS will be used to explore parallelism in the introductory
sequence of courses and in Computer Organization and Operating Systems. The
parallel machine will also be used by students who are doing senior thesis in
parallel computation.
