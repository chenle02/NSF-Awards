Dr. Daniel Szyld of Duke University will visit Dr. Ivo Marek of Charles
University, Czechoslovakia, to prepare a cooperative research project on
computational mathematics. The resulting proposal is intended for consideration
under the U.S.-Czechoslovakia Cooperative Science Program and if successful,
should contribute to our knowledge of iterative methods for solution of linear
systems of algebraic systems of equations.
