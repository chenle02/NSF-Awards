9362063 Nicholson A new laser crystal, praeseodymium yttrium lithium fluoride,
is being proposed for development for applications in holographic
interferometry. Most pulsed laser holographic interferometry is presently
performed with either frequency doubled neodymium yag or with ruby lasers. There
are a number of limitations imposed by either of these tow crystals, some of
which will be overcome by the new proposed crystal. Holographic also anticipates
the crystal will have significant applications in medicine and elsewhere.
Holographics proposes to prove certain aspects of the praseodymium crystal in
Phase I, such as making a seed laser and gaining single longitudinal mode in an
injection seeded gaussian mirrored oscillator. Improvements in pumping
efficiency will be attempted by using fluorescent converter and doped glass
converters. ***
