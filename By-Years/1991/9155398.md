This three year project, sponsored by The National Council for the Social
Studies, will teach 24 Middle School teachers from Maryland and District of
Columbia the basic concepts of urbanism. The program content will be based upon
the integrated study of the major disciplines which are a part of the study of
urbanism-sociology, political science, geography and economics. Using this
interdisciplinary approach teachers, under the guidance of project staff, will
develop, test and compare hypotheses about urbanism through the in- depth study
of selected cities. The result of these studies will be the development of
activities for use in the middle school classroom which illustrate the
application of the scientific method as practiced in the social sciences. During
the follow-up phase, in the academic year, the teachers will implement the
interdisciplinary program in the schools with the help of the project staff. At
the end of the project a book of fifty effective lesson plans for teaching
urbanism in the middle school and suggestions on how to use these in in-service
activities will have been produced. Matching funds from the school districts
involved, the National Council for the Social Studies and the University of
Maryland - Baltimore County are equivalent to 47% of the NSF grant.
