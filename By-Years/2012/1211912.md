The goal of this project is to develop new mathematical models of mode-locked
lasers. Models will take into account descriptions of the optical and electronic
components, and the coupling between them, on multiple time scales. The
different time scales will be exploited to provide analytical methods and
computational tools by which the nonlinear dynamics of the laser can be
analyzed. These mathematical techniques will allow a careful study of the
fundamental factors governing the existence and stability of pulse solutions,
including a determination as to how noise affects these lasers' precision.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent advances have ushered in a new era of extremely
stable ultra-short modelocked lasers, with typical pulse durations of just a few
femtoseconds. Such advanced devices are important as precise sources for
ultraviolet and infrared spectroscopy (e.g., for trace gas sensing) and optical
and microwave waveform generation (e.g., for low noise microwave sources). They
are also an essential component in optical atomic clocks, next-generation
timekeeping devices with accuracies several orders of magnitude better than
current microwave atomic clocks. A goal of this project is to provide results
capable of predicting the performance of femtosecond lasers and that will assist
scientists and engineers who design and build them. Another important component
of this project is the training of students. As part of this component, the PI
will visit Delaware State University to assist in the mentoring of applied
mathematics graduate students being advised in the field of nonlinear optics.
