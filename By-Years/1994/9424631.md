The PI requests funding to purchase shipboard instrumentation in support of
NSF-funded research. The instruments will be used aboard the R/V CAPE HENLOPEN,
a 120 foot vessel, which is owned and operated by the University.
Instrumentation requested includes a transmissometer and a light scattering
sensor. The instrumentation requested is required for support of NSF-funded
cruises aboard the CAPE HENLOPEN during 1995 and will enhance the scientific
capability of the vessel in the future. ??
