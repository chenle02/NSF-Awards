An analytical system and sampling procedures have been developed for the
determination of pore water DOC, using a modification of the high temperature,
platinum catalyzed oxidation method of Sugimura and Suzuki (1988). This approach
employs chromatographic CO2 separation, and allows quantification by flame
ionization detection or alteratively, isolation of the DOC derived CO2 for
isotopic analysis. These methods measure pore water profiles and benthic chamber
DOC fluxes in continental margin sediments from the Western North Atlantic Ocean
and are providing a set of &amp;13C (DOC) determinations on pore water samples
from the same cores. Two benthic carbon cycle studies will be carried out, one
at the Bermuda time-series site (with Dr. Fred Sayles) and the other on the Peru
continental margin (with Dr. Richard Jahnke). By carrying out the DOC
investigation within the context of broader pore water/benthic flux studies of
organic mater decomposition, the role of DOC in the carbon cycle and carbon
isotope budgets at the sea floor will be quantified.
