This project brings together Dr. William K. Smith of the Department of Botany,
the University of Wyoming , with his Australian colleague, Dr. David T. Bell of
the Department of Botany, Western Australian University. The U.S. PI will spend
approximately six months in 1993 visiting Western Australia. The proposed
research will utilize the flora of southwestern Australia to test hypotheses
regarding the functional significance of leaf structure to photosynthetic
performance. The cooperative research will test several of the hypotheses
developed by the Dr. Smith under former and continuing NSF grants, as well as a
more comprehensive and synthetic hypothesis that has recently been formulated
regarding the existence of photosynthetic symmetry in plant leaves. The
hypothesis regarding photosynthetic symmetry may be of fundamental significance
in understanding how leaf structure relates functionally to photosynthetic
performance. The Australian investigator is an authority on leaf morphological
and anatomical properties. The U.S. PI brings to the project an approach that
involves some novel and innovative instrumentation for the measurement of
functional influences of leaf structure on photosynthesis.
