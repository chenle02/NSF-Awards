The proposed research deals with problems related to the approximation,
adaptation and optimization of probability models involving the Markov-Modulated
Poisson Process. These problems will be examined under several criteria, each of
which calls for the identification and preservation of essential physical
features of the point process. The results have applications in communications
engineering. Marcel Neuts is world renowned in computational probability and is
very capable of carrying out the research along with his young capable
associate. The team should produce leading developments for modeling
telecommunication systems. The University of Arizona is an excellent environment
for research in stochastic modeling in engineering.
