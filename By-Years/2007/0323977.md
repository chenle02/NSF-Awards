The project provides financial assistance to eligible students in the Computer
Science degree program at Nunez Community College and encourages high school
students to enter the Computer Science program. A panel of instructors evaluates
each student's potential for success to complete the degree and selects
participants. Selected participants receive tuition and books paid for by the
grant. Students meet with the Computer Science Advisor/Mentor during the
semester to monitor progress. Students also participate in a series of
specialized workshops to help them with logic skills, job-seeking skills, and
transferring to a 4 year university. The Mentoring Model and the series of
specialized workshops are used to enhance the scholarship students' success
rates. The workshops and mentoring skills provided to students receiving
scholarships prepare them for either a satisfying career or entry into a 4-year
institution.
