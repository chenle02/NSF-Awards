Understanding the physiological bases of behavioral and morphological variation
is a major goal in biology. However, the continuous nature of much of the
variation among individuals often makes such study difficult. This research will
use sunfish to exploit the existence of two distinct types of males: a "typical"
parental male type and a cuckolder male that exhibits a mosaic of male- and
female-typical characters. Morphological differences between the two types of
males are tightly correlated with divergence in reproductive behavior and both
types of males are reproductively competent. This project will begin a
systematic biochemical and behavioral examination of the role of androgens and
glucocorticoids, and their interactions, in the expression of male behavioral
and morphological variation. These hormones are known across vertebrates to be
important mediators of reproductive behavior and to play a central role in
transducing information from various environmental stimuli. These studies will
test hypotheses that differences in behavior between the two types of males are
related to differences in two important components of steroid hormone action.
The studies will determine 1) the activity of a major enzyme involved in
androgen and glucocorticoid metabolism, 2) document morph and sex differences in
tissue-specific activity of this and a related enzyme, 3) document in the brain
and other tissues the expression of androgen and glucocorticoid receptors and
these two steroidogenic enzymes, and 4) determine whether morphs differ in their
sensitivity to a standardized stressor. Because many neuroendocrine mechanisms
underlying behavior are conserved, the findings from the proposed studies of
sunfish should be broadly applicable across vertebrates. The project will
provide research training for students in a research program that integrates
neuroendocrine studies with studies of behavior of animals in the field to
understand the evolution of physiological mechanisms underlying
behavior.&lt;br/&gt;
