REMPI Photoelectron spectroscopy is used to measure the amplitudes, phase shifts
and signs of the phase shifts in NO. Extensions of research via modifications of
the experimental apparatus will enable the complete determination of the
scattering matrix and extend the approach to a much wider class of molecules.
This will bring our understanding of the photoionization of molecules to the
level that we now understand atomic photoionization.
