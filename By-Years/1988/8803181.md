The Darlington Herbarium is the second oldest institutional herbarium in the
U.S. It contains 20,000 specimens, mainly from 1828-1855. Many of the specimens
are vouchers from works of noted botanists of that period, a time of national
expansion and exploration. Currently, the wealth of information contained in
this collection is largely inaccessible because of cataloging, synonymy, and
bookkeeping problems. An estimated 90% of the specimens have not been annotated
in the past 100 years and are filed under their original taxonomic names. This
project will provide two years of funding to repair, number and update the
taxonomic nomenclature of the specimens. With the technical help of a graduate
assistant, updated nomenclature and label information will be computerized to
allow easy and efficient access to the specimens. Once computerized, specimens
can be sorted by collector, current taxonomic name or synonyms, geographical
area, location in the collection, etc. The award will also provide equipment to
improve the housing of the collection and its use by professionals. The goal is
to preserve, modernize and publicize this valuable and often- overlooked
historic and taxonomic collection.
