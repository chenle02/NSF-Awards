Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;Closed laboratories have become common in the
computer science educational community as a means of enhancing student
achievement. However, circumstances for many departments have changed since the
original push to closed laboratories: rapid advances in web-based technologies
and increasing ownership of networked personal computers by students makes it
even less sensible to use closed laboratories to deliver exercises or tutorial
activities and many institutions are facing increasing enrollments, shortage of
space, or reduced budgets for laboratory assistants that require departments to
ensure that resource expensive closed laboratory components for courses are used
as wisely as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project we are re-examining
the strengths of the closed laboratory model and assessing methods and
technology for learning outside a closed laboratory in order to deliver better
practicum experiences for students and to reduce a department's costs for
developing and delivering closed-laboratory components in a computing
curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are:&lt;br/&gt;(1) analyzing the needs for a
closed-laboratory component for a course and also for the set of student
activities carried out during a course's weekly laboratory
sessions;&lt;br/&gt;(2) determining what practicum-oriented student activities
are best served in a closed laboratory environment and which can effectively be
handled outside a closed laboratory session;&lt;br/&gt;(3) identifying and
documenting a set of best-practices of techniques and tools that can support
effective learning activities for closed laboratories, and also for activities
that are better moved to an open laboratory
situation;&lt;br/&gt;and&lt;br/&gt;(4) using this set of best-practices to
define a development guide for how to plan and implement laboratory
components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
