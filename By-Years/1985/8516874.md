Research addressed an investigation of the fundamental behavior of gas-liquid-
solid fluidization. Four areas are studied: bubble dynamics; rheological
behavior; probe development, and annular fluidzation. In bubble dynamics, the
characteristics of bubbles and their wakes will be investigated in conjunction
with the behavior of solids exchange between the bubble wake and the liquid-
fluidized region. The high speed visualization techniques will be employed to
examine the bubble dynamics in a two-dimensional fluidized bed. Possible new
classification of particles based on the rheological behavior will be attempted
for three-phase fluidized bed systems. The fiber optic probe will be constructed
for measurement of the solids holdup in the liquid-solid fluidized region of
three-phase fluidized beds.
