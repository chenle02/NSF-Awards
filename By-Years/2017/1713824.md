Certain genes are critical for the proper growth and development of organisms.
As such, changes in these genes can have large effects on the overall evolution
of groups of species. The MADS-box genes are one such family of genes, which
control a sizeable portion of plant development and have been found to underlie
major changes in plant evolution. Through this fellowship, the awardee will work
with the distinguished plant biologist Dr. Zhong-Hua Chen at Western Sydney
University in New South Wales, Australia to study the MADS-box genes in ferns
compared to flowering plants, which include many well-studied crops. This study
will provide new insights into the ancestral MADS-box genes and the changes that
have occurred in this group of genes throughout the evolutionary history of
plants.

Investigations of the MADS-box gene family have been a key facet of plant
evolution research for nearly three decades due to their major role in
development and putative role in the massive diversification of flowering
plants. While the genomics era has allowed the rapid identification of putative
MADS-box genes in a wide diversity of plant species, the verification,
localization, and activity patterns of these genes are generally lacking in all
but a few model flowering plants. In addition, the absence of a published
reference genome in ferns, sister group to seed plants, has left an egregious
gap in our understanding of MADS-box evolution across all of land plants. By
collaborating with Dr. Zhong-Hua Chen, the awardee will use functional genetics
to verify, localize, and quantify the putative MADS-box genes throughout the
life cycle of the model fern, Ceratopteris richardii, the first study of this
kind for a non-seed plant. These results will complement the awardee's broad
genomic and transcriptomic analyses and elucidate the evolution of the MADS-box
gene family across ferns, seed plants, and all of land plants.
