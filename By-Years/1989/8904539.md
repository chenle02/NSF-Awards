The 1989 Midwest Regional Developmental Biology Conference will be held at the
University of Illinois, Urbana.Champaign, from May 30 to June 2. This year the
Conference will be held in conjunction with the Midwest Biennial Regeneration
Forum, a meeting that was established in 1977 because of the number of
laboratories in the Midwest region that conduct regeneration research. There
will be two areas covered by the meeting: 1. Embryogenesis including a session
on the control of gene expression during development and one on embryonic
organization and pattern formation and 2. Regeneration including sessions on
appendage development and regeneration, muscle development and regeneration and
neuronal regeneration. %%% The purpose of this Conference is to provide a forum
for an exchange of information and ideas on all aspects of embryogenesis and
regeneration. Because of international participation, the Conference combines
some of the intellectual aspects of larger meetings with a less formal and rigid
structure that encourages active participation by undergraduates, graduate
students and post.doctoral fellows, including informal interactions with
established investigators.
