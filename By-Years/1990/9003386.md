This award will help to fund a Special Year in Real Algebraic Geometry and
Qradratic Forms. This Special Year will be held during the 1990-91 academic year
in the Department of Mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley. The
Special Year is centered around the yearlong visits of Knebusch and Broecker,
who are experts in real algebraic geometry. There will be researchers from
Europe and North America visiting Berkeley during this Special Year. The main
activities will be two seminars: one on real algebraic geometry and the other on
the algebraic theory of quadratic forms.
