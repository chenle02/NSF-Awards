This CAREER proposal will investigate how companies use Internet-based digital
infrastructure to transform the way they do business, with a focus on two
related isseus: adoption and value creation of Internet-based e-business at the
firm level. Instead of focusing on the direct relationship betweeen information
technology and firm performance, we propose that actual usage may be the missing
link in explaining the impact of technology on firm performance. The study will
use quantitative and qualitative methods, including surveys, statistical
analysis, and case studies. The longitudinal research will be conducted over
five years and will focus on three industry sectors, manufacturing, retailing,
and financial services. The study will draw managerial implications about the
transformation process in which the Internet is used and value is created. The
project will study the role of government regulation and competition on
e-business transformation and will offer implications for public policies. The
project will involve graduate and undergraduate students in the research
process. New curriculum and courses on digital business will be developed for
undergraduates and MBA students.
