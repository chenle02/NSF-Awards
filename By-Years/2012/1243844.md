The proteins of the plant nuclear envelope have important roles in many cell
functions, including mechanical signaling, controlling the shape and movement of
the nucleus, and the cell cycle. However, for reasons that are not currently
understood, the protein composition of the plant nuclear envelope differs
significantly from that of the animals and fungi. The goal of this project is to
understand the function of the novel plant-specific proteins that span the
nuclear envelope, and which are predicted to play roles in plant development,
pollination, and the responses to light and pathogens. The experimental
approaches will include live-cell imaging by light microscopy, and the
identification of the protein interaction partners using techniques of affinity
chromatography, tandem mass spectrometry and computational biology. Broader
Impacts. A novel course in biology and art will be developed, in collaboration
with an Art professor at Ohio State University, with the goal to make topics in
contemporary plant biology accessible and comprehensible to the public. A public
Bio-Art exhibit will be developed and the course will form the basis for a
module that can be used by high school teachers.
