Summary: This objective of this study is to provide estimates of long-term
changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations from the Eocene through the
Oligocene. The study will utilize carbon isotope measurement of alkenones and
carbonate microfossils along with oxygen isotope measurements in carbonate
microfossils. Measurements will be done on 6 discreet time slices representing
the early, middle, and late Eocene and the early, middle and late Oligocene.
Sample resolution will be approximately 250 to 500ky. In addition records will
be established prior to and following distinct climatic episodes such as the
Eocene/Oligocene transition and the apparent rapid deglaciation at the end of
the Oligocene. &lt;br/&gt;
