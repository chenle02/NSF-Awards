The investigator will apply theoretical procedures to the quantitative
prediction of cross sections for Rayleigh and Raman scattering of ultraviolet
radiation in molecular oxygen, and used to explore the influence of scattering
on the transmission and attenuation of solar ultraviolet radiation in the
atmosphere. He will calculate the cross sections and insert them into the
collision kernel of the Boltzmann equation to study the effects of vibrational
excitation in the slowing of energetic nitrogen atoms and production of
rotationally and vibrationally excited NO. He will apply quantal and semi-
classical procedures to determine the rate coefficients for energy transfer in
collisions involving vibrationally excited molecules. Finally, he will
quantitatively assess the contribution of radiation involved in the collision of
metastable oxygen molecules to the continuum emission present in the night
airglow.
