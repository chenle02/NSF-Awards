The Role of LEAFY in Reproductive Development in Arabidopsis The switch from
juvenile to reproductive phase occurs in all higher organisms. Control of the
proper timing of this switch is vital. In plants the transition from vegetative
to reproductive development is also of agronomical importance as seeds, the
storage reserves which human sustenance largely depends on, are the product of
the reproductive phase. The transcription factor LEAFY (LFY) is a key regulator
of the floral transition, a central step in the switch from vegetative to
reproductive development. Later in the reproductive phase LFY controls flower
patterning. Despite its central role in these processes, events downstream of
LFY are poorly understood. Only two direct targets of LFY are known. Genetic
evidence indicates that additional LFY-controlled target genes play critical
roles in reproductive development. We will employ genomic molecular approaches
to identify these unknown LFY-regulated target genes. The proposal is based on
posttranscriptional activation of a LFY fusion protein that allows
identification of genes whose expression change rapidly in response to LFY
activation. Biological significance of the identified novel LFY-regulated target
genes will be investigated.
