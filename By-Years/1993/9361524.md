9361524 Stubberud The artificial neural network (ANN) has been used with varying
degrees of success in the feed back loop to provide the necessary control for
nonlinear or uncertain systems. Recently, research has been done to train a
neuro-controller, as well as a neuro-observer, using a relatively new extended
Kalman filter (EKF) training paradigm. However, both functions have not been
implemented with ANNs, which train on-line. ORINCON will investigate the
capability of implementing a neuro-controller and neuro-observer on-line using
the EKF paradigm. All systems encounter parameter variations over time from
their nominal design that the control must adapt to or be robust enough to
handle. This research will allow the entire feedback loop to be adjusted for
parameter changes. ***
