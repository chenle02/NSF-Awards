Single crystal X-ray crystallography is the most powerful analytical method for
structure determination of solids. In synthetic inorganic, organic, bioinorganic
and organometallic chemistry, single crystal X-ray diffraction is an invaluable
tool to characterize molecular structure. The information gained from the
knowledge of the intermolecular composition and structure helps to develop new
reactions of potentially general interest in catalysis or organic synthesis.
This award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at the University of California in Berkeley, upgrade the
existing X-ray facility. Among the areas of chemical research that will be
enhanced by the acquisition are following: o X-Ray Crystallography in Organic
Synthesis o Structure-Based Design and Evaluation of Protein Ligands o X-Ray
Diffraction as Tool in Studies of the Reactions of Organometallic Complexes o
Studies of Transition Metal Oxides and Phosphides o Accurate Structure Analysis
as a Probe of Bonding interactions in Organometallic Compounds o Bioinorganic
Chemistry
