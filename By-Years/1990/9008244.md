Components are acquired for the construction of an experimental facility to
perform temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), temperature-programmed
oxidation (TPD), and temperature- programmed reduction (TPR). These are
assembled into a working unit. The apparatus will be used in ongoing studies of
the partial oxidation of methane to methanol and formaldhyde over molybdena-
based catalysts, synergy between manganese and molybdenum oxides in the partial
oxidation of hydrocarbons, and selective reduction of nitrogen oxides with
ammonia over vanadia catalysts.
