This award will support collaborative research between Harold Hochman,
Lafayette College, and Giorgio Brosio, University of Turin. The objective of the
project is to re-examine, using experimental methods, the basic behavioral
hypotheses of the theory of bureaucracy and agency. A unique aspect of this
project is its comparative nature. The project will develop a better
understanding of the objectives of local politicians and bureaucrats and re-
examine the extent of the principal-agent problem in decision-making in both
local government and the not-for-profit sector. At a positive level, the project
will improve the understanding of how market and non-market institutions
translate the preferences of constituents or sponsors, through fiscal and
regulatory actions, into agency decisions in government and in private
organizations. At a normative level, the project will determine how well
existing institutions perform this function and devise constraints or incentives
systems to help managers of public agencies and nonprofit organizations serve
the interests of their principals. Attention will initially be directed to three
services -- cultural activities, health and social services, and local
transportation -- in Turin and the Piedmont region in Italy, and in New York
City, Pittsburgh, and other smaller cities in the northeastern United States.
Researchers from Turin have developed and refined some of the requisite methods
of experimentation and interpretation that complements those of the American
specialists. There are enough similarities and differences in fiscal and
political responsibilities in the two countries to define an excellent base for
comparative analysis.
