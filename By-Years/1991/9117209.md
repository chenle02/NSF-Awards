This proposal is for a planning grant for investigating the possibilities of
joining the established Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for
Software Engineering at Purdue University and the University of Florida. The PI
at Arizona State University will use the funds to be provided by this award to
recruit industrial members for the proposed Center, to develop a menu of
research projects that will enhance the present joint I/UCRC at Purdue and
Florida University and to develop the administrative protocols that will be
necessary to have a viable Center. Arizona State University already has several
contracts in the industries located in Arizona and feel that these industries
will support the creation of a joint Center with the University of Florida and
Purdue University. The Program Director recommends an award for $25,000 for a
planning grant to establish a joint Center with the existing I/UCRC at the
University of Florida and Purdue University
