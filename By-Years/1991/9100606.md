Professor Chris L. Craney and other members of the Chemistry Department at
Occidental College are being supported to continue a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1991-93, eight
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a
variety of research projects. Projects include investigation of infrared spectra
of metal-binding proteins, mechanism of electrophilic aromatic substitution
reactions, and photochemical behavior of furocoumarin. Students will give an
oral interim report on their research and prepare a final poster presentation.
Students will be predominantly from two-year colleges.
