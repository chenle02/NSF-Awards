This Project is to develop a graphics workstation laboratory. The equipment will
be used in a sequence of four junior and senior level computer science courses
to demonstrate modern methods in software engineering and computer graphics.
Students will acquire expertise in such methods by using state-of-the-art
instrumentation to implement software projects which illustrate theoretical
results in those fields. The project focuses on the use of graphics tools as
visual aids for the design and analysis of software and on the use of those
tools in the development of graphics software itself. The equipment includes a
color monitor and four workstations for a student laboratory and a file server
and one workstation for a faculty laboratory. The server, a high-speed
microprocessor with a disk drive, provides disk space and additional computing
power to the workstations. Eight existing PCs would be connected to the server;
four would be placed in the student laboratory and four in faculty offices. Both
laboratories will be housed in a newly remodeled facility. Project
implementation span a 2-year period with ample personnel available for equipment
installation and course preparation.
