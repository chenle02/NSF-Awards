9503978 Seidel The cross fertilization across different disciplines that has
been the hallmark of many successful fields of computational science has been
slow to occur in Numerical relativity. The proposal is designed to bring
maturity to a promising new approach for solving Einstein's equations, based on
a new formulation that casts them in an explicitly first order, flux-
conservative, hyperbolic form. This approach opens the door to borrowing
powerful modern algorithms from other fields. Building on this the PI's plan to
incorporate appropriate mathematical formalisms, scaleable computers,
sophisticated parallel and numerical algorithms (including advanced methods for
hyperbolic systems and optimized linear solvers) and experimental scientific
visualization techniques (such as virtual reality) into a single code. A
preliminary version has already been developed with this global approach,
running with outstanding performance on fundamentally different parallel
architectures. The PI's propose the construction of a general controller that
distributes computation, visualization, and data analysis across the metacenter.
The physical applications will include: a general 3D gravitational wave
laboratory, 3D black hole simulations, bosonic stars as a testbed for colliding
objects, and fully general relativistic hydrodynamics. A single, very general
and powerful research tool can be developed, and the resulting experience can be
applied into other fields of computational science, making this proposal a truly
multidisciplinary effort.
