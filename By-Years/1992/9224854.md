9224854 Haller This award will support collaborative research between Gary
Haller, Yale University, and Costas Vayenas, University of Patras, Greece. The
collaboration will investigate nonfaradaic electrochemical modification of
catalyst activity (NEMCA) on Pt and Pd catalysts. Three reactions will be
studied: competitive hydrogenation of toluene and benzene, methanol oxidation,
and neopentane hydrogenolysis. The NEMCA effect will be investigated
spectroscopically with scanning tunneling microscopy and extended X-ray
absorption fine structure. The investigators will pursue complementary physical
characterization of the NEMCA effect. The catalytic reactions will be carried
out in both laboratories. The STM work will be performed in Patras and the EXAFS
at Yale. In both cases, the spectroscopy will be performed in situ, and, to make
these studies as complementary as possible, they will be perfomed using the same
in situ reaction conditions. ***
