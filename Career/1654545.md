In modern mathematics, symplectic geometry is the abstract setting for classical
mechanics, and microlocal analysis is a tool used to study solutions to systems
of differential equations. Microlocal sheaf theory is the geometric formulation
of microlocal analysis. Recent advances have uncovered striking applications of
microlocal sheaf theory to symplectic geometry. This project will explore and
extend these applications in various directions, including further developing
algebraic and combinatorial connections between curves, knots, and surfaces. In
terms of education, the principal investigator will prepare much-needed
elementary expository works on the subject of microlocal sheaf theory.

The specific research goals of the proposal are twofold. First, to localize the
calculations of the Fukaya category of a Weinstein manifold (a certain sort of
exact symplectic manifold) to its Lagrangian skeleton. Once localized,
performing this calculation is a matter of combinatorics; thus secondly, the PI
intends to explore the resulting combinatorics. It is already known that the
sort of combinatorics that arises has a representation-theoretic flavor; in
particular cluster algebras and categorified knot invariants appear. Further
insights in these subjects will be gained by exploring their connection with
symplectic geometry in terms of the above-mentioned skeleta. The localization
and calculation of these Fukaya categories that are the focus of this research
will play an essential role in an approach to the homological mirror symmetry
conjecture.
