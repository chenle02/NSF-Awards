This is a project of fundamental research on the extragalactic distance scale
by one of the leaders in this field. Using the latest available instrumentation,
the properties of Cepheid variable stars will be studied both in our galaxy and
in several nearby systems. This will more than double the number of galaxies
which have reddening corrected distance moduli. It is these calibrated galaxies
which are used in the classical determination of the Hubble constant which in
turn measures the scale of the universe in both distance and time.
