9350159 Kurfess The award is for the conduct of research and teaching in the
area of precision engineering. Research activities will be focused on precision
control, instrumentation, dynamics and large scale data reduction and are
motivated by the need to enhance capabilities in advanced high speed metrology.
Research issues addressed include control of measurement probe/workpiece surface
interaction, precise control of probe motion, and efficient processing of large
amounts of data collected during the scanning process. Teaching activities will
be focused on control theory and quality assurance, with examples drawn from
applications The research should result in a coordinate measurement machine
scanning capability of 40 millimeters/second with typical scanning accuracies of
10 micrometers and would be of great value to manufacturers who rely on
precision inspection technology. The teaching activities would result in
undergraduate and graduate students who are well versed in control theory and
its application to precision engineering.
