Solid-State Excimer Formation and Transportation - A theoretical study of the
long-standing problem of solid-state excimer formation in a range of molecular
crystals is proposed. An excimer is an electronic excitation of two molecules
bound together only in the excited state. Formation, transport, and annihilation
of these entities will be studied in this program. The goal of this work is the
unification of the vast existing experimental database under a single
theoretical umbrella. This proposal will be cofunded by DMR-Materials Theory
(65%) and CHE (35%). %%% The interaction of light with matter has been the basis
for a wide range of useful devices, ranging from lasers and solar cells to
windows and binoculars. Among the various paths known for such interaction, the
exciton is perhaps the least well understood at this time. This project is
intended to put our understanding of excitonic interactions on a firm
foundation. Such a foundation in clearly needed to develop further understanding
of this unique form of solid-state excitation. This proposal will be cofunded by
DMR- Materials Theory (65%) and CHE (35%).
