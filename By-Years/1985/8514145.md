This project will call for a national Symposium where a multidisciplinary group
of practitioners and scientists will discuss the flash flood that occurred 10
years ago at the Big Thompson and what has happened since with regard to
research, policy, legislation, and information transfer. A white paper
summarizing available information on these issues will be prepared and will be
circulated prior to the meeting. The Symposium will run for 2 1/2 days and three
basic questions will be addressed: how the Big Thompson event affected policy,
research, and information flow; whether the vulnerability to flash flood
disasters increased or decreased in these last 10 years, and what will happen in
the next 10 years; and what have been the long-term impacts of the Big Thompson
flood, and what can be learned from it.
