This award in the Division of Chemistry supports research by Professor Mahdi
Abu-Omar at Purdue University to study electron transfer, proton-coupled
electron transfer, and hydrogen atom transfer reactions. In addition, the
catalysis of C-H amination, nitrene transfer and hydrogen atom transfer
reactions by nonheme iron(IV) imido complexes will be explored. A molecular
catalyst that mimics the enzyme chlorite dismutase and is selective for chlorite
dismutation to dioxygen and innocuous chloride will also be investigated. The
manganese porphyrin system and nonheme catalysts that perform these reactions
will be completely characterized.

This research will study how electrons and atoms transfer between molecules and
will investigate molecular mimics of the enzyme chlorite dismutase. These
investigations involve chemical synthesis, catalysis, kinetics, and mechanisms,
which will prepare postdoctoral and graduate students for academic, industrial,
and government careers. Collaborations with leading scientists in Japan
(Professor Fukuzumi, Osaka University) and Korea (Professor Nam, Ewha Womans
University) will further broaden the students' scientific perspectives.
