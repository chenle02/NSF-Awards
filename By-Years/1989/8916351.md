The East Africa Rift system is one of the earth's major active extensional
environments in continental crust. Seismic profiling in the rift lakes has
demonstrated a consistent style of half-graben rift basins bounded by major
border faults and linked by accommodation zones. However, fault geometry and
kinematics of rift architecture have not been rigorously tested, due to
generally poor exposure and weak age control. This project will take advantage
of well-exposed faults and shear zones in the area surrounding Lake Turkana on
the eastern branch of the East African Rift System in order to evaluate existing
models of upper crustal strain resulting from rifting. These and other studies
will be integrated in order to develop a unified picture of rift development.
