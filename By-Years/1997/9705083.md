9705083 Desjardin In the course of this project, the mushrooms (agarics and
boletes of the Order Agaricales, Class Basidiomycota, Kingdom Fungi) of the
Indonesian islands of Java and Bali will be surveyed by an international team of
investigators. Data generated by this research will enhance scientific knowledge
of the mycota of an environmentally endangered and species rich, but
underexplored, region of the world. The information generated will contribute to
advances in biogeographic and speciation research in the Agaricales, leading to
a better understanding of the relationships of agarics not only in Indonesia,
but also in other parts of the world. Both American and Indonesian students will
be trained in systematic mycology in the field and at San Francisco State
University, and the mycological collections of Herbarium Bogoriense (BO) and San
Francisco State University (SFSU) will be significantly upgraded. The project
will result in a WWW page that will document all aspects of the project, and
which will provide photographs of, commentaries on, and keys to the taxa of the
Indonesian Agaricales, as well as an online specimen database of historical and
new collections of Indonesian agarics that is expected to total some 3500
records. This project is being funded cooperatively by the Biotic Surveys &
Inventories Program (BIO) and the International Program (SBE) of the NSF, and
includes matching funds from San Francisco State University.
