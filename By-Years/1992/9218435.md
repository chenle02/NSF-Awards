Volcanism and extensional tectonism spread across a broad region of the western
U.S. during the Cenozoic. Studies in recent years have provided much insight
into the relationship between the tectonism and magmatism in the western U.S.,
but unsolved questions relating to the driving forces for extension remain. The
Cenozoic volcanic rocks of the High Plains provide a unique perspective on such
problems. These volcanic rocks are broadly similar in composition and closely
contemporaneous with volcanic fields in the Rio Grande Rift and southwestward
into Arizona. However, the High Plains volcanic fields lie 100-200 km east of
the Rio Grande Rift in an area well beyond the effects of crustal extension.
Spatial and temporal variations in composition of volcanic rocks shown from our
preliminary study (e.g., isotopic changes) require significant differences in
source composition and crust and mantle structure. A detailed study of this
volcanic field will enable comparison with fields within the region of extension
and provide essential constraints for physical models explaining relationship
between magmatism and extensional tectonism.
