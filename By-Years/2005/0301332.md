This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial biology for
FY2003. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden their scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Cold-active bacterial enzymes:
investigation of the structural features necessary for activity at low
temperature." This research investigates the structural features responsible for
enzymatic activity at low temperature by conducting biophysical and directed
evolution studies on two cold-active enzymes produced by the psychrophilic
bacterium Colwellia psychrerythraea strain 34H. The results of these studies
will enhance understanding of bacterial evolution and the limits of life on this
planet and may also have numerous industrial applications.
