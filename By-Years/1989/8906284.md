This grant provides funding for participation in the study of p+A and A+A
collisions at the CERN SPS using a focussing spectrometer. The experiments will
study single identified particle distributions (pions, kaons, and protons) as
well as two-pion and two-kaon correlations for 450 GeV p+A and 200 GeV/nucleon
S, Pb+A collisions. Using a small acceptance focussing spectrometer with high
resolution TOF, these measurements will obtain excellent momentum resolution,
high statistics in the phase space of interest, and good particle
identification. The Pittsburgh contribution to the experiment will be for the
TOF system, Monte Carlo studies, and data analysis. The work is designed to
probe the spatial and temporal extent of the quark-gluon plasma region that is
predicted to occur in relativistic heavy ion collisions.
