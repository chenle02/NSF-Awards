This proposal will enhance the curriculum in upper division major courses by
establishing a high performance workstation laboratory and assigning projects
using the workstations and specialized software packages. The specific courses
and curricular enhancements are as follows. (1) a new course, systems
performance modelling, which will use a variety of simulation tools to model and
analyze computer systems in student projects will be developed. (2) The computer
graphics course will be enhanced through inclusion of the PHIG standard and
assignments utilizing a PHIG software package. (3) The numerical analysis course
will be expanded to include use of a modern numerical analysis programming
package for solution and graphing of representative problems and the inclusion
of symbolic computations. (4) The modelling and simulation course will use
sophisticated simulation tools to design more detailed and graphically enhanced
models. (5) The data communications course will use specially designed network
simulation tools to introduce pseudo "hands-on" projects not previously
possible. (6) Interactive LISP, available free from the University of Texas,
will allow enhanced capabilities in the LISP, artificial intelligence, and
programming languages courses. (7) Undergraduates will be encouraged to use the
workstations and tools provided to complete research projects proposed but not
completed due to lack of resources. (8) If possible, additional software such as
CASE tools, circuit simulators, C++, PROLOG, and databases will be acquired and
projects incorporated into the corresponding classes.
