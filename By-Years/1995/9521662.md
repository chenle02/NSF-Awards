ABSTRACT CTS-9521662 The interparticle forces colloidal microstructure and
rheological properties of two types of stable dispersions of spheres containing
either polymeric stabilizers grafted to the particles or soluble associative
three-block co-polymers will be investigated. Non- equilibrium statistical
mechanics equations are used to described the colloidal microstructure. For the
polymer-stabilized spheres, a new potential of the mean force, hydrodynamic
functions accounting for the polymer layer and a method for generating the
equilibrium distribution functions, are proposed. For the associative polymeric
suspension, a non-equilibrium interparticles force similar to that in reversible
network theories will be introduced in analysis. The proposed work has relevance
to rheological characterization of polymer-stabilized suspensions, with
particular relevance to advanced materials processing coatings. ***
