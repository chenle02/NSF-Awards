Wasps of the genus Trichogramma are parasites of the eggs of other insects and
are among the most widely used agents for biological control. Despite their
popularity as control agents, the systematics of the North American species of
Trichogramma is rudimentary, hampering their most efficient use. This project
will provide continuing funding to determine species definitions, species
diversity, geographic and host distributions, habitat associations and within-
species character variation of approximately 50 North American Trichogramma
species. The research will result in detailed species treatments; a key to
species; a summary of morphological, host, distribution, and reproductive data;
and a phylogenetic classification of the genus.
