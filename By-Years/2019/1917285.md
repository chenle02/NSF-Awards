Bacteria can develop resistance to antibiotics at alarming rates. This poses a
significant threat to public health and national security. This threat is even
worse with the increasing number of pathogens that can enter and colonize cells.
Polymers can be useful in helping antibiotics enter these cells and attack the
pathogens. This project will explore the mechanisms and rates of such antibiotic
delivery. New concepts and models pertaining to these systems will be developed.
Undergraduate and graduate students will be engaged in executing this project.
High school students engaged in a 4-H Focus for Teens workshop will be trained
to present a polymer science experimental module to their local 4-H clubs. These
activities will stimulate the development of a highly productive and inclusive
STEM workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cell penetrating oligothioetheramides are
a new class of non-charged, cell-penetrating macromolecules that rapidly enter
cells across different cell lines in a highly diffuse pattern. This project will
expand the understanding of how these macromolecular agents are processed within
the cell by developing a kinetic model that directly measures intracellular bond
cleavage. The intracellular degradation rate constant will be specific for each
antibiotic prodrug and cell line. This information will be used to investigate
how linker composition and antibiotic type influence the kinetics of
intracellular antibiotic release and thus antibacterial activity. The database
of kinetic parameters obtained will inform the decision process leading up to
the choice of a cleavable bond for a particular polymer-drug conjugate.
Furthermore, the kinetic parameters will also be of significant value to the
scientists and engineers working on compartmental and physiological models for a
variety of applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
