Participant support is requested for an international conference in algebraic,
analytic, and geometric approaches to group theory, to be held at Cornell
University from October 9 to October 11, 2010. The aim of this conference is to
stimulate cooperative research among group theorists who are using varied
approaches to the study of groups. Algebraic, analytic and geometric approaches
to group theory are robust areas of mathematical research. The conference will
highlight notable recent achievements in these areas, presented in a manner that
will be accessible to researchers with adjacent interests. There will be an
emphasis on particular areas where all of these approaches have been successful,
such as the mathematical theory of buildings.

Group theory is a cornerstone of abstract algebra, one of the primary branches
of mathematics. The goal of this conference is to stimulate cooperative work
among researchers who are using different approaches to the study of groups. An
emphasis will be placed on gathering an unusually broad mix of mathematicians,
with many different subfields of mathematics being represented by a diverse
group from senior faculty to graduate students.
