Funds are provided to investigate a set of fundamental dynamical processes in
the Arctic Ocean where the Ã¢-effect is small and the western ocean boundary is
absent. Results will contribute to understanding a series of important issues
concerning the circulation and state of the Arctic Ocean, such as: Does the
Sverdrup balance hold in the Arctic? Do Rossby waves still play the central role
in the spin up of an oceanic gyre in the Arctic? How does the ocean respond to
changes in wind near the North Pole where Rossby waves are supposed to be
nonexistent or stagnant? What role do eddies play in the potential vorticity
balance? How does the ocean spin up to a quasi-equilibrium state if there is no
western ocean boundary? Do winds or thermohaline factors dominate and shape the
arctic?s ocean circulation? Why does the Atlantic water penetrate to the Arctic
Ocean? Does it go to the Arctic to replace surface water forced by winds to go
out of the Arctic (wind-driven theory) or in order to satisfy salt and heat
balances (thermohaline theory)?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An accepted theory of ocean
circulation has been developed over the past century based on studies of the
subtropical and tropical gyres, such as the Gulf Stream system. The validity of
the assumptions on which this theory is based is questionable in the Arctic
Ocean. This study will enhance our understanding of the fundamental physics
controlling Arctic Ocean circulation and our ability to predict the changes in
circulation patterns that may result from changes in forcing and, hence, our
ability to predict the drift of material in the Arctic Ocean.
