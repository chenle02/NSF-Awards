The project supported concerns the ring of invariants, C(n,r), of a set of r
generic nxn matrices over a field K and the trace ring, R(n,r). The main problem
is to find presentations for C(n,r) as an algebra over K and R(n,r) as an
algebra over C(n,r). The project will also consider the minimal degree of
elements in a generating set and whether the quotient field of C(n,r) is purely
transcendental over K. The research supported concerns matrix theory, ring
theory and the calculation of invariants. In particular, this involves an old
problem of determining what mathematical functions are preserved under various
transformations. This is of interest in many areas of science as well as in
mathematics.
