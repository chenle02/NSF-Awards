0318149&lt;br/&gt;Voelker&lt;br/&gt;Under this agreement the U.S. Maritime
Administration (MARAD) will provide technical support services for a feasibility
design study of a new generation icebreaking research vessel capable of
operation in the ice-covered waters and open oceans of Antarctica. The effort
will take into consideration the design and operational experience gained by
existing U.S. and foreign vessels engaged in polar research.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An initial set of science and operational requirements
currently exist, and they need to be translated into vessel design criteria.
Because of the many features desired in the vessel, a number of special studies
will have to be performed to properly understand the full implications of
certain requirements on the vessel design and cost. Current science and
operational requirements include, among others, the need to conduct acoustic
profiling and bottom mapping during icebreaking, the towing of nets and
instruments from the stern during icebreaking and the ability to conduct AUV/ROV
operations and geotechnical drilling from a moon pool. In addition to these
requirements, the vessel should be acoustically quiet, have reduced air
emissions from diesel engines and incinerator operations, have double hull
protection, as well as enhanced icebreaking capabilities.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The feasibility design shall incorporate applicable U.S.
and international regulations, including classification society rules that
govern the design and construction of vessels for Antarctic operations. A
preliminary cost estimate will also be developed. Deliverables include copies of
reports or special studies that are to be conducted, vessel plans and
characteristics and a design history notebook. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This will
be a multi-year effort. Program recommends funding in the amount of $150,000 for
FY03.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
