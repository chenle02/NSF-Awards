This is a PYI award. Dr. LeMaster is studying the protein, dienelactone
hydrolase whose X-ray analysis has recently been carried out. The combination of
solution and crystalline structural analyses will prove useful for studying the
enzymatic properties of this protein which plays an important role in the
ecological detoxification of chloroaromatics. By means of nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy the ionization state and conformation of the active site
residues of the enzyme can be monitored in the presence and absence of substrate
analogs as a means of gaining a better understanding of the mechanistic
properties of this important class of enzymes. High resolution nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy has begun to provide solution structures of small
proteins. This technique offers an important complement to X-ray crystallography
in structural analysis in that macromolecules can be studied under conditions
more closely approximating the physiological milieu. This will prove
particularly advantageous in studying association reactions such as protein-
peptide and protein-nucleic acid complexes for which X-ray analysis has met with
only partial success.
