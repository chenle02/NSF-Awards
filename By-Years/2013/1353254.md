This Small Business Innovation Program (SBIR) Phase II project advances antenna
technology and wireless network performance by developing a new kind of wireless
mesh network node, i.e. integrated router, radio and antenna, and the software
necessary to create a network of such devices. Networking is an important
productivity resource, but can come at a high cost especially for high-data
rates. Dramatic capacity gains in urban wireless networks are achieved by
deploying directional antennas to minimize interference and allow substantial
frequency reuse. Indoor mounting of nodes in windows is desirable to avoid
complications with landlords, avoid weather, and decrease RF path loss. Finally,
larger antennas produce more directionality, so the desired wireless node needs
a large surface area and yet must be something that people are willing to hang
in their windows, i.e. transparent and attractive. This project is using
transparent conductive coatings with a novel combination of beam steering and
Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) radio technology to develop a mostly
transparent wireless node that achieves a &lt;15 degree wide beam that is
electronically steerable over &gt;110 degrees. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
impact/commercial potential of this project includes increased US
competitiveness by facilitating the spread of high speed Internet access and
through the sale of innovative new devices in the US and worldwide. Community
networks will deploy these nodes, as they are the lowest cost and simplest way
to create an inter-building network. In particular, delivering signals via
windows overcomes RF absorption in the masonry structures typical of public
housing projects. Successful commercialization of this technology will
significantly reduce the cost and increase the performance of urban wireless
networks, thus helping extend Internet access to un- and under-served
neighborhoods and reducing the cost of offloading 3G/4G wireless traffic to
local Wi-Fi hotspots.
