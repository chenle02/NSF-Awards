The objectives of this project are to develop a receptor modeling method that
explicitly accounts for the fractionation in chemical composition of volatile
organic carbon compounds that occurs in transit from emission- sources to the
receptor location. The project also includes the design of a field study that
will simultaneously provide data for receptor modeling, evaluation of the
performance of the model, and its use in conducting an inventory of volatile
organic carbon releases to the environment. This is a Research Planning Grant
made to support a proposal submitted in response to the Program Announcement,
NSF 87-56, Research Opportunities for Women. This project addresses an important
issue in determining the effect that emissions of volatile organic compounds
have on air quality. Completion of the preliminary phase outlined in this
proposal is expected to provide the information that is needed to support a
field study intended to assess the validity of the model developed in this
project.
