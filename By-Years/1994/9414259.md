9414259 Milne A major focus of the third phase of AEROCE is to improve the
understanding of the chemical processes occurring as polluted air masses move
off the eastern North American continent. The presence of non-methane
hydrocarbons (NHMCs) in these air masses, together with the oxides of nitrogen
(NOx), leads to the photochemical production or destruction of ozone. Ozone is a
radiatively important trace gas which has both biological and human health
impacts. Together with the hydroxyl radical, OH, ozone is a key factor in
regulating the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere, i.e. the processes whereby
anthropogenic emissions, including NMHCs, are broken down and removed from the
gas phase. As part of the AEROCE program, this will initiate measurements of
speciated (C2 - C10) NMHCs in the marine atmosphere at several of the AEROCE
field sites. The proposed field measurements will provide an integrated
measurement setting with which to further understanding of the chemical
climatology of NMHCs and photochemical oxidants in the North Atlantic
troposphere.
