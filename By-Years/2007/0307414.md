0307414 Willis This 3-year award to Oregon State University (OSU) provides
support for technical services during NSF-funded programs on R/V Wecoma, a 185'
general purpose research vessel operated as part of the University-National
Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. OSU will provide one shipboard
technician on each cruise of R/V Wecoma to support seagoing research projects
and to maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified users items from their pool
of shared-use research instrumentation. As specialized services, OSU will
maintain and operate the NORCOR facility to provide sediment coring services
when required in support of NSF-funded projects. The NORCOR coring systems are
portable, and they will be operated from the UNOLS vessel that is most efficient
to undertake the scheduled project. OSU will also provide as specialized
services an undulating, towed vehicle for acquiring oceanographic data. This
instrument, also, may be operated from UNOLS vessels of opportunity, and thus
may be scheduled to make efficient use of the UNOLS fleet. The technical support
and instrument maintenance provided via this award enables shared-use operation
of this oceanographic facility by qualified researchers from throughout the US,
and it enables efficient use of the vessel and other specialized instrumentation
for federally-funded oceanographic research. ***
