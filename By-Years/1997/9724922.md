9724922 Srere The investigator's laboratory has presented evidence in the past
that the enzymes of the Krebs tricarboxylic acid cycle exist in vivo as a
metabolon, i.e., a complex of sequential metabolic enzymes. Their most recent
experimental approach is fusing malate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase. They
have found that the best fusion protein for replacing the enzymes in a double
mutant of yeast that lacks those two enzymes is one in which the C-terminus of
mitochondrial citrate synthase is linked to the N-terminus of mitochondrial
malate dehydrogenase. This protein was also produced and isolated using
recombinant technology. The kinetics of the isolated fusion protein were studied
and a channeling of oxalacetate was observed. They will extend these studies to
include aconitase, the next enzyme in the metabolic sequence. The project has
two specific aims. The first is to continue the kinetic studies on the fusion
proteins of citrate synthase, aconitase, and malate dehydrogenase. The second
concerns two forms of citrate synthase, the peroxisomal and mitochondrial, which
have similar enzyme activities but different binding properties. As a
preliminary step in comparing the ability of the peroxisomal form to substitute
for the mitochondrial form in the mitochondria, they will investigate the reason
it has not yet been possible to express peroxisomal citrate synthase activity in
mitochondria. The methodologies to be used are those they have published
previously on the citrate synthase-malate dehydrogenase fusion protein adapted
to the inclusion of aconitase. The investigator's previous work provides
evidence that in certain metabolic pathways, the component enzymes form a
sequential complex which enhances their effciency. This phenomenon will be
further explored in the current project. This enhancement of activity has many
implications for basic biology and for the development of efficient
biotechnological products.
