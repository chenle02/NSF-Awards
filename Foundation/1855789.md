The proposed research is in model theory, which is a branch of mathematical
logic. Much of model theory concerns the ways in which a theory, which is simply
a set of sentences in a formal language controls its class of models. For many
years, the PI has concentrated on mechanisms by which a theory can either admit
or forbid certain combinatorial configurations in its models, and the proposed
research is to continue these investigations in several disparate contexts. In
some cases, this investigation melds well with computational learning theory. As
one example, if a theory forbids the independence property, then all of the
concepts i.e., definable sets, arising in the models of the theory are PAC
learnable.

In more detail, potential canonical Scott sentences have proved to be a useful
tool in determining the Borel complexity of invariant classes of countable
structures and we intend to streamline these methods by exploring thickness and
groundedness of classes of models. It is hoped that the Borel complexity of
every mutually algebraic theory can be computed. Theories with non-maximal
uncountable spectrum are classifiable. Recent technical results about the
existence of prime models make it tractable to settle Vaught's conjecture for
classifiable theories and possibly for superstable theories as well. In first
order logic, aleph1-categoricity of a theory is an absolute notion, as can be
seen by the Baldwin-Lachlan characterization of aleph1-categoricity. The PI
proposes to determine whether a similar characterization can be found for
aleph1-categoricity of sentences of L(omega1, omega), or equivalently for
classes of atomic models. Specifically, the proposed research is to determine
whether aleph1-categoricity is absolute for classes of atomic models. The PI
also proposes to use previous results about mutually algebraic structures to
study expansions of weakly minimal structures that preserve stability.
