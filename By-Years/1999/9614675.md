9614675 Mueller Two important deterrents limit our understanding of shallow
crustal deformation as well as its relationship to active seismicity. They are
the lack of knowledge of the time frame of earthquake events, and the role of
faulting that is totally subsurface, that is , faults that never break through
to the surface. This project will examine folds that form above unexposed
(blind) faults in southern California by studying 1 landforms on hills that are
produced by active folding, 2 young surficial deposits, and 3 subsurface
structure using data from oil wells. Geomorphic structures that may be related
to seismic deformation will be dated by isotopic methods, and then compared to
historic and extrapolated earthquake frequency patterns. Together these results
are expected to be useful in evaluating the potential relationships among
several types of land forms, and seismicity on blind structures.
