Abstract de la Llave

The main goal of this proposal is to devise methods that allow to make
predictions of the long term (or the long range) behavior of dynamical systems
or PDE. We plan to develop a broad array of tools (invariant manifolds,
variational methods, numerical analysis) in such a way that they can work
together. We are particularly interested in applications to instability in
dynamical systems and to global behavior in elliptic partial differential
equations and in coupled networks.

Many of the laws of nature are formulated as local interactions. One point in
space and time affects only its close neighborhood. It can happen that these
local interactions cancel each other out so that the global effect is small and
that the systems remain kind of unaffected or it can happen that the local
interactions reinforce each other and lead to large scale effects. The two
alternatives do happen and they depend on very subtle effects (e.g. rather deep
and abstract number theory is the key to very measurable effects). Even if the
importance of the has been recognized by applied mathematicians for centuries,
it is only very recently that a rich enough toolkit has been developed by many
start tackling it. Different people, have been making different techniques to
work together, and they have started producing results. As a witness to the
interest, the PI of this proposal has been co-organizer of special semesters in
CRM (Barcelona) Fall 2008 and Fields institute (Spring 2011).
