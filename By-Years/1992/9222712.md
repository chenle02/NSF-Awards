This project is an experimental and theoretical investigation of phase
separations of ternary aqueous protein solutions. The solutions will be studied
by static and dynamic light scattering spectroscopy as well as biochemical
chromatographic and centrifugation methods. The theoretical studies will use the
Carnahan-Starling mixing entropy and a mean field model for the interaction
energies in order to construct a Gibbs free energy for the system. This will
potentially provide a route to interpretation and prediction of phase boundaries
and compositions of coexisting phases. The results will be of significance for
the general area of biomolecular materials purification and processing.
