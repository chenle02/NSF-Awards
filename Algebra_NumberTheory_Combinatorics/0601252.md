The investigator and his collaborator have established a connection between the
Castelnuovo Theory of subvarieties in projective space, and the geometric
Schottky problem, i.e. that of identifying Jacobians among all principally
polarized abelian varieties based on geometric properties of the polarization.
This includes in particular a relationship with the celebrated Trisecant
Conjecture of Welters. They are now approaching directly the Trisecant
Conjecture, using these connections, as well as homological $M$-regularity
methods. They are also interested in developing a "higher Castelnuovo-Schottky
theory", based on deeper similarities between subvarieties in projective space
and those of abelian varieties. In this respect, one of the main points they are
interested in is a conjecture of Debarre on which are the subvarieties of
principally polarized abelian varieties representing minimal classes.

The Trisecant Conjecture, or the Strange Duality Conjecture, are among the most
prominent conjectures in the respective directions (which can be called roughly
speaking the abelian and non-abelian theory of theta functions). The proved
statements, or even significant progress towards them, would have a large number
of consequences, as documented in numerous places in the literature. Further
development of the asymptotic methods has the potential to provide new insight
into the geometry of every smooth projective variety, the main objects of study
in algebraic geometry. All parts of the project would further the knowledge in
the field, would have a broad range of applications, and will create interaction
with people of different backgrounds. Many of the problems in this proposal are
of interest to researchers in adjacent fields, like complex analysis (theta
functions), complex analytic geometry (transcendental methods in algebraic
geometry) and conformal field theory (conformal blocks), and will lead to
interactions with some of them.
