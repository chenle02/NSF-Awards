The Garden Mosaics program will develop and test a model in which youth conduct
research on community and home gardens in urban settings. Youth ages 11-18 will
be recruited to participate in gardening activities in conjunction with elders
from their communities. Students learn the science content associated with
organismal biology, community ecology, ecosystems and the physical environment,
as well as culturally-related food growing practices. Participants then take
part in guided research; using methods such as transect walks, mapping,
ecosystem models and soil tests, to document food-growing practices of immigrant
minority and traditional gardeners. Expanded research investigations will be
open to students who want to continue their explorations using the Internet and
other resources. Students contribute to new and existing databases of ethnic and
heritage gardening practices in the United States. Materials to be developed
include an Educator's Manual, a Youth Handbook and a Garden Mosaics website.
During the pilot phase a national leadership team will be established to test
the program and materials at 10 sites in different cities across the U.S.
including San Antonio, Baltimore, Boston, Sacramento, New York, Brooklyn and
Philadelphia. It is anticipated that the dissemination of this model will reach
more than 750 educators and 13,000 youth.
