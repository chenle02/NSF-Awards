Chesley&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0125773&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding magma genesis
in continental arcs is difficult because contamination in the mantle source area
and contamination of mantle-derived magmas by assimilation of lithospheric
mantle or crustal rocks during ascent and emplacement produce similar
geochemical characteristics. We have been studying the trans-Mexican volcanic
belt (TMVB) in order to constrain these processes. We feel our previous work has
shown that 187Os/188Os is an excellent proxy for assimilation, the geochemistry
of samples with low 187Os/188Os (0.13-0.15) is primarily the result of source
contamination, whereas geochemistry of samples with high 187Os/188Os (0.15-0.45)
is the result of a more complex history that includes assimilation. The ability
to decipher different inputs into arc magmas offers an opportunity to couple
other elemental and isotopic systems into this framework to help unravel
different inputs from source contamination and assimilation. We propose further
study, of continental arc volcanism along the Trans-Mexican volcanic belt,
whereby we utilize a combined approach of major and trace elements with Os, Pb,
Sr and O isotopic analysis on whole rock or olivine and magnetite mineral
separates of previously characterized samples, together with new samples from
key localities. These data will be used to constrain the relative importance of
source vs. crustal contamination for different components and isotopic systems
in magma genesis across this arc. Specifically, we will examine: 1) The relative
roles of mantle source contamination versus crustal contamination in basaltic
magmas within individual fields and across the entire Mexican arc from west to
east. 2) Determine whether volcanic fields (Palma Sola) in eastern Mexico are
related to subduction of the Cocos plate or are part of the eastern alkalic
province, which is unrelated to subduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
