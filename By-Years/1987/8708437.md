Funds are requested to acquire a fully automated, multispectrometer electron
probe micronalayzer to be used for research in the Department of Geology and
Mineralogy at Ohio State University. The microprobe is required for analysis of
minerals, rocks and other geological materials and is an essential tool for
modern research in petrology, mineralogy, crystallography, geochemistry,
economic geology, and paleomagnetic studies. Ohio State University has a large
number of active researchers in these and othere areas of research who presently
have no access to an electron microprobe.
