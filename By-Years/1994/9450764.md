9450764 Gaffney A regional center for calculus reform is being established in
the Boston area centered at Northeastern University. As part of this effort,
curriculum reforms are being made to the multivariable and differential equation
courses, and throughout the full range of calculus and precalculus courses. The
completed reforms will affect over 150 sections; over 15,000 students will
enroll in these courses in the next 5 years. Working with Northeastern's
Comprehensive Regional Center for Minorities, the project is strengthening and
helping create precalculus and calculus programs in public high schools in the
City of Boston, and other urban school districts with large minority
enrollments. As an incentive for students and teachers to join this program,
Northeastern will award credit to all high school students completing a calculus
course through this program. There will also be a regional network of school
teachers and college faculty committed to the adaptation and dissemination of
the ideas and techniques of the reform movement, reaching thousands of area
students. This network will maintain a software and materials library and
sponsor seminars, workshops, and regional conferences.
