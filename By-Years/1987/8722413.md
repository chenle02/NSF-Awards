The purpose of this research is to study theoretically and experimentally the
evolution, transport and decay of coherent and incoherent waves (diffused waves)
in random and diffused media. It involves a two-dimensional extension of two
highly fruitful NSF sponsored research on one-dimensional coherent wave
propagation in random media with applications to acoustic emission source
characterization, to acoustic emission receiver calibration and to material
characterization through internal friction. The incoherent wave will extend the
above to practical materials with pronounced microstructural effects. The
results of these studies will add to our understanding on wave propagation in
real materials with immediate applications to nondestructive evaluation and
acoustic emission techniques.
