0203502&lt;br/&gt;Knox&lt;br/&gt;This award to University of California at San
Diego will provide instrumentation for oceanographic research for use by the
Oceanographic Data Facility of Scripps Institution of Oceanography, as well as
specific instruments for use on the four research vessels operated by the
institution, R/Vs Revelle, Melville, New Horizon and Sproul. All four of these
research vessels are operated by the university as part of the University-
National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. Specific
instrumentation to be acquired includes a GPS unit for vessel attitude
monitoring, a thermosalinograph, sixteen computers for shipboard use, two new
CTD (conductivity-temperature-depth) systems with carousels for water sampling,
three conductivity/temperature/pump sets for use with the CTDs, three new oxygen
sensors, upgrades for autotitrator systems, and new cable and fairing for the
towed, undulating vehicle system. The shared-use instrumentation supported here
will assist marine scientists conduct studies worldwide on SIO and other
research vessels during 2002 and future years.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
