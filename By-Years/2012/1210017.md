This action funds Marcus Welker of Dartmouth College to conduct a research
project, entitled "Restoration of Lake Champlain Atlantic salmon: A study of
river and hatchery amino acids," during the summer of 2012 at Hokkaido
University in Sapporo, Japan. The host scientist is Dr. Hiroshi Ueda.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to understand the spatial and
temporal variability of amino acids in river and hatchery waters - two key
pieces of the Lake Champlain Atlantic salmon restoration systems. Amino acids
are one of the key odorants responsible for the migratory and homing abilities
of salmonids, however due to their economic and water quality insignificance,
very little research has been conducted on their presence and concentrations in
salmon streams.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
