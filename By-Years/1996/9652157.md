Salish Kootenai College Environmental Science faculty proposes to develop an
instructional methodology which infuses scientific and environmental literacy
and critical thinking throughout the overall college curricula. The
philosophical basis of this project is that professionals in any field must have
the ability to synthesize relevant scientific and environmental information into
decision-making. Environmental sciences provide the natural bridge between the
sciences and non-science curricula, particularly for Native American students,
because interest in the environment and natural resources is traditionally
strong. This project will include curriculum development on two levels. First is
pairing of eight environmental courses with eight courses in other disciplines,
including Native American studies, business management, English, math,
anthropology, nursing, human services, and computer sciences. These course
pairings will involve integrated student projects, parallel topics, and group
discussions. Second is incorporation of environmental modules into nine other
course disciplines, developed by environmental sciences and other instructors as
a cooperative effort. Results will be disseminated as a manual, on the internet,
and in professional meetings.
