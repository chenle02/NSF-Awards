Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) is a widespread bacterial pathogen of chickens and
turkeys that jumped to House Finches in eastern North America in 1994. For the
past 16 years, this new songbird disease has been restricted in range to the
east and Pacific Northwest of North America, but the pathogen is now spreading
as an epizootic through the southwestern range of the House Finch. The purpose
of the proposed research is to document this new outbreak of MG by collecting
cultures of MG and archiving genome and transcriptome samples from finches
during the first year of the appearance of MG in House Finches in Tempe,
Arizona. This award will create a valuable set of samples for future research.
By screening for genes that show rapid evolutionary change in both the host and
the pathogen, it will be possible to identify those genes that are the central
players in the host and pathogenicity by MG. The project will promote science
education through the involvement of undergraduate students and include outreach
to the general public about studies of MG at backyard feeding stations.
