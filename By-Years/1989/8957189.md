This research involves: (1) Expanding the scope of initial work in capacity
planning to other types of manufacturing systems such as those with batch
processing and assembly; (2) Choice of Technology, investment planning in a
dynamic environment with the objective of developing models that examine the
trade-offs between flexibility and associated costs, and provide a basis for
evaluation of new technologies, especially in CIM and FMS systems; and (3)
Design of Quality in Manufacturing Systems. Traditionally, quality in
manufacturing has emphasized conformance. Recent success of Taguchi and related
approaches suggest that an integrated view that takes into account design,
manufacturing and market response is likely to be beneficial. This research will
examine economic and managerial issues involved in the design of quality control
systems. The research will be directed at developing integrated models that
examine strategic and design choices in manufacturing. These choices occur
within a framework that includes policies from other functional disciplines such
as engineering, product design and marketing. These concepts have been referred
to as concurrent Life Cycle Design analysis and Design for Manufacturability.
Empirical research suggests that these ideas are one of the key factors in the
success of Japanese manufacturers. Initially the focus will be on the
development of models for performance evaluation and optimization to support
design decisions.
