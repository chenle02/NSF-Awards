Integrating adaptive fault tolerance and real-time systems is an important
research area needed for many applications such as robotics, air traffic
control, automated manufacturing, and space exploration. Typically, researchers
work in one or the other of these two areas. We propose a cooperative activity
between the University of Massachusetts which will supply the real-time
expertise and CNR-Pisa which will provide the adaptive fault tolerance
expertise. The main technical objective of the cooperation is to develop basic
research results for adaptive fault tolerant systems that dynamically address
real-time constraints, but at the same time provide system level, a priori
minimum guarantees.
