Improvement Research: Agricultural Change and Its Implications for Land-Cover
Transformations in Madagascar The primary objective of this dissertation
improvement research is to identify and explain the paths of agricultural change
occurring in agrarian landscapes adjacent to natural reserves in Madagascar, and
to associate these trajectories of change with spectral, spatial, and temporal
land-cover patterns identifiable with remotely-sensed imagery. These forces and
trajectories are identified with surveys and field work within representative
villages in these landscapes. They are then linked with the use of remotely-
sensed imagery and GIS to their general patterns of land-cover consequences
within not only the cultivated areas but within the adjacent reserves. The
research will contribute to an understanding of the local-level dynamics that
give rise to particular paths of agricultural change and their land-cover
impacts. In addition the research assesses the role of one kind of
institutionalized protected area (natu re reserves) on agricultural change--a
role that has not been well developed within the agricultural change literature.
