This project will address broadening participation challenges concerning
underrepresented minority students seeking STEM degrees at institutions of
higher education in Southern California. Data show that Latino students in
particular are well-represented at local two-year colleges (TYC) but less well-
represented among STEM bachelor's degree recipients. In order to promote success
for TYC students with an interest in STEM, the project will build upon and
expand the model for strengthening transfer pathways from TYC to four year STEM
degree programs developed through the current program Strengthening Transfer
Education and Matriculation in STEM at California State University, Fullerton
(CSUF). The pilot will focus on replicating the most effective components of the
CSUF model at California Polytechnic State University Pomona (CPP). The pilot
project will target STEM students at Citrus College, a two-year college (TYC) in
Glendora, CA that feeds both CSUF and CPP. If the pilot is successful, it could
be expanded to additional Southern California campuses of the CSU system and
regional TYCs whose students transfer to these campuses. Once the most effective
elements of the model are identified, the model could be adopted by all twenty-
three campuses in the CSU system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project targets
students who have already expressed interest in STEM careers, seeking to improve
the rates at which they persist in higher education, transfer to four-year
institutions, and eventually enter the STEM workforce. The project builds upon a
proven model, seeking to examine the conditions under which this model can be
replicated at institutions with different cultures and constraints, to develop
better understanding of the elements of the model most essential for success,
and to establish partnerships and create a pilot of the model at another
institution. This project will increase the reach of an intervention model with
a proven track record and documented positive outcomes. These interventions
include an undergraduate research experience for the TYC students, peer
mentoring at both the TYC and the four-year institution, a transfer support
program at both the TYC and the four-year institution, and required advising and
co-curricular activities.
