Researchers supported under this project will apply a combination of theory,
numerical models, and analysis of existing observations to advance understanding
of a number of key aspects of hurricane dynamics. The investigators contend that
fundamental understanding of underlying atmospheric dynamics has come primarily
from studies with balanced models and potential vorticity dynamics. The approach
in this proposal will be to examine data with guidance from the basic dynamical
concepts developed in theoretical and numerical work. The intellectual merit of
this work will come through coordinated examination of a number of specific
topics that include: (1) Warm ring thermal structure; (2) balanced wind and mass
fields and their relation to eyewall slope; (3) hypersensitivity of
intensification rates to eyewall position (as a diabatic heating source relative
to the zone of highest inertial stability); (4) Burger's shock structures
produced by strong radial inflow in the hurricane boundary layer; (5) lower-
stratospheric structure above a hurricane; and (6) inadequacies of the Saffir-
Simpson scale. Broader impacts will accrue through training of graduate
students, increased interaction between applied mathematics and atmospheric
dynamics communities, and the development of user-friendly software for
application and exploration simplified dynamical principles that will be made
freely available to other researchers. This research will also address a
significant issue, viz. the need for improved physical understanding and
forecasts of mechanisms leading to rapid changes in the intensity and resulting
societal impacts of hurricanes.
