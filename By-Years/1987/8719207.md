An investigation of the properties of Seyfert galaxies at scales of tens of
lightyears to thousands of lightyears will be carried out. First, a program of
direct imaging and spatially resolved spectroscopy of optical emission lines
will be continued. The aims are to determine the ionization and kinematical
structure of the gas, the morphology of the narrow line region and its relation
to the jet-like radio continuum sources, and to isolate circumnuclear
starbursts. These high resolution observations will mainly be made at Cerro
Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) and on Mauna Kea, Hawaii. When
possible, advantage will be taken of seeing compensating systems such as the
Image Stabilizing Instrument System at Mauna Kea. Second, the profiles of
several ion species will be determined to investigate correlations between
velocity spread, critical density, ionization potential, and radius in active
galaxies. Third, high resolution, diffraction limited, imaging observations will
be made in the 8 - 13 micron band with a new array camera system developed at
the National Aeronautics Space Administration Goddard Space Flight Center.
Fourth, the properties of warm molecular gas in the circumnuclear environment
will be probed by means of the 2.12 micron wavelength line of molecular
hydrogen. These data and others will be confronted with spherically symmetric
infall and wind outflow models of galaxies. The nature of the striking
morphological similarity between the narrow line region and the radio continuum
sources will be investigated. Models in which this connection represents partial
beaming of the ionizing radiation along the radio axis will be explored. Lastly,
the data will be used to perform a comprehensive investigation of circumnuclear
starbursts in Seyfert galaxies.
