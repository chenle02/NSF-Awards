The objective of this project is to understand the mechanism by which Drosophila
and other multicellular eukaryotes repair covalent interstrand crosslinks
between the two strands of the DNA duplex. This type of damage, which can occur
as a result of exposure to a number of compounds, has catastrophic implications
for the ability of a cell to replicate its genome. It is unique in that
crosslinking simultaneously damages sequences on both strands of the duplex,
preventing use of either strand as a template for repair. From genetic screens
for mutants uniquely hypersensitive to crosslinking agents, a small group of
genes has been identified that appear to be play essential roles in crosslink
repair, but to have no essential role in other repair pathways. This phenotype
distinguishes these genes from the majority of genes involved in crosslink
repair, which are essential components of other major repair pathways. The
specific roles in crosslink repair of the four crosslink-specific genes are
unknown. The crosslink-sensitive genes, which include mus308, snm1 and two novel
mutations, will be studied at the genetic, molecular and biochemical levels to
deduce their functional characteristics. The novel mutations will be genetically
and molecularly characterized. The snm1 gene, for which there is no mutant
allele in Drosophila, will be subjected to targeted and classical mutagenesis
until a mutation is obtained. When clones and mutations are available for each
of the four genes, the DNA repair phenotypes of all four will be characterized.
Epistatic interactions will be determined to position these genes in repair
pathways. Interactions at both the genetic and biochemical level will be
determined to test the hypothesis that they function as components of a unique
aspect of crosslink repair, and biochemical characterization will be performed
to understand the molecular role they serve in this process.
