Research will be conducted on lock-free and wait-free shared- object algorithms
for multiprogrammed systems in which several processes may execute on the same
processor. In such systems, process delays are quite common, due to preemptions.
Most lock- based synchronization algorithms perform poorly in the face of such
delays, because a delayed process holding a lock can impede the progress of
other processes waiting for that lock. Furthermore, lock-based algorithms are
susceptible to problems such as deadlock and priority inversion. Lock-free and
wait-free algorithms do not suffer from these problems. Previous research on
lock-free and wait-free algorithms has almost exclusively focused on
asynchronous execution models in which processes may interleave arbitrarily.
Such models can be a hindrance when designing algorithms for multiprogrammed
systems, because they force interleavings to be considered that cannot arise.
What is needed is a new framework for lock-free and wait-free synchronization
directed toward multiprogrammed systems. The main objective of this project is
to develop such a framework. This framework will be established through a
combination of research on lock-free and wait-free algorithms for
multiprogrammed systems, and lower-bound results relevant to the development of
such algorithms. The framework will be experimentally evaluated using simulation
models, synthetic workloads, and real-world applications.
