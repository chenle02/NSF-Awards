Funding is provided for the acquisition of a pulsed ruby laser holographic
camera and the necessary components for image reconstruction. The system will be
used in projects that require determination of the exact size and location of
microscopic particles and bubbles in a liquid medium. In the first project
microscopic bubbles will be used as pressure sensors in order to measure the
free stream pressure fluctuations in water jets. The second project will focus
on the role of turbulent boundary layer vortex structures in the entrainment of
solid particles for a sand bed and the onset of sediment transport.
