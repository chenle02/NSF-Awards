During the 1930s and 1940s two sizable groups of African Americans were
interviewed with the work sheets of the American Linguistic Atlas Project: 1) in
1933 Lorenzo Turner conducted 21 interviews among Gullah speakers in seven South
Carolina and Georgia counties; 2) Guy Lowman and Raven McDavid completed a total
of 32 interviews from Maryland south to Georgia. The responses of these speakers
were transcribed impressionistically in fine IPA phonetics. This project will
enter the responses for these informants, plus the responses of nine more
African Americans interviewed for the Linguistic Atlas in the 1 960s and 1 970s,
into a computer database. Access to the database will be enabled on the existing
Linguistic Atlas Web site, which is already receiving over 10,000 `hits` per
month. The general public and scholars alike will be able to browse and search
the African American and Gullah materials in the same way that they now can
access data from the Linguistic Atlas of the Middle and South Atlantic States;
they will also be able to make maps of `who said what where` within the
database. Ready access by scholars to this large, consistent corpus of
historical African American English should make possible new analyses of the
lexicon and pronunciation which can comment on the origins and nature of
contemporary African American Vernacular English.
