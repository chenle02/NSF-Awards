This project is developing three inquiry-based, lab-focused, online Climate
Change EarthLabs modules as a context for ongoing research into how high school
students grasp change over time in the Earth System on multiple time scales.
Climate literacy has emerged as an important domain of education. Yet it
presents real challenges in cognition, perception, and pedagogy, especially in
understanding Earth as a dynamic system operating at local to global spatial
scales over multiple time scales. This research project confronts these issues
by examining the challenges to high-school students' understanding of Earth's
complex systems, operating over various temporal and spatial scales, and by
developing research-based insights into effective educational tools and
approaches that support learning about climate change and Earth Systems Science.
The project is a collaborative effort among science educators at TERC,
Mississippi State University, and The University of Texas at Austin. The project
uses a backward-design methodology to identify an integrated set of science
learning goals and research questions to inform module development. Development
and review of draft materials will be followed by a pilot implementation and
then two rounds of teacher professional development, classroom implementation,
and research in Texas and Mississippi. Research findings from the multiple
rounds of implementation will allow an iterative process for refining the
modules, the professional development materials, and the research program.

This project focuses on the design, development, and testing of innovative
climate change curriculum materials and teacher professional development for
Earth Systems science instruction. The materials will be tested in states with
teachers in need of Earth Systems Science training and with significant numbers
of low income and minority students who are likely to be hard hit by impending
climate change. The research will shed light on the challenges of education for
climate literacy.
