9416907 Ram This symposium focuses on the biology of zebra mussels. Zebra
mussels are recent invaders of North American fresh- water ecosystems, carried
here in 1986 from Europe in ballast water of a ship that flushed its ballast
tanks into Lake St. Claire near Detroit, Michigan. Zebra mussels settle in large
numbers on hard surfaces and grow rapidly, so that they often coat underwater
structures and displace native freshwater mussels. Zebra mussels have received a
great deal of attention because of their economic impact as fouling organisms,
but very little research has been directed toward understanding of their basic
biology. The symposium gathers scientists to summarize and discuss current
research into the biology, ecology and physiology of zebra mussels. The
participants include two female and eight male scientists who study zebra
mussels, drawn from both academic and management organizations, The proceedings
of the symposium will be published in the American Zoologist, a major research
journal. The result will be a relatively complete and accessible summary of the
basic biology of a species that is an economically and ecologically important
invader into North American streams and lakes.
