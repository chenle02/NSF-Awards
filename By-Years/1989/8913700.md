Energetic charged particles precipitating into the earth's atmosphere cause
atmospheric heating, ionization and optical emissions. The understanding of
these effects requires the knowledge of the ability of the various atmospheric
constituents to react to these particles. The measurement of this ability to
transfer energy is done in laboratory cross-section experiments. The work
proposed here focuses on the accurate measurement of absolute cross-sections
which can be applied directly in theoretical models that predict the aeronomic
consequence of particle precipitation. This research centers on collision in
atmospherically relevant species, specially including the atomic oxygen atom.
New techniques will be implemented for mass spectrometry, measurement of large
scale scattering, production of O-atom scattering targets and study of
dissociative excitation.
