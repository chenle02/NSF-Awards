This research develops the understanding of fatigue crack growth in stage I for
"load" control. Copper single crystals are selected as the specimen material
because of the well-categorized behavior of the material under prior strain
control experiments. Dislocation substructure stability and strain partitioning
are examined under load control testing. Considerations include how variable
loading influences the development of local strain and Stage I crack growth. The
results will be used to form a model of damage accumulation for estimating
fatigue lifetimes.
