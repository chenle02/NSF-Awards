Research team members will collaborate to use island black rats as bioproxies to
understand the history of human voyages across oceanic expanses. Through genetic
investigation of species introduced to islands by human voyagers it should be
possible to determine when they were introduced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
research team is investigating the origin of long distance maritime movement
using genomic analysis of invasive black rats. Recent advances in population
genomics, specifically high-throughput genotyping of single base pair DNA
changes, whole genome sequencing, and statistical estimation of demographic
histories, have made it possible to infer the geographic origins and timing of
rat introductions from contemporary samples. Such approaches will be used in
this project to learn when, and from where, rats first reached an island
setting. Establishing the antiquity of such rat populations will help
archaeologists determine sites for future research. This project will
significantly revise understanding of remote voyaging networks with all their
transformative cultural, economic, and ecological
impacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
