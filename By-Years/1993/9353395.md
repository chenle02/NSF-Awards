9353395 Badar This project will increase the engineering awareness of high
school teachers from northeast Ohio. Project activities are done at Case Western
Reserve University (CWRU) where participating teachers will have access to a
state-of-the art materials and engineering laboratory. They will work in eight
different areas of engineering: Computer Engineering, Materials Engineering,
Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Civil Engineering, Chemical Engineering,
Biomedical Engineering and Systems Engineering. The major components of this
three year project are: two-Saturday workshops and a one-day program during each
academic year for 120 accomplished teachers; two-week, all-day summer institutes
for 30 commuting teachers; sustained support and networking of teachers with
CWRU faculty; and a requirement that institute participants conduct engineering
career programs for other teachers, students, parents, guidance counselors and
administrators. Workshop attendees will experiment with project kits, relating
"real-world engineering problems" to classroom activities. Teachers will also
engage in discussions and demonstrations of various disciplines in engineering.
It is intended that the hands-on experience with engineering projects and design
will provide content and new methods useful to them in teaching their courses
plus becoming a resource for career information. ***
