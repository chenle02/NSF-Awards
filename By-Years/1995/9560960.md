9560960 Dixon This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to
discover a fundamental new approach to a problem older than Noah; namely, how to
keep the bottoms of boats free from biofouling in an environmentally acceptable
manner. Since Noah first used pitch, man has relied on toxic materials to
inhibit biofouling. Unfortunately these materials have tended to persist in the
marine environment. Increased use of marine resources by man has tended to
compound the problem to the point where today selection for use from only a very
short list of toxicants is permitted, and even choosing substances from this
list is undesirable. The objective of this research is to demonstrate that the
use of persistent toxicants is unnecessary. Laboratory formulation of phototoxic
surfaces are proposed as well as tests of their resistance to biofouling in the
marine environment. If successful, the approach will largely replace coatings
which rely on persistent toxicants such as copper and organotin compounds.
Bottom paint, which represents a multimillion dollar worldwide market, is
primarily manufactured and sold by foreign firms using technology which is a
century old. Their products are solvent based and hazardous to apply and remove.
Paint chips must be collected and disposed of as hazardous waste. Replacing this
technology with one that is more environmentally acceptable is very desirable
and is becoming increasingly essential as country after country bans toxicants
for antifouling.
