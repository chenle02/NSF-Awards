The Society of Automotive Engineers is planning the feasibility for the
development of three intensive units for grades six through eight about which
the entire curriculum could be integrated for a few weeks. The units would take
the form of automotive engineering design experiences: exploring automotive
systems, flight technology and ground transportation. The materials would be
targeted to specific grade levels and engage multiple community resources in
dynamic ways. The planning period is to form collaborations with the other major
national curriculum groups, and educational researchers and middle school
personnel and to develop the prototype of the technological challenges which
form the core of the integrated learning experience. Based on their experience
with The World in Motion, the project will reach about 10% of the student body
nationally through interactions with engineers in corporations and universities.
The goals of the project also include the long term collaboration of businesses,
professional societies and universities, the involvement of individual engineers
with the education of middle school students, and the encouragement of a greater
diversity of students to consider engineering as a career. The planning period
is to establish a program development office, to hold a planning conference to
establish the collaborations, to develop and obtain reaction to a prototype and
to prepare a proposal for developing the curriculum units.
