Heterogeneous reaction pathways involving water droplets in clouds and fogs are
increasingly seen as important conduits for chemical transformation of
atmospheric trace gases. One of the basic parameters which determines the
transfer rate of trace gases into atmospheric droplets is the mass accommodation
or "sticking" coefficient for trace gas molecules on aqueous surfaces. This
continuation research project, initiated under grant ATM-8400748, is designed to
study certain heterogeneous chemical processes of atmospheric importance. In
particular, the variation of sticking coefficients with droplet physical
parameters such as temperature and size and chemical parameters including
hydrocarbon surface layers and droplet chemical composition will be
investigated. These studies will broaden the applicability of our measurements
to the natural atmosphere. Chemical reaction kinetics at the droplet surface
will also be measured using this technique in order to determine whether bulk
aqueous reaction rates are appropriate for modeling heterogeneous processes in
clouds and fogs. Techniques for real-time droplet surface analysis such as
stimulated Raman scattering and laser induced fluorescence will be developed.
