Tilt-up structural systems are a popular construction system for commercial and
industrial buildings. There is a lack of data on the performance of tilt-up wall
systems during earthquakes. This research projects builds on data collected in
earlier research surveys. The research project includes building classification,
building analyses, and correlation of research results with actual observed
building performance during the Whittier Narrows earthquake. The results of the
research project will be useful in aiding practicing engineers in the design of
stable, economic, lightweight tilt-up-wall buildings with adequate strength and
ductility. The conclusions will be applicable to seismic zones but can also be
applied to other lateral loadings such as extreme winds.
