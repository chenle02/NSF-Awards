This project is to increase the effectiveness of courses and undergraduate
research in optical engineering. Students study the practical essentials of
fiber optic design especially those aspects that are verifiable in the
laboratory. Additionally there is opportunity for in-depth study and independent
research. Optical systems are designed and tested under conditions similar to
that of the workplace. Graduates are therefore better prepared for the kind of
practical work expected of them as optical engineers. Students are encouraged to
engage in special topics in optical engineering under the guidance of a mentor
with the expectation that some will seek careers in research who otherwise would
go directly into industry. In any case the research experience widens students'
horizons and allows then to contribute to the knowledge base of this
increasingly important area of engineering. The award is being matched by an
equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
