One of the most pressing problems, and hence most influential factors in future
computer architectures is the growing disparity in the performance of processors
and affordable (DRAM) memories. A workshop of experts is convened on the full
spectrum of issues relevant to this problem-including at least chip technology,
architecture, caching, new concepts in memory hierarchy, compiler optimization,
programming techniques, and algorithms. The objective of the workshop is to
assay the problem and suggest research agenda for the various areas bearing on
the issue. A report of the results of the workshop will be published.
