This award will partially cover participant costs for the 16th Symposium on
Study of Earth's Deep Interior (SEDI). The meeting will be held in Edmonton,
Canada from July 8-13, 2018. SEDI is an international scientific organization
dedicated to the Study of the Earth's Deep Interior. The ultimate goal of SEDI
is an enhanced understanding of the past evolution and current thermal, chemical
and dynamical state of the Earth's deep interior and of the effect of that the
interior has on structures and processes observed at the surface of the Earth.
The "deep interior" is generally considered to be the core and lower mantle, but
interest often extends to the surface, for example, in the study of mantle
plumes or dynamics of descending lithospheric slabs. The scientific questions
and problems of interest to SEDI include the geomagnetic dynamo and secular
variation, paleomagnetism and the evolution of the Earth's deep interior,
material properties at extreme conditions, structure and dynamics of the core
and mantle, core-mantle interactions, and the nature and location of deep
geochemical reservoirs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will contribute to
interdisciplinary education of US graduate students and beginning researchers by
fostering dialog with researchers at all levels at a relatively small workshop-
style meeting. The international format complements efforts by US national
groups such as CIDER and will be useful to those funded under or seeking funding
from the NSF CSEDI program. The structure of SEDI is intrinsically
interdisciplinary, providing many opportunities for intra- and international
collaborations on a broad range of topics that contribute to our understanding
of the deep earth and other planetary interiors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
