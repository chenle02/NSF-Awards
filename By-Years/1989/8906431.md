This project provides resources for the procurement of equipment to support
structural dynamics research. The equipment comprises a single laser Michelson
interferometric velocimeter with its associated control/display computers and
software for structural measurements. This system could establish the basis of a
unique and innovative technological advancement in experimental structural
dynamics modeling. The noncontacting characteristic of laser measurements
eliminates many of the problems of contaminated response data encountered with
accelerometers normally used in experimental structural analysis. Rotational
effects, which cannot be measured with translational transducers, can also be
determined with the laser velocimeter. The equipment supports two major current
research activities. The first, high density mode shape extraction and spatial
modal analysis, focuses on the experimental extraction of real or complex modes
of a structure at more than 65,000 points with 3 degrees of freedom. The second
activity addresses the assessment of existing modeling approaches and
development of new elasticity theories for predicting dynamic behavior of
structures. Furthermore, this velocimeter will be used for a six dimensional
comparison of finite element models and experimental modal analysis mode shapes
for the determination of finite modeling defects, for quantitative non-
destructive structural damage evaluation via detailed mode shape comparison, and
for the development of mathematical models from measured multi- mode six degree
of freedom experimental mode shapes.
