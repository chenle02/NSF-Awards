Postseismic Response to the M = 7.9 Nov. 3, 2002 Denali Earthquake This proposal
seeks funding for a field effort aimed at measuring the postseismic deformation
following the Mw = 7.9 Denali earthquake that occurred on November 3, 2002, on
the Denali fault in Alaska. Given the size of this earthquake and its
significance for improving our knowledge of postseismic processes and
lithospheric rheology, we decided to join a field effort led by the Geophysical
Institute, University of Alaska Fairbanks to remeasure campaign GPS benchmarks
and install continuous GPS sites. Purdue contributed 3 GPS receivers and sent 3
field operators. The field effort was coordinated by UAF, with the participation
of UC Berkeley and the technical support of three UNAVCO engineers. The Alaska
Volcano Observatory loaned 8 GPS receivers for this operation. A total of 11
continuous sites have therefore been installed in the area likely to be affected
by postseismic deformation. This operation is exploratory and high risk because,
at the time we went to the field, we did not know precisely what geophysical
signals to expect. However, given the magnitude of the event and its shallow
rupture, we knew from other examples that significant postseismic effects were
very likely (e.g. 1906, M=8.3, San Francisco earthquake; 1857, M=8, Fort Tejon
earthquake; 1946, M=8.2, Nankaido earthquake).
