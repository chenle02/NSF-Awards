An electronic, on-line Directory of Marine Scientists could be a valuable asset
to the Oceanographic scientific community and to the government agencies working
with this community. This effort is to conduct a one-year pilot-scale project to
test the feasibility of developing such a Directory. The Division of Ocean
Sciences' mailing list will be used to determine such factors as set-up and
maintenance costs, issues of privacy, and the extent of cooperation and
commitment from other agencies and professional societies. The results of this
project will be an updated and verified data base from which OCE will be able to
generate a mailing list and labels and the information needed to make a
reasonable judgement as to the feasibility of a full-scale on-line directory.//
