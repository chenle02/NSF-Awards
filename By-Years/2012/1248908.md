This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is aimed at the
development of an innovation which provides for ongoing, minimally invasive,
discreet delivery of medications to the distal 1/3 of the rectum. The project is
directed toward developing an optimized design and prototype of a rectal
medication administration device (RMAD). Almost all patients lose the ability to
swallow as they near death. Approximately 10% of hospice patients have severe
symptoms after the oral route is no longer functional. Unfortunately most of
these patients either die uncomfortably, or are admitted to the hospital for
symptom control. These outcomes are tragic for the patient, and cost the
healthcare system hundreds of millions annually. The rectum is highly
vascularized for rapid and effective absorption. The distal 1/3 of the rectum
partially bypasses the hepatic portal vein allowing medication to enter the
central venous system without a first pass effect through the liver. Rectal
medical administration is an excellent, yet underutilized modality due to lack
of an easy, discreet, and comfortable delivery option. The rectal medication
administration device will solve all of these current problems with rectal
medication delivery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial
potential of this project goes beyond the scope of hospice and palliative care.
For example, it is conceivable that the device could be used in various
emergency situations for hydration and medication delivery, seizure control
being one example. It is possible that every ambulance, military medic, or
special-forces soldier could carry one for medication delivery or hydration. It
would likely be used for the administration of retention enemas to relieve
constipated patients, for administration of antibiotics for severe bowel
infections, and numerous other applications. Cancer patients undergoing
chemotherapy with severe nausea and vomiting could use the device for anti-
nausea medication delivery at home. It is clear that advances in the field of
hospice and palliative care are very important. In 2009 there were 1.6M patients
in hospice in the US, growing at 11% per year. Close to 30% of Medicare dollars
are spent in the last year of life. The RMAD has the potential to reduce
hospital costs by over $500 million annually. The development of the rectal
medication administration device by Hospi Corporation will have profound
humanitarian and financial benefits both within the US and worldwide within the
hospice arena and well beyond.
