Mass transport due to the action of water waves near the bottom in shallow water
is to be investigated both theoretically and experimentally. Both an impermeable
as well as a porous bed at the bottom are to be used in the experimental
simulations, and mass transport velocities will be determined using Laser-
Doppler Anemometry. The experiments will deal with flat surfaces. The
theoretical modeling portion of the research will generalize the conditions to
include the effects of three-dimensionality, bottom topography, and turbulence.
