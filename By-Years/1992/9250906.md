The equipment requested includes a DNA synthesizer, a DNA sequencing apparatus
and power supply, a shaking water bath and x-ray film developing tanks. Together
with equipment already available in the department, this equipment will give the
PI the flexibility to tailor laboratory exercises to individual student
interests. The course will teach students to understand the processes in
addition to the mechanics of research in molecular biology.
