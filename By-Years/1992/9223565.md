In this Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) project in the Experimental
Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Thomas A. Stephenson of
Swarthmore College will study the photo-induced dynamics of the van der Waals
cluster NeBr2 and of the ion-pair states of I2. Specifically, the vibrational
predissociation dynamics of NeBr2 produced in a supersonic free jet expansion
will be examined via fluorescence induced by a probe laser to test model
predictions and to explore the effect of different electronic states. In the I2
studies the effect of electronic excitation on rotational and vibrational energy
transfer probabilities and pathways will be studied in single-collision state-
to-state collision dynamics experiments. %%% A crucial component in developing a
comprehensive framework for understanding chemical reactions is to elucidate the
forces involved as two atoms or molecules interact during collisions. The
studies undertaken here on atom-diatom systems are simple enough that they can
be understood and modeled theoretically, thus providing the groundwork for
understanding more complex systems. Such knowledge is crucial for understanding
all sorts of gas-phase dynamical processes, such as atmospheric reactions,
combustion, and even the synthesis of materials by chemical vapor deposition.
