This research will explore origins-of-life by studying the transition from a
primordial world in which RNA served as the repository of biological information
to the first cells with DNA-based genomes. Trainees will gain expertise with
chromosome-scale synthetic biology, a rapidly developing technology with
transformative capabilities. Educational components situated at the intersection
of STEM fields, social sciences, and rhetoric will engage a broad cohort of
students discussing pressing issues in ethics and governance and the themes that
shape scientific inquiry. Outreach will involve production of new media
accessible to non-experts paired with in-depth written companion
articles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most theories of the origins-of-life posit an RNA
world of self-replicating RNA molecules, followed by an RNA/protein world and
possibly RNA-based protocells, and leading to present-day cells where RNA has
been replaced by DNA as the information source. The transition from RNA to DNA
is crucial, yet little is known about the constraints of RNA as a cellular
genome. Although RNA-based cells no longer exist on Earth, RNA viruses may be
remnants of pre-DNA life, and RNA life may exist elsewhere in the universe. This
research will create new enabling technologies to launch artificial RNA
chromosomes (ARCs) in bacterial and eukaryotic cells, characterize the physical
stability of ARCs inside these hosts, measure the fidelity of information
transmission to daughter cells, and finally provide evidence for the information
capacity of RNA-based genomes. The ultimate goals are to establish ARCs as
essential chromosomes within E. coli and S. cerevisiae (yeast) hosts. These
cells would represent new forms of artificial life, which along with other novel
and radically modified organisms (N/RMOs) are of great public interest. The
current governance of N/RMOs will be surveyed, and ethics and governance
principles that should guide future research will be
recommended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
