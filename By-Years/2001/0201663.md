Since its inception in 1986, the main goal of the NBER Macroeconomics Annual
Conference has been to encourage promising and established young researchers to
write empirically oriented papers that draw out and test the empirical
implications of new theories as well as papers that use relevant theory to
analyze empirical or policy issues of current interest. There has also been a
tendency within the field of macroeconomics to split into different schools of
thought with little communication between these schools. Another goal of the
Macroeconomics Annual has been to provide an opportunity for macroeconomists
within different points of view to focus on different approaches to problems,
not in the abstract, but in relation to specific empirical issues. The
conference series will continue to encourage the writing of empirically oriented
papers by both established and promising young economists. In addition, the
series will continue to serve as a forum for communication among economists from
the different schools of macroeconomics. The annual conference volume has become
a widely cited and influential research reference.
