9623578 Larson Geographic structuring of a group of South American annual
fishes which inhabit seasonally wet environments will be analyzed using
variation in mitochondrial DNA sequences. Hypotheses that phenotypic variation
is correlated with molecular genetic variation, and that local adaptation to
extant environments explains distributional patterns of variation in life
history traits will be tested. By studying the distribution of molecular genetic
variation in a statistically rigorous manner, it will be possible to determine
whether phenotypic differences among populations reflect historical events or
current local adaptations. Research funded by this award should improve the
understanding of factors responsible for survival in environments experiencing
rapid, often stochastic fluctuations. Results will also have potentially broad
applied significance. Under normal conditions, temporary bodies of water become
a breeding ground for mosquitoes; thus killifish, due to their unique ability to
survive complete desiccation of their habitat, have been lauded as the ideal
mosquito control agents. By understanding which populations are most likely to
succeed in a given habitat, it will be possible to maximize the benefits of
killifish as successful mosquito control agents.
