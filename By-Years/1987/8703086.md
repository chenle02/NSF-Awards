This project concerns three areas of research that deal with particular kinds of
rule based systems: (1) logic programming, (2) stratification and knowledge base
management, and (3) Petri nets and vector addition systems. In area (1) several
problems are being investigated that deal with the analysis of fundamental
algorithms of unification &amp; generalization and semantic &amp; recursion
theoretic issues for Prolog and extensions such as Constraint Logic Programming.
In area (2), the PI is seeking applications of the notion of stratification to
rule based systems whose semantics are those of propositional logic. Intended
Model Semantics, querying and related issues are also under study. In area (3),
the PI is making proof-theoretic analyses of algorithms for Petri nets and
possible extensions. The problems proposed are important ones for which
solutions are needed to make logic programming sound and more generally
applicable. Results that will have practical impact are anticipated.
