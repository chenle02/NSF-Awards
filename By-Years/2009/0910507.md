This is a proposal submitted to both NSF and ARO for joint support, with each
agency being asked to fund separate but related facets of the proposal. We
propose to develop techniques which can be used for model reduction, whereby a
complex full-model is replaced with a smaller simpler approximation that
produces outputs within a desired degree of accuracy. Our proposed method
combines the data driven and model driven methods in that it makes use of
input/output data relationships as well as incorporates the physics of the
model. The overriding objective of this proposal is to formulate and generalize
model reduction via proper orthogonal decomposition in groundwater modeling in
one, two, and three dimensions and to develop a protocol for snapshot selection
based on the structure of both the governing equation and the parameters of the
model. We will also propose procedures whereby the reduced-model is utilized for
groundwater management as well as for solving the inverse problem of parameter
estimation. We will use numerical experiments and real case studies to show how
this new, robust methodology can be used to drastically reduce the computational
demand, while maintaining a significant degree of accuracy. The NSF portion of
the work focuses on error analysis of the reduced model, which is a key
component of the proposed research. Additionally, we will focus on verification
of the proposed methodology using field data for parameter estimation and
conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater. We have made arrangements with
the Calleguas Municipal Water District (CMWD) in southern California for
collaboration.
