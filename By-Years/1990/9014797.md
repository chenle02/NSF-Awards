Direct numerical solutions of the time dependent Hartree Fock equations for
ions colliding with atoms and solids will be carried out. Large scale computer
codes using B-spline and split operator methods have been developed to improve
the numerics. The techniques will be used to examine the non linear response of
metal foil conduction band electrons to the passage of larger particles, to ion-
atom collisions, muon capture and to the ionization of atoms by strong laser
pulses.
