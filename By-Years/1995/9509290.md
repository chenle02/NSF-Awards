9509290 Chen The long range objective of the proposed research is to elucidate
the fundamental principles that govern the differential and selective mRNA
degradation in mammalian cells. The focus of the research is on the molecular
mechanism by which p64, a polyribosome-associated RNA binding protein,
participates in the turnover of labile c-fos proto-oncogene mRNA through its
interaction with the cognate RNA target, an RNA determinant of instability
present in the c-fos protein coding region. In this application four specific
aims are proposed: 1. To purify the p64 RNA-binding protein and raise antibodies
to it, 2. To clone a full-length cDNA for p64, 3. To determine the RNA binding
specificity of the p64 RNA-binding protein, and 4. To characterize the
properties and functions of p64. The studies in this application will provide
significant insight into general biochemical and molecular principles governing
the differential decay of mRNAs in mammalian cells. %%% The identification of
diverse biological systems in which messengerRNA stability regulates gene
expression has demonstrated the importance and generality of this type of
control. In mammalian cells, the half-lifes of some mRNAs span several hours or
even days, while other mRNAs decay within minutes of their initial synthesis.
The molecular mechanisms by which mRNAs are differentially targeted for
degradation remain relatively poorly understood. The long range objective of
this research is to elucidate the fundamental principles that govern the
differential and selective mRNA degradation in mammalian cells which will, in
turn, further our understanding of basic mechanisms controlling cell growth and
differentiation. ***
