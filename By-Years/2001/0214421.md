This research seeks to understand whether large markets (i.e., markets
consisting of many buyers and many sellers) can effectively aggregate the
disparate pieces of information that each individual acting in the market
possesses. It is often said that prices "convey" information. How, exactly, is
this achieved? Under what conditions is it achieved? Stock markets are a prime
example of markets in which information plays a crucial role. When information
is freely available to all, it is well understood that markets operate
efficiently. But in reality each investor possesses a small amount of
information, which, on its own, might convey little about the value of the stock
in question. However, if the information possessed by all traders could somehow
be pooled, it would serve as a much better forecaster of the value of the stock.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We seek to understand whether market prices alone are
capable of conveying the information possessed by individual traders. When this
occurs, the market achieves a high level of efficiency. When this fails to
occur, one can begin to explore ways in which the market's design might be
responsible for the failure. Corrective measures might then be called
for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
