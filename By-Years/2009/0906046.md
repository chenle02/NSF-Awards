This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2009. The
fellowship supports a research and training plan entitled "The role of color
pattern polymorphism in the evolution of snake mimicry: a statistical
phylogeographic approach" for Alison Davis. The host institution for this
research the University of California - Berkeley and the sponsoring scientist is
Jim McGuire.

Mimicry is common in both plants and animals, with many cases of conspicuous
pattern-matching found among organisms. However, in mimicry systems where
harmless species (mimics) discourage predators by resembling toxic species
(models), many species paradoxically have coexisting mimetic and non-mimetic
color patterns (polymorphism). Because such variation governs the interactions
between models, mimics, and predators, identifying the role of polymorphism in
these systems is essential to understanding how mimicry is maintained or lost
over long periods of time. This research uses a computationally intensive
genetic approach to test hypotheses proposed to explain stable and widespread
polymorphism in a mimetic snake species, Sonora semiannulata.

The training objectives of the fellowship include developing advanced skills in
computational biology, including methods in statistics, molecular phylogenetics,
and bioinformatics. The scientific impact is to increase understanding of
mimicry systems and their evolutionary significance. The evolutionary history
likely has a large, but rarely investigated, influence on the dynamics and
distribution of mimetic types. The fellowship's broader impacts include
extensive mentoring and outreach activities, working with the University of
California's Science and Math Initiative and CalTeach programs to promote the
participation of underrepresented groups in the sciences.
