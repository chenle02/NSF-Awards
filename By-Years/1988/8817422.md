This is an award to provide support for research to determine the fate of
semivolatile organic chemicals under conditions representative of various
wastewater transport and treatment process. Research is planned to include all
elements of the collection system, and unit operations and processes in the
treatment plant. Research involves evaluation of the relationship of compound
removal to the parameters used to determine the performance capability of each
unit operation and process. The investigators plan to model the fate of
semivolatile organic chemical and expand this to consideration of volatile
organics as will be possible within time constraints. Laboratory scale
experiments under conditions representative of various components of wastewater
transport and treatment systems will provide a better basis than is now
available for assessing the fate and removal efficiency of semivolatile organic
substances during the treatment processes. The investigators expect that the
investigation of dynamic behavior of treatment processes will assist in
addressing problems relating to accidental spills of toxic semivolatile
substances identical and similar to those studied in this project.
