Post-translational modifications of proteins play a key role in the regulation
of physiology and development. For example, reversible phosphorylation is the
most common mechanism for cellular regulation in eukaryotic systems where it is
estimated that roughly one third of the total protein complement of a cell is
involved in this process. Coupled to this, the dynamic interactions of protein-
protein and protein-DNA interactions provide a complex series of transient
interactions crucial to life. In order to identify and measure all of these
events in a systems biology approach, new mass spectrometry equipment and
techniques must be developed. The development of high-Field Asymmetric waveform
Ion Mobility Spectrometry to exploit the full potential of Electron Transfer
Dissociation of peptides will provide steps towards more extensive measurement
of these proteins. This project will not only enhance the research
infrastructure at ISB but also integrate both educational activities and
research goals to enhance the teaching, training and learning by providing
innovative tools to maintain the cutting edge curriculum of courses held by ISB.
Used by experimentalists and computational biologists, the data collected will
ultimately inform researchers of proteome dynamics that are responsible for an
organism's form and functions. Information derived from this development will be
publicly accessible through the Seattle Proteome website
(http://www.proteomecenter.org) as well as regular research publications.
