CBET-0829057&lt;br/&gt;Tao&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partial support is provided for
the US-EU-China Thermophysics Conference-Renewable Energy (UECTC-RE), which will
be held in Beijing, China, on May 28 - 30, 2009. The purpose of this meeting is
to engage a diverse international community of researchers in the general field
of thermophysics and renewable energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to the
intellectual merit of the conference, increasing the adoption of renewable
energy technologies is inhibited by a lack of fundamental understanding of
thermofluid transport processes. Researchers in various countries are working on
different aspects of these issues, but there are limited opportunities for them
to communicate their research with one another, particularly in an
interdisciplinary environment. The subjects of particular interest in this
conference include renewable energy conversion processes, the built environment,
computational simulations, nanotechnology, energy storage, industrial
opportunities, and challenges in standards and
marketing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the conference include
engaging the international thermophysics research community, in particular
Chinese researchers, in this vital subject of renewable energy. The European
community will also be involved. The majority of the NSF funding will be used to
support US-based junior investigators and those from under-represented groups.
This conference could lead to enhanced collaborations among US, Chinese, and
European thermophysics researchers in renewable energy.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by the Thermal Transport Processes
(TTP) Program, and by the Energy for Sustainability Program, of the Chemical,
Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (CBET) Division.
