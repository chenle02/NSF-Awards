This doctoral dissertation research award is based on the idea that Supreme
Court justices seek as much information as possible about cases heard on the
merits. The problem, for the justices, is that almost all the information they
receive is what other actors want them to consider. In other words, the Court
has little control over the majority of information it is given. As a result,
unless justices ask that the parties brief a specific issue, there is only one
time when they may gather information they themselves want: the time set aside
for oral arguments. As such, these proceedings may play a unique and important
role in the Court's decision making process. In particular, this research
addresses two main questions: 1) What types of information do Supreme Court
justices seek to obtain during oral arguments; and, 2) Are oral arguments
important to their decisions on the merits. In answering these questions, the
project adopts a strategic approach to judicial decision making. This approach
suggest that Supreme Court justices seek to gather as much information as
possible about a case, because if they are to create efficacious policies, they
must formulate beliefs about how other actors will react to their decisions.
Further, if this information is important for the justices then it should be
addressed, both in their private deliberations, and in the Court's final
opinions on the merits. To assess these two predictions, the research examines
the specific types of information the justices gather during oral arguments, and
then compares the issues raised during these proceeding with the conference
notes, private papers, and final opinions of the Court to discern whether these
issues are addressed by the justices in their deliberative process.
