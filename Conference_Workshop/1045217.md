The first decade of the twenty-first century has witnessed the solution of many
fundamental and long-standing problems in algebraic geometry, including the
proof of finite generation of the canonical ring by Birkar, Cascini, Hacon and
McKernan and the discovery of a counterexample to Kodaira's conjecture by
Voisin. Furthermore, the modern techniques developed earlier in the decade have
led to far-reaching advances in the cohomology and the tautological rings of the
moduli space of curves, Gromov-Witten theory, the study of rational curves and
rational points on varieties and combinatorial descriptions of cohomological
invariants of homogeneous varieties. The PIs are organizing a conference
entitled "A celebration of algebraic geometry", on August 25-28, 2011 at Harvard
University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in order to reflect on these
developments and to disseminate the advances to early career mathematicians.
This grant will support young participants attending the conference.

Algebraic geometry is the study of the solutions to a collection of polynomial
equations. Even though algebraic geometry started more than two thousand years
ago, with the study of the geometry of conic sections, such as circles, we still
cannot completely answer many simple and fundamental questions. For example,
given a collection of polynomials, with finitely many solutions, we would like
to know the number of solutions. We know this number in many special cases, and
these cases have interesting applications in engineering and biology. The first
decade of the twenty-first century has seen tremendous advances on some of these
fundamental problems. For example, Birkar, Cascini, Hacon and McKernan have
shown that given a collection of polynomials, there is a nice way to present all
of the solutions. This presentation allows us to answer many interesting
questions. The PIs are organizing a conference to disseminate the advances of
the last ten years to young mathematicians. This grant will support the
participation of early career mathematicians at the conference.
