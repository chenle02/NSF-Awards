A large testing facility is being completed at the University of Houston to test
full-sized reinforced concrete panels under in-plane loadings. It consists of
thirty-seven 100-ton hydraulic jacks embedded in a large steel reaction frame.
The jacks are controlled by a sophisticated hydraulic system to produce in-plane
normal and shear stresses in a panel. Extensive tests of reinforced concrete
panels will be conducted to generate material laws which are required in the
development of the softened truss model theory. The equipment will upgrade the
facility to have the capability to apply out-of-plane loadings, including
bending moments, torsional moments and out-of-plane shear stresses. These out-
of-plane loadings will be supplied by seventeen additional 60-ton jacks. Since
both in-plane and out-of-plane stresses occur in an element of a shell
structure, the upgraded facility is known as a shell element tester.
