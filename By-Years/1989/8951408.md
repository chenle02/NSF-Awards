The Physics Department at Central Michigan University will establish a student
laboratory dedicated to laser physics. This laboratory will be located in the
new science building presently under construction. Four sets of experiments will
be available that cover the topics of the principles of laser operation,
holography, non-linear spectroscopy, and solid state lasers. Each of the basic
experiments can be extended to more detailed studies. These experiments have
been chosen to illustrate the state-of-the-art applications, equipment and
techniques presently in use in optics. The laboratory will serve students in the
Physics Department optics course as well as physics majors doing a senior
research project. In addition, it will be used by non-physics students,
particularly from the Art Department and from local high schools. The use by
non-physics student will mainly involve the production of holograms. The award
is being matched by an equal amount of non-federal funds.
