This project covers research activities in two areas of Artificial
Intelligence: knowledge-based expert systems and machine learning. One research
thrust focusses on developing a knowledge-based consultant system to aid in the
design of digital VLSI circuits. This research involves extending current
methods for developing rule-baszed expert systems, by applying them to design
tasks, and by integrating rule- based methods with algorithmic methods for
dealing with different aspects of the design task. The second research area,
machine learning, has focussed on developing the LEX system which learns
problem-solving heuristics by generating and solving practice problems. This
research has led to development of a domain-independent technique (goal-directed
learning) for generalizing from examples. Research on machine learning over the
coming year will include an attempt to apply these techniques to the task of
learning rules for VLSI design.
