This award will support international travel of younger US cognitive scientists
to enable them to participate in the full scientific program of the 23rd Annual
Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society, taking place August 1-4, 2001 in
Edinburgh, Scotland, the first such meeting outside of North America. The
participation of these younger (Ph.D. within the last six years) scientists, all
of whose research is on topics within the purview of NSF, will allow them to
forge connections with researchers in the international community. Thus, not
only will collaborations be born that could not start in other fashions, but
also the international visibility of these young US scientists will be enhanced.
