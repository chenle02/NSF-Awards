9500301 Spencer This project is to purchase a data acquisition and analysis
system which will be dedicated to inter-disciplinary research in engineering.
The equipment will be used to support ongoing NSF sponsored research efforts on
active, semi-active and hybrid control of structures for earthquake hazard
mitigation. The data acquisition system will allow for accurate determination of
mathematical models (both linear and/or nonlinear) from which appropriate
control strategies can be developed. Such models are essential, since many of
the most promising control devices are intrinsically nonlinear and hysteretic.
This equipment is expected to accelerate development of control
devices/strategies that are implementable in full-scale structures and to allow
prescribed modelling uncertainties and errors to be introduced to asses the
robustness and performance of the controlled structure. ***
