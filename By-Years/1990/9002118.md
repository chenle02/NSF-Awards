Body growth depends on a hormonal stimulus for growth and adequate quality and
quantity of nutrients. When nutrients are limiting, growth is stunted. Upon
removal of nutritional restraint, catch-up growth occurs. This project attempts
to elucidate how nutrition contols growth in an animal model in which
spontaneous running stimulates growth of lean body mass and skeleton. To assess
how exercise affects hormones of growth, and in conjunction with nutrients,
stimulates growth, measurements will be taken of gene activation for synthesis
of hormones of growth and of tissue proteins. This study will contribute to the
understanding of the mechanism of growth and of the nature of the stimulatory
effects of exercise and food energy on growth. The results may provide insights
for treatment of children or juvenile animals in whom dietary restriction
produces the stunting of growth.
