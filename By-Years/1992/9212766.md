Digital image coding of color video sequences will be supported by the new
equipment purchased under the aegis of this award. The system will be used for
developing and implementing data compression and digital signal processing
algorithms which will be applied to visual interactive systems such as medical
imaging or videotext. Acquisition of the equipment will stimulate development of
applications algorithms suitable for broadband integrated services digital
networks.
