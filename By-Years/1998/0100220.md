This is a Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award.
The goal of the project is to develop global meta-hybrid approaches and
corresponding software tools for the efficient solution of large-scale supply
chain optimization applications and other massive combinatorial optimization
problems. This research effort is built on recent research in heuristics for
combinatorial optimization, including the global meta-heuristic Nested
Partitions (NP) framework. The focus is on problem classes for which fast
heuristics may be developed for both the construction of feasible solutions and
for the improvement of such solutions. However, rather than considering
heuristics in isolation, the researchers wish to obtain maximum benefit from
their availability by employing them within the global framework of partition-
based strategies. The term global meta-hybrid is used to denote the combination
of a global meta-heuristic with linear programming technology. Such a hybrid
combines the lower bound information available from linear programming
relaxations with the upper bound and feasible solution data from the heuristic
in a synergistic fashion.

This project will yield mathematical techniques and corresponding computer
software for the generation of high-quality solutions for large-scale supply
chain models as well as large-scale combinatorial optimization problems arising
from other applications such as radiotherapy. Such problems are intractable for
current approaches that do not take advantage of the special properties to
exploit within the methodological framework. This project is a collaboration
with Rockwell Automation.
