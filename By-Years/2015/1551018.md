This renewal collaborative research project supports an ongoing US-Turkey pilot
program. Investigators from the City College of New York (CCNY) in the U.S. and
Istanbul Technical University (ITU) in Turkey will investigate and compare the
potential for, and impacts of, using RCA in concrete in both countries. The
project plan includes reciprocal visits by the U.S. and Turkish PIs to each
other's laboratories as well as a six month graduate student exchange during the
life of the project. The close working environment will expose individuals in
both teams to very different cultural and scientific environments and foster
closer relations between US and Turkish researchers.

A main goal of the research project is to develop, based on scientific findings,
a systematic procedure for producing reliable structural RCA concrete that will
be cost-competitive with conventional NA concrete and will reduce the
environmental impact of concrete production. Experimental facilities needed to
study materials at the micro-scale are at CCNY while facilities for full-scale
macro-scale structural testing are at ITU. Working with recycled concrete
aggregate producers and manufacturers of structural concrete in these two
markets will provide a unique opportunity to develop solutions across a wide
spectrum of real-life conditions and constraints.
