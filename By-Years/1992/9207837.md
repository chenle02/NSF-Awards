The primary objective of this proposal is to investigate environmental
influences on male reproductive functioning among the Turkana of Kenya. The
investigators have conducted exemplary research on the reproductive ecology of
Turkana women and the proposed research will extend their studies. The Turkana
are divided into settled and nomadic groups which differ in diet and activity
patterns. Additionally, strong seasonality in food supply leads to dietary
variation as well. The investigators will utilize blood and urine samples to
obtain profiles of testosterone and gonadotropins as well as other indicators of
physiological functioning and body composition. From prior studies it is known
that ecological factors strongly affect female reproductive biology. The current
study will be one of the first to explore the role of ecology in male
reproductive function.
