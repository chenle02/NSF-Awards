Minimization of potential energy characterizes phenomena throughout the natural
world. In certain systems, known as gradient flows, the principle of minimizing
potential energy as quickly as possible completely determines the system's
behavior. Examples include models of vortices in superconductors and of cells
communicating via chemical signals. The present project will study gradient
flows arising in physics, biology, and engineering through a unified approach
combining mathematical analysis and numerical simulation. This research will be
pursued in collaboration with undergraduate and graduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gradient flow systems at the heart of the
present research are nonlinear systems involving nonlocal interactions, which
arise not only in the examples mentioned previously, but also in robotic control
algorithms, geometric shape optimization, and quantum information theory. These
gradient flows do not satisfy traditional convexity assumptions of the calculus
of variations, and techniques from partial differential equations have been
unable to compensate for these limitations in the general theory. This project
aims to overcome these gaps through the development of more general notions of
convexity, well-posedness results that link dynamics and asymptotic behavior,
and novel spatial and temporal discretizations of the gradient flow problem. Two
key motivating questions are singular limits of gradient flows: (1) the nonlocal
approximation of diffusion and (2) the slow diffusion limit, a generalization of
the mesa problem. In both cases, convexity and regularity deteriorate in the
limit, bringing into focus the limitations of the existing
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
