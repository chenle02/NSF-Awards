"Lake.effect storms" are well known among weather forecasters. During late
autumn and early winter when cold air from Canada flows over the Great Lakes,
which are still relatively warm, extensive cloudiness and snow showers sometimes
occur on the lee side of the lakes. Previous work has shown that these storms
generally have a shallow vertical structure and frequently develop without any
upper.level dynamical forcing. The sensible heat flux from the lakes and the
surface friction collectively, so thought, play a role. However, are these
storms a forced phenomenon? Is there any instability mechanism at work? Using a
sophisticated primitive equation model for numerical simulations and a nonlinear
spectral model for examining the physics selectively, Professors Shirer and
Fritsch will address these questions.
