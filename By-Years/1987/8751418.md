The mathematical sciences in U.S. colleges and universities must respond to
dramatic changes in the nature of mathematics in the past 15 years and prepare
for the rapidly changing and complex national needs of the future. The project
MS2000 will produce a comprehensive assessment of college and university
mathematical sciences and an agenda for reinvigoration immediately and for
renewal by the year 2000. The present undertaking involves planning, initial
staffing, the preparation of a review paper on the supply and utilization of
mathematical talent, and the formation and one meeting of an oversight
committee.
