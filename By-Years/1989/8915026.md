This award will support a joint U.S.-Japan seminar to be held in Rockville,
Maryland, August 22-25, l990. The topic of the seminar is "Pesticides and the
Future -- Toxicological Studies of Risks and Benefits." The organizers are
Professor Ernest Hodgson of North Carolina State University and Professor Naoki
Motoyama of Chiba University, Matsudo, Japan. The principal objective of the
seminar is to examine the toxicological factors involved in the evaluation of
both risks and benefits of pesticides. Topics will include assessment of the
problem of non-target health and environmental effects, the role of
toxicological factors with particular reference to future needs and solutions,
and methods to improve both toxicity testing and risk assessment. The
participants are noted leaders in their fields of research. The seminar will
address current global concerns in this important area, and the results of the
discussion are expected to help guide the development of new pesticides. Because
the U.S. and Japan are the most important manufacturers and users of pesticides,
with strong research capabilities in these areas, this meeting should be of
benefit to both countries.
