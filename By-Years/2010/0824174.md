&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to help transform the power grid
into a smart and controllable grid, helping to regulate the voltage at select
nodes, and the current in specific branches, while improving the grid stability
margin. The approach is through the use of a new type of Flexible AC
Transmission or FACTS device - the Controllable Network Transformer, a device
that can provide dynamic amplitude and phase-angle control capability for
existing generators and load-tap changing transformers on the grid by using a
newly proposed concept of Virtual Quadrature Sources. The techniques will be
explored using analysis and simulation, as well as through experimental
validation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
basic mechanisms of grid control have remained unchanged for over 70 years.
Significant operating margins are needed to assure grid stability under dynamic
operating conditions and during system faults. It is anticipated that
Controllable Network Transformers based on Virtual Quadrature Sources will
provide a new method for achieving dynamic control of amplitude and phase angle
for node voltages on the grid. This will improve controllability and stability
of the system. The use of computational intelligence and conventional state-
estimation based techniques will be compared. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grid control is a key factor in improving asset
utilization and reducing energy cost. It is anticipated that broader deployment
of smart and controllable devices on the power grid will improve the
reliability, controllability and utilization of the grid, supporting economic
development, allowing increased penetration of renewable energy resources, and
reducing the overall cost of electricity.
