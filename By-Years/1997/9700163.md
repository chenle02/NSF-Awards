This research is concerned with algorithmic problems relevant to the design,
maintenance, and management of high speed communication networks. High-speed
integrated communication networks are going to be the most important
communication platform of the future, presenting new technological challenges.
The essence of many of these technological problems is the interactability of
certain simple network problems, such as routing and packet scheduling. The
research is concerned with developing fast and simple approximation algorithms
for these combinatorial problems. Such algorithms can serve as tools for
successfully answering these challenges. Some of the more promising approaches
will be tested on real network data. Designing efficient methods to get packets
of information across a communication network is one of the main problems in
implementing Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network(BISDN) standards,
such as ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode). The packet routing problem is simply
that of moving packets in a communication network from their sources to their
desired destinations quickly, reliably, and using as few resources as possible.
A solution to this problem consists of two distinct (though by no means
independent ) parts: a selection of paths for the packets (routing) and a
schedule of the motion of packets along their selected paths (packet switching).
The main thrust of the research is on the two basic algorithmic issues: routing
and packet switching. The combinatorial essence of many real-life routing
problems is the disjoint paths problem. Research directions for the routing
problem include both off-line and online problems with worse-case, and
competitive analysis, respectively.
