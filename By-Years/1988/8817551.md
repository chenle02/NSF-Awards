This workshop is to answer the two most critical questions raised in the
original April 18-19 workshop on incineration, i.e., the apparent lack of
success in measuring the criteria pollutants with existing continuous monitoring
techniques, as well as the inadequacy of current commercial NOx removal systems.
Once the current monitoring failures in the field are analyzed by a group of
specialists and industrial users, the diagnostics experts will bring in their
experience from other applications and will identify the basic research needs of
incineration diagnostics. Furthermore, a low rate of performance has been
identified in the various techniques of elimination of nitric oxides. A critical
review of such equipment is timely, in particular from the viewpoint of the
weaknesses and needs of the current data base in designing effective equipment.
The resolution of these two major areas of concern will help the waste
incineration industry enter a predicted phase of rapid growth with the proper
knowledge base for the design of safe and efficient equipment.
