The department of Computer and Information Science at the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst will continue to develop the infrastructure created
with their prior CER award, with the emphasis on supporting their research real-
time computing. This research will be concentrated in the following areas: real-
time communication, real-time distributed operating systems, real-time
artificial intelligence, cooperative/distributed problem solving, robotic
manipulation and geometric reasoning computer vision and robot navigation, and
special-purpose architectures. The groups involved in the various research areas
will have a rich interaction, so that the software developed by the systems
group will be used in the AI, robotics and vision application areas, and these
areas will in turn give valuable feedback to the systems group. Equipment to be
purchased in support of the research includes upgrades to current workstations,
an upgrade for the Sequent Symmetry multiprocessor, as well as specialized
equipment for robotics and vision.
