NCR-9520963 Kenneth Young Bellcore, Tektronix, the Joint Interoperability Test
Command (JITC), and the University of Pennsylvania will implement an ATM
Interoperability Testbed to develop tools, procedures, and standards that
promote interoperability among ATM products. The project will include three key
areas of ATM technology for the development of interoperability testing systems.
These areas are 1) ATM signaling Interoperability, 2) ATM traffic management
interoperability, and 3) higher-layer protocol interoperability. These areas are
chosen because standards for signaling, traffic management and higher layer
protocols (e.g. Internet Protocol- IP) as they related to ATM are maturing
rapidly and will be implemented in products in a time frame that is consistent
with this project's research and development.
