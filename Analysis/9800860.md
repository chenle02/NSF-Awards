Proposal: DMS-9800860 Principal Investigator: Senya Shlosman Abstract: Shlosman
will study the behavior of a system subject to stochastic dynamics in the
situation where the initial state of the system is far from equilibrium. The
typical example is the Glauber dynamics of the model of statistical mechanics,
which model is taken with parameters close to (but different from) those of the
phase transition region. For a long time the system behaves as if it were in the
"wrong" equilibrium, until it finally undergoes the transition to the "true"
(and unique) one. The (non-equilibrium!) states of the model before transition
are what should be considered the metastable states of the system. Shlosman
shows that such family of states is a smooth continuation of the curve of
equilibrium phases through the critical point. The transition happens because of
the creation and growth of "droplets" of the equilibrium phase inside the non-
equilibrium phase. The PI will study the lifetime of these metastable states. It
is possible to write an explicit expression describing it. The formula is quite
interesting and contains, in particular, a term corresponding to the surface
energy of the Wulff droplet. The explanation is that the shape of the critical
droplet is given by the Wulff construction. This settles a controversy on the
subject that has existed in the literature. The subject of this research project
is the rigorous study of the phenomenon of metastability. A good example of the
metastable state of matter is supercooled water (i.e., water cooled below its
freezing temperature, yet remaining liquid). This state of water can indeed be
observed in nature. The characteristic feature of supercooled water is that it
cannot stay liquid for a very long time: after a while, it suddenly freezes. The
concept of metastable state is well known in physics, where it plays an
important role. What has hitherto been lacking is the rigorous understanding of
this phenomenon on the level of microscopic statistical mechan ics. As one
famous scientist put it, "The concepts of the metastable state and of fractional
dimension are useful, provided they are not taken too seriously." Shlosman's
research is aimed precisely at providing the tools to understand metastability
one hundred percent "seriously." To this end, the concept of a "critical
droplet" (which is a microscopic piece of ice in the case of water) is
developed. Shlosman will study the process through which such a droplet is
created and examine the process of growth of this droplet, until it eventually
absorbs the whole sample (by coalescing with other growing droplets). The
overall theory looks quite complete and satisfactory.
