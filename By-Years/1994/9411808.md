9411808 Sork Young secondary forests are becoming increasingly common and
important throughout the tropics as primary forests are cleared and unproductive
fields and pastures are abondoned. However, the dynamics of tree regeneration in
secondary forests have received very little research. This study examines the
ecology of tree seedling establishment in ten-year old secondary forest in
Amazonian Peru. The objectives are to: 1) examine intra- and interspecific
patterns of growth and survivorship of protected seedlings, 2) measure impact of
exposure to physical damage from herbivores and litter fall on seedling
performance, and 3) evaluate whether morphological traits of seeds and seedlings
are predictive of performance. This research will greatly improve our
understanding of the processes of secondary forest regeneration. The results of
this study will have application in the conservation and restoration of tropical
forest ecosystems.
