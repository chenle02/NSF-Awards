The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a quadrupole mass spectrometer capable
of CI ionization, and GC, LC, DCI and solid probe sample manipulation. This
instrument is used in the analytical, organic, and physical chemistry
laboratories and their associated courses. With a DCI source, students identify
and quantify a variety of solid, liquid, and gaseous molecular samples not
otherwise possible. As a result, students acquire a better understanding of
molecular structure and bonding as well as learn up-to-date qualitative and
quantitative analytical techniques required to enter their respective scientific
fields.
