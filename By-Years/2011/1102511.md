This award provides funds to operate the National Superconducting Cyclotron
Laboratory (NSCL) at Michigan State University (MSU) as a national user
facility, to support NSCL faculty and staff research in nuclear physics, nuclear
chemistry, nuclear astrophysics, accelerator physics and instrumentation
development, and to continue serving as a national user facility dedicated to
the training of the next generation of scientists and diverse workforce in these
disciplines. The award will allow the NSCL to continue its nationally and
internationally prominent leadership role in these areas by operating as the
nation's premier user facility dedicated to the production and study of rare
(short-lived) isotopes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of new
instrumentation along with new techniques and new beam capabilities form a
potent combination allowing extraordinary discovery potential to be realized.
The proposed physics program builds upon these strengths while creating new
assets that will sustain and enhance NSCL's scientific standing. MSU was
recently selected by the Department of Energy (DOE) for the next generation
national Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB). These opportunities have strong
overlap with the stated scientific goals of the 2007 NSAC Long Range Plan, and
form a coherent trajectory towards the implementation of FRIB.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSCL is a university-based national user facility
serving a user community of more than 700 registered users from the U.S. and
abroad. The NSCL plays a prominent role in the education of the next generation
of scientists through a close synergy of classroom education and hands-on
laboratory research throughout the entire graduate career. Approximately 60
graduate students at the NSCL have research assistantships that support their
thesis research. Further, NSCL faculty and staff are strongly engaged in cross-
disciplinary research, K-12 and undergraduate education, and science outreach to
the general public.
