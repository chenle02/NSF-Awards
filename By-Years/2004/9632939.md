This award is to support the Allerton Conference/Institute on the uses of
digital libraries. The study of how the new resources, tools and services that
fall under the rubric of digital libraries are in fact being used is critical to
help assure that digital libraries are suitable for the tasks they are meant to
support. The objectives for this conference are to increase understanding of
digital library needs and uses, to improve participants skills in the conduct of
formative and summative digital library evaluations, to share results of digital
library use and usability studies, and to provide an opportunity for digital
library researchers to meet and lay the foundations for future interactions.
These objectives will be met by convening an interdisciplinary group of experts
in information system design and evaluation with others currently involved in a
wide range of digital library projects. A specific aim is to connect the current
Digital Library Initiative projects with similar work conducted around the
world. The participants will present and discuss results of their digital
library use studies, hold small group working sessions, and demonstrate new user
interfaces and online data collection techniques, and conduct roundtable
discussions of key research issues.
