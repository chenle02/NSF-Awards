This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to produce
transgenic citrus and rice plants carrying novel gene fusions for the purpose of
controlling citrus canker and rice blight disease. The fusions consist mainly of
peptide aptamers and single chain variable region fragments from monoclonal
antibodies (SCFVs) that bind to and interfere with bacterial pathogenicity (Pth)
proteins that must be injected by the pathogens into host cells to cause
disease. Fusions will be selected that show improved binding at physiologically
appropriate pH and temperature ranges by BIAcore analyses. Binding affinities of
aptamer SCFV fusions over a range of pH and temperatures will be
determined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Phase II project will lead to a new, cost-
effective genetic method to control a variety of important plant diseases caused
by bacterial plant pathogens. Commercial potential would be to the agricultural
and forest industries.&lt;br/&gt;
