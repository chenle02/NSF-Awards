Farvardin The basic idea of this research is to develop a class of suboptimal
vector quantizers in which the codebook is derived, in a simple manner, from
another highly structured codebook, therefore, eliminating the need to store the
codebook and hence allowing the design of very large codebooks. For memoryless
sources, the codebook of the Structured Vector Quantization (SVQ) is selected as
a well-defined subset of the Cartesian product of the codebook of a specific
entropy-coded scalar quantizer. Since the SVQ codebook is a part of a highly
structured codebook, the memory requirements, the complexity, and the needed
training data are reduced significantly, hence, allowing the possibility of
designing SVQs with large codebooks. The research plan entails the design,
analysis and simulation of SVQs, along with a meaningful comparison of their
merits with respect to other known quantization schemes. Based on the results of
this research, the application and performance of SVQs in more practical
situations representative of real-world problems will be studied.
