This award in the Division of Chemistry supports research by Professor Seth N.
Brown at the University of Notre Dame to explore the activation of monometallic
centers by nonclassical oxygenation reactions. The main strategy is based on
using redox-active ligands that use small bite angles to encourage higher
coordination numbers on complexes of molybdenum and tungsten. Ligands will
include both known (catecholate, bis(iminophenoxide), amidobis(phenoxide)) and
novel (hexadentate tris- (iminophenoxide), bis(hydroxyphenyl)triazole) designs.
Interactions of molecular oxygen with complexes of the reduced ligands, as well
as possible molecular oxygen generation from dioxo complexes of the oxidized
ligands, will be studied mechanistically. The ability of the ligand-oxidized oxo
complexes to deliver oxygen to substrates will also be analyzed to determine the
geometric and electronic factors that encourage this reaction. Possible
catalytic reactions that combine molecular oxygen activation with atom transfer
to organic substrates, such as oxidative cleavage of alkenes (i.e., ozonolysis
using molecular oxygen), will be explored. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
explores ways to synthesize oxygen-containing organic molecules more
efficiently. Activating molecular oxygen is a prime target for catalysis, with
impacts in green chemical synthesis and renewable energy storage. It is a
difficult target because the intermediate oxidation states of dioxygen (such as
peroxide) are high in energy, placing an intrinsic roadblock on efficient
reactions. The research will provide broad training of postdoctoral, graduate,
and undergraduate students. Undergraduates (including members of
underrepresented groups) will be recruited and encouraged to pursue research
throughout their undergraduate careers. Graduate students and especially
postdoctoral scholars will be encouraged to mentor undergraduates in
collaboration with the PI in order to assist in their training and provide them
with motivation to pursue careers in teaching and research.
