&lt;br/&gt;PI: Raber Institution: National Academy of
Sciences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award, funded jointly by the Divisions of
Chemistry and Chemical and Transport Systems, renews support to the National
Academy of Sciences for the Chemical Sciences Roundtable (CSR). The Roundtable
consists of 30-35 chemical scientists and engineers from academia, industry,
private organizations, federal agencies and laboratories. The CSR will address
by regular meetings and workshops crosscutting issues in the chemical sciences.
It will discuss and explore research, education, and economic issues important
to the chemical community. The overall purpose is to foster progress and
strengthen the infra structure for U.S. chemical science and technology by
bringing together a broad representative group from many sectors. It will
disseminate its deliberations via publications. The charter of CSR prohibits it
from making formal recommendations to any government funding or regulatory body.
Its structure allows for open and uninhibited commentary on important topics
that will stimulate further studies and initiatives as appropriate. Workshops
are under consideration during the grant award on topics with a chemical
orientation such as globalization, water and sustainable development, education,
academic entrepreneurship, security, law and communicating chemical issues to
the public.&lt;br/&gt;
