The ion-milling machine, with accessories and ancillary apparatus will be used
for the preparation of thin foil specimens suitable for examination by
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), such as precipitation strengthened ZnS,
various refractory metal silicides and glassy materials containing microscopic
pores, as well as proton irradiated intermetallic compounds to be examined in
cross-section. The proposed apparatus will also enable the routine examination
of the microstructures of deformed ceramic materials, metal and ceramic matrix
composites and metallic alloys that are sometimes inadvertently coated with an
oxide layer after conventional electropolishing. More exotic cross-sectional TEM
specimen preparation of electronic device materials prepared by MBE, and oxide
substrates on which small metal clusters have been deposited, is expected to
become a possibility as a consequence of the acquisition of the proposed
apparatus.
