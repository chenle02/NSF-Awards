Brayton Gray plans to study the unstable development of periodic families in
the homotopy groups of spheres through the use of higher order periodic EHP
spectral sequences. Basically, this is an investigation of one of the principal
algebraic tools of topology, namely homotopy theory, which seeks to make it more
manageable by discovering repeating patterns.
