9361987 Caughey We propose the design, construction and evaluation of a 3-12 um
narrowband light source based on an optical parametric oscillator/optical
parametric amplifier pair (OPO/OPA), consisting of ZnGeP, crystals that are
pumped by a tunable Kl P OPO. The tunable KTP OPO, which is itself pumped by a
Nd:YAG laser, provides a novel method not only for pumping the ZnGeP2 OPO, but
for providing an additional option for tuning and for characterizing it. Means
for narrowing the limewidth of the ZnGeP2 OPO will be evaluated. Since
femtosecond and picosecond Nd:YAG lasers are available. the proposed system can
lead to an ultrafast tunable IR source. The proposed Phase I program is expected
to provide the technical base for the manufacture of a long sought 3- 12 um
tunable laser source. ***
