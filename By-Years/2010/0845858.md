"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
2009(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Internet was designed to
operate in a trusted and closely knitted academic environment. Today, as the
Internet has embraced more than a billion users worldwide, its old design faces
significant security and economics challenges. First, it is extremely vulnerable
to security attacks such as Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and prefix hijacking
attacks. Second, the Internet suffers from the ``tussle of economics,'' in which
different participants with competing interests strive to favor their own
interests. One aspect of the tussle, the tussle between users and ISPs, has
manifested itself in the recent net neutrality debates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
goal of this project is to design, implement, and evaluate a clean-slate network
architecture (SureNet) that is resilient to network-layer security attacks and
provides control mechanisms for different network participants to express their
economic interests. A main design principle behind SureNet is to make identify
and trust a first-class network object. A strong notion of identity makes a
source (or a network) accountable for its actions, which in turn enables a
variety of security and resource management schemes that together make a network
trustworthy and a fair playground for participants with conflicting interests.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This project will explore a practical and
decentralized approach to establish strong host and network identity, develop
mechanisms to isolate and punish misbehaving nodes, and design advanced resource
allocation and pricing schemes that enable a network to allocate its resources
to users that value them the most. It will foster inter-disciplinary
collaboration between computer science and economics, and train both networking
and multi-disciplinary graduate students.
