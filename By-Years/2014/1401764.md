Diophantine geometry is the study of integer solutions of polynomial equations,
seen through the prism of the geometry of their solutions over the complex
numbers. Structural characteristics of the integer solutions are sometimes
governed by subtle geometric phenomena. We rely on results on the geometry of
complex surfaces, especially those defined by equations of small degree.
Examples include equations of degree three or four in three variables. Our hope
is to discern larger patterns governing the behavior of large classes of
problems sharing common characteristics.

This project addresses problems at the interface of algebraic and Diophantine
geometry arising from fundamental questions about the behavior of rational
points on algebraic varieties. In the simplest situations, these touch on
beautiful constructions from classical algebraic geometry. Beyond these, one
quickly encounters deep geometric problems not accessible through classical
techniques. Specific research questions will include: How to interpret moduli
spaces of K3 surfaces with level structure geometrically? To what extent can
these be organized using notions of derived equivalence for K3 surfaces and
their twisted analogs? Can these techniques be used to evaluate Brauer-Manin
obstructions explicitly? Given two derived-equivalent K3 surfaces, how are their
Diophantine properties related, especially over local fields? For del Pezzo
fibrations over curves, how are spaces of rational curves governed by
cohomological invariants? As the numerical invariants of the fibrations vary,
what inductive structures are shown by the spaces of rational curves? These will
be addressed using deformation-theoretic properties of rational curves,
structural descriptions of cones of effective curves arising from Bridgeland
stability conditions, and classifications of degenerate fibers of K3 fibrations.
