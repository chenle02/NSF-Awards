ABSTRACT 97-26860 Loucks W/WS: Development and implementation of decision
support systems of predicting economic and ecologic impacts of alternative land
and water management policies in urbanizing regions. Community planning and
environmental assessment boards must frequently evaluate proposed changes in
current land and/or water use. The aim of this research is to provide planning
and environmental boards with an appropriate interactive PC computer-based
technology for predicting the economic and ecologic impacts of decisions they
may make regarding alternative water and land use policies. This research will
identify and quantify how various temporal and spatial patterns of surface and
ground water flows and pollutant concentrations effect land and water
ecosystems. The investigators will also predict how different land and water
management policies and related socioeconomic activities influence local
economic development and tax revenues. This research is a multidisciplinary
effort. The research team consists of an ecologist, a regional economist; and
three agricultural-environmental and systems engineers. A prototype of the
technology will be ready for evaluation by potential users at the conclusion of
the project.
