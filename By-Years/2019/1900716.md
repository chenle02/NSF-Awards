Molecular programming is an emerging nanotechnology that uses the information-
processing capabilities of DNA and other biomolecules to create and control very
small devices. Scientists in this area are developing more complex and
sophisticated devices every year. Molecular programming will soon move beyond
basic science to promising real-world applications ranging from targeted drug-
delivery in humans to smart materials that are compatible with living tissue.
This project is developing new methods for designing dependability into systems
of molecular programs and reasoning about their behavior. This research will
make molecular programming more productive, dependable, and safe. The
investigators are training a diverse and successful group of researchers and
educators in molecular programming, and the project will develop methods for
constructing assurance cases that future applications will need in order to be
certified for real-world use. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The design and verification
of molecular programs face three major challenges. These are the complexity and
randomness of the programs themselves, the complexity and randomness of the
environments in which they will operate, and the safety-critical nature of many
of their envisioned applications. This project is addressing these challenges by
building complex molecular programs as systems of simpler molecular programs
that use biochemical signals to communicate with one another and by adapting
dependability methods from software engineering to the design and verification
of these systems. Most of the project's fundamental science lies in this
adaption to a chemical world that is far more capricious than the highly
engineered silicon platforms on which traditional software
operates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
