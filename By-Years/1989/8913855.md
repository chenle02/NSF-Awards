The magnetic flux in high Tc superconducting films will be studied through the
use of a novel type of bilayer film. They will deposit a layer of magnetic
bubble material on a high quality high Tc thin film. They will then use an
electron microscope to image the magnetic domains in real time and use these
pictures to draw conclusions about the magnetic flux penetrating the
superconducting film.
