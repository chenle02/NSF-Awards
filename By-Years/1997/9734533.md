The interferometric strain/slope rosette (ISSR) is further developed to include
greater capabilities of measuring multiple strains in isotropic and anisotropic
materials. The method is being developed as a quasi-nondestructive method of
evaluating residual stresses. ISSR indentations are also used to record
permanent deformations incurred from manufacturing processes, which offers
industries a quality control tool to avoid failures due to excessive residual
stresses. Fatigue and fracture behavior of materials is investigated through an
integrated experimental-theoretical numerical approach. A new diffraction strain
gage/rosette technique is also developed to allow measurements in soft
materials. Applications include bioengineering materials such as tissues, and
thin-thickness polymer materials.
