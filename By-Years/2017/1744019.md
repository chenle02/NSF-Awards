The emergence of big data has been transformational in many areas in science and
engineering - biology, health sciences, material science, physics, and so on. At
the heart of this transformation is statistical machine learning, a subfield of
computer science that aims at studying and developing algorithms that can
analyze large volumes of data. The goal of this international workshop is to
bring together researchers, both from USA and Armenia, who work on machine
learning (ML) and other scientific disciplines that are poised to benefit from
the recent advances in ML. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will include
participation from leading experts in a number of disciplines. In machine
learning, the workshop will cover topics such as deep learning, tensor methods,
unsupervised learning with high dimensional data, and so on. In computational
social sciences, the topics will include social network analysis, behavioral
modeling, modeling of socio-technical systems. And in computational biology, the
topics will cover gene expression analysis, computational neuroscience,
predictive diagnostics. The workshop will serve as a bridge to get these
communities talking to one another and explore collaborative research. The
workshop will provide a forum for the participating researchers to formulate a
research agenda that will help to utilize recent advances in ML in data-
intensive disciplines. Second, the workshop will support participation of senior
graduate students and early career scientists. Finally, the workshop will
promote scientific cooperation between the American and Armenian
researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is cofunded by the Office of
International Science and Engineering.
