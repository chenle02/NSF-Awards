In this project, the P.I.'s will continue development and application of
intermediate models of the gyre-scale ocean circulation based on the balance
equations (BE). BE contains more dynamics than the quasi-geostrophic (QG)
models, but requires substantially less computer capacity than the primitive
equation (PE) models. Wind and thermal forcing are both included. Successful
adiabatic models will be extended to include diabatic effects of buoyancy and
wind forcing, and related sub-grid-scale mixing algorithms.
