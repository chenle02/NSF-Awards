The PI proposes to apply methods from the theory of mixed Hodge modules to the
study of Hodge classes and normal functions, in order to solve several problems
about singularities of normal functions and the locus of Hodge classes. The main
idea is the construction of natural complex-analytic extension spaces, which
make it possible to apply differential-geometric and topological methods to the
above problems, and which can also be used to define numerical invariants. To
date, the PI has successfully carried out one portion of this, namely the
construction of complex-analytic Neron models. He proposes to use his results to
describe graph closures of admissible normal functions, to carry out a local
study of singularities, and to obtain a classification theorem. The PI also
proposes to introduce Poincare bundles of Neron models, both to define numerical
invariants for pairs of normal functions and to make progress on the question of
the existence of singularities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work is
connected with the program of M. Green and P. Griffiths, and bears on the Hodge
conjecture. The general philosophy is to understand the geometry of a complex
algebraic variety with the help of differential geometry and topology. The
proposed methods can be used, for instance, to study Noether-Lefschetz loci on
Calabi-Yau threefolds; this example is interesting because we have very
intriguing numerical predictions made by physicists for these loci.
