9451860 King The goals of this project are: To demonstrate the applicability of
expert systems to engineering education; and to improve the efficiency of the
electrical engineering laboratory instruction. Use of an expert system enables
the students to conduct more of their own troubleshooting. Students do not have
to wait for assistance. They are able to query the expert system and receive
guidance as the need arises, even during non-laboratory hours. The result is an
increased opportunity for student/faculty discussions of more advanced concepts
and methods of system design and development. Usually, the laboratory instructor
spends most of the laboratory period with just one or two of the lab groups
assisting them with troubleshooting tasks. The expert system allows the
professor to service more of the students during the lab period because it copes
with the routine tasks. The expert system continues to "learn" symptoms and
solutions, always providing complete "recall" of troubleshooting suggestions,
even for new faculty and laboratory teaching assistants who teach the course for
the first time. Innovative use is made of computers and an expert system to
assist electrical and computer engineering faculty by providing certain of the
routine functions encountered in the microprocessor-based systems design
laboratory. This application of expert systems to engineering education will be
carefully evaluated to confirm its value as a "teaching assistant".
