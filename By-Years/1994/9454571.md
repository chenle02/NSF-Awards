Harrison 9454571 The Advanced Integrated Manufacturing Center a joint effort
between Sinclair Community College and the University of Dayton submits this
proposal to create a National Center of Excellence for Advanced Manufacturing
Education (NCE/AME). Headquartered at the Advanced Integrated Manufacturing
Center on the campus of Sinclair Community College, the goal of the NCE/AME is
to redesign the infrastructure of technological education. The NCE/AME will be a
catalyst for educational change to improve science, mathematics, and advanced
manufacturing instruction at the high school, community college, and university
levels. The program will accomplish the following objectives: 1. Develop a new
competency-based, occupationally verified, seamless curriculum beginning in
grade 11, through the Associate of Applied Science degree, culminating with the
Bachelor of Science degree using advanced manufacturing as the focus; with
gateways to and from industrial employment throughout. 2. Write, pilot test, and
publish curriculum materials (laboratory manuals, video, software, and other
ancillary materials) to improve mathematics, science, and manufacturing
engineering technology instruction. 3. Disseminate the curriculum, curriculum
materials, and model program nationally.
