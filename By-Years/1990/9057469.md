This research by a Presidential Young Investigator is focused on experiments in
wakes and mixing regions. These are characterized by the absence of boundaries
but have shear generated from upstream boundaries. Specific topics to be
investigated are: the effect of bubbles in a free shear flow, the effect of
initial conditions on cylinder wakes, and study of forcing in a free shear layer
to create either organized three-dimensional structures or chaos.
