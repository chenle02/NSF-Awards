9614401 Dueker This research involves the formation of images of the mantle
discontinuity structure beneath two important geologic transects: one across the
Tibetan Plateau and the other across the Cascadia subduction zone. This is done
by means of common mid-point stacks of source-normalized radial P-wave arrivals,
i.e. receiver functions. Previous work with the 1993 Snake river Plain and 1992
Rocky Mountain Front PASSCAL arrays shows that this technique of common mid-
point stacking can significantly improve the isolation of direct converted P to
S arrivals from mantle discontinuities with respect to single station stacks.
The mantle structures under the Tibetan Plateau and Cascadia subduction zones
are important to interpretation of the present day crustal forces and their
evolutionary histories in these seismically active areas. This research is a
component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
