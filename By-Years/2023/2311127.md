In recent years, machine learning has achieved remarkable success in various
benchmark tasks, including image classification, question answering, and speech
recognition. However, these models tend to exhibit reduced performance when
applied to test data that differs from the data they were trained on. This
scenario, also known as distribution shift, is a common issue in fields such as
healthcare, criminal justice, and robotics. For example, a classification model
trained on medical images from one hospital may not perform well on images
collected from another hospital due to differences in medical equipment,
scanning protocols, and subject populations. This project aims to address the
challenges of distribution shift in learning from data by developing principled
methods and theories. Additionally, it seeks to train the next generation of
data scientists who can handle learning under distribution shifts.

The project will focus on three important problems involving distribution
shifts: nonparametric regression under covariate shifts, off-policy evaluation,
and offline reinforcement learning. To advance our understanding of these
challenging problems, the project will (1) investigate more appropriate
assumptions on distribution shifts that allow for efficient knowledge transfer
between different distributions while also being practical; (2) characterize the
information-theoretic limitations of learning under distribution shifts,
determining when learning is possible and when it is not; and (3) develop
efficient and adaptive learning methods with optimal finite-sample guarantees
that adjust to the unknown amount of distribution shift. Throughout this
project, new tools will be developed in high-dimensional statistics, information
theory, and sequential decision making, and numerous opportunities will be
provided to enhance interdisciplinary graduate and undergraduate research
training.
