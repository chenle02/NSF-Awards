9509117 Bronzino The primary hypothesis to be investigated is that, during
normal development, the maturation of peak hippocampal theta frequency is
related primarily to changes in the modulation of dentate granule cell activity,
and not due to alterations in cellular excitability of CA1 pyramidal cells.
Another hypothesis to be tested is that the biocoherence index is an effective
measure of the changing interrelationships that occur between CA1 and the
dentate gyrus during development of hippocampal activity. In previous research
surgical and recording techniques were developed that allow a quantitative
examination of the development of inhibitory/facilitatory modulation of the
dentate granule cell population. Modeling techniques will be used to
characterize the development of the rat hippocampal EEG during the early
postnatal (15-22 days) period of development. The studies are expected to
provide new knowledge on the interactions that occur between hippocampal neural
systems responsible for the generation of hippocampal EEG patters as the animal
iteracts with its environment during the early postnatal period of development.
The results will provide new approaches to probe questions related to the
maturation of neural circuits and developmental patterns of the EEG in behaving
animals. The project provides a high quality research experience to
undergraduate students through their active participation in surgery and
recording techniques and to the development of quantitative and computational
techniques applied to problems in biology. ***
