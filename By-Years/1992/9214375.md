This award will provide one-half the funding needed for the acquisition of a
high sensitivity noble gas mass spectrometer to be installed and operated in the
Geophysical Institute at the University of Alaska-Fairbanks. The University is
committed to providing the remaining funds necessary. The mass spectrometer will
be used primarily in the application of the argon-40/argon-39 isotopic method of
dating rocks and minerals in a variety of research projects including the timing
of ore-mineralization, dating of Alaskan Quaternary volcanic sequences, the
study of very old continental crust evolution, and the study of the retention of
argon in minerals.
