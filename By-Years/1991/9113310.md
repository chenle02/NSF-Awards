A graduate and an undergraduate student (both minorities) will work with a
chemist at Clark Atlanta University in conducting comprehensive research to
prepare and study the physical and mechanical properties of films and fibers.
This will be achieved by preparing polymers which are chemical precursors to
poly (p-phenylene-2, 6- benzobisoxazole) (PBO) and poly (p-phenylene
benzobisthiazole) (PBT) which are normally very intractable and difficult to
process. The precursors will be designed to have higher solubility and lower
melting points by decreasing the symmetry and preventing hydrogen bonding. Once
processed into films or fibers the precursor polymers will be converted to PBO
and PBT by high yield chemical transformations. The precursor polymers and
polymers will be characterized by techniques including infrared microscopy and
spectroscopy, and 1H, 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, light
scattering photometry, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric
analysis, polarizing optical microscopy, gel permeation chromatography,
solubility, viscometry and x- ray diffraction. Physical testing, such as,
tensile strength measurements will be performed on films and fibers made from
the precursors and polymers, before and after transformation to PBT and PBO.
