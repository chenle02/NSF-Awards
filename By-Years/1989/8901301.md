8901301 Cannon Free boundary and inverse problems arise in the modelling of many
physically important phenomena. One example of the former is to determine the
location of the water/ice interface in a region where the temperature on the
boundary of the region is specified so as to be subcritical in some locations
and supercritical in others. Inverse problems arise, for instance, in the
attempt to locate the heat source inside an object by measuring the temperature
and heat flux at the surface. Free boundary and inverse problems of this type
are included in the study of a certain class of partial differential equations
whose coefficients may depend on functionals of the solution. This project
examines questions of existence and unicity of solutions and seeks to provide a
better understanding of this class of differential equations.
