This award is to support US scientists' participation in a joint US-Taiwan
seminar on rehabilitation of public works to be held in Taiwan January 1988.
This seminar will be held under the auspices of the cooperative science program
between the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) and the Coordination Council for
North American Affairs (CCNAA). The rehabilitation of public works addresses
problems related to capacity and safety of large engineering systems such as
roads and bridges. Because public safety and essential services are involved,
the fundamental understanding required for developing practical engineering
approaches to development and maintenance of public systems is of critical
importance. Taiwan has pursued an aggressive industrialization and construction
program in recent years and has developed considerable laboratory and field
experience in several areas of structural technology. US scientists, working
with their colleagues from Taiwan, will share experiences and data related to
specific engineering concerns, and will explore areas of common interest and
concern which could be developed into joint research projects.
