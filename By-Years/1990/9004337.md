This project is concerned with mineralized porphyry systems and mafic intrusions
with particular emphasis on identifying "magmatic" fluids, fluid inclusions in
high-grade metamorphic rocks, and fluid inclusions from ultramafic nodules, and
2) to study samples that have already been mapped and neutron- irradiated from
Valles, New Mexico (dilute modern geothermal system). Hansonburg, New Mexico
(Mississippi Valley-type Pb-Zn deposit), and Juneau, Alaska (gold-bearing quartz
veins). The funds will be used primarily for support of a post doc.
