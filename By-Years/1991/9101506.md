This continuing research program includes six topics: 1) a 20-year perspective
of several scales of disturbance on three species of kelp that will be continued
with long term demographic studies in five areas; 2) thinning experiments
searching for thresholds necessary for understory persistence in different
regions; 3) evaluation of intra- and interspecific density effect on kelp
growth, reproduction, recruitment, and survivorship; 4) an experimental
evaluation of fundamental vs. realized niches of kelps in the presence of a
strong competitive dominant, and 5) the effects of long shore and cross shore
gradients, especially light and temperature with regard to succession theory.
The investigators are also (6) using outplants to evaluate some adaptive tactics
of four species of relatively rare kelps that have very different life
histories. For most of the experiments they will use triplicated clearings at
each of four depths and modules with different densities of sporophytes to
evaluate regional and density thresholds on growth, time and intensity of
reproduction, recruitment, and survivorship.
