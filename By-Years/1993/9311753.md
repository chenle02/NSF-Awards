This research will develop a hypertext maintenance document for the overhaul of
a complex unit of balancing equipment. This type of equipment is central to the
manufacture of many different products. This internship will also help build a
closer relationship between the principal investigator and the industrial
research partner. When complex and/or foreign-made equipment breaks down, a
company is frequently faced with an expensive and time-consuming maintenance
problem. One way to reduce the downtime and to insure uniformity of maintenance
procedures is to develop a computerized maintenance document giving step by step
diagnostic procedures. This will be the first application of hypertext to a
maintenance document.
