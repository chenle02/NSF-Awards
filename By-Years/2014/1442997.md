Next-generation Geoscience needs to handle rapidly growing data volumes from
ground-based and space-based sensor networks. As real-world phenomena are mapped
to data, the scientific discovery process essentially becomes a search process
across multidimensional data sets. The extraction of meaningful discoveries from
this sea of data therefore requires highly efficient and scalable machine
assistance to enhance human contextual understanding. This is necessary both for
testing new hypotheses as well as for the detection of novel events and
monitoring for natural hazards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops a
computer-aided discovery approach that provides scientists with better support
to answer questions such as: What inferences can be drawn from an identified
feature? What does a finding mean and how does it fit into the big theoretical
picture? Does it contradict or confirm previously established models and
findings? How can concepts and ideas be tested effectively? To achieve this,
scientists can programmatically express hypothesized Geoscience scenarios,
constraints, and model variations. This approach helps delegate the automatic
exploration of the combinatorial search space of possible explanations in
parallel on a variety of data sets. Furthermore, programmable crawlers can scale
the search and discovery of interesting phenomena on cloud-based
infrastructures. The computer-aided discovery prototype is evaluated in case
studies from Geospace science, including the exploration of structures in space
and time using combined GPS, optics, and Geospace radar data.
