NER: Airborne Nanoparticle Detector Based on a Microplasma Particle
Trap&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;This exploratory research focuses
on measuring the sizes and concentrations of airborne nanoparticles.
Nanoparticles are difficult to quickly measure due to extremely small size. As
nanotechnology becomes a reality, however, the accurate and rapid sensing of
nanoparticles becomes an important part of many manufacturing processes.
Controlling the density and size distribution of nanoparticles is not only key
for reliable manufacturing, but also critical to the health and safety of the
workforce. The proposed sensor consists to two components: a nanoparticle trap
and a nanoparticle detector. The trap uses a small region of ionized gas (i.e.,
a microplasma) to negatively charge the nanoparticle. Once the particle is
charged, it is trapped by the voltage gradient within the microplasma. Next, the
accumulated nanoparticles are detected by using a voltage pulse to empty
particles from the trap. The charged particles are collected by an electrode
that senses both the accumulated charge on each particle and its time-of-flight
between the microplasma and the sensing electrode. These data allow the density
and size of the particles to be determined. Part of the research will
concentrate on the basic physics of trapping nanoparticles by examining the
multitude of forces exerted on the particles. The expulsion of nanoparticles
from the trap will also be examined using dynamic models and experiments. The
research will not only demonstrate a fast, low-cost sensor for nanoparticles in
the environment, but also provide basic data for nanoparticle behavior in gas
streams and plasmas. By including a graduate student and an undergraduate
student in this program, the nanotechnology workforce infrastructure will also
benefit.&lt;br/&gt;
