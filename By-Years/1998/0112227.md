This project, submitted under the Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER)
program, will examine the impact of legal structures and institutions on federal
district court decision making. In particular, the investigator will examine
proceedings in Pedreira v. Kentucky Baptist Homes in the Western District Court
of Kentucky. This case presents the question of whether the use of religious
organizations to provide welfare services creates a constitutional violation
under the establishment clause. Using material gleaned from ongoing court
hearings and the parties' court filings, the investigator will test the impact
of the legal structures and institutional arrangements on the policies expressed
by the court. This research will advance the understanding of the influence of
legal institutions on judicial decision making. This is especially pertinent at
the district court level given the variance in institutional structures found
across districts.
