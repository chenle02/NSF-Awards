We propose to organize a workshop at the upcoming Conference on Decision and
Control (CDC) to bring together academic, industry, and government researchers
to explore cross-disciplinary research and interaction with industry. The
purpose of the workshop is to discuss successful mechanisms for integrating
academic research in control with industry applications and, in particular,
cross-disciplinary teams. The workshop will involve 8-10 invited speakers and
will be open to all participants of the CDC.
