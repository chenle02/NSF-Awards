Many data sets can be represented via a natural hierarchical ordering, which can
be easily represented programmatically by using tree data structures. For
example, two-dimensional spatial data can be organized by using quad-trees,
while three-dimensional data can be organized by using oct-trees. As data
volumes continue to increase, compact representations of the extremely large
data become increasingly important since the representations can enable much
more efficient data selection, transportation, and processing. Yet the
development of standardized, generic and efficient tree data structures that
both scale to massive data and leverage the capabilities of modern computer
architectures remains an unmet need. This research effort addresses this need by
designing and implementing a library of generic implicit tree abstractions that
will provide the foundation for next generation analysis codes in data driven
sciences. By working with the C++ standardization committee, this research will
potentially impact millions of software developers, worldwide, since this low
level language is implicitly used by many high-level language analysis tools and
libraries.

This research will investigate generic and high performance tree building blocks
by exploring two key elements. First, low-level bit manipulation techniques will
be created that can be optimized for specific computer architectures (such as
the Intel Haswell). These techniques will be developed in conjunction with the
international C++ standardization committee as an open source library and will
impact a wide range of applications areas including arbitrary precision
arithmetic, cryptography, and tree indexing strategies. Second, a generic
library of implicit tree structures will be developed, by using the previously
developed bit manipulation techniques, and submitted as a new, open-source
library to the Boost community for broader dissemination. Finally, to
demonstrate the efficacy of these new software libraries, two example tree
applications will be developed and published: an oct-tree used for numerical
simulations and a decision trees used for machine learning.
