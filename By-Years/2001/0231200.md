In modern times, almost anything that uses electricity uses some form of
embedded computing. Examples include answering machines, GPS systems,
televisions, gas pumps, toys, stereos, refrigerators, automobiles, game boxes,
cellular phones, cash registers, and clocks. Not only is embedded computing
becoming more widespread, but the complexity of the computing is increasing.
Many of the products listed above process complex multimedia, including signal
acquisition, compression, and display, with a concurrent interface. A modern
embedded computing course is needed to teach engineers about the technologies
and designs that go into these kinds of devices. Computer vision topics have
historically been taught in graduate courses, since few examples were being
practiced in mainstream engineering. In recent years the incorporation of
multimedia into embedded devices has drawn some vision topics into mainstream
attention. This project develops an undergraduate course that incorporates
relevant vision theory into the larger context of embedded computing.
Traditional topics, such as processor types, dynamic power management, and real-
time scheduling, are taught alongside relevant vision topics, such as codecs,
concurrent interfaces, and multimedia signal acquisition, storage, and
rendering. At Clemson University we are developing ECE 468L Embedded Computing
along these lines. In lab work, the students program hardware to operate as a
digital video camera. This project develops the evolving course materials and
lab exercises into a prototype textbook, based upon student assessment and
evaluation.
