ECS-9725016 Michel This project seeks to sponsor engineering students an IEEE
Control Systems Society Meeting, the 1997 IEEE Conference on Decision and
Control (CDC'97). The goal is to develop an opportunity for students to be
informed about the most recent advances in Control Systems. Opportunities for
student attendance will be advertised nationwide and women, minorities and
disabled students will be especially encouraged to apply for sponsorship.
