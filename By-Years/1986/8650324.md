The goal of this project is to assemble and deploy the basic components of a
well-equipped vision laboratory, to support teaching and undergraduate research
in a broad range of visual processes. Major equipment items include a
radiometer/photometer, an optical bench and accessories which can be configured
as a two-channel Maxwellian view system, a grating monochrometer for studying
wavelength effects on vision, and a versatile system for testing contrast
sensitivity effects. Provision is made in the project for computer control of
experimental procedures and data acquisition. The equipment has been selected
primarily for laboratory projects and classroom demonstrations in a course on
Sensory Processes, and for pursuit of independent research and honors projects
by advanced students. In addition, the equipment will be used in such other
teaching contexts as Introductory Psychology, Neuroscience and Perception, and
the Psychology Department's program for Junior majors. Psychophysics is one of
the most easily communicated areas of experimental psychology, offering
startling perceptual phenomena, but it is rarely encountered in undergraduate
teaching programs. Thus this project, while basic in its scope, is expected to
have a substantial impact upon the curriculum.
