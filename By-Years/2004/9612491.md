For manufacturing industries to remain competitive, considerations such as the
ease of assembly, graspability, and ease of feeding must be taken into account
when products are designed. This grant provides an extended opportunity to
attack exciting new research topics that fall within the same general research
area as the original grant: combining sensors and actuators with few degrees of
freedom to grasp and orient parts. Remaining open problems related to the
parallel-jaw gripper include a fast algorithm for estimating 2 point frictional
grasps of a given polyhedral part and finding grasps that will permit the part
to be pivoted into the desired final pose under an active pivot servo. We will
also investigate how parts can be oriented and sorted as they move on a conveyor
belt against a passive sequence of fences and a method for systematically
feeding parts with controlled vibrations on a metal plate. Sony uses a variant
on this idea in their APOS system but they do not have a science base for
programming it. The aim of this new research is to develop such a science base.
