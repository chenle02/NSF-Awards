Proposal # DBI-BDI: 0345341 &lt;br/&gt;PI: Beaman &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yale University has been
awarded a grant in collaboration with the New York Botanical Garden and the
University of Illinois to create a system to image specimens in natural history
collections (plant specimens in this case), use Optical Character Recognition
(OCR), Natural Handwriting Recognition (NHR) and Natural Language Processing
(NLP) to read the labels on the specimens and parse the label data into its
component fields, then enter the data into a database. Modular, configurable,
open source web services will provide interoperability and scalability in
mirrored, distributed environments. This project will make the data capture of
natural history collections much more efficient and lower the associated time
and costs per specimen digitized.&lt;br/&gt;
