9600716 Eliseev This Americas Program award will support cooperative research
between Dr. Alexey V. Eliseev of the State University of NY, Buffalo, and Dr.
Anatoly Yatsimirski of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM). The
investigators intend to work on two approaches to the creation of new molecular
receptors and host-guest systems based on the search for potential molecular
hosts among compounds generated during chemical self-organization and natural
evolution, as opposed to the designed synthesis of these compounds. This joint
effort will involve the complementary skills of two research groups and the
shared use of facilities. The results of this collaboration may lead to finding
new examples of supramolecular systems and discovering new properties of
naturally occurring compounds. ***
