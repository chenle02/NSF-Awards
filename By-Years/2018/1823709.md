This project consists of a series of workshops for graduate students at the pre-
dissertation stage in problem-solving sociology. In line with research that
shows that many fundamental advances in basic science have resulted from the
pursuit of answers to specific, applied problems, problem-solving sociology is
an approach that argues that grappling with real-world problems can lead to
breakthroughs in the understanding of society. The workshops will guide the
students in the development of dissertation research proposals oriented toward
solving social problems. The project has the potential for influencing the field
of sociology by broadening the perspectives of scholars entering the
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From applicants from around the country, 36 students
will be invited to two-day workshops held at Northwestern University. The goal
of the workshops is to provide feedback on research design at a very early
stage, and to allow scholars to develop thematic networks and communities with
other researchers in their age cohort conducting similar research. The workshops
aim to help students avoid three traps common in scholarship that studies social
problems: the trap of simply describing or complaining about a problem, the trap
of studying only the victims of the problem rather than the process that is
causing the problem, and the trap of resting content with critiquing others'
proposed solutions without proposing solutions of one's own. The goal of each
workshop will be for each participant or group of participants to develop, by
the end of the second day, a short proposal for a research project to develop a
sociologically informed solution to the specific problem being
discussed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
