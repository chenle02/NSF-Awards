The Seminar on Stochastic Processes 2012 will take place on March 22-24, 2012 at
the University of Kansas. These seminars have been held annually since 1981, and
constitute the most important regular conference series for probabilists in the
US. Many of the participants work on such topics as Markov processes, Brownian
motion, superprocesses, stochastic analysis, or mathematical finance. The
primary goal is to provide a platform for the dissemination of the most recent
significant progress in research, and to encourage the interaction between
junior and established researchers. The program includes five one hour lectures
given by invited speakers and informal sessions emphasizing open problems of
current interest.
