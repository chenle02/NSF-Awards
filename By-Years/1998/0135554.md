Weidner&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0135554&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COMPRES, the Consortium for
Materials Property Research in the Earth Sciences, promotes research and
education in the area of Earth Science materials properties. The goal of this
research community is to improve our understanding of the Earth and other
planetary bodies by better understanding the materials that make up these bodies
at the conditions that are found within the bodies. Through a community-based
consortium approach, COMPRES aims to provide the broadest possible access to
advanced facilities for research on Earth materials. Broad access will be
achieved in part through educational initiatives and improved user support at
advanced, centralized research facilities. This program supports the
infrastructure for education and research including operational costs for
national facilities, development projects for the community research programs,
educational efforts for the community, and a central office. The mission of
COMPRES is focused within three themes: COMPRES Central, Community Facilities,
and Infrastructure Development Projects. COMPRES is governed by the community
through elected committees and officials. The consortium will enable a
community-wide approach to setting research and development priorities, and
identifying the most promising new areas of future technology and
research.&lt;br/&gt;
