This application has been submitted to upgrade the transmission electron
microscopy capabilities of the Department of Biological Sciences of the State
University of New York at Albany. In particular, this proposal requests funds
for the purchase of a new transmission electron microscope to serve as a
multiuser, departmental research instrument. As such, the new microscope will
serve primarily a core of active cell, developmental and neuro-biology
laboratories. A new ultramicrotome is also requested. This proposal details the
need and intended uses of the requested instrument.
