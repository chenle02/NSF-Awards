Nine years' observations of 33 sunlike stars offer tantalizing evidence that the
sun's potential for long-term brightness variability is significantly understate
by measurements of solar irradiance variations since 1978. These stellar
observations also show that changes in visual brightness and magnetic activity
are not simply correlated, as has been presumed in reconstructions of long-term
solar irradiance fluctuations from sunspot and other solar data. This project
will extend the observational time series for three years (that is, comparable
with one full "solar" cycle), providing a unique unbroken set of precision
photometric measurements at 472 nm and 551 nm. In close collaboration with the
separately funded HK program at Mount Wilson Observatory that monitors the
chromospheric (magnetic) activity of these stars, the PI will compare magnetic
and brightness variations of the sun and similar stars in an effort to
characterize long-term solar variability. Stellar and solar brightness
variations are clearly linked to chromospheric activity, but the relationship is
complex and requires further elucidation. The PI will establish the morphology
and statistics of long-term brightness variability with particular regard to the
question of poorly understood phenomena such as the solar "Maunder minimum." #
