This proposal, submitted by California State University, Hayward, and Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory, is to establish a program that will increase the
retention rate of underrepresented minority college students majoring in
physics. It will also increase the number of these same students who will
ultimately receive doctoral degrees in physics and thereby expand their numbers
in the workforce and professional physicists. This proposed program will achieve
the following goals: 1) Increase and retain underrepresented minority (Black,
Hispanic and Native American) students in physics through their B.S., M.S., and
Ph.D. degrees. 2) Increase number of underrepresented minority students exposed
to physics research at a national laboratory. 3) Provide scientists to serve as
role models with similar cultural backgrounds to mentor these students. 4)
Establish and formalize national organizations of underrepresented minority
students; e.g., Black, Hispanic, Native American.
