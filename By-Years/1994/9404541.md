9404541 Butler This award provides partial funding (67%) necessary to acquire a
cryogenic magnetometer and associated equipment to be installed and operated in
the Paleomagnetics Laboratory of the Department of Geosciences at the University
of Arizona. The institution is committed to providing the remaining funds needed
to acquire the equipment. The equipment will be used mainly by the Principal
Investigator, colleagues and students in research aimed at understanding the
relationship between the past record of the Earth's magnetic field as measured
in ancient rocks and the past migration of tectonic plates in which the rocks
are found. ***
