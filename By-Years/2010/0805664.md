This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2008.
The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for
the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation of underrepresented
minorities in biology through mentorship and outreach. The title of the research
and training plan for this fellowship to Glenn F. Dulla is "Host-symbiont
interactions between composting earthworms and bacteria: Do chemical signaling
and motility affect host colonization?" The host institution for this research
is the University of Washington and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. David Stahl.

The health of all biological systems is influenced by interactions between the
resident micro- and macro-organisms. In terrestrial systems, earthworms improve
the health of soil biosystems through their burrowing, ingestion of particles,
and nutrient cycling. In turn, the worms'health is enhanced by symbionts such as
Acidovorax-like bacteria, which colonize the osmoregulatory-excretory organs
(nephridia) of the composting earthworm Eisinia foetida. This project is
developing a genetic system to manipulate the genome of the Acidovorax-like
species. Using these new tools, genes and expression patterns are being
identified that determine the role of bacterial motility and chemical signaling
in the bacteria's preferential colonization of the nephridia. The training
objectives expand proficiencies in microbiology techniques. Working in a new
biological system will add scientific breadth to the repertoire of technical
skills and alternative avenues of scientific reasoning. Broader impacts include
a better understanding of the relationship between the earthworm and its
associated Acidovorax-like bacteria, as well as more general interactions
between eukaryotic hosts and their bacterial endosymbionts.
