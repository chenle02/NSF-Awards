This award supports a student session at the 2nd Workshop on Question
Generation. The aim of the workshop is to strengthen the Question Generation
(QG) research community and create consensus with respect to QG as a shared
task. The 2nd Workshop on Question Generation is a 1-day workshop organized into
two sets of sessions. In the morning sessions, regular paper presentations on
general topics related to QG are scheduled. The afternoon sessions are dedicated
to discussions and presentations related to QG in Intelligent Tutoring Systems,
one category of shared tasks identified at the previous Workshop on The Question
Generation Shared Task and Evaluation Challenge. As part of the afternoon
sessions we have a student session. Attending the workshop will greatly impact
the scientific awareness and skills of students. It will allow students to
become real contributors and leaders of the QG research community by engaging in
discussions at the workshop about important research issues in this area of
research. The workshop is a great venue for student to be exposed to
interdisciplinary research which will definitely strengthen their skills. The
broad implications of QG research will increase students? motivation to do
research in this area. The students attending the workshop will be among future
leading scientists who could boost our national STEM education, a mission of
particular interest to the National Science Foundation, due to the importance of
QG in learning technologies. We will encourage participation of groups
underrepresented in science and engineering, including minorities, women, and
persons with disabilities.
