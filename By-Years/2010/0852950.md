Social displays such as courtship behaviors are the result of interactions of
brain chemistry, hormones and social environment. Because the physiological
mechanisms that control these behaviors can be quite complex a relatively simple
animal model will be used to ask questions about fundamental neurochemistry and
neural pathways that may underlie such important behaviors for all vertebrates.
Male frog courtship behavior and calling behavior is an excellent model to study
such brain-behavior interactions. Male frogs must call in order to attract
females to mate and frog brains share anatomical similarities to many animals,
including humans. The roles of dopamine, a neurotransmitter and arginine
vasotocin, a neurohormone, will be used for modulating the calling behavior of
frogs. Specific drugs will be used that will either activate or block the
pathways associated with each neurochemical and quantify changes in the animals'
behavior. Both arginine vasotocin and dopamine have independently been shown to
be potent modulators of social behaviors in many animals, but little is known if
they interact. The frog model is well suited to answer such questions. It is
expected that these two important brain chemicals do interact and that the
actions of one system will influence the actions of the other. This project will
allow us to determine how these two chemical systems interact to modulate
important social behaviors. The PI will conduct her research together with
students from Spelman College in Atlanta Georgia, a historically black liberal
arts college for women. These young women of color will gain a rigorous academic
experience in neuroscience and behavior. Finally, as part of the PI's focus in
integrating her research with her classroom teaching, many Spelman students will
be provided with an opportunity to explore neuroscience and research-related
career options. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
