The principal goal of the research project is to address some of the new
analytical questions of the theory of integrable systems which emerged from the
recent developments in random matrix theory and in the related areas of exactly
solvable quantum models. The problems under consideration include the analytical
description of the Painlev\'e - type universalities in random matrix theory and
the related study of special families of Painlev\'e transcendents and
generalized Painlev\'e transcendents arising in the critical asymptotics in
random matrices, statistical mechanics and in the enumerative topology. The
third direction of the project is concerned with the analytical investigation of
the crossover phenomena in the classical theory of Toeplitz and Hankel
determinants, i.e. with the study of the Painlev\'e-type transition behavior
between different non-critical asymptotic regimes exhibited by large size
Toeplitz and Hankel determinants. Each of the above mentioned directions is
represented by a collection of concrete problems, and they are proposed to be
investigated within the same analytical framework, which is the Riemann-Hilbert
method.

The theory of integrable systems is an expanding area which plays an
increasingly important role as one of the principal sources of new analytical
and algebraic ideas for many branches of modern mathematics and theoretical
physics. Simultaneously, it provides an efficient analytical tool for study of
some of the fundamental mathematical models arising in modern nonlinear science
and technology. The new areas where the analytic techniques of integrable
systems become more and more common include random matrices, quantum field and
string theories, enumerative topology, stochastic processes, number theory, and,
most recently, entanglement in quantum chain systems which is expected to play
prominent role in future quantum computing technology. The problems considered
in the proposal have direct connections with the mentioned disciplines. In
particular, part of the proposal related to the Toeplitz and Hankel determinants
is primary motivated by the needs of the analytical theory of quantum
entanglement and by the challenges of analytical description of critical
behavior in important stochastic and quantum field models. This part of the
proposal is also essential for testing the random matrix predictions in number
theory. Proposed study of the Painlev\'e - type universalities and the families
of special Painlev\'e functions has direct relation to enumerative topology and
string theory. Success in achievement of the proposal's goals will have a
notable impact on research in all these areas.
