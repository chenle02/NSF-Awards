The University of Georgia's Marine Institute on Sapelo Island has been the site
of coastal research since 1953. Investigators into salt marsh environments have
used this research facility as resident and visiting scientists, and the
Institute has undergone renewed growth during the past decade. Due to its remote
location, separated from the mainland by six miles of marshland, the Institute
is subject to electrical brownouts and complete power failures. Dr. James
Alberts, Director of the Institute, proposes to install an uninterruptible power
source. This backup system would eliminate brownouts and would provide
continuous electricity for 30 minutes following power failures. The Institute's
backup generator system would provide electricity beyond this 30 minute
interval. The proposed installation of an uninterruptible power source would
have an important impact on the Institute's research capabilities. Researchers
at the Institute must rely on uninterrupted electricity for controlled growing
environments, culture growth chambers, and continuous environmental monitoring
systems. Brownouts and power failures can destroy months and years of research
effort. The proposed power supply will support continued growth of the
Institute's research impact.
