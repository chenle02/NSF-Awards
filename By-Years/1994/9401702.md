Montgomery This award funds the research in analytic number theory of Professor
Hugh Montgomery. Prof. Montgomery will study a number of outstanding problems in
multiplicative and additive number theory including the Riemann Hypothesis. In
one part of the project he hopes to construct a general technique for
determining optimal sieve methods. Such a technique would have wide application.
The field of analytic number theory applies the techniques of calculus to the
discrete realm of the whole numbers. Calculus was developed to aid the analysis
of continuous mathematical objects. The idea of using continuous methods to
investigate discrete objects is two centuries old, but with the work of the
modern analytic number theorists such as Professor Montgomery, the field has had
a new rebirth. ***
