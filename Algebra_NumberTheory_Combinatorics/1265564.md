Solutions to many problems in graph theory and extremal combinatorics require
structural information of graphs and hypergraphs. The PI plans to study graph
structures and their potential applications to graph colorings, in particular, a
long standing conjecture of Seymour on topological K5. He also plans to work on
several problems of Bollobas and Scott about partitions of graphs and
hypergraphs. The PI has previously obtained a number of results in the proposed
area using structural and extremal methods, and he plans to continue his work.

Graph theory studies discrete structures such as networks (e.g., the Internet).
Many problems in the real world may be formulated as problems on graphs, and
mathematical techniques have been applied to attack such problems. When the
structure of a class of graphs is well understood, efficient methods can often
be found to solve problems on these graphs. When the structure is not clear, one
often tries other mathematical methods (e.g. algebraic and probabilistic
methods). This proposal considers both structural and extremal problems in graph
theory. Progress on these problems should increase our understanding of graph
theory and has potential applications to areas such as optimization and computer
science.
