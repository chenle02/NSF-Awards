9405398 Abbott In view of the excellent science and engineering capabilities
that exist in many countries in all parts of the world, it is increasingly
important for U.S. scientists and engineers to remain in close touch with the
activities and plans of their foreign colleagues, in part as a means for
planning joint research programs with them. Additionally, gaining an
understanding of many important scientific problems, such as those associated
with the global environment, requires cooperative scientific efforts on a
multinational basis. U.S. scientists and engineers have a number of available
mechanisms to maintain close communication with scientists and engineers in
other countries. Among the most extensive of these mechanisms are the non-
governmental international disciplinary unions which today comprise the
International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU) in which more than 70
countries are represented. National members of these unions, as well as ICSU-
proper, are private scientific bodies whose activities are normally determined
by committees of working scientists. In the United States, the National Academy
of Sciences (NAS) is the official adhering body to ICSU and its unions. This
grant will support U.S. participation in the ICSU complex by enabling the NAS,
in cooperation with the National Research Council (NRC), to manage the
activities of the U.S. National Committees for ICSU and 20 its 23 associated
disciplinary unions for a period of three years. ***
