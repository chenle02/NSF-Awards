Clustering is the task of grouping given objects so that similar objects are in
the same cluster and different objects are in different clusters. It is one of
the most basic tasks in unsupervised machine learning, and clustering algorithms
are run numerous times each day across every field dealing with data. This
research aims to develop efficient clustering algorithms with improved
performance guarantees and study the limitations of efficient algorithms. These
goals will be achieved by creating algorithmic techniques that advance the
state-of-the-art and building new connections between various fields of computer
science and mathematics, including optimization, complexity theory, geometry,
combinatorics, and analysis. The outcome of this project will be integrated into
various courses in data science and approximation algorithms at both
undergraduate and graduate levels. The education plan also includes training
graduate students and broadening the participation of undergraduate students in
theoretical computer science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is centered
around two main directions, one for algorithms and one for hardness. The first
algorithmic direction is to revisit the study of local search, a discrete analog
of gradient descent. While the standard local search has been well studied, new
types of local search algorithms incorporating convex optimization methods or
Euclidean geometry were recently proposed. Understanding the power of these
local search algorithms seems to require a new global analysis. Secondly, the
investigator will study a recently introduced complexity hypothesis called the
Johnson Coverage Hypothesis which, if true, will result in significantly better
hardness results for clustering in Euclidean spaces. It already reveals exciting
connections to other areas of mathematics and theoretical computer science that
are worth further investigation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
