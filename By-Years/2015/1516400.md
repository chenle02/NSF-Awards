This award supports the research program of the Principal Investigators
concerned primarily with mathematical and computational aspects of "discrete
energy problems." These are problems with classical roots -- the simplest
example is that of determining the configuration of a finite number of point
charges on a conducting shell interacting via mutual electrostatic repulsion --
yet are relevant to several modern large-scale scientific computing
applications. Representing surfaces and volumes by a large but finite number of
points is useful for data sampling methods and for simulating complex
geophysical processes such as climate changes and heat diffusion in Earth's
mantle. Minimal energy methods for particles interacting via pairwise repulsive
interactions will be used to generate such approximating point configurations.
Graduate students and post-doctoral fellows will play an active role in the
research program, which will involve collaboration with scientists at the
National Center for Atmospheric Research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigative
team is (i) developing an asymptotic analysis of discrete energy problems with
an external field for nonintegrable Riesz kernels and is applying the theory to
develop computationally efficient algorithms for generating large-scale node
sets modeling a specified nonuniform density; (ii) analyzing energy asymptotics
for periodic problems and their connection to optimal lattice (crystalline)
structures; (iii) investigating the geometrical properties of optimal and near
optimal polarization configurations on manifolds, especially for large numbers
of points.
