The investigators propose to build and test a multi-sensor, automated
measurement station for monitoring Arctic and Antarctic ice-ocean environments.
The system, based on a previously successful design, will incorporate weather
and climate sensors, camera, snow and firn sensors, instruments to measure ice
motion, ice and ocean thermal profilers, hydrophone, and salinity sensors. This
new system will have two-way communications for real-time data delivery and is
designed for rapid deployment by a small field group.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AMIGOS-II will be capable of providing real time
information on geophysical processes such as weather, snowmelt, ice motion and
strain, fractures and melt ponds, firn thermal profiling, and ocean conditions
from multiple levels every few hours for 2-4 years. Project personnel will
conduct a field test of the new system at a location with a deep ice-covered
lake. Development of AMIGOS-II is motivated by recent calls by the U.S.
Antarctic Program Blue-Ribbon Panel to increase Antarctic logistical
effectiveness, which cites a need for greater efficiency in logistical
operations. Installation of autonomous stations with reduced logistical
requirements advances this goal.
