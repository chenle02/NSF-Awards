In this proposal, the PI proposes to study geometric problems that are inspired
from physics, especially equations that are relevant to string theory and
general relativity.

An important set of nonlinear equations appeared in Heterotic string theory as a
coupled system of Einstein and Yang Mills over a complex manifold. We propose to
solve this system. We expect to use this system to understand structures of
higher dimensional manifolds. Intrinsic metrics on moduli space of complex
structures and curves of higher genus on Calabi-Yau manifolds play a very
important role in algebraic geometry and string theory, we expect to study their
properties in detail. We would like to generalize some of our previous works on
moduli space of Rieman surfaces to higher dimension. In general relativity, we
shall continue to study the definition of quasi-local mass and their properties.

The interaction between theoretical physics and mathematics have been extremely
fruitful in the past quarter of century. This proposal is part of this
interaction. While the works will serve the physics community, we are confident
that the outcome of this research will give insights that will lead to better
understanding of geometry .
