ABSTRACT CTS-9733066 Raul F. Lobo/U. Del. This grant is awarded through the
Interfacial, Transport and Separations Program of the Chemical and Transport
Systems Division. The principal investigator is Dr. Raul Lobo at the University
of Delaware. The research will investigate structure-property relationships of
zeolite adsorbents used in gas separations. The research will involve
characterizations of the adsorption sites using a combination of neutron, x-ray
and NMR techniques, and studies to understand intermolecular interactions within
zeolitic pores. The educational plan consists of (i) integration of research as
part of undergraduate education (ii) development of courses at the graduate and
sophomore level (iii) provide mentorship in a Resources to Insure Successful
Engineers program. The fundamental understanding of molecular phenomena within
zeolite pores is of utmost interest to the chemicals processing industries.
There are numerous reaction and separation processes that use zeolites as
catalysts and adsorbents. The research could have an impact in the preparation
of a new generation of zeolite adsorbents. The results of the research may have
implications for the catalytic application of alkali-metal exchanged zeolites
and the use of Li-containing zeolites as solid-state ion conductors. ***
