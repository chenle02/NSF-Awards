This proposal is for the funding of five Graduate Research Trainees to
undertake research and training in the University of Hawaii's Ecology,
Evolution, and Conservation Biology Program. The students' training would expose
them to one of the world's most spectacular examples of adaptive radiation,
provide first- hand experience of Hawaii's native ecosystems, active
conservation policies, research and practice and integrate basic knowledge with
conservation practice in real situations. The training environment will be
enhanced by an exchange agreement with Cornell University at present being
negotiated, the development of a Center for Conservation Research and Training,
the closely-related Hawaii Evolutionary Biology Program, the expansion of the
Lyon Arboretum's role as a conservation research area, and a summer field course
with collaborating land managing agencies. The training will include a two-
semester core course that will provide professional level discussion of areas in
biology that are fundamental to the understanding of all biology. Recruitment of
ethnic minorities, already strong, will be enhanced through keying in with
existing undergraduate minority programs. Special efforts will be made to
recruit women by working through the American Association of University Women
and the American Women In Science. Leading mainland candidates will be flown to
Hawaii for assessment. To assist retention and the acquisition of skills
students will in the first year be rotated through several research projects
with associated graduate faculty.
