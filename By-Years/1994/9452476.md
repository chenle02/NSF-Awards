9452476 Bustoz A networked computer laboratory classroom is devoted exclusively
to undergraduate instruction in mathematics. Two types of courses are affected:
(1) The laboratory is used to teach approximately 1,000 students per year in a
course entitled "Calculus with Computers." This course, which is aimed at non-
technical majors, is a replacement for College Algebra as a graduation
requirement for non-science students. The course introduces most of the main
ideas of calculus using the DERIVE software package to do most of the algebraic
manipulations and to plot functions. (2) The Laboratory is used to teach a new
sequence of courses in calculus, ordinary differential equations, and
mathematical modeling that are tailored to the needs of students in the
biological and life sciences. The goal is to improve the mathematics background
of these students, who have traditionally taken only a one-semester course in
polynomial calculus. Initially, about 100 students per year take these courses.
