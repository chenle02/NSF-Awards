Professor Schaffner is examining theory structure and research strategies in
molecular biology. In order to develop a more general approach to these issues,
he is first undertaking three detailed case studies: a recent historical inquiry
into the molecular explanation of the generation of antibody diversity; simple
molecular learning mechanisms in Aplysia; and the genetic control of the life
cycle of the HIV virus. These case studies are intended to lead to a broader
conceptualization of theory structure and research strategies in molecular
biology. This conceptualization should include an examination of the conceptual
structure of theories, models, mechanisms, principles, and generalizations in
molecular biology, and their relations to experimental results and new
experimental technologies. Professor Schaffner is then considering ways in which
these elements (e.g. theories, models, principles . . .) change as science
progresses, and what dynamical factors drive such changes. As part of this
study, he is examining various heuristics for theory and model changes and the
proposal and evaluation of laboratory experiments.
