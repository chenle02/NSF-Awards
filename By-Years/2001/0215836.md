University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MRI/RUI: Acquisition of Wireless, Beowulf, and
Distributed Computing Clusters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal from an REU
institution, establishing a parallel and distributed computing research
laboratory for CS faculty and students, includes &lt;br/&gt; An ad hoc mobile
network cluster (handheld PDA and labtops connecting without a
server),&lt;br/&gt; A Beowulf cluster ( a parallel computing cluster composed of
off-the-shelf PCs with fast network connections between them), and&lt;br/&gt;
Workstations connected in typical network style.&lt;br/&gt;With specific
research activities that follow, the clusters will support the following
areas:&lt;br/&gt;A. Parallel and Distributed Computation on Ad Hoc
Networks&lt;br/&gt;1. Development of a serverless location protocol&lt;br/&gt;2.
Development of parallel applications for ad hoc networks on top of serverless
SLP, and&lt;br/&gt;3. Utilizing idle cycles of wireless devices&lt;br/&gt;B.
Parallel Algorithms for Graphs Coloring and Applications&lt;br/&gt;1. Graph
coloring heuristics&lt;br/&gt;2. Historical study of the four-color
theorem&lt;br/&gt;C. Parallel Genetic Algorithms (an optimization techniques
based on the idea of "survival of the fittest")&lt;br/&gt;D. Language Support
for Distributed Computing over Heterogeneous Networks &lt;br/&gt;(support for
distributed data structures in High Performance C++)&lt;br/&gt;E. Distributed
Database Systems&lt;br/&gt;F. Distributed Virtual Shared Memory
Architectures&lt;br/&gt;G. High-Energy Astrophysics&lt;br/&gt;H. Dynamics of
complex systems&lt;br/&gt;Depending on the configuration needed for a particular
application, the three clusters will be combined into one heterogeneous
distributed network or used as stand-alone parallel/distributed networks.
