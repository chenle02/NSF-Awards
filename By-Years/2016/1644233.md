The Boise State University Gateway Scholarships in Biological Sciences Program
emphasizes the importance of recruiting students to STEM disciplines and the
significance of improving retention, graduation rates and overall student
success of academically talented students with demonstrated financial need. The
program has five key components: 1) a mentored cohort program, 2) enhanced risk-
based advising, 3) evidence-based instructional practices integrated into the
curriculum, 4) co-curricular experiences for students, and 5) investigation into
the effects of proposed activities on retention, student success, and degree
attainment. The project encourages students from a diversity of backgrounds who
are academically talented and demonstrate financial need to complete their
degree program and join the STEM workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals
include improving educational opportunities for biology students, increasing
retention of students so that they complete their degree program, improving
student support programs at Boise State University, and increasing the number of
well-educated and skilled employees in STEM fields. Goals are accomplished
through evidence-based instructional and advising enhancements, and co-
curricular and cohort-building activities that allow students to engage in the
profession and recognize the interdisciplinary nature of the biological
sciences. Connections between active learning practices, self-efficacy, and
rapport with others in the department are emphasized in the factors that
contribute to biology student success, particularly for underrepresented
students. Data collected contributes to new knowledge about the effectiveness of
simultaneous curricular and co-curricular student success interventions,
integrated with a faculty-mentored scholarship cohort.
