The objective of this project is to develop a framework for anytime, anywhere
collaborative virtual observation of events occurring in dynamic environments.
The approach is to enhance recently developed virtual observation concepts by
adapting software service composition mechanisms developed for pervasive
computing systems. The observations, made at different points in time and space,
are stitched together based on location, query, device, and other variables.
Protocols for soft-real time delivery of data packets in heterogeneous networks
comprising a combination of continuous and disruption tolerant communication
channels are being developed. Middleware tools are being created to perform
reactive and proactive query processing, matching, and synthesis of integrative
panoramic views.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed
work lies in the launching of the virtual observers, in retrospect, in soft
real-time, on any device in a mobile environment and the concatenation of
successive virtual observers to create virtual tours. Development of an
integrated framework for video acquisition, stream processing, video synthesis,
opportunistic networking, and integrated pervasive services in dynamic and
heterogeneous environments are contributions of this
project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to broader impact, the research has
the potential to provide new insights in the areas of video surveillance and
security of public places. In general, outcomes of this project have broad
applicability in such areas as science manufacturing, education, homeland
defense, and entertainment. International collaboration with the Curtin
University enables graduate students, including those from underrepresented
groups, to interact with students and researchers in Australia, thus broadening
their knowledge and skills.
