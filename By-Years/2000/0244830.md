Professor Gang-Yu Liu of the University of California Davis is supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry program to fabricate nanostructures that
immobilize antibodies with designated positions while maintaining their
bioreactivity. Scanning probe tips are used to secure antigens followed by
divalent binding of antibodies. The structures are probed by scanning probe
microscopy (SPM). Can the assemblies trigger cell responses which mimic natural
immune processes? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These studies have the potential to open
new avenues of study in bioanalytical and bioengineering areas. The project also
relates to the goals of miniaturizing electronics such as biosensors to
molecular-size scale. Students receive interdisciplinary training in
electrochemistry and nanofabrication skills and benefit from close collaboration
with a synthetic chemist and an immunologist.
