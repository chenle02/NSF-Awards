This proposal is funded to reconstruct past sea surface temperatures and
salinities in the sub-tropical Atlantic to determine if tropical forcing
influenced climate oscillations associated with millennial scale changes. d18O
and Mg/Ca analyses of planktic foraminifera will be used to provide a robust
estimate of these parameters at millennium to orbital time scales.
