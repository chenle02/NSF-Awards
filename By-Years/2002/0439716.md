The proposed research will devise novel silicon nanowire biological sensor
arrays capable of screening unknown samples by analyzing for DNA markers of a
wide variety of dangerous biological species in real time. Specifically, this
research will create silicon nanowire field effect transistor sensor arrays to
detect the genetic markers of Bacillus anthracis as a model system. The
advantages of the newly developed nanowire sensing devices will include rapid
response time, on-site detection capability, high detection sensitivity,
remarkable selectivity, and small packaging size. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
