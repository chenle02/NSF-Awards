Objective:&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this program is to develop compact ultra-
high-Q three-dimensional photonic crystal resonators and demonstrate optically-
pumped and electrically-pumped low-threshold microlasers defined in a complete
photonic band gap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;Photonic
crystal technology is currently limited by the boundary set by 2D photonic
crystal slab. It is apparent that there is a huge space beyond the boundary to
explore. The most significant thing in 3D photonic crystals is that they can
have a complete photonic band gap. This unique feature enables three-dimensional
light localization in an extremely small space as a resonance state. In this
program, the developed UHQ microresonator and low-loss waveguides designs will
be built by a simple fabrication method without wafer bonding in order to
demonstrate 3D photonic crystal microlasers by optical and electrical
pumping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This program consists of
research, training, and education components. &lt;br/&gt;The developed
technology would break the boundary set by current light localization technology
and open up possibilities of creating new light localization devices and enhance
the performance and functionality of optical devices. The efforts would impact
other scientific communities to enhance capabilities of light localization and
light-matter interaction. The developed components for light localization would
be excellent test beds for investigating condensed matter physics and optical
physics, including light-matter interaction, quantum information science, and 3D
optics. Furthermore, current-injection UHQ microlasers and resonators will make
light localization technology practical. The program provides students in
underrepresented groups with educational, training and research opportunities.
