Computer Science (31) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves the running of
a workshop whose goal is to continue work on developing a community of users and
developers of algorithm and data structure visualizations (AVs). Successful use
of AVs depends on both the availability of quality educational materials and
their proper deployment. The field of AV has progressed little from the mid
1990s in terms of adoption levels or total educational impact. Many developers
are not making use of lessons learned. Since effective ways of developing and
deploying AVs are known, these difficulties can be overcome by a cohesive
community of AV developers and users. The goal of this project is to continue to
build this community. This community helps to guide creation of an integrated
collection of resources and infrastructure to serve as a communications hub and
information clearing house. These resources leverage the progress already made
by AV developers and users to bring about wider adoption and greater successful
impact in the classroom. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is the
improvement of the computer science education community's understanding of how
AVs can be made pedagogically effective. The broader impact is improving on the
general availability and quality of AVs, which can affect the educational
outcomes for many students every year in computer science and related
disciplines. Providing a community resource on best practices improves the
development of future AVs. A clearing house of available AVs and documenting
best practices for their use provides quality educational materials to
instructors.&lt;br/&gt;
