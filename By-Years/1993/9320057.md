9320057 Baier This "TIE" project funds a research project to be performed
jointly by Case Western Reserve University's Industry/University Cooperative
Research Center for Applied Polymers Research and the State University of New
York at Buffalo's Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for
Biosurfaces. This project is a collaborative study of surface interactions that
will lead to an elucidation of relationships between biomaterial surface
properties and blood protein and monocyte/macrophage adhesion and activation.
The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Applied Polymers will be
responsible for the biological characterization both before and following
protein adsorption. The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for
Biosurfaces will be responsible for surface characterization both before and
following protein adsorption and cell adhesion. The researchers are very well
qualified to perform this joint project. The Program Manager recommends the
State University of New York at Buffalo be awarded $25,000 for the first year of
a two-year continuing award.
