This is for completion of a petrologic and geochronologic investigation of
caldera-related volcanism of the southeast San Juan volcanic field. The platoro-
Summitville caldera comples, which includes voluminous pre- and postcaldera
andesite to dacite volcanoes, records the early development of the San Juan
field. The relatively mafic compositions of the Treasure Mountain ash- flow
tuffs and their association with postcaldera andesite lavas, indicates that this
magmatic system represents a primitive stage in the growth of the large silicic
magma body which formed subsequently under the central and western San Juan
caldera clusters. This is a field, petrologic, and isotopic study of the entire
caldera-related volcanic sequence of the southeast San Juan field, including the
Masonic Park Tuff. Although the basic geochemical characterization of much of
the sequence is nearly complete, additional isotopic analyses (Pb, Sr and Nd)
will be completed and further petrologic work will be done on the tuffs.
