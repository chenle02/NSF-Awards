One of the significant impediments in the fight against a disease like COVID-19
is the availability of a safe and effective mimic of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that
could be used without the need of very specialized handling and laboratory
equipment that could serve as early-stage substitute during technology
development. As an early stage substitute the SARS-CoV-2 mimic, or pseudovirus,
could serve as a safe, effective tool to create antibodies, develop purification
methods, design vaccine candidates, and build diagnostic kits. In the absence of
suitable mimics, the nationwide ability to quickly pass/fail ideas is vastly
limited. In particular, due to the low number of facilities that are able to
safely handle an infectious agent, a strain on infrastructure occurs which
ultimately limits the number of teams “in the fight” who may have significant
expertise but minimal accommodations. This project will produce such a safe
pseudovirus that could be widely used for the development of materials for this
and potentially future pandemics. In addition, a postdoc will be trained in an
interdisciplinary environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this
proposal is to develop a synthetic yeast construct that will serve as a safe
(BSL-1), robust and reliable surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 or other infectious agents
against which diagnostic and environmental testing assays could be developed and
validated. The key elements of the proposed work are 1) the development of a
yeast surface display platform in which the surface density of key proteins
normally found on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 can be expressed, 2) the development
of a robust production platform for the biomanufacturing of the yeast
pseudovirus, and 3) the validation of the yeast pseudovirus against SARS-CoV-2
to demonstrate that the yeast pseudovirus can be used as a mimic for SARS-CoV-2
for the development of biologics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
