This award will support student travel to the seventh Midwest Verification Day
(MVD), to be held at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in September
2015. MVD is an informal regional workshop with the goal of cultivating a
regional research network in verification and formal methods. The funds will
help support U.S. based students, focusing on Ph.D. students at an advanced
stage in their program and students who would otherwise not be able to attend
MVD. The broader impacts include training the next generation of researchers in
this important research area. Higher priority will be assigned to students
giving presentations and a strong emphasis will be put on supporting students
from underrepresented groups.
