0128882 Hartmann This award supports Dieter Hartmann and students from Clemson
University in a collaboration with Sylvio Klose of the Thuering Observatory in
Tautenburg, Germany. The aim of the international project is to study the
temporal evolution of gamma-ray burst afterglows. Both groups have access to
small and midsize telescopes. The U.S. side uses data from the fully robotic
Super-LOTIS telescope at the Kit Peak National Observatory. The German side has
access to the Tautenburg two-meter telescope as well as time on various
international large-aperture telescopes. By combining data collected by both
groups, they will analyze gamma-ray burst afterglow light curves and possible
color changes on time scales ranging from seconds to days. The work plan
provides for extensive participation by graduate students in the international
travel and research.
