The purpose of this award is to fund a meeting for materials researchers in the
realm of 2 dimensional materials to envision how data sciences can contribute to
the development of this discipline to elucidate structure/processing/property
correlations. At present, many materials problems of technological relevance
suffer from lack of data frameworks. Indeed, lack of adequate frameworks to
process, curate, and share complex raw data hinders progress in this field,
ultimately not realizing the promise of 2 dimensional materials commercial
technologies. In short, materials scientists are inundated with multi-
dimensional data from many sources, both experimental and computational, and
vast amounts of data are under-utilized, repeatedly acquired, or thrown out
completely. &lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this workshop is to build the needed
framework towards sound data schemes and repositories in the realm of 2
dimensional materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This meeting is the first
intervention on the PIs of the recently constituted NSF-2D Data Framework
(2DDF), which will be complemented by further PI meetings as well as events for
students and post-docs to provide training and implement the vision developed by
PIs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
