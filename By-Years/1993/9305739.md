This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will assist the
Department of Chemistry at Brandeis University in the purchase of an x-ray
diffractometer and an associated data analysis system. This new instrumentation
will enhance greatly research in a number of areas including the following: 1)
Solid state reactions of metal complexes, 2) Sterically encumbered ligands, 3)
The conformational analysis of type I and type II B-turns in model polypeptides,
4) Ion pair structures, 5) Applications of organometallic chemistry to materials
science and organic synthesis. From molecular wires to enantioselective
reagents, 6) Development of new synthetic methods and their application of total
synthesis. %%% The x-ray diffractometer is used to make accurate and precise
measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a molecule. The
information obtained gives the precise values of all the bond distances and bond
angles of a given molecule and it gives accurate information about the spatial
arrangement of that molecule relative to the neighboring molecules.
