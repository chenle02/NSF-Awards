This project addresses the difficulties associated with requirements analysis
and design by combining object-oriented analysis and design with formal methods.
A formalization of an object-oriented diagramming method is being developed, and
a framework of rules for reasoning about the meaning of its diagrams is being
defined. Diagrams are treated as data type definitions, and the rules enable the
automated checking of the consistency of the definitions. The diagramming method
comprises three commonly used graphical notations that define the Object
Modeling Techniques; (1) object models, (2) data flow diagrams, and (3) state
charts, which have been used to perform requirements analysis. As such, the
rules defined for these notations provide a formal basis for requirements
analysis and allow the rigorously checked diagrams to be used as formal
specifications. Diagram composition rules have corresponding proof obligations
regarding consistency. Automated techniques are used to determine the
consistency and completeness of a system's requirements as depicted by the
diagrams. A set of transformation rules for diagrams and their corresponding
formal specifications are used to derive designs, guide the implementation
process, and validate the developed code. A graphics-based prototype environment
is being developed that encapsulates the formalization process and existing
specification and program development tools.
