This award is to Keck Graduate Institute to support the activity described below
for 36 months. The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for
Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF-03521).

Partners The partners include Keck Graduate Institute (Lead Institution), Sprout
Group, Axiom Venture Partners, Sears Capital Management, Business Technology
Center of the Los Angeles County Community Development Commission, and Southern

The primary objective of this award is to form a unique
industry/academic/government partnership to incubate innovative bioscience ideas
from entrepreneurs with the venture capital community to create new
products/business enterprises. Innovative ideas are solicited from the Keck
Graduate Institute, other local universities, and entrepreneurs from the
business community. Business/management expertise is provided by Keck's school
of management. The venture capitalists collaborate with entrepreneurs to
validate their ideas and provide funds and expertise to grow the businesses.
Thee local and regional government agencies help disseminate the
ideas/technologies to the biomedical and pharmaceutical business communities. In
addition, workforce education and training programs at the lead institution will
provide the workforce to support the new and emerging companies. Long-term
sustainability is a key component of the program.

Potential Economic Impact The long-term goal is to enable these new companies
grow over a long period by providing financial, technical and managerial support
to create economic well being and new jobs in the region.

The intellectual merit of the activity lies in providing a source of new
knowledge in the biotechnology area and partner it with managerial/business
knowledge and venture funding to create new biotechnology, biomedicine, and
pharmaceutical companies.

The broader impacts of the activity concentrate on creating a new student
generation from the underrepresented population with Masters in Bioscience
degree and stimulating new economic growth by transforming bioscience ideas into
products and services that are beneficial for the economy and the public.
