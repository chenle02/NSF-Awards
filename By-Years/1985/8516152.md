This project focuses on the current position of research in the fields of
natural and technological hazards. The two fields have typically developed in
subtly different ways, despite the many similarities between them. As a result
of the fundamental similarities, and with a recognition that hazards are posing
ever larger problems to societies throughout the world, this project will
attempt some cross-fertilization between the two research traditions, and the
generation of a set of key issues which will both inform and stimulate research
within the field of hazards as a whole. This aim will be achieved by the
initiation of detailed research reviews, the presentation of these developments
to a special workshop where they will be refined in discussion, and the
publication of these ideas in collected form.
