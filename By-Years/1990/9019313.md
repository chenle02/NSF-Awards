This award is for the development of a specific NMR technology with a long term
objective to develop NMR spectroscopy as a powerful tool for protein engineering
and rational drug design. Specifically in this project, Dr. Montelione will
develop software for computer assisted analysis of MD (multi-dimensional) NMR
spectra, and will develop pulsed field gradient technology for high resolution
NMR with a focus on applications of MD-NMR to the analysis of proteins in
aqueous solution. The PFG technology represents one of the most exciting
frontiers of high field NMR spectroscopy today. If it is successfully developed,
it will significantly advance our ability to analyze protein molecules that are
currently not amenable to NMR studies.
