Today's Solutions in partnership with the Girl Scouts-Lone Star Council are
using a planning grant to build a strong regional and national collaboration
with Texas community colleges and five additional Girl Scout councils. The
Council is building on a technology curriculum project pilot called "The Edge."
The original pilot program was developed for girls ages 6-17 and delivered
primarily to elementary and middle school girls. The plan is to modify "The
Edge" to address the needs of high school age girls, undergraduate women and
women desiring an entry level technology job. The large project will focus on
those in rural Texas counties, girls within the 200% of poverty level and girls
that have English as a second language, to increase their technology skills and
their interest in going to college. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Austin Community
College distance learning, St. Edward's University, University of Texas and the
IC2 institute are eager to partner with Girl Scouts - Lone Star Council . The
Council served 12,839 girls and 6,598 adults in fiscal year 99-00. &lt;br/&gt;
