Data from small-angle scattering in collisions between helium projectiles and
rare gas target atoms will be analyzed to yield accurate determinations of the
ground state potential energy of these systems as a function of internuclear
separation. Results will be obtained by fitting a realistic potential model
(HFD) to published keV-energy collision data using a least squares minimization
procedure. The focus of this study is the repulsive barrier at energies greater
than 0.1 eV, a region which at present is poorly characterized relative to our
understanding of the interaction potential at lower energies. The work will be
carried out primarily by undergraduate students and will provide excellent
training for them on a project that is well suited for undergraduate
participation and will train them the techniques of computer based reduction of
experimental data.
