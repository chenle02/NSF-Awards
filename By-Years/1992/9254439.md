9254439 Hooper The Project to Improve Science Models (PRISM) is a multifaceted
plan to improvethe science preparation of all prospective teachers of grades 1-9
by transformingpreservice courses and field experiences. Objectives of this
project are university faculty collaborating with professional teachers to
effect the undergraduate educationof pre-service teachers in order to: increase
understanding of science concepts,processes and skills; develop creative skills
and positive attitudes toward science; and ultimately transfer these
competencies into classrooms. The major components of the project include the
development of: three core content courses (12 semester hours) integrating six
science disciplines; a 3 semester hour infused methods course; effective
modeling of multimedia instructional technology; a mentor teacher network, and a
science resource center. The project is a collaboration developed by a steering
committee of eight teachers working with university faculty, input from both
Arts and Sciences faculty and Education faculty, 60 area teachers, and a local
educational consortia, CESAs. The University faculty is designing integrated
courses infusing multimedia technology; the teachers serve as mentors for over
1000 prospective teachers; and, CESAs provides technical assistance, educational
materials, and logistical support. Materials being developed make the project
model available and transportable so as to affect positive changes in 1-9
preservice teacher education. ***y
