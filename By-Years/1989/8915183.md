Professor C. Bradley Moore is supported by a grant from The Physical Chemistry
Program to organize a bilateral US - USSR Workshop on Linear and Nonlinear Laser
Interactions and Molecular Dynamics. The workshop will be held in the Soviet
Union in Spring 1990, and this grant will provide travel expenses for 11 US
participants to attend. The US scientists will also visit a number of Soviet
laser laboratories in Moscow, Leningrad, and Novosibirsk, as well as
laboratories in other Eastern European countries. The three day meeting which
will be held in Moscow will cover a number of basic research areas on the use of
short-pulsed lasers in determining the dynamics of rapid photochemical changes
of molecules in gases, solids and solutions, and surfaces as well as the use of
intense laser radiation in understanding the mechanisms of multiphoton laser
photochemistry and its applications.
