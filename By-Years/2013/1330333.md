This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II award proposes to
develop a multi-touch table with object tracking and smart surface devices to
create a highly versatile augmented-reality lab bench. The resulting instrument
allows collaborative experimentation using physical lab equipment such as
ballistic pucks, microscopes, beakers, and hot plates, combined with real-time
measurement, analysis, and graphical content. Working with Tufts University and
area educators, a new model of lab equipment has been demonstrated. The
effective use of affordable technologies provides the access, supports, and
scaffolds that students need to make sense of science and become excited by STEM
(Science Technology Engineering and Math) creative opportunities. STEM-Table
will be used in conjunction with traditional instruction, but leverage a wide
range of new multimedia enhanced interactions, thereby transforming the STEM
classroom into a more hands-on and responsive environment and elucidating the
connections needed for fuller scientific understanding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader/commercial impact is that (1) creating the classroom-ready, large-
format, multi-touch STEM-Table brings unique, tangible interactive experiences
to STEM Teaching Labs; (2) multi-touch STEM lab equipment enables a wide range
of learning that combines data collection and hands-on lab skills with virtual
media; and (3) the multi-touch environment will provide classrooms with a new
paradigm for collaborative STEM activities with cost, capabilities, and workload
reduction advantages. In the proposed work a fully-commercialized STEM Table
"Multi-Science Augmented Reality Lab Bench" product will be deployed with
associated tangible lab equipment surface devices. This technology will be
classroom-tested and a user community will be supported with expanded
applications. Based on the user and market reaction to the core technology
evaluated to-date, this product will provide both a strong market position among
current educational lab equipment and significant STEM education benefits.
