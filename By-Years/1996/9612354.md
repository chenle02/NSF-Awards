The primary goal of this research is to develop efficient codes for noisy
modulation channels such as those encountered in magnetic and optical recording
devices. In these channels, it is often required to map the data to a sequence
with special modulation properties; since most devices are noisy, the recorded
sequence should have some error control capability as well. Coding techniques
are used to transform arbitrary data to sequences that satisfy the modulation
and error control requirements. Coding technology is one of the critical factors
that has contributed to the astounding capacity of today's magnetic recording
devices. The most commonly used coding scheme is based on concatenating an outer
code for error control with an inner code for modulation. Although each of the
two component codes may be optimal with respect to its function, the overall
concatenated scheme may not be optimal. It is recognized now in industry that
the coding gain achieved using this approach is close to reaching a saturation
point. This research aims at optimizing the overall concatenated coding scheme
rather than optimizing the component codes. It is expected that this approach
will significantly improve the overall coding gain. To accomplish this task, the
two component codes should not be independently designed and implemented.
Instead, any error control capability in the inner code should be optimally
exploited by the outer code for better performance. Funding for this project
will be used to support graduate students in an area with many applications in
data storage and communications, which are interdisciplinary in nature. There is
a need for more researchers in the coding aspects of these applications.
