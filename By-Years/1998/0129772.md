The primary goal of the "Evergreen International Phage" meeting is to provide a
place where students and researchers studying bacterial and archaeal viruses can
build strong international working relationships, leading to new insights and
collaborations. All aspects of phage biology, such as genetics, regulatory
mechanisms, the functioning of enzyme complexes involved in DNA synthesis,
repair and shutting off of host functions, phage-host interactions in lytic and
lysogenic cycles, morphogenesis and cell lysis, phage ecology and evolution,
structures of phage proteins, and functional and comparative genomics are
discussed. Senior scientists start each session with an introductory talk,
followed by younger scientists and students. The meeting is treated by Evergreen
State College as an extension of their summer Undergraduate Research Program,
and undergradute students at the College are involved in running the meeting.
This provides them with the opportunity to interact with an international range
of scientists.
