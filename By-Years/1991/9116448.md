This is a proposal to develop and apply the Direct Stress Solution (DSS)
technique to a three-dimensional circulation model of the inner shelf (5 to 30 m
depth). The model will then be applied to study nonlinear tidal generation and
the effect of wave-current interaction on the mean circulation of the English
Channel/North Sea and the eastern Irish Sea. The results will also be compared
to existing models.
