This award provides funding for a three year standard award to support a
Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering Site program at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison entitled, "RET Site: Cross-Cultural Connections:
An RET Site Program with UPRM and the UW", under the direction of Dr. Juan J. De
Pablo.

The University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW) Materials Research Science and
Engineering Center (MRSEC) on Nanostructured Interfaces and the University of
Puerto Rico-Mayaguez (UPRM) Center of Research Excellence in Science and
Technology (CREST) on Biomedical and Energy-Driven Systems and Applications will
collaborate to offer their local K-12 teachers the opportunity to learn about
cutting edge research in nanoscale science and engineering (NSE) and materials
science and engineering (MSE) and to create classroom educational materials
based upon that research. This RET in Engineering program at UW and UPRM will
provide a total of 23 K-12 teachers over a three year period, an opportunity to
participate in a six week summer research and professional development
experience with additional responsibilities and activities during the academic
year to build upon the summer experience. As RET Fellows, the teachers will work
with UW MRSEC and UPRM CREST faculty, postdoctoral associates, staff, graduate
students, and undergraduate students to conduct research in NSE/MSE and to
develop related curriculum. A highlight of this program will be the capstone
exchange week, during which the RET teachers and project team will go to UW or
UPRM for a week long exchange between the RET Fellows of their RET experiences,
research, posters, and curriculum materials; their schools and cultures of K-12
education; and their host universities.
