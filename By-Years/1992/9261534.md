Current phased array antenna technology utilizes discrete digital or analog
ferrite phase shifters which are high cost and RF power limited when in the
transmit mode due to the ferrite saturation phenomena. This research
investigates macromolecule and electrorheological suspensions (ERS) as a
potential electrically controllable (anisotropic) microwave phase shifter when a
DC field is applied. The research includes fabricatior of an experimental test
fixture to measure the Kerr constant of candidate materials, and research cf the
phenomena under various material, concentration and temperature conditions.
Also, a mathematical model will be developed to describe behavior. Lastly, the
potential configuration and performance of phase shifters using these materials
will be explored. The success of this research will have widespread applications
for low cost phasea array antennas for radar and in use in the
telecommunications industry.
