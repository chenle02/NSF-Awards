A symposium gathers together outstanding scholars, analysts, and practitioners
in science and technology policy who are within seven years of their PhDs. It
provides an opportunity to meet and exchange ideas and to present their work to
a high-level (senior) audience. This research symposium is oriented toward eight
theme tracks in science and technology policy: &lt;br/&gt;New history of science
and technology policy.&lt;br/&gt;R&amp;D program analysis and evaluation
&lt;br/&gt;Expertise, advice, assessment, and evaluation&lt;br/&gt;Science,
technology, and human needs and values&lt;br/&gt;Science, technology, and
international issues&lt;br/&gt;Science education, human resources, and
workforce&lt;br/&gt;Science and technology policy institutions and
processes&lt;br/&gt;Science, technology, and the public. &lt;br/&gt;Proposals
for these tracks were broadly solicited and peer reviewed for acceptance.
Accepted authors were funded to attend the workshop held in Washington, DC.
Senior scholars and practitioners served as discussants. The new scholarship
presented and the interaction among academics and practitioners have the
potential to improve policy and programs and to benefit education in science and
technology policy in a variety of ways. An edited book containing the presented
papers will be published.&lt;br/&gt;
