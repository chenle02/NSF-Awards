The Articulated Technological Education Pathways (ATEP) project develops three,
year-long courses for high school students that provide a bridge from high
school technical programs to community college programs in technician education.
The three courses address standards-driven technology concepts and skills and
STEM career choices in biochemical technology, information and communications
technology, and materials and manufacturing technology. Curriculum development
is guided by contemporary pedagogical practice and matched to industry
competencies and STEM academic learning standards. The materials are mainly
digital - emphasizing web-based learning and hands-on, design-based, physical
modeling activities that can be delivered as hybrid courses. Each course
consists of four nine-week modules that can serve as replacement or
supplementary curricula for high school Career and Technical Education
engineering and technology programs. Each course is developed by a team
consisting of content experts, faculty from high schools and community colleges
and a senior level industrialist. The first module in each course is
introductory and builds on previous work at the Center for Technological
Literacy. The content of the remaining modules is determined by the assessment-
driven design process of Wiggins and McTighe to emphasize key concepts and
builds on previous work at ATE Centers and projects. The materials are pilot
tested in classrooms, evaluated and revised before field testing. Guides are
prepared for teachers, administrators and parents. The materials include a
commercially published hybrid text and web-based cyber-learning instruction.
Research is conducted to determine how effectively the ATEP hybrid program
engages students, supports their learning of important STEM concepts and
workplace skills and serves to interest them pursue further STEM education
leading to STEM careers.
