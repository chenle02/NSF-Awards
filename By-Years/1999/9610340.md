Abstract CTS-9610340 Chris Rogers Tufts University The main goal is to develop
instrumentation for the measurement of instantaneous, two dimensional fluid
velocity fields from the viewpoint of a moving particle. A Kodak camera, imaging
frame grabber and accessory equipment will be purchased. In order to accurately
predict the behavior of a solid particle in a turbulent air flow, one must be
able to predict the fluid turbulence experienced by the particle: that is in the
particle Lagrangian reference frame. Most conventional models and simulations
give information in the stationary Eulerian reference frame or in the Lagrangian
reference frame. Since the particle has a gravitational drift and inertia, its
path is different from that of a fluid point (Lagrangian) or a stationary point
(Eulerian). The turbulence to which the particle responds is dependent on the
physical particle properties and on its previous history of surrounding
turbulence. The PI is modeling a transformation from an Eulerian coordinate
system to the particleÄ±s coordinate system for single point measurements, such
as fluid velocity autocorrelation. For some particles, however, their path is
dictated by local fluid vorticity. Vortices tend to throw particles out into
straining regions. To model this behavior, one needs to be able to measure the
local instantaneous vorticity along the particle path. One can approximate the
vorticity using digital particle image velocimetry, measuring the 2-D fluid
velocity field in the reference frame of the moving particle. The current
difficulty is spatial and temporal resolution, both of which are addressed here.
The equipment will also be used by a number of other projects, both with
industry and government agencies.
