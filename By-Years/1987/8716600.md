Michael Brown proposes to apply concepts of catastrophe and chaos theory to two
fields of interest in ocean physics; the dynamics of two-dimensional
incompressible fluids and the propagation of high frequency acoustic waves. He
will address problems of formation, stability, and interactions of vortices
(rings and eddies), stirring of streaky tracer fields by turbulent flows,
effects of small random perturbations in the wavefield in the vicinity of
caustics, and the predictability (or lack thereof) of underwater sound fields.
These studies will shed new light into the solution of models and help to
interpret observational data.
