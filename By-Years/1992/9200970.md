This effort will seek a resolution to the controversy on DOM measurements that
have arisen due to the development of a high temperature combustion method.
Apparent differences may be due to variable blank interferences and varying
approaches to correction. It appears that rigorous protocol, not only for sample
collection and preparation, but also for standardization and blank correction,
could bring disparate DOC values closer together. It remains to be seen whether
the older wet chemical and UV methods really miss much of the "new" DOC. The HTC
methods for DON are obviously less well developed, but there is hope that with
attention to monitoring of nitrogen budgets in method development a more
complete final product can be obtained that does give all of the DON. There is
presently no clear indication that conventional methods for DON give values much
lower than HTC ones, but there are serious problems still to be resolved with
the HTC methods. The proposed next step is an effort that will take
approximately two years and is based on recommendations arising from a community
wide workshop convened to address the issue.
