Professor Yury Gogotsi of Drexel University is supported by the Analytical and
Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to conduct research in an
international collaboration with Professor Alexei Kornyshev of the Imperial
College London. The goal of the collaborative project is to conduct experiments
and molecular simulations to elucidate the molecular basis of surface charging
and discharging in electrochemical capacitors with room temperature ionic
liquids (RTILs). Energy storage mechanisms and current delivery dynamics, as
well as the behavior of ions in nanoscale confinement will be investigated.
Understanding the interaction between ions and nanostructured carbon surfaces is
essential for the development of supercapacitors in electrical energy storage
and harvesting applications. The research will provide students with training in
materials science and computer simulation and expose them to an international
research experience. The project is supported jointly by the NSF and the
Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council of the United Kingdom
(EPSRC).
