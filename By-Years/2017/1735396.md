With every passing day, the Internet becomes more and more integrated in
society. Our reliance on online web services in our professional and personal
lives continuously increases. Recognizing this, attackers take advantage of the
web's popularity to mount a wide range of web application attacks, compromising
systems, and stealing private and financial information. Although many classes
of these attacks are seemingly unrelated, in reality, many of them stem from the
stateless nature of the web, where no safeguards exist to ensure that a resource
that was linked to yesterday is the same resource being accessed today. As a
result, enforcing link integrity holds the promise of mitigating a multitude of
security attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, the dynamicity of the web poses
challenges to link integrity schemes, which must cope with constant benign
changes while flagging the malicious ones. Pursuing this line of research
requires a fundamental understanding of the security aspects of the web?s
dynamic nature. This nature cannot be assessed today with the available tools,
because existing web crawlers are limited to retrieving content, and generally
do not gather the metadata critical to the development of link integrity
schemes. This project aims to quantify the stability of web links by developing
a custom web crawler infrastructure and tools that will collect security-related
metadata about remote resources. The gathering and subsequent assessing of this
metadata is a critical first step to demonstrate the feasibility of developing
robust link integrity schemes that can be used to detect abnormal content and
infrastructure changes (indicative of an ongoing attack) while keeping false
positives to a minimum.
