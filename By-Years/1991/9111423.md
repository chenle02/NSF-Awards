This grant will give partial support to a three-day multidisciplinary
conference at the newly inaugurated Rutgers Center for Cognitive Science,
October 31-November 2, 1991. The conference will be an opportunity for
individuals representing the disciplines of Cognitive Psychology, Linguistics,
Computer Science, Philosophy, and Neuroscience to address a common problem in
Cognitive Science and for the interchange to enrich the approach taken by each
one. The particular focus will be on a main area of interdisciplinary activity
within Cognitive Science, the problem of understanding the Architecture of
Intelligent Systems, the structure of information processing mechanisms and
systems of representation underlying intelligence.
