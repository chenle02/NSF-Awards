This project explores the role of university pedagogy in the development of
chemistry into an academic discipline. The project consists of a historical case
study on the Dutch medical and chemical professor, Herman Boerhaave (1668-1738),
and his efforts to reform the teaching of chemistry at Leiden University. It
examines how Boerhaave established chemistry as a university subject by
successfully integrating it into the curriculum of the Leiden medical faculty as
part of his general reform of medical education. This process of integration
required the re-structuring and re-interpretation of various practices and
concepts from diverse chemical traditions in order to shape them into a chemical
course which conformed to the pedagogical and philosophical norms of Leiden's
medical faculty as well as presenting himself and his work in a manner which
would enlist the support of the Leiden University curators and Dutch religious
community. The P.I. will base his account largely on manuscript materials found
in Boerhaave's papers currently held at the Military Medicine Academy in Saint-
Petersburg, Russia. This project will make a significant contribution to the
history of chemistry by suggesting an alternate view regarding the institutional
and disciplinary development of the field and add to the debates on the
relationship between chemistry and alchemy and chemistry and medicine. The
project also presents a strong case for the importance of the university,
especially in the Dutch Republic, in the development and spread of new empirical
and experimental natural philosophies during the late seventeenth and early
eighteenth centuries. Finally, with regard to its wider significance for science
and society, the project will enhance the growing interest in science pedagogy
among scientists and STS scholars, especially regarding the changing status of
pedagogical work over time and the uses of pedagogy to promote disciplinary
reforms and philosophical agendas.
