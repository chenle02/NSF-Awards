Project summary:&lt;br/&gt;This proposal supports the registration of six junior
faculty members and/or potential faculty candidates to attend the annual
American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) meeting in Nashville, TN to
take place November 3-8, 2009. These faculty members are specifically invited to
attend an all-invited session entitled "Accessing Facilities at National
Centers, Laboratories, and Synchrotron Radiation Sources" sponsored by the
Materials Engineering and Science Division. This session will introduce the
facilities and infrastructure at national laboratories and synchrotron radiation
sources to the materials science/chemical engineering community in general, and
providing specific know-hows to junior faculty members just starting their
independent research programs.
