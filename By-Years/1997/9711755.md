9711755 Barthelmie The project is a study of atmospheric aerosol particles that
will use a one-dimensional lagrangian air quality model (ACDEP). The objective
of this work is to produce a meteorology trajectory model that incorporates key
aerosol formation processes, including secondary formation of inorganic and
organic aerosols and heterogeneous chemistry. Once updated, the model will be
tested and evaluated with measurements from field intensive studies. Data will
be utilized from the Fraser Valley study (British Columbia) and from an air
quality monitoring site in the eastern United States. Results from this study
will generate a new modeling platform that can assess the relative importance of
various aerosol formation processes, interactions of suspended particles with
ambient gas phase compounds, and the effect of atmospheric water vapor on gas-
aerosol partitioning for water soluble organics. The improved aerosol model will
be an important diagnostic tool for air quality managers.
