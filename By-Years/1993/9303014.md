Gottlieb This is a project to characterize and model the performance of a
scalable shared memory computer. Ultracomputer uses a multistage interconnection
network with hardware combining to provide high-bandwidth scalable connections
between processors and memory. Ultra III, on which the work is being performed,
uses Xilinx parts to implement most of the glue logic in the PEs (processing
elements). These can act as programmable performance monitors at each processor.
These tools are being used to evaluate the impact of combining on overall system
performance, measure the performance of scientific applications, measure and
compare alternative operating system designs, and construct mathematical models
of parallel system behavior.
