Natural language inference (NLI) and data-driven paraphrasing share the related
goals of being able to detect the semantic relationship between two natural
language expressions, and being able to re-word an input text so that the
resulting text is meaning-equivalent but worded differently. On the one hand,
work in recognizing textual entailment (RTE) within NLI has attempted to
formalize the process of determining whether a natural language hypothesis is
entailed by a natural language premise, sometimes called "natural logic".
Research in data-driven paraphrasing, on the other hand, attempts to extract
paraphrases at a variety of levels of granularity including lexical paraphrases
(simple synonyms), phrasal paraphrases, phrasal templates (or "inference
rules"), and sentential paraphrases, for various downstream applications such as
question answering, information extraction, text generation, and
summarization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER award explores bridging the gap,
through analysis of sentential paraphrasing via synchronous context free
grammars (SCFGs), and how they may be coupled to formal constraints akin to
recent work in phrase-based formulations of natural logic for RTE. Data-driven
paraphrasing has largely neglected semantic formalisms, and NLI has relied
heavily on hand-crafted resources like WordNet. If this project is successful it
will potentially lead towards NLI systems that are more robust, and paraphrasing
systems that are better formalized. Taken together, these improvements will
allow better RTE systems to be developed. Moreover, this project has the
potential to impact widely used human language technologies such as web search
and natural language interfaces to mobile devices, and to further the connection
between computational semantics and formal linguistics.
