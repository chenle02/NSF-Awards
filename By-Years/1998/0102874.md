Texas Southern University (TSU) proposes a Science and Technology Enhancement
Program (STEP) One-Year Planning Grant to the NSF Historically Black College and
University Undergraduate Program (HBCU UP). The objective is to increase the
recruitment, retention and graduation rates of students in undergraduate
programs in science, mathematics, engineering and technology (SMET) areas
through quality enhancements of teaching and student learning at the University.
The TSU STEP will achieve this overall objective through four (4) programmatic
thrusts: Student recruitment and retention for academic success, Faculty
development in teaching and scholarly achievements, Curricular reforms through
use of technology, and Assessment and evaluation for sustainability beyond NSF
funding. These programmatic thrusts will have measurable goals and timelines to
achieve the overall objectives of the TSU STEP.

During this one-year planning period the TSU STEP will develop a comprehensive
recruitment and retention plan for science and technology. Industry will become
an integral part of the S&T programs trough establishing a Corporate and
Professional Advisory Committee for the College of Science and Technology and a
discipline specific one for each department. Comprehensive plans to assist
faculty teaching with technology and enhancing their research capacity will be
developed. Each undergraduate academic program will recommend improvements in
their curriculum to enhance the quality of the education. An assessment and
evaluation plan will be developed such that the TSU STEP will be sustainable
after NSF funding has expired.
