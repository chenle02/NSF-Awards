A research computer laboratory is being developed in the Psychology Department
to facilitate the teaching of experimental methods via the execution and
analysis of original student research projects. The lab thus facilitates an
experiential approach to learning research methodology, including problem
conceptualization, experimental design, research methodology including problem
conceptualization, experimental design, research execution, data analysis, and
report writing. A standardized set of software tools, used throughout the four-
course research sequence, helps to provide continuity to the research
curriculum. The computer lab also helps demonstrate the steps in hypothesis
testing, simulate classic experimental designs, and test students' ability to
critically evaluate specific experimental designs. The computing laboratory,
with a network of 11 PC computers and associated peripherals, thus gives
students an experiential understanding of empirical methods via an integrated,
cumulative research sequence. The university will contribute an amount equal to
the award.
