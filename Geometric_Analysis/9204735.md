The principal investigators will continue their investigation of problems in
differential and algebraic geometry. In particular they will investigate the
structure of Chow varieties via the method of characteristic classes. Results
are expected to have relationships with Bott periodicity, the Hodge conjecture,
and the Schubert calculus. This award will support research in the general area
of differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry is the study
of the relationship between the geometry of a space and analytic concepts
defined on the space. Global analysis is the study of the overall geometric and
topological properties of a space by piecing together local information.
Applications of these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the
structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and the large scale
structure of the universe.
