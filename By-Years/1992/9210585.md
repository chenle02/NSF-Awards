The objective of this RIA project is to determine the effects of frequency
nonstationarity in the earthquake ground motions on the inelastic response and
related damage of structures. A new, versatile stochastic model formulated in
both discrete-time and continuous-time will be developed to represent the
desired features of the ground motion. System identification techniques will be
developed to calibrate the model against real earthquake records. Nonlinear
random vibration method will be used to gain insights into the effects of the
ground motion nonstationarity on linear and nonlinear structural response. The
models of inelastic action will be considered to represent the realistic smooth
hysteretic behavior with progressive deterioration. The research undertaken will
provide improved understanding of earthquake-induced damage in structures and
the way it is influenced by various ground motion parameters. It will also help
assess effects and relative importance of the various excitation and system
parameters on the statistics of structural response and damage.
