The curriculum of the chemistry major at the Institution has been improved in
the area of instrumental chemical analysis by a significant expansion in the
extent and scope of "hands-on" student use of modern nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) techniques in several required and elective laboratory courses. These
improvements have been accomplished with the acquisition of a modern NMR
spectrometer capable of performing multinuclear, variable temperature, and pulse
programming experiments. Specific experiments for student utilization of the NMR
spectrometer have been incorporated into the Experimental Organic Chemistry I
&amp; II, Instrumental Chemical Analysis, Experimental Physical Chemistry, and
Experimental Inorganic Chemistry courses. These experiments, in a progressive
way, move students through practical exposure to NMR beginning with simple 1D
proton and carbon experiments and ending with applications of dynamic,
multinuclear, and 2D NMR in the upper level courses. Providing "hands-on"
exposure to the many capabilities of NMR experiments has significantly improved
the program for undergraduate chemistry majors at the institution along with
other major chemical instrumentation in spectroscopy, electrochemistry, and
chromatography. The institution contributed to the project in an amount equal to
the NSF funds.
