9731607 Pollock This cooperative research project between Professor John
Pollock, Department of Biological Sciences, Carnegie-Mellon University, and
Professor Philip Batterham, Department of Genetics, University of Melbourne,
focuses on the molecular genetic analysis of normal and mutant visual system
development of Drosophila melanogaster. The U.S. and Australian researchers and
their laboratories bring complementary expertise to this study: image analysis
and tissue culture in Pollock's laboratory, and molecular and genetic expertise
in Batterham's laboratory. The research plan involves a multifaceted attack on
the role of played by the lozenge locus in the progressive recruitment and
differentiation of cells in the developing eye. This research should provide
further understanding of how eyes develop and also how lozenge influences the
development of smell and taste. It will also provide a platform for the training
of young researchers in an international setting.
