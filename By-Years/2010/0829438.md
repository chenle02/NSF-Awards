Biomarkers measured in a minimally invasive and repeatable way can expedite the
early diagnosis of disease, the indication of disease prognosis, and the
discovery of new drug targets for therapy. Serum proteomic profiling for
biomarker detection may reflect the abnormality or pathologic state of various
diseases through the protein/peptide peaks that are expressed differently
between diseased and healthy individuals. Since the procedures are simple,
inexpensive, and minimally invasive, serum proteomic methods readily lend
themselves to screening-test development; their robustness and ease promise to
translate into routine clinical practice. The objective of this project is to
construct a high-throughput proteomic profiling analysis toolset, Proteomics
Biomarker Information System (ProBIS), which can provide early biomarker
detection and identification for clinical proteomics healthcare. Our main
contributions are: (1) High Resolution Proteomic Profiling: different from
traditional low resolution mass spectrometry analysis, we will use high
resolution profile to analyze the low-molecular weight (LMW) end of the
proteomic spectrum for more precise analysis; and (2) Integrated System for
Biomarker Discovery and Identification: identification and sequencing of the
underlying discriminatory proteins/peptides will reveal the insights of
biomarkers and characterize disease pathway. The results of this project will
have an impact on the computer science community and an equal, if not greater,
impact on the broad medical community that is in need of such a proteomic
profiling data analysis tool. The experiments will be driven by a series of case
studies, including ovarian cancer early relapse monitoring and prostate cancer
diagnosis. The solutions for these case studies will have a direct impact on
individual areas. Our source code and data will be available for general
dissemination over the internet, and discoveries will be integrated into the
classroom.
