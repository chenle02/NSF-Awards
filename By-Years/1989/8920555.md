The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports Professor Grant in a
continuing experimental and theoretical study of bound-state surface
intersections and their effects upon excited-state dynamics in isolated
molecules. The purpose of the work is to develop a more complete understanding
of the consequences of coupling betwen electronic and nuclear motion in isolated
molecules and complexes. The vibrational structure of intramolecular potential
surface intersections is being studied experimentally in molecular beams pumped
by lasers and probed by ionization-detected Rydberg absorption spectroscopy and
zero-kinetic-energy photoelectron spectroscopy. Systems being investigated
include various triatomics and polyatomics; multiresonant techniques can give
resolution to a vibrational-rotational level of detail. Theoretical work is
extending existing capabilities for handling large diagonalizations to allow the
solving of three-state multimode problems. Techniques are also being developed
to derive classical analogs for radiationless dynamics of vibronically-mixed
valence states of excited triatomics. Berry's phase is also being investigated
in extended parameter spaces.
