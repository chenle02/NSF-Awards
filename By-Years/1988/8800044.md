This award is for a workshop on "Paleoclimatology and Paleometeorology: Modern
and Past Patterns of Global Atmospheric Transport." It will be held November
15-19, 1987, at the Sunspace Conference Center, Oracle, Arizona. The objective
of the workshop is to bring together geologists and paleobotanists who study the
sedimentary records of eolian and hydrologic process with atmospheric chemists,
physicists, and meteorologist who study the origin and transport of modern day
aerosol and with those who model modern and ancient aerosol transport. This
interaction will enhance information exchange, assessment of current models, and
lead to new strategies for combining these fields to make more sophisticated
inferences about the nature and causes of climatic change.
