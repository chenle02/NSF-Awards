Educational Broadcasting Corporation (WNET New York) is producing twelve new
programs for the third season of Cyberchase, the first national math series for
children in over a decade. The daily, half-hour programs currently are viewed by
over 1.5 million viewers for each broadcast. The associated website has had over
140 million page views. Summative evaluation of previous seasons has determined
that Cyberchase increases children's positive attitudes about mathematics as
well as their content comprehension and confidence in their problem-solving
skills. In the third season the content of Cyberchase will be enriched by the
addition of more complex mathematics concepts. Grouped by their related NCTM
standard, these include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Number &amp; Operations: Percent,
Zero, Mixed Number Fractions, Factoring&lt;br/&gt;Geometry: Circles,
Perspective, Tessellations, Navigation: Angles and Distance&lt;br/&gt;Algebra:
Body Math (Ratio &amp; Proportion); Mathematical Modeling&lt;br/&gt;Data
Analysis and Probability: Experimental Probability, Stem &amp; Leaf
Plots&lt;br/&gt;Reasoning &amp; Proof: Reasoning&lt;br/&gt;Representation:
Drawing to Scale&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the third season WNET also will
upgrade the web site to offer more math challenges to frequent visitors and will
create math games with varying levels of complexity and challenge to provide
more learning opportunities and to bring children back online more often. In
addition, WNET will intensify the project outreach to key constituencies through
an integrated campaign of community outreach, materials and
promotion.&lt;br/&gt;
