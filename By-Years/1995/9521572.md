Dr. James T. Spencer, Chemistry Department, Syracuse University, is supported by
the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division for the study of the photochemistry of main-group metal cage
compounds. The important photochemical pathways of borane and metallaborane
clusters will be determined and the mechanisms of these processes will be
investigated. This will lead both to a description of the range of
phototransformations available to clusters and to a clearer picture of
fundamental molecular photoprocesses which these molecules will undergo. Light
induced chemical transformations are of extreme importance in several areas of
chemistry. In this study the behavior of boron containing cage molecules, when
irradiated with intense light, will be determined. This will lead both to the
basic `photochemical` behavior of cage type molecules and to advances in the
preparation of new boron containing electronic materials.
