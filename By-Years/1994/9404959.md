9404959 Salesin Global illumination, which simulates the interreflection of
light between surfaces, is one of the most fundamental problems in computer
graphics, with a wide variety of applications. During the award period, the
research will be focused on three critical aspects of the global illumination
problem: (1) Controlled-precision methods -- Global illumination algorithms that
compute tight bounds on the error simultaneously with the simulation will be
developed. These algorithms will be able to direct their computational efforts
into regions where the error is largest, resulting in improvements in both speed
and accuracy. (2) Improving discontinuity meshing -- Incremental discontinuity-
meshing algorithms in which only numerically or visually significant
discontinuities are ever computed will be investigated. Discontinuity meshing
techniques are planned to be extended to curved surfaces. (3) Smooth wavelet
bases for radiosity -- The discontinuity meshing will be combined with the use
of smooth wavelet bases in order to provide accurate, yet sparse,
representations of the light transport between the surfaces of an environment.
