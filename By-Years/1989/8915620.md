Professor Arthur Winfree is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to perform theoretical and experimental studies
on excitable media. Excitable media are chemical systems which respond
dramatically to a stimulus that exceeds some threshold. These studies have a far
reaching impact on such diverse applications as: transmission of nerve impulses,
heart muscle contraction including lethal arrhythmias, and burn stability in
solid-fuel rockets. In the laboratory and in supercomputers Winfree studies wave
geometry in excitable media whose equations are well enough known to permit
critical comparison between laboratory measurements and computer simulations. In
particular he studies the self-organizing behavior of such 3-dimensional media
which resembles vortex ring formation in fluids. In theory, these organizing
centers exist in a variety of topologically distinct forms, some of which may be
dynamically stable for certain characteristic sizes. The well-known Belousov-
Zhabotinsky chemical reaction has been used as a synthetic model system to
experimentally confirm numerically simulated results.
