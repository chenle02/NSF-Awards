9301940 Owen This Americas Program award will support a research collaboration
between Prof. Guillermo Owen of Texas Tech University, and Prof. Cornelio
Sanchez-Hernandez of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM) and
Prof. Ricardo Lopez Wilchis of the Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana in
Iztapalapa, Mexico. The purpose of the research is to conduct biodiversity
studies in Michoacan, the western end of the transverse volcanic belt of
southern Mexico. The principal investigator and his collaborators will conduct a
survey of mammals, and their ectoparasitic arthropods, focusing on questions of
regional biodiversity and biogeography. Combined genetic, morphological,
karyotypic, and ectoparasitic data from each specimen will provide a powerful
tool for evaluating systematic and biogeographic phenomena from an evolutionary
perspective. ***
