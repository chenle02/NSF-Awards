This award supports participation in the Rutgers Geometric Analysis Conference
held May 16-20, 2022, on the College Avenue Campus of Rutgers, The State
University of New Jersey, New Brunswick. The conference is a five-day meeting
with a one-day summer school comprising three mini-courses and four days of
research talks by twenty-one leading mathematicians from the United States and
Europe. The scientific themes of the event include geometric analysis,
mathematical physics, and applications to low-dimensional topology and
symplectic geometry. The participants will interact with a distinguished and
diverse group of mathematical leaders and rising stars. The conference aims to
generate transfers of knowledge, new collaborations, and a cross-fertilization
of ideas, and further inspire graduate students and early-career
mathematicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There has been exciting recent progress in
geometric analysis, mathematical physics, and applications to low-dimensional
topology and symplectic geometry. For example, geometric flows are of great
current interest due to their many applications. For Ricci flow, there has been
progress in understanding the structure of solutions, their singularities, their
asymptotic limits, and uniqueness. Flows starting from more general initial data
(for example, a metric space, or a manifold with unbounded curvature, or an
incomplete metric) are becoming better understood. An improved understanding of
Ricci flow may lead to advances in areas such as general relativity, string
theory, low-dimensional topology, and renormalization in quantum field theory.
Further study of mean curvature flow may lead to advances in general relativity,
image processing, material science, and minimal surfaces. The meeting will bring
together experts at the frontier of research in these areas from around the
world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference website is:
