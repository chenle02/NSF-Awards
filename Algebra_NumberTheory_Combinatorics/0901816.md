The PIs will study higher secant varieties of classically studied varieties such
as Segre varieties, Grassmann varieties, and Segre-Veronese varieties. These
varieties correspond to parameter spaces for rank one tensors, alternating
tensors, and hybrids of regular tensors and symmetric tensors, and their
(closed) higher secant varieties correspond to compactifications of the
parameter spaces for higher rank tensors. The main goal of the research is the
classification of defective secant varieties of Segre varieties, Grassmann
varieties and Segre-Veronese varieties. This is analogous to the celebrated
theorem of Alexander and Hirschowitz, which asserts that higher secant varieties
of Veronese varieties have the expected dimension (modulo a fully described list
of exceptions). This work completed the Waring problem for polynomials which had
stood for some time as an outstanding unsolved problem. There is a
corresponding, conjectural complete list of defective secant varieties for Segre
varieties and for Grassmann varieties. The first component of the project is on
the refinement of existing methods and the development of new theoretical and
algorithmic methods towards the solution of this classification problem. The
second component of the project is concerned with decomposition of tensors.

In many applications, it is natural to represent a collection of data as a
multi-indexed list. Alternatively, one can think of the data as a
multidimensional array (sometimes called a multi-way array). For example, a
digital grayscale picture can be stored as a matrix of numbers where each pixel
location in the picture corresponds to a location in the matrix and the number
in the matrix corresponds to the darkness of the pixel. In a similar manner, a
digital color picture can be stored as a three dimensional array of numbers. A
mathematical framework that includes the study of multi-way arrays, and their
representations as sums of more basic objects, is through parameter spaces of
tensors. This project explores problems related to tensors, tensor
decomposition, tensor rank and tensor border rank from an algebro-geometric
point viewpoint. These subjects have significant applications in fields as
diverse as signal processing, data analysis, computational biology,
combinatorics, algebraic geometry and statistics. It is the expectation,
therefore, that techniques developed through this research will advance our
knowledge and understanding across multiple disciplines.
