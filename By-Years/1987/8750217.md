The Biology Department is involved in a four-phase program to expand the
instrumentation of its Cellular and Molecular Biology laboratories. Phase one
was completed by the institution; this project is covering the second phase
which involves procurement of an ultracentrifuge, electrophoresis equipment,
photographic equipment, a uv/visible spectrophotometer, a CO2 incubator, and an
ion-free reagent water system. This equipment enables undergraduates to perform
expanded laboratory experiments and individual projects in cell fractionation;
protein, DNA and RNA separations; transfers of proteins and nucleic acids for
testing and analysis (Southern, Northern, and Western blots); quantitative
determination of proteins and nucleic acids; autoradiography; DNA sequencing;
restriction digests of nucleic acids; and cloning of restriction fragments. A
new course in Molecular Genetics is being offered, while major laboratory
segments of Advanced Cell Biology and Developmental Biology are being expanded.
Subtantial laboratory exercises also are being added to coursework in
Microbiology, Genetics, Biochemistry, and Immunology. Students are gaining
vastly expanded experience with current techniques and equipment used in Protein
and Nucleic Acid Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics.
