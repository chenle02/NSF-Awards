Description: This proposal supports the collaboration of Dr. Deborah Goodings,
University of Maryland and Dr. Erol Guler, University of Bogazici. Project
funding will allow Dr. Guler to spend eight months in Dr. Goodings laboratory in
order to collaborate on a series of geotechnical centrifuge models investigating
the effects on geotextile reinforced retaining walls. Research results may bring
about new design techniques for less expensive construction of retaining walls.
Scope: This proposal will bring together research scientists from the
universities of two countries working in the area of geotechnical centrifuge
models. It is anticipated that this collaborative research will result in the
development of new design techniques for retaining walls. Dr. Guler will have an
opportunity to familiarize himself with research equipment that is presently not
available in his university. Therefore, this proposal fulfils objectives of the
Science in Developing Countries Program in its exchange and transfer of
scientific knowledge through an international collaboration.
