This two-year award is on the function of the vestibular system of the inner
ear, used for balance. The semicircular canals of the vestibular system are
fluid-filled ducts in the head. When the head is rotated, the fluid in each
canal shifts, and stimulates mechanosensory cells called hair cells. The
activity of these cells then stimulates the neurons (nerve cells) of the
vestibular nerve to the brain. The neurons are sensitive over a very wide
frequency range of head movements, and also show some decrease in activity, or
adaptation, to high frequency or high intensity stimuli. This project will test
the responses of the canal nerves for stimuli representing various frequencies
of head oscillations (from 0.01 per second to nearly 100 per second). This wide
stimulus range will establish the limits of current bioengineering models of the
vestibular syste in a way which has only been touched on by other experiments.
The wide range of stimuli is important to many animals, but pigeons provide an
excellent model because they receive very low frequencies of swaying perches in
trees, to the very high frequencies of air turbulence in fast flight. Both
rotational stimulation and direct mechanical stimulation of the canals will be
used, and nerve activity recorded. The mathematical transfer function that
relates nerve sensitivity to stimulus frequency will be determined, and the
degree of adaptation across frequencies will be measured. The results will allow
determination of an important parameter in vestibular mechanics, the value of
the short time constant, which has not yet been established for warm- blooded
vertebrates. This work is a novel approach that has some technical challenges,
but should have high impact on a sensory system that is not yet well understood.
