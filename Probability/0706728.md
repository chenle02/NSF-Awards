One of the primary concerns of this proposal is to develop, systematically,
geometric methods for analysis of random fields and stochastic differential
equations. Special emphasis is placed on Gaussian, stable, and Levy random
fields such as the Brownian sheet, additive Levy processes, and solutions of
stochastic partial differential equations driven by Gaussian or Levy noises.
These are random fields that arise naturally in many areas of mathematics,
applied mathematics, mathematical oceanography, turbulence, stochastic
hydrology, geostatistics, spatial statistics, and mathematical physics. The
proposed research intends to gather and develop probabilistic, analytic,
algebraic, and geometric tools that lead to a deeper understanding of the
geometry of random fields and stochastic partial differential equations. The
Proposers believe that these tools will be novel enough to solve a number of
open problems on random fields. The Proposers also believe that the program
developed herein will help promote the future applicability of these and related
mathematical methods in the aforementioned areas.
