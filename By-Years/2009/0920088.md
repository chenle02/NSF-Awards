the major selective force leading to parent-of-origin influences on gene
expression in mammals and seed-bearing plants. Genes central to the molecular
interaction of conflicting entities show extraordinarily rapid rates of
evolution. The maternal/fetal relationship in livebearing animals has been
likened to a host/parasite interaction since the fetus is generally only half
related to the mother. The paternal genome, therefore, is in a unique position
to influence the level of maternal provisioning by driving adaptive change at
the maternal/fetal interface. Placentation in poeciliid fishes has evolved
independently in numerous recently diverged lineages. Broad scale examination of
the genetic changes accompanying the adaptation to placentation will provide
unique insights into the mutational mechanisms underlying the evolution of a
developmental program. The PIs will employ transformative molecular genetics
approaches to identify genes that have undergone adaptive changes leading from
yolk-provisioned to maternal provisioned embryogenesis. By using next generation
sequencing technology, otherwise known as massively parallel sequencing, the PIs
will produce full gene activity information for species with vastly different
reproductive strategies in an effort to identify the consequences of genomic
conflict on genes involved in fetal growth regulation. In addition to the
genomics resources this work will provide for the Poeciliidae, the proposed
experiments offer educational and training opportunities for post-doctoral,
post-graduate, undergraduate and high school students from diverse backgrounds.
