The conference "Workshop on High Dimensional Topology" will be held at the
University of Notre Dame on December 7 and 8, 2012. The core problem in high
dimensional topology is the classification of manifolds through the technique of
surgery theory. This involves techniques from a wide spectrum of mathematics,
including algebra, algebraic topology, differential geometry, analysis, and
geometric group theory. A key theme is topological rigidity, especially the
Borel conjecture and related topics such as equivariant rigidity and the
Farrell-Jones Conjecture.

The conference will feature cutting-edge lectures from mathematicians in the
field. One of the talks in the conference will survey the work of Frank
Connolly, one of the leading experts in the field. There have been several
conferences recently in Europe on high dimensional topology, but a conspicuous
lack of domestic conferences. The workshop will give the opportunity for
professional mathematicians and graduate studies to discuss current
developments.
