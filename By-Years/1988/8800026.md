The atmosphere at mesospheric and lower thermospheric levels (80 to 120 km
altitude) is continually subject to the disturbance of waves passing through the
region, including diurnal and semidiurnal tides, planetary waves, and gravity
waves originating at tropospheric levels which propagate upward with
exponentially increasing amplitude, as the atmospheric density exponentially
decreases with height. The wave activity affects the chemical reactions
producing airglow in several layers in the region, and it is possible to study
the wave properties (wavelength, direction of propagation, amplitude, etc.) and
sometimes infer sources, by ground based observations of the airglow emissions
at night using photometers and allsky imaging cameras. This award is to initiate
a program of such observations at an undergraduate institution, in cooperation
with researchers at other institutions using complementary radio and optical
equipment. The training of undergraduate students in atmospheric science, and
the arousal of their interest in a possible research career, are added benefits
of the activity.
