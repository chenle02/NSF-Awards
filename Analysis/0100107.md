A major part of the success in the linear and quasilinear theory of partial
differential equations is based upon interpreting derivatives in the generalized
sense of distributions, allowing for a more powerful calculus. However,
Distributions do not seem, in general, well suited to non-linear problems
because they cannot be multiplied. "Jets" are generalized (local) pointwise
derivatives that allow for the interpretation and calculation of non-linear
functions of derivatives. In this proposal, the PI presents a project to extend
the notion of jets from the Euclidean or Riemannian case to more general state
spaces. Typically, in these spaces higher derivatives with respect different
parameters do not commute, as in the Euclidean case, but rather satisfy more
complicated algebraic relations. Jets adapted to the geometry of a state space
endowed with a family of vector fields satisfying a non-degeneracy condition are
called "subelliptic jets". Basic analysis topics like Taylor developments and
maximum principles have to be adapted to conform to the new subelliptic
geometry. The PI proposes to study Hamilton-Jacobi equations, to provide with a
natural approximation procedure for semi-continuous functions, and to explore
notions of "subelliptic convexity" to help formulate appropriate second
derivative subelliptic estimates. The derivative is a basic tool in mathematical
analysis, used to measure the growth and decay of functions. Knowledge of the
derivative of a function allows for its recovery by means of integration. When
trying to model complex scientific phenomena it is often necessary to write down
equations satisfied by derivatives, and derivatives of derivatives, of functions
with respect to several parameters. These equations are called partial
differential equations. If these equations are linear, a well developed theory
exists to study their solutions. Much less in known in the more interesting case
of nonlinear equations, although when the state space is Euclidean, there is
vast fully-nonlinear theory developed in the last twenty years. However, in
applications coming from Control Theory, Robotics and Finance, very often we
find derivatives which do not commute. The analysis of nonlinear operator of
these derivatives is the main object of this project. The significance of this
proposal relies in the interconnection between areas of classical mathematical
analysis and applied mathematics as well as the use of computational tools not
available until now in mathematical analysis.
