In order to meet the increasing demand in Virginia for a workforce skilled in
using geospatial technologies, three Virginia Community Colleges (Virginia
Western Community College, Tidewater Community College, and John Tyler Community
College), with the support of the Virginia Community College System (VCCS) in
partnership with the Virginia Geospatial Extension Program (VGEP) and the
Virginia Space Grant Consortium (VSGC), are creating model academic pathways at
community colleges and providing faculty professional development to spread the
use of geospatial technology across Virginia. The GTEVCC project team is
building on a planning project that resulted in the formation of this
partnership with each partner bringing resources and strengths to the project.
The GTEVCC project is establishing sustainable academic pathways in geospatial
technology at three VCCS colleges to provide Virginia employers with a larger
pool of skilled geospatial technicians. These pathways serve as models for other
community colleges. The GTEVCC project is taking an interdisciplinary approach
to geospatial technology and applications of technology. Educational materials
are being created and professional development and mentoring is being provided
for faculty. The GTEVCC project team is partnering with the ATE National GeoTech
Center (NGTC) to leverage exemplary geospatial educational materials and best
practices in needs assessments, career awareness and professional development.
