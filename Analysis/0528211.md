ABSTRACT In recent years considerable progress on the interaction between
harmonic analysis and ergodic theory has taken place, which benefited both
fields. The proposed conference on harmonic analysis and ergodic theory, which
will be held at DePaul University, Chicago, December 2-4, 2005, will focus on
that interaction. The main talks will be delivered by distinguished
mathematicians and top researchers in both fields, who will highlight, among
other things, some of the new ergodic theory techniques used in harmonic
analysis and vice versa. In order to give graduate students and junior
researchers working in one of the areas an opportunity to learn about the other
area, we will offer two mini-courses during the conference, one on harmonic
analysis and the other on ergodic theory. The courses will be taught by two
distinguished experts. The conference will serve as a meeting ground for
harmonic analysts and ergodic theorists and provide a forum for mutual
collaboration between experts in the two fields. In addition, it will give
graduate students and young investigators a chance to interact scientifically
with specialists of similar interests. The conference will have a positive
impact on the scientific community in general, and the mathematical community in
particular, because it will give graduate students and junior researchers, who
will shape the future of the filed, a chance to learn about new topics and how
to apply them in their own research.
