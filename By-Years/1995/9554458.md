9554458 The project will conduct a regional self-study to determine optimum
strategies to accomplish systemic educational reform and economic development in
a region characterized by high poverty and lack of resources. The principal
investigator has established a coalition among American Indian education
centers, tribal education boards, reservations, state agencies and NSF systemic
initiatives in the region that includes California, Nevada and Arizona. The
development phase will result in an implementation plan that addresses the
barriers faced by American Indian students in the region, and capitalizes on
opportunities to create community based support for equitable access to science,
mathematics, engineering and technology education. The strategies employed will
include local, regional and multi-State conferences, bringing together the key
education and community stakeholders. ***
