This project is upgrading a Computer Aided Manufacturing laboratory by
integrating training level CNC machines, computers, peripheral equipment, and
related instrumentation and software. The expanded laboratory is providing a
broad based, multistation, hands-on experience in the CAM and Robotics
curriculum. Students are being educated in a modern manufacturing laboratory
setup through laboratory experiments, design projects, special study courses,
and funded and unfunded research projects sponsored by local industries and
agencies. This project is being matched by an amount equal to the award.
