This project is providing a modern, safe steam autoclave for the sterilization
of culture media and supplies used in the teaching of microbiology to
undergraduates, most of whom are Hispanic women. The acquisition of a new modern
steam autoclave provides the department with a more efficient and reliable means
of preparing bacteriological culture media. This improvement benefits the
students enrolled in microbiology courses by providing them with the required
materials for instruction in the culture and identification of microorganisms.
The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal sum obtained
from non-Federal sources.
