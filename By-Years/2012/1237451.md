Abstract #1237451 Zelikoff, Judith

This proposal, submitted under the NSF/FDA Scholar-in-Residence at FDA Program,
seeks to provide mentoring activities for an NYU postdoctoral scholar to conduct
scientific research at the FDA (Center for Devices and Radiological Health) on
the development/validation of immune response assays useful as early indicators
for nanomaterial (NM)-induced toxicity associated with medical device
applications. Use of engineered NM for medical devices is rapidly growing.
Currently, silver (Ag) nanoparticles (NP) are used for medical device
applications(i.e., in wound dressings and catheter coatings) to prevent
infections. FDA is also faced with metal oxide NP derived as wear debris from
orthopedic implants. Metal-on-metal hip replacement devices made from surgical
cobalt-chromium (Co-Cr) alloy, have been shown to release Co and Cr NP by wear
mechanisms into the body. Despite clinical assumptions that after the removal of
worn hip replacements level of metal ions in the tissue/blood decrease,
uncertainty remains about long-term health consequences of these metal
particles.
