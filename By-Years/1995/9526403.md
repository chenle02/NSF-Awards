9526403 Grew The proposed research is to study the mineralogy and petrology of
certain carriers of boron in order to assess their role in the behavior of boron
during high-grade metamorphism, migmatism and anatexis. The carriers to be
studied include tourmaline, muscovite, sillimanite, kornerupine, grandidierite,
and werdingite in metapelites in Western Maine. Special emphasis will be on
assessing the role of aqueous fluid and anatectic melt in removing boron
released by tourmaline breakdown. major element compositions will be determined
by electron microprobe, Fe+2 and Fe+3 by Mossbauer spectroscopy, H in bulk
samples by uranium extraction, H zoning by 15N reaction, bulk and microscopic B,
Li and F microscopic measurements by ion microprobe. Results from this study
will provide a detailed understanding of the B budget during high-grade
metamorphism and provide important insights into the processes by which
crystalline terranes are formed.
