The goal of this project is to study automated reasoning in elementary geometry,
differential geometry, and mechanics as an extension of our previous and current
work. It covers not only theorem proving, but also formula derivation. In each
of these three areas, the following research will be conducted: (1) to improve
existing proving techniques; (2) To further study mechanical formula derivation;
(3) to collect a significant number of worked examples; (4) to improve Ritt-
Wu's decomposition algorithm and other key algorithms; (5) to combine Ritt-Wu's
method with Collins' method in elementary geometry; (6) to release an automated
reasoning system; (7) to study practical applications of our techniques to areas
such as kinematic synthesis of linkages and mechanisms, CAD/CAM, etc; (8) to
study theoretical issues related to our techniques.
