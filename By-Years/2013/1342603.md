Intellectual Merit: The objective of this EAGER project is to profile the
dynamic interactions between circadian oscillator protein compleesx and other
cellular machineries by using mass spectrometry-based proteomics and Drosophila
melanogaster as a model. This project is to develop foundational data to probe
the dynamic rewiring of the circadian interactome necessary for biological
timekeeping. Looking ahead, results from this project will lay the foundation
for (i) functional characterization of new clock components, and (ii)
comparative protein network analysis of the circadian interactomes in multiple
species with distinct clock designs. This comparison coupled with rigorous
mathematical approaches will highlight network rewiring and differential
interactions that can reflect inherent flexibility and adaptability of the clock
network.

Broader Impacts: Circadian biology is a fascinating topic that people of all
ages and backgrounds can relate to, as circadian clocks regulate physiological
processes that are of interest to many, and therefore represents a perfect
platform for science education. The PI and her colleagues developed a multi-
faceted plan to use insect circadian rhythms to educate and inspire future
generations of scientists of all ages and engage the general public. This
project will also provide cross-disciplinary training and career development
opportunities for graduate students, undergraduates, and high school teachers.
