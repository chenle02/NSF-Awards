Abstract: GOALI Tribology of Nanocomposites



This collaborative proposal between the University of Florida (W.G. Sawyer),
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (L.S. Schadler) and Albany International (G.
Toney) teams a tribologist and a materials scientist with a company focused on
developing nanomaterials with improved wear behavior.



1.0 Intellectual Merit



The overall scientific goal of the project is to gain fundamental understanding
of the wear mechanisms in filled polymers by: a) experimentally isolating the
effects of particle size (10 nm to 10 um), particle aspect ratio (1 to 1000),
dispersion, filler / matrix interface, and matrix properties on performance, b)
obtaining a parametric understanding of the correlation between wear behavior
and other mechanical properties, and c) modeling of the wear properties. Polymer
nanocomposites significantly improve the tribological performance when compared
to traditional filled polymers. It is unclear for non-lubricious nanoparticles
what the mechanism is that lowers the coefficient of friction. Finally,
nanoparticle filled polymers have not been comprehensively explored for wear
applications despite evidence suggesting large improvements in performance.



2.0 Broader Impacts



The impact of these new materials in polymeric bearings will be broad, covering
the spectrum from industrial applications needing dry sliding bearings, to
orthopaedic implant materials, to self-lubricating bearings for space
environments. An indication of the industrial interest in this field is the
support of Albany International for this work (~$60K). They are supporting a
full time graduate student at Rensselaer and have also supplied funds to Florida
for wear testing. They will be hiring a graduate student into a co-op position
in order to transfer technology developed by Florida and Rensselaer and provide
industrial experience for the student. Students will travel between both
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy NY and the University of Florida in
Gainesville FL to broaden their knowledge in the synthesizing and processing of
nano-particles and composites and tribological testing and modeling,
respectively.
