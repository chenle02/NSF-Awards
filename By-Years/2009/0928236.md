can the labor movement reverse the decline in union density? Some labor
activists suggest that mergers may help to slow, if not reverse, the decline.
Mergers, they argue, streamline unions, enabling them to organize and bargain
more effectively. Merger critics disagree; if implemented incorrectly, mergers
could decrease the rights of members and locals and ultimately weaken unions.
This dissertation uses archival data to examine the determinants and outcomes of
mergers. Three types of data inform this project: 1) data on union
characteristics for each union from 1886-2000; 2) each merger agreement and
constitutional clauses for each union before and after each merger; and 3) case
study analysis of two unions as they merge over time. The project has several
theoretical objectives. First, it links literature in labor studies and
organization theory by extending theory that is typically applied to firms to
democratic organizations. Second, it evaluates the relationship between mergers
and the decline/growth of unions. Finally, it assesses how mergers have impacted
the leadership roles of women and minorities. The broader impacts of this
project are to provide an analysis of the consequences of mergers, in terms of
the size, rank and file participation, and diversity among leaders. By making
this research publicly available, labor activists will have empirical,
historical evidence on which to inform their decisions. Moreover, the depth,
breadth, and longitudinal quality of this dataset will provide scholars with a
new dataset, thus contributing to future studies.&lt;br/&gt;
