9223088 Davis The principal investigator will work on the development of
parallel alllgorithms, tools, and data structures for large irregular problems
arising in computational science. The solution of large, sparse, unsymmetric
systems of equations is an an example of one such problem. It forms a critical
componment of many solutions to scientific problems, and yet has an irregular
nature that limits its performance on a wide range of current high performance
computers: parallel-vector shared- memory computers (i.e., Cray), distributed-
memory computers (i.e., Ncube, Intl), and pipelined, RISC-based workstations
(i.e., IBM RS/6000, SUN SParc/10). All of these computers have a complexx memory
hierarchy to take advantage of the regular memory addressing patterns that are
present in many scientific codes. This regular pattern is not presentin typical
factorization algorithms for unsymmatic sparse matrices. Addressing this problem
will require the use of dense matrix kernels with regular memory addressing
behavior, and high- performamce cocurrent data structures that allow the
remaining irregular behavior to be carried out in as an efficient manner as
possible. ***
