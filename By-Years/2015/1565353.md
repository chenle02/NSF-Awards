This award provides funding for the "Conference on Analysis and Geometry," to be
held at Princeton University from January 26 to 29,
2016.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on recent developments in
analysis, especially in the fields of harmonic analysis, partial differential
equations, and geometric analysis. A number of distinguished mathematicians have
agreed to attend and speak at this conference. The award gives early career
researchers, researchers who are members of underrepresented groups, researchers
not funded by NSF a chance to attend and participate in this conference. The
organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to
target groups through a number of different activities. More information will be
made available
