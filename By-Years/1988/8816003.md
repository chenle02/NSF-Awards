The objective of this research is to investigate the feasibility of producing
model foreign gene products, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) or
>-glucuronidase (gus), from genetically modified tobacco cell culture, Nicotiana
tabacum. The production of cat or gus enzymes will be monitored in batch, semi-
batch, and continuous bio-reactors, and optimum conditions will be determined.
The stability of the genetically modified plant cells will be tested in long-
term continuous operations. Plant cells can be grown in a liquid solution
containing sugar and other ingredients, which may be employed for the production
of important plant products, such as pharmaceuticals, flavors, and pigments. The
long-term objectives of this proposed research are to genetically engineer plant
cells to produce valuable pharmaceutical products and to develop an economically
viable, industrial-scale process suitable for production. As a first step, the
study will examine the feasibility of producing model protein products from
genetically altered plant cell culture in a laboratory-scale fermenter system.
