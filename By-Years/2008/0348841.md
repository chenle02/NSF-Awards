The National Academy of Sciences, through their Committee on Science Education,
will oversee a research synthesis on children's science learning in grades K-8.
The proposal makes the case that there has not yet been a study of this kind
that pulls together research from multiple disciplines (science content,
learning theory in the cognitive sciences, developmental psychology, social
psychology and anthropology) and incorporates research from the standards
movement along with the impact of accountability at all levels of the education
system. The study proposes to address the following questions:&lt;br/&gt;1. What
does a comprehensive picture of how children acquire scientific ideas look
like?&lt;br/&gt;2. How can this comprehensive understanding be helpful to
advancing goals around student achievement and equity in opportunities to learn
science? How can this knowledge help advance the design of science
assessments?&lt;br/&gt;3. What other lines of research need to be pursued to
make our understanding about how students learn science more
complete?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An NRC study committee that reflects a
multidisciplinary perspective and includes expertise in science and science
education, cognitive psychology, child development, learning theory, education
policy and education research will carry out the study. The work will be
conducted through commissioned papers and workshops. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
work will be analyzed and synthesized into an NRC report. The NRC is working
with the Merck Institute for Science Education about providing a shorter, more
policy-oriented document to accompany the full-length report. It is anticipated
the report will be of interest to educators, researchers and
policymakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
