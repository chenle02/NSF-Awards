This research focuses on the recovery of solvent vapors by vacuum swing
adsorption on activated carbon. The effects of high concentration, high
humidity, multicomponents and other factors on performance will be examined
experimentally. In support of the experiments, dynamic models are to be
developed that simulate the vacuum swing adsorption-solvent vapor recovery
process. Effective methods for the removal of solvent vapors are important to
assuring the health and safety of employees in the workplace and to addressing
environmental concerns.
