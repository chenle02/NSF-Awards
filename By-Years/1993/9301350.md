9301350 Marotske This project will focus on a model to estimate the
climatological annual cycle of the Indian Ocean from hydrographic, current meter
and altimetric data. The observations would be synthesized using a general
circulation model (GCM), with the adjoint of the GCM used to drive the model
toward the data. The techniques to be developed are intended to provide a
complete estimation framework for the synthesis of field data to be acquired in
the planned Indian Ocean Expedition, which is part of the World Ocean
Circulation Experiment (WOCE). Further, it will provide a basin-scale prototype
of the estimation studies needed to synthesize the entire global WOCE data set.
