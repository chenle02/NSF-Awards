The proposed project provides an option for fulfilling general education
requirements which is an alternative to traditional General Biology/General
Chemistry/Pnysical Science courses. Ferrum College will institute a series of
courses called the Science 2000 Progra designed primarily to help non-science
majors develop confidence and competence in dealing with scientific issues. The
approach recognized the importance of incorporating knowledge of student
learning styles and motivation into science teaching. For the general education
science requirement represents the capstone of a student's science education,
not an introduction to a scientific discipline. The student should leave such
courses understanding nature of scientific inquiry and the ability of scienc eto
address meaningful issues and concerns. This grant will assist faculty in
developing and implementing the philosophy of the course through summer
workshops and release time to concentrate on course development and to interact
and assist each other in developint the new approach.
