Stereotypes can have profound implications for how individuals are viewed and
the opportunities they have. It is often presumed that the stereotypes people
hold are simple, but they are not. The stereotypes people use to understand
others are often quite complex. Understanding this nuance therefore has
important implications both for creating stronger empirical models of
stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination processes and for reducing instances
of stereotyping and discrimination. The proposed research investigates the
nuanced manner in which social perceivers think about and behave towards others
using information about age, sex, race, and features of the local circumstances
in which people live (e.g., the availability and predictability of economic
resources in their communities). This approach suggests novel ways of reducing
the application of many of the most pernicious stereotypes to members of
minority groups, and thus for reducing discrimination against
them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is grounded in life history theory, a
conceptual framework from the biological sciences, which highlights the roles
that age and sex, in interaction with the local ecology, play in shaping
people's goals, capacities, and behavioral strategies. Life history theory can
therefore be usefully applied to help explain why people so readily use age,
sex, and race to understand others, and why people possess many of the specific
stereotypes they do. Hypotheses developed from this framework will be tested in
a series of studies, employing multiple methods including national surveys and
laboratory experiments. This research expands theory in innovative,
transformative ways; provides rigorous empirical tests of novel, theoretically-
derived hypotheses, employing a variety of methods; suggests novel interventions
for reducing the extent to which stereotypes are applied to individuals; and
makes important, integrative connections between the social and biological
sciences, strengthening each.
