Oligodendrocytes play a supportive role for neurons within the central nervous
system. These cells appear to be sensitive to neurotoxic agents when challenged
in vivo, showing abnormal changes in intracellular organelles-mitochondria,
Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum-that play a significant role in normal metabolic
functions of these cells. The substances of interest here are L-pyroglutamic
acid, the internal amide of L-glutamic acid; and the the tripeptide thyrotrop in
releasing hormone ?pGlu-His-Pro-NH2! (Rieke, et al., 1984). Although these
agents appear to induce pathology in oligodendrocytes, it remains uncertain
whether oligodendrocytes are destroyed by such agents. Oligodendrocytes can be
raised in vitro in cultures where they are the principal cell present. Cultures
will be exposed to the test substances for periods up to 20 days. After exposure
to the test substance the tissue will be fixed and processed for electron
microscopy. It will be examined to determine the test substance-induced
pathology and whether oligodendrocytes can recover following exposure to these
substances. These experiments will provide the preliminary data needed to
pinpoint the intracellular site of activity of these agents and establish their
use as probes for nerve cell activity in culture.
