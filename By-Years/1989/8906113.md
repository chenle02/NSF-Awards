Observations have shown that orography significantly affects atmospheric fronts
- their strength, propagation and precipitation - but the dynamics of the
interaction between a front and orography are still not well understood. In
particular, the interaction of the mountain and a front in the presence of a
developing baroclinic system has not been investigated. Under this grant, the
principal investigator will use a primitive equation numerical model to explore
the dynamics of this interaction and to isolate the physical processes involved.
The cold front will be forced by the shearing deformation associated with the
nonlinear evolution of a baroclinic wave. The inclusion of temperature gradients
provides a more realistic scenario than has been explored previously. The
effects of mountain size and atmospheric stability, both in the presence and
absence of moisture, will be investigated as well as the role of boundary
processes and their effect on the vertical motion field. Finally, the principal
investigator will study the effect of the mountains on precipitation associated
with the front.***
