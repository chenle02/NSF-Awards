"Symposium H: 3D Nanoengineered Assemblies", to be held in the context of the
2002 Materials Research Society (MRS) Fall Meeting in Boston, MA, during
December 2-6, 2002. The Symposium will provide a forum for scientific and
technical exchange to advance the practice and progress of nanoengineering in
three dimensions. The symposium will explore 3-D processing techniques with the
promise to transport or modify material on the nanometer scale, as alternatives
to conventional 2-D techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technologies to be
addressed include soft lithography, self assembly, biological or biomimetic-
based processing, atomic manipulation using scanning probes, as well as non-
contact methods such as holography, nonlinear optical processes, particle beam
material interactions, and materials manipulation with an eye on developing 3-D
nanoengineered systems and embedded 3-D nanostructures with nanometer scale
resolution.
