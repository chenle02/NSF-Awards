This grant addresses various issues related to non- linear charge transport in
one dimensional artificial structures in a temperature range from liquid helium
to higher temperature. We will focus on basic and high field transport
properties in highly quantized systems with special emphasis on electron-phonon
interaction, intersubband and real space transfer effects. The research employs
an integrated theoretical and experimental approach which involves tools and
technologies developed by our group at the University of Illinois.
