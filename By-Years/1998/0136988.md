Received theories of regional growth stress the role of firms and managers in
making location decisions. In contrast, this research project investigates
whether an occupational rather than an industrial approach might better explain
regional growth differentials. The occupational approach emphasizes the causal
role of human capital, especially as key generative occupations. Skilled workers
of all sorts are less linked to specific industries than in the past, exhibit
considerable inter-regional mobility and may provide a better vantage point from
which to assess entrepreneurial potential than does the traditional reliance
upon industries in regional analysis. To identify occupations key to regional
development, the research effort uses four attributes: capturability, growth
potential, cross-fertilization and entrepreneurship. Using federal and state
level data on occupations, the effort will identify generative occupations for
each of a set of US metropolitan areas and test hypotheses regarding the
contribution of each to overall growth performance. It will also compare the
results of an occupational approach to traditional industrial
approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research results will contribute
methodological innovations to comparative regional growth analysis, expand the
state of knowledge on the composition of regional economies and offer economic
development practitioners an additional tool for guiding metropolitan growth and
development. Billions of dollars have been spent by state and local governments
in attempts to attract and retain firms, with mixed results. Encouraging the
development of key occupations by working with the institutions that create and
organize them (e.g. schools, colleges and Universities, training programs,
professional associations) might prove a more economical and effective way of
anchoring economic activity in regions than targeting industrial sectors. This
research is designed to test the theoretical underpinnings of this novel
approach to economic development.&lt;br/&gt;
