The workshop advances the science of science and innovation policy by linking
basic research in an array of disciplines to urgent public policy questions
related to the changing nature of work. The workshop advances the development of
the research community focused on understanding more fully the nature of
production of societal value. The workshop introduces new data and research-
based insights into policy debates about the future of work. The workshop
nurtures a new data and structure rich analysis that have the potential to
improve science and innovation policy.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The production
algorithm refers to the processes for turning ideas into goods and services. A
culinary recipe is an example: it is a means for turning ingredients into a
meal. The advance of the algorithmic frontier refers to improvements in
production algorithms that occur over time. This workshop brings together a
multi-disciplinary team of researchers involved with the relationship between
the advance of the algorithmic frontier, the changing nature of human work and
the potential for inclusive opportunity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
