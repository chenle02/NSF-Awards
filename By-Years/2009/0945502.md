This SBIR Phase I project will demonstrate that a novel thermodynamic cycle
could enable a 50% improvement in conversion efficiency from geothermal and
concentrated solar sources when the two are synergistically combined.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of the proposed project could be as
much as a 50% improvement in system efficiency and the enabling of a new
paradigm for geothermal and concentrated solar power.&lt;br/&gt;
