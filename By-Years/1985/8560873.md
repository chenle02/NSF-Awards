An automated crop assessment method based upon a photo-diode array sensor and a
micro-computer analyzer is examined. This method exploits the visual damage
patterns, from biological infestations, found on the leaves of the crop. Current
techniques take a leaf sample along a field diagonal for laboratory analysis,
after a problem is determined. This method, because of its reliance upon the
farmer visually detecting crop damage, gives pathogens a change to become
established. Once established, the extensive use of expansive wide area
fungicides, herbicides, and pesticides is required to eradicate the pathogen.
The fungus Verticillium Albo-atrum will be used because of its well-documented
effects on leaves and its ease-of-handling. Objectivess are (1) to determine the
ability of an automated sensor to detect Verticillium Albo-atrum, (2) to
determine the automated sensors' resolution requirements; and (3) to determine
the sensors performance in relation to human beings.
