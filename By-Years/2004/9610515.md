9610515 Liu The main objective of this conference is to provide a forum for
researchers and industrial practitioners from all over the world to: review the
state of the art; exchange ideas; transfer to knowledge gained to industry for
applications; and ascertain the important industrial problems so that research
progress can be aimed in relevant directions. PIs expect all US researchers to
benefit by establishing world-wide contact with individuals from this rapidly
growing region of the Pacific Rim and Australia who share their research
interests. It will be especially beneficial for young US researchers who will
see, perhaps for the first time, the larger context into which their work fits.
