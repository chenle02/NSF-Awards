Cultures with traditional religions change as they come in contact with
proselytizing religions. This project will explore the process and effect of
religious change in the St. Lawrence Island Yupik community of Sivuqaq (Gambell,
Alaska) and analyze the degree to which change from traditional religious
practices to Protestant Christianity has been incorporated into Yupik Eskimo
ethnic identity. This project addresses the nature of the conversion process as
well as the place of Christian religious practices in contemporary Sivuqaq
identity. Using a combination of ethnohistorical, ethnographic and textual
analytical methods, the student will look at the relationship between social
practice, historical process and cultural mediation. This project will
contribute to the important current debate on the role of Christianity and
missionization in the incorporation of non-western peoples into the industrial
world. In addition, it will have applied as well as theoretical implications. As
Eskimos try to cope with a changing world, it is crucial that we understand the
processes that have affected them and influenced their sense of identity.
