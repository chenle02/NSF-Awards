Improvement in the quality of education in geophysical exploration of the
shallow subsurface is realized through the acquisition of up-to-date remote-
sensing geophysical instrumentation. This equipment is used initially in the
development of an environmental geophysical field site and subsequently is
integrated into the geologic field courses. This new site provides an area where
students can be taught geophysical and hydrological techniques within a
controlled environment. The geology department teaches inquiry-based science
courses with the main objective of problem solving. The new instrumentation
enables the faculty to upgrade geophysical instruction in the introductory and
upper-division courses as well as student research programs. The new equipment
includes (1) a proton precession magnetometer with a gradiometer, (2) a
12-channel hammer seismic unit, (3) an electrical resistivity unit, (4) a ground
penetrating radar system with antennae, (5) water wells for monitoring purposes,
(6) a portable generator, and (7) a computer system with plotter. With this new
equipment, the department is able to instruct students in modern remote-sensing
techniques including computer-assisted data interpretation and analysis.
Additionally, students can, through courses and research, obtain the
technological skills needed to address current human impact on the environment.
