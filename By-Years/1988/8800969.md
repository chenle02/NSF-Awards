The biochemical and physical organization of bacterial ice nuclei are examined
in E. coli and Pseudomonas syringae, using methods developed during Phase I of
this grant. Many envisioned uses of bacterial ice nuclei require the production
of cell-free nuclei active above -5.C (warm-threshold nuclei). A detailed
understanding of the structure of these nuclei is a prerequisite for such
development. The program goals are a) Investigation of the reasons for the
observed Mg+2- dependence of warm-threshold cell-free nuclei from E. coli and P.
syringae. b) Visualization and localization of cell-bound bacterial ice nuclei
in P. syringae cells and subcellular fractions, by immunogold electron
microscopy. c) Elucidation of the steps involved in assembly and degradation of
ice nuclei, in E. coli and P. syringae, using inducible expression systems, and
drugs which block specific steps of protein synthesis and processing. The
proposes research utilizes cloning and expression of bacterial genes in E. coli
and P. syringae, immunoelectron microscopy, and temporal and spacial
localization of bacterial proteins by established biochemical techniques. The
planned investigations will demonstrate which structures must be synthesized and
stabilized to produce warm-threshold, cell-free ice nuclei. Bacterial ice nuclei
are of potential use to the oil exploration, ski slope snow making, food
processing, clinical testing, and frost protection industries.
