The landfall and slow movement of Hurricane Harvey created one of the most
exceptional precipitation events on record in the United States. This rapid
response award will result in the creation of a research-quality rainfall
analysis product that can be used by hydrologists, meteorologists, and engineers
to study flooding and extreme rainfall events. Traditional rainfall analysis
products are limited by potential errors in the underlying data and differences
in how ground-based measurements are mixed with weather radar estimates of
rainfall. The researchers in this project will collect data about the rain
gauges and test the various analysis techniques to provide a product that has
high spatial and temporal resolution and quantifiable uncertainty estimates. The
impact of the project will be to help improve simulations of urban flooding and
to better understand extreme precipitation events. Local high school students
will work on teams to collect data for the project, introducing them to
scientific research activities.

The research team will create a foundational set of rainfall data, metadata, and
analyses for use in atmospheric, hydrologic and engineering studies of extreme
precipitation events. One of the main project goals is to create a level of
consistency and accuracy of the information that goes into the rainfall
analyses. The research team will work with other stakeholders to establish
metadata needs and standards and then collect the metadata from the network
operators. Different rainfall analysis techniques and the sensitivity of the
analyses to technique and parameter choices will also be assessed. One result of
the project will be to provide analyses and uncertainty quantification to the
research community. Other aspects of the research project will be to place
Harvey's rainfall into historical context and to establish a dataset for
comparison of rain gauge network performance.
