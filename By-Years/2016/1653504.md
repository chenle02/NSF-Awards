This project supports student participation in the 25th International Meshing
Roundtable conference will be held on September 27-30, 2016 in Washington DC.
Meshing is the decomposition of complex objects into simple parts for design,
display, and analysis. As technologies change in computing and computer-aided
design and manufacturing the demand for meshing seems only to increase.

The IMR conference includes four short courses, four invited speakers, and
presentations of reviewed papers, research notes, and posters, and a
professional development session particularly targeting students and postdocs.
This award will support registration and some travel expenses for a dozen
students (undergraduate to postdoctoral, coming from U.S. universities, national
labs, or non-profit research organizations) to exchange ideas with experts from
around the world, fostering collaboration and recognition that can help them
launch their careers. (For selection criteria, see the conference web site
