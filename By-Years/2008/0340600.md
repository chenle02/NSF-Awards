This research focuses on data-intensive computing---embedding processing
capability in the memory and I/O subsystems of traditional computer systems and
shipping the code to the data rather than moving the data through the main
microprocessor. Novel architectures that can exploit this newfound flexibility
in the memory and I/O system have the potential to significantly improve
performance and robustness. They will also remove three important limitations in
current parallel and uniprocessor architectures: hardwired cache coherence
protocols in scalable multiprocessors, poor cache performance for applications
with bad stride accesses or poor spatial locality, and latency and bandwidth
bottlenecks in I/O-intensive applications. This research specifically addresses
those limitations and includes the development of novel coherence protocols and
fairness mechanisms for programmable memory systems; and the development of the
necessary protocol extensions to convert the FLASH multiprocessor into an active
memory machine. This will be done by exploiting the existence of a hardware
prototype to run real-world problems and gain insight into the potential of
flexible memory and I/O systems. Finally, the design of Active Fabric, a high
performance novel unified architecture for data-intensive computing will be
accomplished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
