Sehgal, Amita IBN-9723035 Sleep-wake and other activity cycles, the maintenance
of body temperature, and the secretion of several hormones are just a few
examples of physiological processes that are periodic and tied to the 24 hour
daily cycle. The timing of all these processes is determined by a master
circadian (24 hour) clock within the body. The body clock is usually set by the
day:night cycle of light and dark. The clock is genetically determined, and some
of the genes that are part of the clock have been identified. This project
focuses on one of these genes, the "timeless" gene, which was recently isolated
and shown to control a component of the body's clock function. The protein made
by the timeless gene is destroyed by light, which is part of the mechanism by
which the body clock synchronizes to the day:night light cycle. This project
identifies the important parts of the timeless protein and determines how they
mediate the clock function's sensitivity to light. These studies provide insight
into the mechanisms used by organisms to adapt to their environment, and provide
information important to understanding the basis for daily rhythms in normal
physiology, cognition, and behavior.
