This EES Program builds upon the successful NSF-funded Computer Science,
Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarship (CSEMS) Program. This scholars program
provides financial and academic support to first-year engineering students and
new transfer students from two year community colleges who are academically
qualified and have unmet financial need, with special consideration given to
women, racial/ethnic minorities and persons with disabilities. The fundamental
objectives of EES are to increase: (1) the number of talented students with
financial need earning undergraduate engineering degrees; (2) the number of
underrepresented students earning undergraduate engineering degrees; and (3) the
retention and graduation rates of students earning undergraduate engineering
degrees. EES Fellows will have access to a specific set of support programs,
called the EES Community, designed to support and enhance their academic
success. EES Fellows will participate in academic advising and EES seminars
focusing on professional and academic development and career planning.
