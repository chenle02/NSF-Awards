ABSTRACT

This award will fund travel and local expenses of nine invited speakers and 25
new PhDs, graduate students and underrepresented minority mathematicians to
attend a conference on "Variational and Topological Methods: Theory,
Applications, Numerical Simulations, and Open Problems," to be held at Northern
Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona, May 23-26, 2007. The topics to be
discussed are semilinear boundary value problems, p-Laplacians and other fully
nonlinear equations, eigenvalue problems, symmetry, dynamical systems, and
equations from quantum-mechanical systems. Emphasis is on cooperation across
disciplines and integration of numerical simulations. The program will consist
of invited lectures and contributed talks. A tutorial will precede the
conference. The conference maintains a web site at
http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~jmn3/var07/var07.html .
