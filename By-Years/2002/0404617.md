0404617&lt;br/&gt;Sapiro&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This U.S.-France cooperative
research project between Guillermo Sapiro's research group at the University of
Minnesota and the Odysee research laboratory led by Olivier Faugeras and Rachid
Deriche at the French National Institute for Research in Informatics and Applied
Mathematics (INRIA) in Sophia Antipolis focuses on the development of
computational tools for brain imaging studies. The research addresses brain
development and shape deformations, diffusion tensor imaging analysis and
analysis of functional brain data. They will apply advanced computational tools
based on partial differential equations to data obtained from the Center for
Magnetic Resonance Research at the University of
Minnesota.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project will advance
knowledge in brain imaging research, using and developing novel computational
tools. The research addresses theoretical and computational frameworks in an
interdisciplinary research area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The
proposed computational techniques have applications in brain imaging and in the
general area of medical imaging techniques. The collaboration takes advantage of
French expertise in computer and biological vision perception and functional
imaging and modeling of brain activity. Through this award, U.S. students are
given the opportunity to develop research skills in an international research
environment and partnerships with French researchers for future
collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;
