This award provides support for graduate and undergraduate student attendance at
the 3rd International Workshop on Si-containing Polymers, which is to be held at
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy NY during the summer of 2003. The
requested support will allow a considerably reduced registration fee to be
offered to student attendees at the Workshop. Due to its international character
(18 of the 23 invited speakers are from outside of the U.S. and a sizeable
fraction of the up to 100 participants will also come from other countries) and
state-of-the-art focus on an important area of polymer science and technology,
this Workshop will provide a unique educational experience for these polymer
science and engineering students.
