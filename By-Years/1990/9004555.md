This research is to study the large-scale aspherical and spherically averaged
structure of the earth from long-period seismic data. The variety of three-
dimensional earth models in the literature and their general inability to
provide detailed fits to the data indicate where work is needed. Two areas will
be emphasized: the expansion and interpretation of a dataset of PIP and PKIKP
equivalent modes, some of which are very anomalously split, and the detailed
spectral analysis of long- period surface wave packets which should provide
extremely good lateral resolution of upper mantle structure. The goal is to
combine this information with datasets of structure coefficients and long-period
travel times to constrain global models of aspherical structure.
