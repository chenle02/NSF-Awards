A two-semester introductory sequence for computer science majors is being
developed with equal emphasis on programming, mathematical analysis, and
experimentation, along with the supporting mathematics. This sequence teaches
the three topics concurrently and provides a rigorous foundation so that
students can practice programming, analysis and experimentation immediately and
continue throughout the curriculum. The courses concentrate on developing
mastery of the three foundations of computer science rather than on surveying
various sub-fields of the discipline.
