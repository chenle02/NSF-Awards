With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program that is co-
funded by the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Program,
Professor K. Travis Holman and colleagues from Georgetown University will
acquire a single-crystal X-ray diffractometer without a detector since a state-
of-the-art detector is currently available. The project is aimed at enhancing
research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) studies of
metal-organic and metal-organometallic framework (MOFs) materials; (b) molecular
materials for gas separation and storage; (c) self-assembly and encapsulation
chemistry, (d) crystal polymorphism; (e) pathogenic crystal growth; (f)
crystalline explosives; (g) optically-switchable magnetic materials; (h) single-
molecule magnets; (i) molecular materials catalytic intermediates for C-H bond
functionalization; (j) bioinorganic modeling; (k) frustrated Lewis pair and NO-
activation chemistry; (l) stereodynamic sensors; and (m) and asymmetric
catalysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and
precise measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a molecule,
including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the
spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies
described here will impact a number of areas, including organic and inorganic
chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an
integral part of teaching as well as research and research training and will
contribute to educate students participating in activities such as the ACS
project SEED and an NSF-supported REU program as well as undergraduate, graduate
students and postdoctoral fellows.
