SSC-9450484 Bentley College Waltham, MA Wallace, Robert and Richard Frese
"Science Horizons: The Bentley College Science-Math Summer Camp" Bentley
proposes a four-week Monday-Friday residential summer program with academic year
follow-up, for girls from under- represented minority groups, entering the 7th,
8th and 9th grades. The program will run for three years beginning July 5-29,
1994. Approximately 10 will be selected from each of fine schools (3 in Boston,
2 in Cambridge). Schools will be selected such that the 50 girls will represent
a number minority groups (will be African- American, Latina, Haitian, and
Southeast-Asian in origin) and a variety of abilities (will attend non-magnet
and magnet schools, etc.) The major criterion for selection will be on
motivation and interest in science/math and a clear understanding of the nature
of the program. Emphasis will be placed throughout the program on factors
affecting interest and success in science/math of the students not only as under
represented minorities, but also as females. A core component of the curriculum
will be based upon a three-week pilot offered at Bentley in the summer of 1993
for 15 predominantly minority girls. This program utilized a curriculum, in
which age-appropriate mathematics were integrated with chemistry laboratory
experiments utilizing (1) team work and cooperative learning styles and (2)
material and problems familiar to girls in particular.
