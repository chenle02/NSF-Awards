9411203 Zhao This award is for a planning grant to enable the principal
investigator to develop a program of research on the application of genetic
algorithms to the optimal design of engineering systems. In particular, this
research will focus on the design of complex systems involving the synthesis of
topology, geometry, component properties, and their relationships. The
preliminary research will study some important issues concerning the development
of methodologies for the above purpose, including the possible representations
of engineering systems suitable for genetic algorithms, the representation of
design requirements and constraints, and possible extensions to other
engineering problems that involve the synthesis of a large number of subsystems
and components. This research could lead to a better understanding of the
engineering design process, and the ability to affect better system designs.
Although it is initially focused in the area of civil structures, if successful,
it should be applicable to a wide variety of engineering systems.
