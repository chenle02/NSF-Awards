9619910 Reactive systems such as telecommunications systems, and aircraft
navigation systems interact continuously with their environment and are usually
safety critical. This has created a demand for a rigorous framework for
reasoning about their correctness. Traditional formal methods for ensuring
system reliability perform a static analysis where a high-level design is
verified using techniques such as theorem proving and model checking. Since
actual systems are much more complex than the verified abstraction, static
analysis is supplemented by testing and monitoring of the implementation. This
project will introduce rigorous paradigms for the monitoring of reactive systems
and use them along with static analysis techniques to obtain mathematical
guarantees on the correctness of system behaviors. It aims to extend two
paradigms --- program checking, which seeks to follow up each computation of a
program by a check that proves that the result is correct, and conformance
testing, which seeks to determine if an implementation is correct by observing
its input-output behavior --- to the context of reactive systems. The project
will also explore distributed monitoring of distributed reactive systems. ***
