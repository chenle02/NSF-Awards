9357976 HAUSER This award provides support to Dr. Marc Hauser under the National
Science Foundation's Young Investigator Awards program. The objective of this
program is to recognize outstanding young faculty in science and engineering, to
enhance the academic career of recent PhD recipients by providing flexible
support for research and educational activities, and to foster contact and
cooperation between academia, industry, and institutions that support research
and education. Dr. Hauser has already made significant research contributions to
the field of biological anthropology, and he has the potential to become a
leader in academic research and education. This award will allow the
investigator to continue his research on the evolution of cognitive ability. By
integrating theoretical and methodological insights from cognitive neuroscience
with evolutionary biology, he will examine both the neural constraints on
behavior and the adaptive significance of a species' cognitive machinery. He
will use observational and experimental techniques on both captive and wild
nonhuman primates focusing on the role of hemispheric specialization in the
categorization of visual and auditory signals. Results will shed light on the
evolution of cognition in human and nonhuman primates. Dr. Hauser's research
promises to make an important contribution to knowledge at a time when
scientists are just beginning to examine the primate origins of social
intelligence and the evolution of language. ***
