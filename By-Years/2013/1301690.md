The project is to study the distribution of points on curves over a fixed finite
field and stabilization of sequences of moduli spaces, especially of curves, in
the Grothendieck ring of varieties. The question of distribution of points on
curves in a family over a fixed finite field is quite mysterious, even on the
heuristic level, but many recent developments allow interesting access to
special cases. These cases can provide the groundwork for development of the
general theory. Related questions of counting points on varieties over finite
fields have recently been determined to reflect a deeper structure in the
Grothendieck ring of varieties, which will be studied and further developed in
this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A basic question about an equation is: how
many solutions does it have? Many equations naturally fall into families of
similar equations, for example, quadratic equations are ones in which all terms
have degree at most two. This project studies how answers to the question of
"how many solutions?" vary within a family and what consistent patterns develop
as the family gets more complicated. The project also involves mentoring
undergraduates, supporting infrastructure for networking and mentoring of women
in mathematics, dissemination of mathematical ideas to middle school students,
high school students, college non-math majors, and the general public, and
mentoring and training graduate students
