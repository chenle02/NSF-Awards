The workshop "Syzygies in Berlin" will take place in Berlin, Germany on May
27-31, 2013 and will bring together early-stage and senior mathematicians to
study classical results and open problems surrounding free resolutions,
regularity, and syzygies. This classical area has undergone a renaissance in the
past decade, aided in large part by computer algebra calculations, especially
with the NSF funded computer algebra package Macaulay2. The workshop's will
center around a trio of short courses, led by D. Eisenbud (Berkeley), H. Schenck
(Urbana-Champaign), and F.-O. Schreyer (Saarlandes). These leading experts are
also well known for their enthusiasm and effectiveness as teachers. In addition
to the short courses above, three invited lectures will highlight recent
developments in the field. Potential speakers for these lectures are: Christine
Berkesch (Duke University), Diane Maclagan (Warwick University, England), and
Irena Peeva (Cornell University).

This workshop will bring together young researchers and senior leaders in the
field of algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry is a field which studies the
interplay between polynomial equations and the geometric objects which
constitute the solutions to the equations: a familiar example might be the
equation y=x^2, whose set of solutions forms a parabola in the plane. The field
of algebraic geometry plays a prominent role in both pure and applied
mathematics, appearing in problems ranging from the purely theoretical (string
theory) to applied (signal processing, geometric modeling and computer aided
design). The NSF funding for the proposal matches support provided by the German
Mathematical Association, and provides travel support for ten Ph.D. students and
postdocs, as well as support for lodging for fifteen participants, as well as
travel and lodging support for two of the invited lecturers. Additional
