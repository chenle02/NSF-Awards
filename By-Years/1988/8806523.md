Dr. Shirley Graham of Kent State University will study the genus >Cuphea> (ca.
260 species) of the loosestrife family, a common, widely distributed herb of
tropical Latin America. In the past ten years it has been learned that the seeds
of many species contain commercially exploitable quantities of oils of unique
and varied composition that are attractive alternatives to coconut and palm
kernel oils for use in industrial, nutritional, and personal.care products. The
U.S. Department of Agriculture has designated >Cuphea> as one of a select number
of new crops on which to intensify research and development. Despite its
predicted economic importance, however, the genus is known taxonomically from
only a single study made on very limited collections in 1880.1883. Dr. Graham
will continue her basic taxonomic appraisal of the genus, to provide
identification keys to wild species, descriptions of morphology and of
geographic ranges, and illustrations for accurate species.recognition,
discussion of species relationships and evolutionary mechanisms likely to
operate in the genus, and chromosome numbers that serve as initial guides for
the plant breeding programs needed to domesticate wild >Cuphea> for use as a
crop plant. Her taxonomic research will also contribute to basic inventory of
tropical plant resources.
