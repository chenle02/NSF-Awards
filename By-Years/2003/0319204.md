This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop a novel, low cost laboratory instrument for genetic analysis and single
molecule studies. The technology is suitable for the detection and
identification of DNA and RNA through fluorescent hybridization probes without
the need for Polymerase Chain Reaction amplification, or for proteins and small
molecules through fluorescence immunoassays. The general scheme is based on
single molecule detection (SMD) and utilizes the two-color cross-correlation
spectroscopy (TC-FCCS) technique with coincident detection analysis scheme to
simultaneously probe ten focal regions of a microfluidic assay. High efficiency
single photon detectivity Geiger mode microavalanche photodiode (uAPD) arrays
will function as detection elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial
applications of the instrument will be in research, medical applications, and
for drug development. Applications range from the study of conformational
dynamics and interactions of macromolecules to biochemical kinetics of single
molecules. &lt;br/&gt;
