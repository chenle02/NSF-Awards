Scharlemann's recent research has centered on the theory of classical knots and
of 3-manifolds, in particular on the use of Heegaard splittings and of related
notions (eg bridge positionings, tunnel number) from classical knot theory. The
focus is typically on the behavior of surfaces contained in the 3-manifolds (a
classical approach) but in a more sophisticated way. Added to old-fashioned
combinatorial arguments on surface intersections are ideas from graph theory;
added to the classic study of hierarchies on 3-manifolds is Gabai's notion of
sutured manifold decomposition, in which parameterizing surfaces and estimates
of the Thurston norm help control and understand the topology of the hierarchy;
and, added to the classic tool of Morse theory, is the minimax principle of thin
position, in which handles of a given index are added not all at once, but as
slowly as possible. Recently Scharlemann has gotten interested in how these and
similar new tools can also be used towards resolving questions in the topology
of 4-manifolds. For example, his recent proof of the genus three Schoenflies
Conjecture began with an effort to prove the full Schoenflies Conjecture with,
among other ideas, a 4-dimensional application of thin position. The proof of
the genus three case (which includes ideas on the general problem and its
connection to Property R) also integrates Heegaard theory into this important
4-dimensional problem through the natural use of Heegaard unions. These may be
only the first steps of a useful application of 3-manifold ideas to those
intriguing topological questions which are sometimes called (3 + 1)-dimensional
because they ask how 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds are interrelated.

A focus of Scharlemann's interest for many years has been the topology of
3-manifolds. To explain: one of the most basic observations about the world
around us, apparent almost from our birth, is that it is 3-dimensional. So it is
of interest to understand objects with precisely this property: anyone living in
one would see their world as 3-dimensional. Such objects are called
``3-manifolds", and the broad goal of this research proposal is to increase our
understanding of them. Of particular (but not sole) interest is what our
emerging understanding of 3-dimensional manifolds can tell us about some old and
important questions concerning 4-dimensional manifolds. Such 4-manifolds also
connect to our natural experience, when we incorporate time as well as space
into our thinking. The particular emphasis in this proposal is on questions that
sit on the edge between 3- and 4-dimensional manifold theory. Both of these
dimensions are interesting in part because they model the universe in which we
live.
