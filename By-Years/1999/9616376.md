ABSTRACT SBR 96-16376 PI: MacDonald This proposal requests funds for a Special
Session of the 10th Annual CUNY Conference on Human Sentence Processing on the
topic of The Link between Child Language Acquisition and Adult Language
Comprehension. The CUNY Conference is the primary research meeting of
psychologists, linguists, and computer scientists who study how humans
comprehend language. The special session is necessary because researchers who
study human adult language comprehension typically have not taken advantage of
work indicating how children learn language. There is now good evidence that the
way in which language is learned in childhood affects the way in which it is
represented and comprehended in adults, and so the time is ripe for
presentations at the CUNY meeting. In addition to offering important insights
into the nature of human capacities for learning and language, a better
understanding of language comprehension in humans may have important practical
applications to computer language comprehension systems, as well as possible
clinical applications with children or adults with language disabilities.
