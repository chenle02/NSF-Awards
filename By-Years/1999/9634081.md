This project connects Gogebic Community College to the Internet over 56 kbps
lines. Faculty and students at the school benefit from access to the resources
of the Internet, including libraries and supercomputers. In addition, they are
able to communicate and collaborate with colleagues at other institutions in
pursuit of research and educational projects. The award provides partial support
of the project for two years.
