The Committee on biopsychology at the University of Chicago spans the Division
of Social and biological Sciences and has provided national leadership for the
discipline since its inception. The Committee studies behavior and its bi-
directional interaction with neural and endocrine mechanisms and its ecological
and evolutionary context. The strength of the committee derives from bringing
all three levels of analysis together as an integrated system, including mental
processes and integrative physiological systems other than the brain. This
degree granting Committee is unique in the nation because it combines the
biopsychology of humans with the biopsychology of animals. The University of
Chicago is the only university to provide both graduate and undergraduate
training in behavioral neuroscience and endocrinology and this award enables
them to renovate their research and research training space in this important
research area.
