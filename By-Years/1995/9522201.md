9522201 Chou The research uses nanofabrication which employs ultra-high
resolution e-beam lithography, RIE and the integration of other nanotechnologies
to realize unique and novel device structures. The emphasis is on improving the
e-beam lithography system and examining new RIE etches to define nanostructures
with sub-10 nm dimensions. The research addresses three nanostructures: (1) Si
quantum-Dot transistors operating at room temperature, (2) ultrafast Si MSM
photodetectors and (3) high-speed optical receivers using MSM PD's and sub-100
nm Si MOSFETs. In order to realize these structures the e-beam diameter will be
reduced from 4 nm to 2.5 nm by replacing their tungsten filament with a LB6
filament, the system noise will be reduced and the accelerating voltage will be
increased from 40 KeV to 50 KeV. Inorganic resists will be examined for sub 10
nm feature sizes along with chlorine-based RIE processes. ***
