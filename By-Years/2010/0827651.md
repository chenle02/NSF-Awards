The multi-agency and international T-PARC (THORPEX Pacific Asian Regional
Campaign) requires the use of the structurally modified Naval Research
Laboratory (NRL) P-3 aircraft equipped with the National Science Foundation
(NSF) ELDORA radar to investigate tropical cyclones in the Pacific region.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The airborne system, using the ELDORA Doppler radar, will
allow for investigation of the short range dynamics and forecasting of one area
and its impact on forecasting in a downstream region. The primary purpose of
TPARC is to lead to improved predictive skill of high impact weather events such
as tropical cyclones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The observations made by the
P-3/ELDORA system will be complemented by observations from other aircraft and
sounding systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
