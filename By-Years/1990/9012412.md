A group of about 20 organic chemists will be selected to receive travel
assistance to attend the Eighth International IUPAC Conference on Organic
Synthesis in Helsinki, Finland which will be held July 23 to 27, 1990. The U. S.
chemists will present technical talks and have the opportunity to interact with
specialists from all over the world. The possibility of travel support will be
advertised and the applications will be reviewed by a panel of scientists.
Professional and geographic factors will be considered in the final selection of
grantees. This travel grant is being funded by the Synthetic Organic Chemistry
Program.
