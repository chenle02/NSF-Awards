The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) has detected
gravitational waves from binary black holes, verifying Einstein's predictions
and opening an entirely new window onto the universe. Gravitational waves are
very small, so searching for them presents great challenges in data analysis,
mathematical techniques, and computation on top of the technical challenges of
building and operating the instruments. A theoretical understanding of the
sources of gravitational waves, such as neutron stars and black holes, can also
help guide searches as well as learn about these objects from the results of the
searches. Both the data analysis and theory work under this award will help
transform LIGO from a prototype instrument into a tool for exploring physics and
astrophysics, including the possibility of exotic particle phases and the
complicated microphysics of matter under the most extreme conditions. A
continuous wave signal in particular will give a direct view into the otherwise
inaccessible interiors of neutron stars. As they spin down over the years, these
stars can tell us about the properties of matter under the most extreme
conditions since the Big Bang: supernuclear densities, relativistic speeds,
superconducting and superfluid at a hundred million
degrees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the implementation of matched
filtering searches of Advanced LIGO data for continuous gravitational waves
based on the Texas Tech group's code used in Initial LIGO publications; and
supports development of that code to improve sensitivity and efficiency, allow
more continuous gravitational wave searches, and isolate instrumental artifacts.
Specific science goals are (1) directed searches for young non-pulsing neutron
stars, (2) narrow-band searches for known pulsars with unusual gravitational-
wave frequencies, (3) detector characterization focusing on narrow spectral
lines, and (4) theoretical guidance and interpretation of searches for
continuous gravitational waves, particularly from neutron-star r-modes.
