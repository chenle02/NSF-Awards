This is the ninth meeting of the series on the Biology &amp; Chemistry of
Vision, from the Federation of American Societies of Experimental Biology
(FASEB), which has met biennially since 1985, with varying topics each time to
stress advances in the broad field of vision. Attendance ranges from around
120-160 scientists, with the specific inclusion of at least 10% of junior
scientists.&lt;br/&gt; The conference is highly interdisciplinary in the
approaches discussed, including molecular biology, physiology, biochemistry and
genetics. In this particular conference, the stress is on photoreceptor cell
components involved in development, visual transduction, dark adaptation, and
cell maintenance. The format includes a combination of lectures, periods for
extensive informal discussion, and ongoing poster sessions, emphasizing
interactions between workers from different fields. The biennial timing allows a
good perspective, and this year's focus on photoreceptors and genetics is well
matched to the leading edges of visual research, with the welcome addition of
evolutionary topics.&lt;br/&gt; The potential impact of this conference is high
in several subfields of vision, because of the discussions at the talks and at
the posters, where there are likely to be interactions and introductions
essential to career development of young investigators. Broader impacts also
include raising the interest and visibility of young investigators in visual
neuroscience, and it seems likely lead to new kinds of collaborative
interdisciplinary interactions.&lt;br/&gt;
