This project supports the use of programmable logic devices in an electrical
engineering curriculum. These programmable logic devices (PLD) provide a low
cost effective mechanism for the introduction of the concepts of I.C.
fabrication and design into the curriculum beginning at the sophomore level. The
PLD bridges the gap between discrete logic devices and the microprocessor. As
the student moves through the educational program, projects of increasing
complexity lead to the final industry-sponsored senior project. All are made
more meaningful through the use of PLD. The award is being matched by an equal
amount from the principal investigator's institution.
