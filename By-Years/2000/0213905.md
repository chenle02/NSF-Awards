The domestic dog is without question the most diverse species with regard to
size and conformation. Further, many conformation traits are fixed in breeds and
it is argued that these traits may often have a simple genetic basis. Therefore,
the dog is a good model for identification of genes that have a consequential
effect on skeletal development. A novel experimental design is presented that
aims to uncover specific genes that influence conformation, coat color and
behavior. The design utilizes a case controlled approach in which breed that
share similar traits are scanned with 540 framework markers. Regions of the
genome that have low variability in a subset of markers are likely to contain
genes that have been the object of selection in breeds. Statistical and
molecular tools are defined that will allow fine-scale mapping and eventual
identification of major genes influencing traits. To demonstrate the viability
of the approach, three small studies are proposed: 1) a genomic scan of 20
breeds thought to be inbred to demonstrate they have sufficient variation for
our experimental design; 2) a genomic scan of three breeds sharing the
achondroplasia phenotype (short legged dogs) to show that the gene for this
trait can be identified; and 3) determination of the extent of homozygosity
signal in regions flanking a gene known to cause a coat color phenotype in one
breed.

This project will test the feasibility of a new approach to discover genes that
have consequential effects on size and conformation. Further, the footprint that
intense selection leaves in the genome will be determined. This may enable new
approaches for gene mapping and provide a better understanding of skeletal
development and evolution.
