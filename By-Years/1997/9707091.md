PI: Sosa IBN-9707091 It is known that growing neurons and their axons can sense
their way towards a specific target by 'reading' a variety of guidance cues that
they encounter in their terrain along the way. Once the terminal branch of a
neuron reaches the area where it is going to 'settle' it needs to establish
connections, known as synapses, with certain neurons and not others. The
mechanisms by which neuronal terminals ultimately sort themselves out within a
maze of thousands of possible interconnections at a specific area are not well
understood yet. A phenomenon that plays a role in this sorting out is that of
competition between neurons synapsing with a common target cell. The strength of
synaptic between neurons is modified when other competing synapses are also
present. This phenomenon has been observed in the peripheral and central nervous
system of the cockroach will be used as a model to study synaptic competition
between sensory neurons that form permanent connections with the same target
interneuron. A mutant strain in which the effects of a single additional neuron
on a previously formed connection can be assessed will be used to determine if
the presence of the additional neuron affects how the points of contact between
the sensory neurons and their target are distributed and whether the additional
competing neuron is preprogrammed to be weaker or becomes weaker as a result of
its timing of arrival relative to other neurons. The investigator will also
attempt to mimic the phenomenon of synaptic competition between mammalian
neurons grown in culture to try determine specifically what the involved neurons
are actually competing for. Results from this project will not only further our
understanding of how synapses develop and how the complex circuitry of the brain
and spinal cord is ultimately established, but will also be of relevance in
understanding recovery of function following injury to the nervous system, since
synaptic competition is also observed as neurons rege nerate.
