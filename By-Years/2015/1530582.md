1530582&lt;br/&gt;Rouff&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports acquisition of
an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) to be
housed in the Department of Earth and Environmental Science at Rutgers
University ? Newark. The ICP-OES would support research in environmental
geochemistry that requires the ability to determine elemental concentrations in
natural samples with low detection limits (ppm-ppb) and high precision. The
investigators include early career faculty and an underrepresented geoscientist
and the acquisition will support focused efforts to broaden the participation of
underrepresented students in geoscience research through experiential learning
in analytical geochemistry with relevance to issues of urban
sustainability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research on trace metal interactions with a
phosphate mineral precipitate (struvite) produced from human waste and the
biogeochemical cycling of trace metals in soils will be facilitated by this
acquisition. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***
