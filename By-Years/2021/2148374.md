NextG network systems are expected to connect billions of heterogeneous Internet
of Thing (IoT) devices along with billions of people, enable machine-to-machine
communications, and provide low-latency computational and storage resources on-
demand at the devices and in the cloud. In NextG, many services will run
dynamically as lightweight functionalities close to users to support ultra-low
latency when storing/processing extremely critical data, for example, from
autonomous vehicles and tele-surgery. Historically, however, many of these
services have been developed/deployed with no security in mind, or simply with
security as a reactive add-on. This kind of security practice may beget life-
threatening consequences for critical NextG applications/services. The projectâ€™s
novelties are the introduction of a revolutionary capability for secure
architecture for NextG and a system, NextSec, that enhances the security of
NextG services. This project provides a solid foundation and collaborative
community for future system and network security research. The project team
incorporate insights and results from this work into relevant courses,
recruit/educate underrepresented students in computing, and transfer the
developed technology to industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address the
challenges in the secure composition of microservices in the pervasive,
distributed user-to-edge-to-cloud continuum of NextG network systems, this
project has three research thrusts. The concept of security transformation is
new for addressing the various security issues of microservices. The
Programmable Security thrust provides new primitives for supporting a software-
defined way of enforcing user-to-edge-to-cloud security. Finally, the extended
Maximal Causality Reduction methods offer efficient, scalable verification of
complex security properties across microservices. The framework has been
evaluated on Texas A&amp;M Commercial 4G/5G Advanced Wireless Application
Research Environment (AWARE) testbed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
