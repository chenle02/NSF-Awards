Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;This project will determine the potential
vulnerability of key ice streams to incursions of warmer ocean water onto the
continental shelf and if this mechanism could already explain any of the
observed thinning of the ice sheet. It will provide important constrains on ice
dynamic of the investigated section of the EAIS, and thus will be critical for
future ice sheet models and provide mechanisms for EAIS contributions to past
sea level high-stand. The PI proposes to investigate four key ice stream systems
on the continental shelf between ~90°E and 160°E. They will use multibeam
bathymetry to identify if and where cross-shelf troughs exist to help determine
whether these troughs could provide potential pathways for warmer ocean water.
Furthermore, detailed analysis of morphological features of these troughs could
provide information on past ice dynamic, maximum extent, and flow direction of
related paleo ice streams. The PIs will also conduct water column measurements
along these troughs and on the continental slope to determine whether warmer
ocean water could enter the shelf in the near future, or if such water has
already entered any troughs, and thus might be causing the observed thinning of
some ice streams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;This project
includes the participation and support of undergraduate and graduate students in
field work and data analysis. The possible involvement of a PolarTREC teacher
and the Earth2Class teachers program will reach out to K-12 students.
