A high power circulating liquid hydrogen target and a gas Cerenkov detector
system will be constructed for use in a measurement of parity violating
asymmetry in elastic e-p scattering at the Bates linear accelerator. This
measurement will allow determination of the contribution of strange quarks to
the anomalous magnetic moment of the proton. The target development will have
relevance to the research program at CEBAF. Most fabrication, assembly and
testing will be carried out by California Institute of Technology faculty,
staff, and students in the Kellog Radiation Laboratory.
