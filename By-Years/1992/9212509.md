The project will organize, convene and report on a workshop on the effects of
the April 22, 1991 Costa Rica earthquake. This earthquake presents an unique
opportunity to study the performance of structures sited on very soft and
liquefiable soils. The workshop intends to study and identify analysis,
retrofit, and design techniques to mitigate damage when poor soil conditions
exist. It focuses on identifying areas where more research is needed and on
recommending practical solutions for existing structures, with emphasis on
lifelines (bridges, water and electrical systems, emergency services, and key
industrial facilities). The results will be directly applicable to the U.S.
practice since large areas of the U.S., including the San Francisco Bay Area,
the Mississippi River Valley, and several East Coast seismic regions are
potentially vulnerable to similar problems if subjected to strong ground
shaking.
