9421385 Sucher The goal of this research is to understand the fundamental
interactions of nature through their manifestations in various aspects of
particle physics, astrophysics and atomic physics. In particular, this includes
exploration of the nature of new physics such as grand unification,
supersymmetry, new gauge symmetries which provide solutions to various unsolved
problems of the successful standard model of electroweak interactions, such as
the observed fermion mass hierarchies, the strong CP problem etc., and have the
potential to explain observations pertaining to neutrino masses and mixings
inferred from solar neutrino data and hot dark matter of the universe. Another
area of investigation is the application of Quantum Electrodynamics, the quantum
theory of electromagnetic interactions and Quantum Chromodynamics, the theory of
strong interactions to problems of atomic and particle physics. Specfic examples
include the analysis of forces between atoms, ions, and electrons which depend
on spin, the understanding of the highly excited states of the helium atom, the
interplay between strong and electromagnetic forces in proton-proton scattering,
and the computation of forces between quarks and anti-quarks resulting from the
exchange of gluons. ***
