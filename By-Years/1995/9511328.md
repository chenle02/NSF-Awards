Differences in behavior between male and female animals are reflected in
structural differences within the brain. The hypothalamus is a brain region
where there is strong ilteraction between hormones and the brain, and these
neuroendocrine events are very important during development. Nerve cells, or
neurons, often are clustered into groups called nuclei. Besides neurons, the
brain is packed with cells called glial cells, which have a variety of functions
that modulate neural development and activity. This project asks novel questions
on whether glial cells in a nucleus of the hypothalamus are sexually
differentiated during a neonatal "critical period." Cellular marking techniques
and molecular biology are used to explore cellular changes in morphology and
gene expression in these glial cells in response to steroid hormones. Similar
techniques will be used to localize sites of membrane receptors for steroids, to
determine whether the steroid action is directly on glial cells, or instead is
an indirect influence via steroid-concentrating neurons. Results will be
important for developmental neuroscience as well as neuroendocrinolgy, and will
help understand how the basic structure of the brain is related to behavior.
