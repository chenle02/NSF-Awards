We propose to continue our low-temperature research program on disordered
mesoscopic systems and specially designed nanostructures. The first part, which
concerns quantum interference effects in transport processes, will comprise
studies of narrow-bandgap mesoscopic conductors and superlattice effects. In
addition, we envisage work on single-electron charging in a vertical tunneling
structure, probing the question of "coulomb blockade" vs quantized-flux
conductance effects, and developing a split-gate, electrostatic AB device.
Unique advances in materials fabrication and processing have given accessibility
to entirely new experimental systems. This work aims at a comprehensive
understanding of how quantum phase interference and correlated transport effects
evolve in complex disordered systems. It bears directly upon current and near-
future efforts to develop powerful new devices for measurement and control in
science and industry.
