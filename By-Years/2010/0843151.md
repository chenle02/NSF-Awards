Intellectual merit. This project aims to understand the molecular machinery that
controls endosomal-mediated degradation of plasma membrane proteins in plants as
well as the cellular and developmental processes that depend on endosomal
trafficking pathways. Endosomal compartments play a fundamental role in the
sorting, recycling, and turnover of membrane proteins, the down-regulation of
receptors, and the trafficking of proteins to vacuoles and lysosomes in all
eukaryotic cells. This project focuses on two important plant endosomal
proteins, SKD1 and CHMP1, which work in coordination with other endosomal
protein complexes to regulate sorting of membrane proteins for degradation.
Endosomal trafficking plays a role in various aspects of the plant life, such as
development, cell type specification, cell wall remodeling, gravitropic
response, signal transduction, and hormone transport. The research proposed here
will provide valuable information in this plant cell biology
area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts. The project will have important
impacts on education and outreach. The Principal Investigator is currently
teaching undergraduate courses at the University of Wisconsin. An additional
part of the plan is to recruit one or more graduate students, in addition one
already in the laboratory, to work on the central topic of this research
proposal. Due consideration will be given to recruitment of individuals from
under-represented groups. The development of new imaging techniques will also be
important for the educational plan, since the PI is committed to develop
workshops on cell biology and cell imaging for undergraduate and graduate
students across campus as part of the educational activities of the new Imaging
Center in the Department of Botany-University of Wisconsin. The Center was
initially supported by NSF funds.&lt;br/&gt;
