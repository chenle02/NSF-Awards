9450934 Nyerges New pedagogy indicates that undergraduate education in
geography, including geographic information systems (GIS) education, should
foster group-based active learning and individual critical thinking, while at
the same time treat substantive topics of geographical concern. A GIS provides
an effective means for capturing, managing, analyzing and displaying large,
complex geographical data sets for various applications. This project,
therefore, enhances the character of undergraduate GIS laboratory experience
through the use of team work and geographic-based critical thinking skills for
undergraduates in geography GIS courses. One introductory course, two
intermediate and one advanced are emphasized. Implementation of this new
pedagogy is accomplished by integrating commercially available GIS and group
support system (GSS) software running on workstations linked by a local area
network server. ArcView and Arc/Info GIS software also supports two levels of
capabilities across a three-course sequence.
