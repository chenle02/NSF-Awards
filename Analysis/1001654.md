In a wide variety of questions in number theory one often recognizes symmetries
and invariance under group actions; and deep insights can be gained into such
problems by understanding dynamics of subgroup actions on homogeneous spaces of
Lie groups. In several such instances it is necessary to describe limiting
distributions of sequences of translates of smooth measures on submanifolds of
homogeneous spaces. Building up further from his earlier work on some typical
cases, the principal investigator seeks in this project to develop new
techniques in homogeneous dynamics to provide very general natural conditions on
the manifolds and translating elements that lead to equidistribution of the
limit measures. The work should lead to resolutions of some questions on metric
properties of Diophantine approximation, counting integral and rational points
on group varieties, and counting points on orbits of geometrically finite groups
associated with certain geometric configurations. From a broader perspective,
the research will apply the concepts and methods of ergodic theory and dynamical
systems about the long-time behavior of a generic particle in a flow, which is
originally a physical problem, to answer questions about deep properties of
whole numbers. This conceptual bridge between two very different disciplines
uses and influences other areas like representation theory, analysis, and
differential geometry, not to mention physics.
