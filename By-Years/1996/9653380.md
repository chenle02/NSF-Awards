Project Summary: This course presents 25 undergraduate teaching faculty with
the principles and applications of optics in engineering. A mixture of lectures
demonstrations, hands-on laboratory experiments and projects, represents the
core of this proposed enhancement program. Participants will be provided with a
prepared set of notes on most topics which will be covered, including Fourier
analysis, diffraction theory, interferometry, geometrical optics, fiber optics,
holography, photoelasticity, shearography, Moir methods, optical data processing
methods, nondestructive testing, and digital image processing. Participants will
have intensive work experience with the latest in optical equipment and related
instrumentation, much of which is computer controlled. Oakland University
possesses outstanding applied optics facilities, which will enable participants
to work with the modern instrumentation. In addition, the very latest equipment
available will be borrowed from manufacturers and suppliers and set-up in
Oakland's laboratories for participant use. As a follow-on effort, the
investigators will assist the participants to implement applied optics programs
and laboratory experiments at their home institutions.
