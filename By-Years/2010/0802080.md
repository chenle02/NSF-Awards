0802080&lt;br/&gt;Byrne&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support a small
workshop on arc-continent collisions and the evolution of the continental crust.
The workshop will be held at Arizona State University and the overall goal of
the workshop is to develop a research strategy for understanding the temporal
and spatial evolution of the ongoing collision in Taiwan, one of the world's
classic orogenic belts. The Continental Dynamics Program is funding a large
multidisciplinary project in Taiwan (TAIGER) that will carry out extensive
geophysical surveys which will provide better definition of the crustal-scale
features in the subduction-collision transition. What is missing, however, is a
synthetic view of the orogen that integrates crustal-scale processes with
outcrop-scale kinematics and exhumation and surface processes through both time
and space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will establish a research plan to
develop this synthetic view of the orogenic processes. The workshop will include
plans for fostering national and international collaborations and for
integrating undergraduates into international geoscience
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
