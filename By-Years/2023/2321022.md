Caribou are critically important to arctic ecosystems and human subsistence in
Alaska and Canada, and caribou herds are subject to complex management regimes
and harvest regulations amidst increasingly unpredictable climatic conditions.
Collaborative stewardship of caribou advances science and improves management
outcomes by integrating diverse perspectives, types of knowledge, and data
sources. This travel award supports participation of Indigenous knowledge
holders, wildlife biologists, and students in the joint meeting of the North
American Caribou Workshop and Arctic Ungulate Conference in Anchorage, Alaska.
Travelers will participate in a panel that advances collaborative stewardship of
caribou and highlights how equitable participation of Indigenous and rural
community organizations, biologists, and managers can improve outcomes for both
humans and wildlife.

Participants in the workshop, conference, and panel will explore the roles of
Indigenous knowledge in caribou stewardship, thereby advancing caribou
conservation and subsistence, and facilitating collaboration among Indigenous
organizations, biologists, and managers. Student participants will gain
experiential knowledge of the complexities of caribou management and a better
understanding of the role of Indigenous knowledge in wildlife conservation. The
PI team plans a peer-reviewed journal article that discusses the roles of rural
and Indigenous communities and knowledge in wildlife management.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
