Dutt This research is on a framework for IC circuit and system design, which
uses a mixed media approach to aid engineers in modeling designs for high level
synthesis. Design tools are being built on top of a graphical input language and
a tabular intermediate representation. The representation uses a general design
model that includes synchronous and asynchronous behavior, timing constraints
and protocols between communicating designs. Specific research tasks are: 1. An
environment for high level synthesis which provides multiple input media for
design conceptualization and capture; 2. Inclusion of partially designed
structures and user bindings into the environment; 3. Modeling guidelines for
design description in VHDL which support high level synthesis and simulation.
