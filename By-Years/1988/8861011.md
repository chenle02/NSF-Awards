Research is proposed on a novel solid state electric circuit breaker. The device
can be used as a large-scale (400 kV, 1 kA) industrial or utility circuit
interrupter. The proposed device has the potential to significantly extend the
performance of existing circuit breakers by simultaneously increasing the rate
of change of current, di/dt, and the resulting rate change in system voltage,
dV/dt. The proposed research involves analytical calculations and experimental
tests of a scaled-down circuit breaker device. The investigator will
independently test the di/dt and dV/dt performance of a small scale device. Fast
acting, high power AC circuit breakers have application in general electric-
power applications and would provide an improved performance level that has not
been attained to this point.
