The proposal concerns several aspects of four dimensional topology and geometry.
Some of the projects on the topological side are: defining smooth and symplectic
invariants and studying their properties, classifying symplectic Calabi-Yau
4-manifolds and classifying Lagrangian and symplectic surfaces in rational and
ruled manifolds, investigating smooth and symplectic mapping class groups. And
on the geometric side, the PI is comparing tamed, compatible and integrable
almost complex structures on 4-manifolds.

An n dimensional manifold is a large scale space that locally looks like the
Euclidean space of dimension n. In particular, the space-time universe we live
in is a four dimensional manifold. On an even dimensional manifold, a symplectic
structure is a geometric structure that underlies some fundamental equations of
classical and quantum physics. Thus symplectic four manifolds play a central
role in both mathematics and physics. This research project aims to gain some
new understandings of the general shape of symplectic four manifolds, using a
variety of techniques from topology, algebraic geometry and differential
geometry.
