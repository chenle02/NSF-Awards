Boake 9514041 The process of species formation is very poorly understood; a
major factor is the maintenance of separate gene pools before two species are
incompatible. This proposal describes an analysis that links an intraspecific
phenomenon, sexual selection, to the process of behavioral isolation and the
separation of gene pools. The proposed research will examine factors that could
influence behavioral reproductive isolation between two species that are
incompletely isolated. Behavioral reproductive isolation has been explicitly
related to sexual selection in two models, and the relationship deserves
empirical attention. The central hypothesis for the proposed study is that the
aspects of mating behavior which are critical to species discrimination are also
involved in sexual selection within at least one species. This hypothesis will
be tested by examining Drosophila silvestris and D. heteroneura, a pair of
allopatric, interfertile species. These species were chosen because they have no
postzygotic isolation, their mating systems are non-resource based, and because
behavioral isolation is incomplete, the cross between D. Silvestris females and
D. heteroneura males is easy to make and occasionally occurs in the wild.
Behavioral isolation has arisen in the reciprocal cross, D. heteroneura females
and D. silvestris males. Furthermore, these species inspired a controversial
hypothesis that relates sexual selection to speciation. The failure of D.
heteroneura females to mate with D. Silvestris males is primarily due to the
failure to initiate courtship, rather than failure at later stages, and research
will focus on early courtship. At the end of the study, behavioral traits that
are keys to reproductive isolation will have been identified, which will allow
an analysis of the inheritance of critical differences between the species.
