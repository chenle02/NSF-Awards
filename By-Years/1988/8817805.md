This fossil flora provides evidence of succession on a volcanic field in which
a mixed conifer forest is replaced for a period by a broadleaved schlerophyll
vegetation. The sequence will be dated using the potassium-argon method and the
rates of succession compared with modern rates on disturbed areas. This is the
first time that gradual replacement of miocene exotic hardwood vegetation will
have been recorded and dated. The study has a relevance to global change. The
general date corresponds to a major spread of the Antarctic ice sheet some 15 Ma
ago and will be the first time that marine changes in the southern oceans can be
correlated to mid-latitude terrestrial changes. The study will also test the
hypothesis that these fossil floras are preserved in situ and have not been
transported from elsewhere and are the direct, although ancient, ancestors of
present-day high montane floras.
