This award supports a two week intensive training session at the Pittsburgh
Supercomputer Center (PSC) for twenty two students. The participants will be
exposed to multi-processing, numerical methods, data communications, graphics as
well as the standard elements of supercomputing. Vectorization will be discussed
and students will be introduced to the FORGE Automatic Code vectorization
package. students will become familiar with performance monitoring techniques,
visualization techniques and multi-tasking with an introduction to parallel
theory. The students will be divided into three groups with each group receiving
a project assignment. First hand experience with distributed-task programming
will also be part of the training institute. Each group will be given the
opportunity to produce an animation sequence on videotape of their project
results. Faculty will come from PSC, Carnegie-Mellon University, University of
Pittsburgh, Thinking Machines Corporation and Pacific Sierra Research. the
supercomputer in use is the CRAY Y-MP/832.
