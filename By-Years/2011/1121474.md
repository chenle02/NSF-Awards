The societies of many mammals are structured by dominance hierarchies in which
individual social rank determines priority of access to resources. Although high
social rank is known to affect survival and reproduction among female mammals,
its effects upon males are poorly understood because males usually change social
groups before breeding, so it is difficult to follow them throughout the
lifespan. This research follows male carnivores throughout the lifespan to test
hypotheses suggesting that their maternal rank in their natal social group might
affect the development of their behavior, their body condition and/or their
morphology, and that each of these in turn might affect their survival and
reproduction in the natural habitat. This research uses spotted hyenas as model
mammals because their societies are rigidly structured by dominance
relationships. Specially designed radio collars will be applied to male hyenas
dispersing among multiple study groups in Kenya. Methods will include radio
tracking of collared males, noninvasive monitoring of their stress hormones, and
collection of observational data on their performance in standardized test
situations as well as their behavioral interactions with other individuals,
using bush vehicles as mobile blinds. These techniques will permit determination
of whether or not social rank in the natal group affects male survival and
reproductive success long after they leave their natal groups, and if so, how
such effects are mediated physiologically. This field project offers unique,
rare and highly valuable training opportunities for American graduate and
undergraduate students in eastern Africa. In addition, this research will
educate and entertain lay audiences via internet coverage, public lectures,
museum exhibits and television coverage. Finally this work is expected to
enhance efforts focused on the conservation of large mammalian carnivores, both
in Africa and around the globe.
