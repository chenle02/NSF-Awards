Abstract 9614158 Sivjee This project maintains an infrared spectrophotometer, an
eight channel photon counting photometer and an infrared Michelson
interferometer at South Pole, Antarctica to study the dynamics and chemistry of
the upper atmosphere. By measuring the variations in the brightness and
temperature of airglow band emissions it is possible to detect planetary,
gravity and tidal waves. The horizontal wave structures are studied by looking
in several directions while making these measurements at several wavelengths,
which come from different heights in the atmosphere, provides information on the
vertical extent of the wave activity. Additionally, viewing the different
altitude auroral emissions with the spectrophotometer is providing insight into
the nature of the sources of the auroal precipitating electrons and how these
different sources vary as a function of time. ***
