With NSF support, Alcorn State University will build upon effective practices
developed during a previous HBCU-UP award to further strengthen science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) instruction. Undergraduate STEM
students will expand significantly their participation in research conducted
both on- and off- campus. During the summer following their freshmen year,
student participants will acquire analytical skills in mathematics and
communication and learn basic laboratory research techniques. Through the
sophomore year, students will continue research training through the use of
technology enhanced instructional strategies. In the summer following their
sophomore year, students will engage in faculty-supervised research at a partner
research institution. Additional research training is provided throughout the
balance of students' undergraduate experience. During their junior and senior
years, students also serve as peer-tutors to STEM freshmen and
sophomores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project lies in
the advancement of the knowledge base concerning STEM undergraduate teaching and
learning emphasizing both the theoretical and practical aspects of
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the project lies in the
enhanced participation of under-represented minorities in STEM disciplines and
the national STEM workforce that will result from the Alcorn State University
HBCU-UP project.&lt;br/&gt;
