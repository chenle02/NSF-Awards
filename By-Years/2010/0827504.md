Developing theory that captures the complexity of biological systems is
essential for understanding current patterns and predicting future trajectories.
This project will develop a novel theoretical approach that integrates models
from evolution, ecology and behavior to predict how interacting processes affect
social interactions and individual and population-level patterns of reproduction
and survival. This theory will then be used to examine two key issues in
biology: the evolution and ecology of cooperation and conflict and the effect of
environmental change on wild populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This integrative
method has broad relevance within biology and for understanding social behavior
more generally. Theory examining how organisms respond to environmental change
is also relevant to conservation and management. For example, we now know that
commercial fisheries have evolutionary, behavioral and ecological effects on
wild populations. Yet, existing models cannot predict how these dynamics
interact to affect populations and their management. Undergraduates, graduate
students and one postdoctoral fellow will be trained to use and apply the
resulting theory and models. To reach beyond academia, interactive computer
programs demonstrating the role of theory in biology and summer internships will
be developed for an after-school science education program that targets high
school students from groups traditionally underrepresented in science and
engineering.&lt;br/&gt;
