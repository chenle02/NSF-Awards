In this proposal, the PI proposes to study geometric problems that are inspired
from physics, especially equations that are relevant to string theory and
general relativity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important set of nonlinear equations
appeared in Heterotic string theory as a coupled system of Einstein and Yang
Mills over a complex manifold. We propose to solve this system. We expect to use
this system to understand structures of higher dimensional manifolds. Intrinsic
metrics on moduli space of complex structures and curves of higher genus on
Calabi-Yau manifolds play a very important role in algebraic geometry and string
theory, we expect to study their properties in detail. We would like to
generalize some of our previous works on moduli space of Rieman surfaces to
higher dimension. In general relativity, we shall continue to study the
definition of quasi-local mass and their properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
interaction between theoretical physics and mathematics have been extremely
fruitful in the past quarter of century. This proposal is part of this
interaction. While the works will serve the physics community, we are confident
that the outcome of this research will give insights that will lead to better
understanding of geometry .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
