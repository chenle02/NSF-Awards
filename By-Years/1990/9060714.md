A software tool which presents analytical solutions of Laplace's equation offers
several advantages over numerical techniques. Students in many areas of
engineering and physics will benefit from the opportunity to study parametric
dependence of the solutions. Aspects of potential theory that are difficult for
numerical techniques, such as highly curved surfaces and derivative variables,
are simple for analytical methods, so both analysis and design of new structures
and devices will become more accurate. The principal obstacles to the use of
analytical solutions have been the difficulty of matching the shape to a
solution, and the need to perform a large number of tedious symbolic
calculations using algebra and calculus. These difficulties are overcome in the
proposed work by implementing an interface which guides the user through a
sequence of graphical menus leading to the desired solution in a variety of
formats, including, graphs, computer subprograms, and word processing elements.
Phase I of the project is devoted to working out the techniques which will
enable the solutions of Laplace's equation to be generated using a computer
based symbolic mathematics package (Mathematica), and to testing a minimal
version of the program for the suitability of the interface for Junior level
engineering students.
