There are a number of organizations whose missions involve great potential
risk, but where perfect reliability is demanded because of the extraordinary
consequences of failure. Examples of such high reliability organizations include
nuclear aircraft carriers, air traffic control systems, and many public
utilities. Relatively little is known about how these organizations operate, and
how their operations differ from other types of organizations. The investigators
will spend extensive periods of time observing and interviewing personnel on a
nuclear carrier and a California electric utility. They will examine the central
authority structure of the high reliability organizations, the way decisions are
reached and the decision-making role of computer technology, and the development
of a self-sacrificing organizational culture.
