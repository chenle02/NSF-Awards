The project supports participation of graduate students enrolled in PhD programs
at US universities in the 10th International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC 202)
to be held in Boston, MA, US. Specifically, the project supports travel to the
conference for those who might not otherwise be able to attend for financial
reasons, and participation in a doctoral consortium that provides for one-on-one
interactions and mentoring for the students from the world's leading semantic
web researchers. Students benefit from exposure to state-of-the-art semantic web
research, opportunities to attend tutorials on emerging research topics.
Collectively, these activities help integrate graduate students into the
established semantic web research community and provides a natural avenue for
integration of research and education.
