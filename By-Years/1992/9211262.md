Parametric computing deals with problems where the input is a function of one or
more parameters. This research will analyze various questions in parametric
combinatorial optimization. These questions can be described as either search or
construction problems. Search problems involve finding the parameter values for
which certain conditions hold. Construction problems deal with determining the
set of all the optimum solutions that are obtained when varying the parameters
within a prescribed range. Three specific areas of research are: Parametric
optimum subgraph problems on graphs of bounded treewidth; Efficient
combinatorial algorithms for Lagranian relaxation problems; Implementation of
construction and search algorithms, especially for problems related to minimum
spanning trees. A common theme is the notion of algorithm simulation, a
technique that originated in the field of minimum-ratio optimization. This work
combines this idea with other algorithmic, geometrical, and graph-theoretical
tools.
