This project will investigate the structure, energetics and dynamics of Gulf
Stream variability by deploying an array of current meters and inverted echo
sounders for two years. The instrumentation is designed to obtain data to
interpret the energy exchanges occuring in the Gulf Stream. The project is part
of a larger study, SYNOP, which will utilize data from this and other
experiments to address fundamental questions concerning the predicability of
Western Boundary Current systems. This is a five year study with deployments in
spring 88, redeploy in 89, and recovery in 90.
