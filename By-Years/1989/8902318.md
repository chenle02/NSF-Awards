This award supports an international workshop on the mathematics of reductive
groups to be held in Cordoba, Argentina at the National University of Cordoba
from August 23 to September 1, 1989. The U.S. organizer is Nolan Wallach of
Rutgers University while his Argentinian counterparts are Juan Tirao, Roberto
Miatello and Jorge Vargas of the faculty of mathematics, astronomy and physics.
The participants consist of leading mathematicians from the U.S., Argentina,
Brazil, France, Italy, England and Chile. There will be ten main speakers
including Wallach. The speakers at this workshop are known internationally as
experts on the representation theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras. Therefore
this is an opportunity for the exchange of knowledge and ideas, important for
the goals of the U.S.-Argentina Cooperative Research Program. There is an large
potential benefit to mathematics in Argentina, Chile and Brazil as well as to
the U.S. and the other participating countries.
