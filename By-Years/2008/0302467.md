This project will investigate the dynamics of the earth's ring current and how
the dynamics relate to the various sources of charged particles that give rise
to the ring current. The four major topics which will be addressed are: (1) the
plasma properties at geosynchronous orbit as a function of solar wind
parameters, (2) the significance of direct ion injection from the ionosphere
into geosynchronous orbit, (3) the evolution of the Dst index (a measure of the
magnetic perturbation on the ground due to the ring current) due to solar wind
parameters and ionospheric-magnetospheric coupling, and (4) the connection
between ionospheric ion outflow, the evolution of the ion density in the plasma
sheet and the recovery phase of magnetic storms. The project will combine
empirical modeling, statistical analysis and numerical simulations. Two new
empirical models will be produced that will be useful for space physics and
space weather modeling. A model of the inner plasma sheet will be developed
which can be used to produce boundary conditions for ring current simulations.
The second model will provide a relationship between Dst and the plasma source
drivers which may be compared to numerical simulations.
