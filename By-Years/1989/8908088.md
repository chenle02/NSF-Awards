The rational synthesis of new types of compounds that exhibit unusual structures
and reactivity patterns is the essense of chemical research. The most powerful
structural tool is a single crystal x-ray diffractometer. The analysis of the
x-ray data can help to correctly assign the solid state structure of a molecule.
This award will allow the Department of Chemistry at Michigan State University
to acquire a new x-ray diffractometer and associated software for research in
the following areas of chemistry: 1. The structure of alkalides and electrides;
2. Design and synthesis of new hosts for crystalline molecular complexes; 3. The
synthesis, structure, reactivity and photochemistry of bidentate fluorophosphine
and fluoroarylphosphine transition metal complexes; 4. Novel structures in
photochemistry; 5. Design and x-ray studies of new low-valent transition metal
clusters and solids; 6. Novel intermetallic alloys through metal/chalcogenide
complexes; and 7. Structure determination of new organic and inorganic
compounds, either synthetic or isolated from nature, in support of a variety of
organic and inorganic research projects.
