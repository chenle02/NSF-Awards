Students in the Accelerated Calculus Program are benefiting from a new
curriculum that treats beginning calculus as a laboratory course with Next
computers and Mathematica software as the equipment. Students, in classes of
125, work on open ended projects with assistance from graduate teaching
assistants, upperclass undergraduates, and faculty.
