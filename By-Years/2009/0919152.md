Much remains to be learned about the biological diversity of microbial
organisms. Amoebae, the subject of this proposal, have been particularly
neglected because of both their small size and simple cell structures that
provide few characters for comparative studies. This project relies on molecular
tools to elucidate the diversity of amoebae in the group Tubulinea, with a focus
on the so-called shelled amoebae in the Arcellinida. These amoebae, which are
abundant in diverse habitats including ponds, streams, and many soils, are
likely important players in food webs and in Carbon cycling. Project
deliverables include: deposition of new cultures of free-living amoebae,
characterization of numerous genes from diverse amoebae; and creation of a
framework for future studies of these poorly known
species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project include: 1)
training undergraduates and graduate students; 2) educational outreach to local
schools, including those in the underserved city of Springfield, Massachusetts;
and 3) increased participation of students from underrepresented groups,
including first generation college students, through a program co-founded by the
principal investigator at Smith College.&lt;br/&gt;
