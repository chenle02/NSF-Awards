9604024 Cerling The PIs will study the carbon and oxygen isotopic composition of
fossil tooth enamel on a global scale to determine changes in the diets of
African mammals over the past 20 million years. The PIs have established that
the carbon isotopic composition of enamel from equids and other large mammals
changes dramatically between about 7 and 5 million years ago in widespread parts
of the world. We propose: 1) to examine the transition to C4 diet in East Africa
for the last 20 million years for different mammal groups, including bovids,
suids, rhinos, and proboscideans; 2) to gather data on extant mammals from the
East African ecosystem to develop the use of d13C and d180 as a paleoecologic
indicator. The PIs will examine the development of different ecological niches
in rhino, proboscidean, suid, and bovid lineages using the stable carbon
isotopic composition as a measure of the diet (hence habitat) of these groups.
We will examine the shift in conjunction with morphologic change in these
animals. In addition, the PIs will examine three different communities: the
semi-desert region near Lake Turkana, a savanna plains community, and an
equatorial forest community. Forest communities may preserve a closed canopy
signal in the d13C signal, and resource partitioning in carbon and oxygen should
be distinguishable in all communities.
