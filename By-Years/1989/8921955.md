Polynyas, open water areas within ice covered seas, are thought to be important
in sustaining primary and secondary productivity in polar regions. The project
will investigate the influence of the St. Lawrence Polynya (SLIP) on benthic
communities in the Bering Sea by utilizing 3 methods. The first method will use
a newly demonstrated technique that takes advantage of the oxygen-18 signal
incorporated from seawater into tunicate cellulose, providing an averaged
seasonal metabolism signal for benthic productivity. The next method will test
whether sediment oxygen uptake is enhanced in regions exposed to open water in
the early spring, reflecting a larger cumulative organic detrital load. The last
method will evaluate benthic community composition in the polynya benthos to
test whether the presumed presence of enhanced early spring primary productivity
has significant role in structuring macrofaunal diversity and biomass. The use
of the stable oxygen isotope technique for analyzing tunicate cellulose, in
combination with sediment respiration rates and traditional benthic sampling,
will provide insight into the significance of the winter/spring polynya primary
production.
