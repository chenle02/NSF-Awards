This research concerns the performance of parallel systems, and in particular of
homogeneous shared-memory multiprocessors. These systems are just now becoming
available, show promise of proividing cost- effective high-performance computing
for the near-term future, and present a wide range of unsolved problems, many of
which apply to other system architectures as well. They will study three
specific areas. The first is the influence of software structure on system
performance; we will explore the sources of degradation in parallel systems and
the relationships among these sources of degradation, providing guidelines for
the construction of parallel software that performs well. The second is software
control policies for parallel systems; they will develop and evaluate techniques
that yield both good program speedup and good system efficiency. The third is
performance tools on and for parallel systems; They will build performance
debugging tools for parallel programs, and performance modelling tools that
address the problems of parallel systems and that exploit parallelism
themselves.
