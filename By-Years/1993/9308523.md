Neural network technology has the potential to solve an impressive variety of
today's technological problems which conventional computers are quite powerless
to deal with. The first applications of neural networks technology have been
limited to relatively small problems, and therefore systems scaling was not a
primary issue. Neural networks for real-life problems usually consist of a large
numbers of interconnected processors working in parallel. The objective of this
proposal is a deeper investigation into the computational and learning abilities
of neural networks for such large scale problems. In particular, the
computational models and topologies best suited for large scale problems, and
efficient and accurate learning techniques for such resource- bounded parallel
machine will be investigated. The results will be evaluated on two challenging
real-life problems from electrical engineering and molecular biology (mixed-
signal integrated circuits testing and protein structure prediction). The
proposed work is based on recent results: (1) a discrete multivalued neural
networks model that can be used as a tool for reasoning about the computational
scaling abilities of various neural network architectures; (2) efficient neural
network learning algorithms that generalize well starting with pre-existing
symbolic knowledge and incorporating additional constructive learning from
examples.//
