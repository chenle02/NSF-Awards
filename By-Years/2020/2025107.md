This Division of Earth Sciences Instrumentation and Facilities Program grant
supports acquisition of device that permits analysis of all the stable isotopes
of Oxygen (16O, 17O and 18O) contained in carbon dioxide gas liberated from
carbonate rocks and minerals to enable advanced studies of Earthâ€™s past climate
and environmental conditions as recorded in the stratigraphic record. The
instrument will serve the research needs of a large number of faculty and
students, initially supporting the education of two graduate students, a
postdoctoral scientist and two early career scientists on the investigator team.
The instrument will be housed in the University of New Mexico Center for Stable
Isotopes (CSI) which hosts weekly student seminars and hosts an annual student
competition to support meritorious project laboratory analytical
costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A tunable infrared laser direct absorption
spectroscopy (TILDAS) will be acquired. The investigators will employ the
instrument for triple oxygen isotope studies of sedimentary carbonates as
proxies of the temperature of their formation and isotopic composition of
formation fluids. A TILDAS tuned for 17O measurements is a new instrument with
anticipated analytical precision rivaling the traditional fluorination method.
TILDAS analysis times are 30 minutes versus 4 days for fluorination followed by
traditional gas source stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry (SIRMS). TILDAS
can analyze sample sizes an order of magnitude smaller than
SIRMS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
