9703814 Schonmann The Principal Investigator will work on various projects in
the areas of interacting particle systems, statistical mechanics, percolation,
and other related subjects in Probability Theory. The main objects of interest
in this proposal are the ergodic behavior and the relaxation patterns of several
interacting particle systems, including Ising models and other lattice spin
systems, contact processes on arbitrary graphs, growth models and cellular
automata. Several of the proposed problems have their motivation in phenomena
observed in nature as, for example, metastable states of systems in the vicinity
of phase transition regions. The Principal Investigator will study problems in
interacting particle systems. These are models for systems which contain a large
number of similar components and in which each component interacts in a simple
way with a few other ones. For instance one can think of the atoms in a crystal
interacting when they are close enough, or individuals in a large population
which may suffer or not from some infection with contamination occurring between
neighbors. The local interaction may involve a substantial amount of randomness,
but since the system as a whole is large, one expects and indeed observes a much
more predictable behavior at the global level. A great deal of interest in such
systems stems from the fact that the qualitative behavior of the whole system
may depend in non-trivial ways on parameters which are built into the local
interactions, but which only affect those in a smooth way (for example, the rate
of infection between neighboring individuals in the second example above). The
general issues of interest are then the understanding of which sort of
equilibria can be reached by such types of stochastic dynamics, how an
equilibrium state is reached, and how the parameters which affect the local
rules may affect the answers to these questions.
