0969023 Iowa State University; R. Bruce Thompson CNDE is seeking a Phase III
support (third five-year period) for the Center, including support for center
personnel, evaluation and research. The proposed Center is a single-university
Center at the Iowa State University.

CNDE was established in 1985, and is currently a self-sustaining Center that
continues to operate under the IUCRC model. The Center focuses on the use of
noninvasive measurement techniques to gather information on defects in materials
and the various properties of materials, components and structures-information.
Included are techniques that are familiar from medicine, e.g. the use of x-rays
and ultrasonic waves to detect cracks and other material conditions that might
lead to failure, as well as techniques that have no medical analog.

In Phase III, detailed brain-storming sessions are planned between the
Industrial Advisory Board (IAB) and Principal Investigators to guide the
evolution of project plans in the context of the generic industrial needs. The
work proposed involves research in ultrasonic, x-ray, electromagnetic, signal
processing, and magnetic measurement techniques. Additional projects are focused
on materials specific problems in the characterization of microstructure and the
NDE of composites.

The proposed research will help avoid major structural failures and the
resultant loss of human life, create and maintain a unique base of specialized
equipment available for use beyond the I/UCRC, and help train a new generation
of NDE engineers. Significant attention will be given to broadening
participation of under-represented groups through special programs (Science
Bound Program), encouragement of women in undergraduate and graduate research,
and involvement of women in leadership positions. The Center plans to
disseminate information via the Review of Progress in Quantitative
Nondestructive Evaluation, an international meeting attended by 300-350
researchers annually.
