This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop a new Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) detector system, which will
measure signals over seven orders of magnitude with a digitization resolution of
better than 1 percent (from a single laser pulse). The detector system hopes to
bridge the gap between analog to digital converters and photon counting systems.
The intellectual merit of the system is in the way it combines state of the art
logarithmic amplifiers, variable gain on the detectors and traditional photon
counting (for very low signals). A microprocessor will be used to process the
data and provide a high-speed Internet connection.

The final detector system should be relatively inexpensive and will improve
LIDAR scanning and miniaturization possibilities. The same design could also be
applied to multi-channel detectors allowing scanning LIDAR remote sensing
spectral studies (fluorescence, Raman, Differential absorption).
