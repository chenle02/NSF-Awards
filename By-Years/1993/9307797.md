Under a Research Initiation Award the relationship between processing,
microstructure and tribological behavior will be studied for copper alloy
composites with chromium fiber reinforcements. The effects of high load and
velocity will be evaluated under conditions where large electrical currents pass
across the interface between the composite and a hardened steel counterface,
simulating the conditions of electrical brushes in homopolar motors and similar
applications. The resistance to arc erosion and to oxidation will also be
evaluated.
