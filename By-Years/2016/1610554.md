Non-technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;The project focuses on the investigations of
the optical properties of Weyl and Dirac semimetals. These recently discovered
new classes of materials are semimetals with most interesting optical
properties. The presence of topological phases results in modifications of the
properties in new ways. For example, new states which are protected from
scattering are predicted. These features have promise for robust transport of
electrical and optical signals useful in future applications. While a number of
examples of the Weyl and Dirac semimetals have been identified experimentally,
many of the novel predicted optical properties have not yet been investigated.
The research experiments in this project fill this gap. The project trains one
graduate student, one post-doctoral scholar, and involves one part time
undergraduate. Educational outreach activities include development of new
lecture demonstration experiments in the optical
sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;The experimental
investigations of topological 3D Dirac and Weyl materials leverage terahertz
optical and magneto-optical techniques. These semimetallic materials are a new
class of materials that have relatively low carrier density and conductance,
enabling robust tunable optical effects at terahertz frequencies that directly
probe the novel properties and low-lying excitations. Magneto-optical
experiments in the Voigt geometry offers an extremely sensitive probe of the
predicted optical effects from the chiral anomaly that, so far, has only been
reported by transport measurements. Kerr and Faraday rotation measurements test
predicted magneto-optical-like effects that arise from the underlying Berry
curvature (magnetic) monopoles associated with the Weyl nodes. Magneto-optical
measurements on the pyrochlore Iridates aim at confirming the presence of the
Weyl state below the magnetic transition. Cyclotron resonance investigations of
several Dirac semimetals in the extreme quantum limit directly probe the chiral
N=0 Landau level. The activities also test recent theories that predict new
exotic physical properties of these materials. The electronic band structure of
all studied material systems are characterized spectroscopically with FTIR zero-
field reflectance and/or cyclotron resonance transmission measurements. The
project trains one graduate student, one post-doctoral scholar, and involves one
part time undergraduate. Educational outreach activities include development of
new lecture demonstration experiments in the optical sciences.
