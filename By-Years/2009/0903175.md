Hybrid vehicles are quickly gaining popularity around the world. Concerns about
fuel costs and air quality are resulting in the sale of hybrid vehicles in
unprecedented numbers. The growth in hybrid vehicle sales requires a
corresponding increase in the number of technicians who have been trained to
service these vehicles. Through this project, professional development workshops
are being developed and delivered that are aimed at community college faculty
and high school teachers who are teaching in automotive repair technology.
Representatives from several major US automakers are participating in the
delivery of the workshops. Participants are being linked together through a
variety of strategies to form a community of practice for the exchange of
curricular materials, course ideas, and the possible sharing of equipment.
Follow-up activities are designed to help ensure that content from the workshops
is being implemented in the academic programs of the participating institutions.
Participants are also creating curriculum modules that are being vetted and
stored in an online repository. Results from the project are being rigorously
assessed through a variety of measures.
