9301259 Agarwal This project will explore several areas of computational
geometry, including arrangements of surfaces, ray shooting and hidden surface
removal, approximate algorithms, dynamic algorithms, and multidimensional
searching. There will be a special emphasis on higher dimensional problems and
on problems involving nonlinear objects. Since it is not always possible to
obtain simple deterministic algorithms, the project will develop and implement
approximate and randomized algorithms for several hard problems. The impact of
the research will be two fold: (i) discovering new mathematical techniques to
solve various geometric problems, and (ii) developing and implementing simple
algorithms that work well in practice. ***
