This project takes advantage of recent developments in multimedia computer
technology to create an integrated set of computer-aided learning (CAL) modules
to teach fundamental concepts of geology in general education courses. The
software consists of graphics-intensive, interactive multimedia modules that
will include animation, video, sound, and hypertext linking across topics.
Module topics include global geology, plate tectonics, geologic time, Earth
interior, Earth materials, global cycles, human influences, and evolution of the
Earth. Questions throughout the material provide immediate feedback to the
students and guide their progress. Quizzes after each section assess concept
attainment and provide automated scoring for assessment of student progress and
effectiveness of the instructional media. The new modules build on the success
of an award-winning pilot module developed by the PI, and are guided by student
evaluations collected throughout the development and assessment phases. The
initial target audience will be students in two large general education courses
for non-science majors (&gt;60% freshmen-sophomores, ~10% education majors)
taught by the PI (History of Life) and the Co-PI (Planet Earth). The modules
have broad applicability to any introductory geology general education course,
and will be published, widely advertised, and disseminated nationally to
universities, colleges, junior colleges, and high schools. Extensive use of the
modules in the preparation of elementary and secondary teachers is planned.
