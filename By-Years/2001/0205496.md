Over the past decade, tremendous strides have been made in increasing the
transmission capacity of fiber optic communications systems. One technique that
has enabled this increase involves transmitting multiple streams of data
simultaneously down a single fiber line in a process known at wavelength
division multiplexing (WDM). In order for this technique to work, interaction
between the different data streams must be minimized. Another important
development has been the appearance of all optical devices, system components
that exploit parametric processes in optical fiber to perform data manipulation
at faster rates than more tradition opto-electronic components. In contrast to
WDM systems, these devices depend on strong interaction between different
frequency components in order to function. Proposed is a consideration of the
problem of interchannel interaction (the interaction of data streams centered at
different frequencies) in the two limits suggested by WDM systems (weak
interaction) and all optical devices (strong interaction). To meet this goal,
asymptotics, multiple scale and soliton perturbation theory, variational
methods, and symmetry reduction techniques will be used to obtain reduced
equations for the dynamics of optical pulses in the relevant limit. These
equations will be studied analytically and numerically in order to identify the
parameter regimes that support stable and efficient system operation. Numerical
simulations will be used at each stage of the analysis to compare results with
experimental data. This University-Industry Cooperative Research (U-ICR)Program
project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities
(OMA) and the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS).
