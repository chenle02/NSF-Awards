The geochemistry of boron may provide the ability to follow and measure ocean
sediment recycling in arc volcanoes. This project will investigate by field,
petrologic and geochemical techniques, the behavior of boron, originally
concentrated in marine sediments, in subduction-related assemblages found in the
Cascades, Washington and in southern Alaska. Results will help elucidate the
role of recycling of subducted material versus fluid contamination as the cause
of anomalous enrichment of boron in some island arc magmas.
