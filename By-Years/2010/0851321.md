Areas of mathematics covered in the program include analysis, geometry, graph
theory, matrix theory, and statistics. Only a modest mathematical background at
the sophomore level will be needed to understand most of the open questions that
will be presented to the participants. The primary objective is to stimulate
talented undergraduate students to pursue graduate work in sciences and
mathematics by providing accessible and challenging research problems in basic
mathematics. Six faculty members will be active in the three year program. Three
faculty mentors will coordinate the effort each summer. Students will work in
groups of two or three with one faculty mentor. Students will make presentations
of their progress during weekly seminars. Each student will submit a written
report at the end of the program. Students will be encouraged to publish their
work and make presentations at professional meetings. Every effort will be made
during recruitment process to attract applicants from students in under-
represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project
is based in the challenging mathematical problems students will attempt to
solve. The students will tackle unsolved problems whose solutions (or partial
solutions) will improve human understanding of the very structure of
mathematics. The broader impact of the proposed project include training
undergraduates in research in basic mathematics,increasing the participation of
women and minorities in science and math activities, and involving
undergraduates as young professionals in the broader disciplinary field.
