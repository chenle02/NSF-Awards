9311012 HANSELL Although most of the research effort in marine organic
geochemistry has been directed toward particulate material, most of the organic
matter in the world ocean is dissolved (DOM). Despite its abundance, little is
known about the chemical nature of DOM, its reactivity and role in the marine
carbon and nitrogen cycles, and its relationship to the global CO2 cycle. In
this study the investigator will investigate the distribution, production, and
mineralization of DOM (specifically the carbon and nitrogen components) in the
Arabian Sea. As part of a team of scientists in the U.S. JGOFS Arabian Sea
Process Study, the investigator will study the relationship of DOM production
and mineralization to phytoplankton and bacterioplankton dynamics associated
with seasonal forcing by the monsoon winds. By relating these studies to other
scientists' simultaneous investigations of other aspects of carbon production,
consumption, and transport, a clearer understanding of the role of DOM in the
marine carbon cycle will be gained.
