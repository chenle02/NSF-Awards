The Educators' Equity in STEM II project tests and refines a model of
professional development for secondary teachers and postsecondary faculty at
community colleges whose responsibilities are in the area of career and
technician education. The project engages 100 participants (technician faculty
and teachers) and 100 supporters (key personnel in selected departments and on
campuses) in testing, refining and implementing equitable and inclusive students
experiences in classrooms that transform teaching practices in courses in
technician education programs. The cornerstone of the proposed professional
development is the "Micro-messaging to Reach and Teach Every Student Program"
developed with funding from programs administered in the NSF Division of Human
Resource Development and the Division of Undergraduate Education. Based on a
localized implementation of the program (prior support), the project
hypothesizes that attention and action focused on micro-messaging geared to
increasing equity and inclusiveness in the classroom could increase the
confidence and success of students in technician education programs across the
nation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project effectiveness will be assessed using the
Learning Forward 2011 Standards for Professional Learning and a project
evaluation that adapts and integrates the Context-Input-Process-Product
Evaluation model with models for evaluating professional development. In
recognition of performance appraisals at the secondary and post-secondary
education levels, participants will earn graduate education credits through
Castleton University in Vermont.
