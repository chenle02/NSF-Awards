This proposal supports student travel to attend the 2017 Formal Methods in
Computer Aided Design (FMCAD) to be held in Vienna, Austria in October 2017.
FMCAD 2017 is one of the leading conferences on theory and applications of
formal methods in hardware and system verification. It provides a forum to
researchers in academia and industry for presenting ground-breaking methods,
technologies, theoretical results, and tools for reasoning formally about
computing systems. This travel grant will enable career development and learning
opportunities for US-based and/or US citizen graduate students. Attending
conferences is an important component of graduate school education for our
society's future computer security researchers. Students have the opportunity to
discuss leading edge research with world-class computer security researchers,
and establish networks, connections, and mentoring relationships that will serve
them well during their research careers.
