The main objective of this research is to understand the relationships between
leaping behaviors and the design of the limb skeleton in living and fossil
primates. Leaping behaviors have been hypothesized to be an important component
in the evolution of modern primates. This research will clarify form-function
relationships in living prosimians by examination of mechanically important
aspects of leaping behaviors and limb longbones. Analysis of captive galagine
and lemurid leaping will be based on qualitative kinematic descriptions of
videotaped locomotor sequences. Mechanically sensitive aspects of limb
longbones, including cortical bone cross-sectional area and geometry, will be
determined from measurements made on radiographs of museum specimens. Form-
function relations demonstrated in living species will allow inferences of the
locomotor adaptations of the earliest modern primates to be made.
