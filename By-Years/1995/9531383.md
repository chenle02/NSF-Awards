The University of Notre Dame Physics REU-REU summer research program will be
continued from 1996 through the year 2000. The Notre Dame summer research
program will continue to place a strong emphasis on not only the research
development of each student in a particular project, but will also expose the
participating students to the numerous opportunities available in a variety of
physics research areas. Each of the undergraduate physics majors admitted to the
program (averaging 18 students for the last three years) will participate in an
ongoing and active research program and will be encouraged to become involved
colleagues in the everyday problem solving events. The participating Notre Dame
physics research groups are diverse -- atomic, nuclear astrophysics, high
energy, solid state and microelectronics, biophysics, and theory. Most of the
recruitment efforts are in undergraduate colleges and universities in the
midwestern region.
