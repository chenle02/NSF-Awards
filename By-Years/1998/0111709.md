Voltage gated channels are one of the ways that materials move into and out of
cells. They are important across biology. A channel can either be open or
closed; the transition is called gating. However, these proteins do not
crystallize easily and two-dimensional methods have had to be developed to
consider their structure. Each channel protein consists of six hydrophobic
membrane-spanning segments and a membrane insertion region.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to predict or at least have good models for
these transmembrane proteins is a significant need for the research community.
The techniques for this are now just beginning. At the moment, there are no good
homologues to VGC proteins in the PDB, because of the difficulty of
crystallization. However, alignment of sequence is possible. Three-dimensional
protein homology models will be developed from these aligned sequences, using a
variety of software packages developed by the group. The resulting tools will be
available on the web. Once the first models are made, all similarly aligned
proteins can be automatically predicted. This effort will produce models that
could be used to refine the structure data coming from new studies and methods
of considering membrane proteins.&lt;br/&gt;
