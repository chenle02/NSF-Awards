Under the award CCR-9120995, the Principle Investigator and his colleagues at
SUNY Stonybrook are continuing their NSF funded research on verification tools
for concurrent systems and on software capitalization of the findings.
Simultaneously, E. Madelaine and his collaborators at INRIA are engaged in an
independent, closely related project. This supplemental award provides travel
money to INRIA for the P. I. and one graduate student so that the two activities
can be combined at the implementation stage in the form of a front-end generator
accepting language specifications and producing routines to compile designs into
finite state machines. INRIA will support a comparable coordination effort by
the European investigators.
