It is becoming increasingly evident that reactions of gases at solid interfaces
play a key role in atmospheric chemistry. However, at the present time, our
understanding of the fundamental kinetics and mechanisms of such reactions at
interfaces in the atmosphere is rudimentary, at best. However, such data are
essential to elucidate the role of these processes in the chemistry of both the
stratosphere and troposphere. This research will explore the fundamental
kinetics and dynamics of the reactions of solid NaCl, the major component of sea
salt particles found in marine areas, with gases such as HNO3 and N2O5 using
surface science techniques including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, high
resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy and laser-induced desorption mass
spectrometry. These reactions are believed to contribute to the formation of HCl
and ClNO2 respectively. The latter is of particular importance since its
photolysis produces chlorine atoms which may compete with OH in initiating the
oxidation of organics in the troposphere. These studies will result in a much
better understanding of the fundamental parameters controlling these gas-solid
processes, which can than be input to models to provide a more realistic and
accurate assessment of the role played by such reactions in the atmosphere. In
addition, it will establish the utility of modern surface science methodology in
elucidating the fundamentals of reactions occurring at interfaces in the
atmosphere.
