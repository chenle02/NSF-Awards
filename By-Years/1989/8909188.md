This Research Initiation Award will support development of hierarchical image
processing techniques for extracting shapes from binary imagery. Traditional
dilation and erosion operations have proven useful for binary image coding,
object recognition, and inspection. Dr. Wong will study hierarchical
representations for speeding up such operations, with an ultimate goal of
efficient feature extraction from gray scale imagery.
