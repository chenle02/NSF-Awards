Despite its economic and biological importance, the evolutionary and systematic
affinities of many taxa in the suborder Ruminantia (order Artiodactyla) remain
problematic. Recent molecular studies using mitochondrial ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
and transfer RNA (tRNA) gene sequences strongly suggest that evolutionary
relationships in Ruminantia can be addressed successfully with these
extranuclear genomic data. The primary objectives of the project are therefore:
(1) to isolate, clone, and sequence mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences (rRNA
and tRNA genes) from diverse representatives in the suborder; (2) to construct
mtDNA phylogenies and to develop phylogenetic classifications from the
extranuclear nucleotide information; and (3) to compare these results against
other systematic data (e.g., those encoded in the nuclear genome) for patterns
of congruence. As an extranuclear genomic system, the mtDNA sequences will offer
unique insights into the phylogeny of ruminants, as well as into the molecular
evolution (mutational mechanisms and structure/function relationships) of rRNA
and tRNA genes.
