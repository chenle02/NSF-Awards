The Gramene Community Curation project will develop a robust network of
community-based curators for the Gramene comparative mapping database. Gramene
is a comparative resource for rice and other cereals based on the emerging rice
genome sequence. The project will develop protocols, relationships, and
community knowledge to facilitate the ability of researchers to contribute their
expert knowledge, and in turn provide researchers with the skills to fully
utilize the information available in Gramene. Travel and development through
workshops will provide the curators with an opportunity to develop standard
operating procedures, to design data entry resources, and to draft curricula and
other training materials. The standards and software developed will be useful
for other organisms as well.
