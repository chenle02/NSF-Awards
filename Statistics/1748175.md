The Program in Quantitative Genomics (PQG) at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public
Health will host the 2017 conference, "Quantitative Analysis of Higher Order
Chromatin Interactions", November 2-3, 2017 at the Joseph B. Martin Conference
Center at Harvard Medical School in Boston, MA. This is the eleventh in a very
successful conference series on emerging statistical and computational issues in
genetics and genomics. The impetus for this year's theme comes from the
increasing amount of data that provide information on the nuclear organization
of the human genome and its applications. A series of "chromatin confirmation
capture" techniques, such as Hi-C, have been developed for identifying three-
dimensional interactions between all pairs of genomic loci at once. Profiling
such three-dimensional interactions is critical for a full understanding of gene
regulation. With increasingly refined technology and decreasing sequencing
costs, it is now possible to generate high-resolution datasets with close to a
billion sequencing reads, on the same order as human whole-genome sequencing.
The scientific community is on the verge of generating massive amounts of Hi-C
and related types of data. The conference will deal with key aspects in
analyzing and interpreting these large and complex datasets. The conference is
open to the whole research community and particularly encourages participation
of junior faculty and researchers, postdoctoral fellows, students, and women and
minorities. The participants will discuss and critique existing quantitative
methods, discuss in-depth emerging statistical and quantitative issues, and
identify priorities for future research in the analysis of higher order
chromatin interaction data. The research presented will be broadly disseminated
in publications in scientific journals and websites.

The conference will focus on the following three topics of critical importance
in quantitative analysis of higher order chromatin interaction data: (1)
emerging technologies; (2) computational challenges in high order chromatin
data; and (3) applications to basic biology and disease mechanisms. A key
feature of the conference is to provide a timely and interactive platform for
cross-disciplinary senior and junior investigators, including statistical
geneticists, computational biologists, and biologists, to discuss these analytic
challenges. For more information, visit https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/2017-pqg-
