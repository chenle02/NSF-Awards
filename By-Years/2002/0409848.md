The International Materials Institute (IMI) at the University of California-
Santa Barbara, named the International Center for Materials Science, builds upon
the extensive materials expertise at UCSB and the various materials-related
Centers at the University, such as the MRSEC, the Institute for Theoretical
Physics and the California NanoSystems Institute. The IMI covers a broad
spectrum of materials science, including photonic and electronic materials,
self-assembled materials, nanomaterials and multifunctional materials. The IMI
serves as umbrella for existing and to be developed world-wide networks of
collaborations, both at the individual and institutional levels. The IMI
international activities focus on Asia and the Americas, with a special emphasis
on developing countries in those regions, but the IMI includes participants from
across the world. The IMI supports an annual visitors program that convenes
leading scientists from the US and abroad for a 3-month period and includes
substantial participation from scientists from developing countries in Asia and
Latin America. The visitors program focuses on a central materials research
theme that changes from year to year and comprises seminars, discussions and
active research with UCSB faculty. In addition, the IMI provides fellowships for
students, postdoctoral associates and young faculty for overseas research
visits. The IMI also supports annual international workshops and an annual
international summer school aimed at graduate students, postdoctoral associates,
and junior researchers. This award is co-funded by the Division of Materials
Research and the Office of International Science and Engineering.
