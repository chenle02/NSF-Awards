In a cooperative effort, the University of Nebraska at Omaha(UNO) and the
University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) have implemented an innovative
biotechnology program to provide state of the art experience in molecular
biology to undergraduate students. A rigorous laboratory curriculum includes a
Biotechnology internship where students will join a molecular biology research
laboratory at UNO or UNMC for one semester. The cornerstones of this program are
two newly designed lecture and laboratory courses, Virology and Molecular
Genetics, at UNO. The requested equipment will enable the program to add new
experiments critical to the Biotechnology degree to each of the courses. The
major equipment items to be acquired include: a floor model ultracentrifuge and
rotors; a microcentrifuge; an electrophoresis power supply, an electrophoresis
apparatus for sequencing; a hybridization chamber; a pressure blotting system; a
UV-crosslinking apparatus; an electroblotting system; adjustable micropipettes
and a Geiger-Muller radiation monitor. These additions will substantially
improve the molecular biology curriculum at UNO and thereby facilitate the full
implementation of the new Biotechnology degree program.
