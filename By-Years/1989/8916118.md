This research models the seismic wave propagation through fluid-saturated
porous media by means of the use of Biot theory. The objective is to apply full-
wavefield inversion to poro- elastic media to extract information on porosity,
permeability, and fluid viscosity as well as compressional and shear velocities
and densities. The research results have application to investigation of ocean-
sediment interfaces, geothermal/volcanic regimes, partial melting in the upper
mantle, and water and hydrocarbon reservoirs.
