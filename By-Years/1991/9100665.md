In automated deduction, the project involves the computer verification of
proofs of mathematical theorems. It addresses the problem of automatically
generating proofs of individual lemmas, and also sets forth a general framework
for verifying large fragments of mathematics through a development of axiomatic
set theory. In logic programming, the project considers Prolog-style languages.
These derive from logic, but there are serious questions about their semantics,
and there are several divergent points of view on what a logic program "should"
mean. The goal is to clean up the semantics, while still maintaining Prolog's
efficiency as a programming language. In set theory and topology, three topics
of research are planned. (1) Homogeneity properties of compact spaces. (2) Real-
valued measurable cardinals; recent advances by Gitik and Shelah make it
reasonable to reconsider some old questions in this area. (3) Martin's Axiom
(MA) and uncountable cardinals below the continuum. Specifically, the
investigator would like to find models where MA first fails at a singular
cardinal of cofinality greater than omega-one and would like to discover
consistent PFA-style axioms which allow the continuum to be greater than omega-
two. This project thus involves several apparently unrelated areas, logic
programming and proof verification on the one hand and set theoretic topology on
the other hand. The former has a more obvious relation to practical problems of
computer science, but the underlying connection is through the habits of mind
cultivated by long study of mathematical logic.
