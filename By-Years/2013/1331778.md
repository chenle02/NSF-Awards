This award supports junior U.S. researchers, allowing graduate students and
those in early stages of their career to participate in the thematic semester on
Biodiversity and Evolution that will be held at the Centre de Recherches
Mathematiques (CRM) in Montreal during the second half of 2013. This is part of
the more general program of the thematic year on Mathematics of Planet Earth
(MPE2013). Five workshops are devoted to (i) random trees, which arise in a wide
variety of biological application, (ii) modeling the complex evolutionary
dynamics that have shaped the structure of contemporary biodiversity, (iii)
models of DNA sequence evolution, (iv) coalescent theory and other genealogical
processes, and (v) applications of evolutionary game theory. This grant will
allow 25-30 young U.S. researchers to participate in this exciting
program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the rise and decline of species in
interaction with one another and with the environment, not to mention the
astonishing variability within species, requires a combination of approaches
from distinct scientific disciplines (genomics, ecology, economics,
computational biology, mathematical modeling, statistical genetics and
bioinformatics). The thematic semester on Biodiversity and Evolution that will
be held at the Centre de Recherches Math√©matiques (CRM) in Montreal August-
November 2013 will have conferences featuring research on a wide variety of
mathematical, statistical, and computational approaches. Participating in
conferences will allow 25-30 young researchers to learn about fertile and
important research directions, and to interact with the leading researchers in
their field.
