The goal of this program is to study the distribution of galaxies to test the
assumption of statistical isotropy, which is the idea that the universe, on
average, looks the same in every direction in the sky. A cosmological origin of
the violation of statistical isotropy would invalidate basic assumptions used in
the standard analyses to extract cosmological parameters. Dr. Huterer will
explore numerically and analytically the use of large-scale structure data to
probe inflationary physics in the presence of astrophysical and instrumental
systematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training
of undergraduate and graduate students. In addition, Dr. Huterer will run a two-
week summer course for high school students as part of Michigan Math and Science
Scholars program. He will also work with teachers in high-schools from the
Detroit metro area, visiting their institutions, giving lectures in classes, and
helping them develop astronomy curricula.
