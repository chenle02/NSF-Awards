The activity will support travel for up to 20 students to attend and present at
the IEEE International Symposium on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access
Networks (DySPAN), which will take place in McLean Virginia, USA from April 1
till April 4, 2014. The grants will provide partial support for travel, housing,
and conference attendance. The topic of this conference is of great relevance to
the NSF?s interests in spectrum management for research applications,
particularly radio astronomy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The special themes of this
event are advanced spectrum engineering and regulatory approaches focusing on
sharing Government spectrum (e.g.: S-band RADAR), novel spectrum sharing methods
and policies, business and economic modeling studies and systems oriented
research.&lt;br/&gt;
