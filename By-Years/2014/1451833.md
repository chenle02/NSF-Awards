This project focuses on taking advantage of emerging virtual reality (VR)
technology and high-performance networks for collaborative exploration of 3D
environments, and on the application of such environments to education. The
project is developing an immersive networked collaborative VR environment for
education about energy technologies. As part of the project the system will be
deployed to assess the value of its tools for high-school STEM education. The
overall goal is to explore, and to help spark, the transformative potential of
high-performance networks and emerging VR devices for innovative educational and
other beneficial uses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project leverages the City of
Lafayette's innovative "Fiber-to-the-Home" project that has brought high-speed
fiber optic internet access directly to every school and home in the city,
including the David Thibodeaux STEM Magnet Academy, the target high-school for
the project. The project also leverages an existing non-collaborative VR tour of
a "Virtual Energy Center" that was developed to explain solar thermal power and
other alternative energy concepts to high school students. It models a real-
world facility, the UL Lafayette Pilot Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) Plant in
Crowley, Louisiana, a research facility for alternative energy sources.
