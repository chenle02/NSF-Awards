This project is further developing an ongoing effort at Harvey Mudd College to
provide students with interactive computer experience in the mathematics
classroom. The introductory Ordinary Differential Equations course in which
students are exposed to such instruction at Harvey Mudd College is required of
all students regardless of major. During the past two years they have developed
an interactive computer workbook, Differential Equations Laboratory Workbook,
co-authored by Robert Borrelli and Courtney Coleman of Harvey Mudd and William
Boyce of RPI. Students have weekly laboratory assignments from this workbook.
This book has been published by Wiley. In this project they are expanding the
successful approach described above to create a computer laboratory environment
and laboratory manuals and exercises for two additional computationally
intensive mathematics courses, Numerical Analysis and Scientific Computing.
Materials will be widely disseminated.
