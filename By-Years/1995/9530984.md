9530984 Garfunkel The program addresses the study of ultra-thin (&lt;10 nm)
oxides on silicon substrates. The investigation centers around a cross-
correlation between growth mechanisms, composition, microstructure and
electrical properties of the thin oxides. Medium Energy Ion Scattering (MEIS)
will be employed together with a number of analytical and electrical techniques
to provide a characterization of the transition region between the oxide and the
underlying silicon substrate. ***
