University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Multifunctional Hybrid Porous
Nanoparticles for Controlled Drug Release&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL
MERIT: Porous silicon (PSi) is a promising drug delivery vehicle owing to its
tunable porosity, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and exceptionally large
specific surface area, which can be exploited for drug loading and controlled
release. Unlike liposomal or micellar drug delivery vehicles, PSi can be
fabricated into a vast range of sizes and shapes by an imprinting technique
recently developed by the PI. The aim of this proposal is to explore
multifunctional porous micro- and nanoparticles for the treatment of localized
pathologies. The specific objectives of the research are: (1) understanding the
impact of porous silicon particle (PSP) shape and size on cellular uptake and
selectivity, (2) investigating smart surface attachment chemistries to enable
intracellular, site-specific release of loaded therapeutic peptides, and (3)
exploring the viability of an ultrasonically-induced drug release mechanism and
piezoelectric-functionalized PSPs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS: This
research combines scientific and engineering methods of the complementary
disciplines of materials science, biomedical engineering, electrical
engineering, and physics for the realization of a drug delivery platform capable
of combating some of the most socially and economically devastating medical
conditions. The integrated educational goals of the plan involve the exposure of
participating graduate and undergraduate researchers to the interdisciplinary
nature of nanoscience and a team-based research atmosphere. Member selection of
the research team will emphasize increasing the participation of gender and
ethnic minorities, as facilitated through coordination with the existing NSF-
sponsored Vanderbilt-Fisk-Delaware State I-cubed program in materials science,
the Vanderbilt Institute of Nanoscale Science and Engineering REU program, and
the Vanderbilt chapters of SWE, NSBE, and SHPE. Educational K-12 outreach will
focus upon the development of inquiry-based learning activities to teach
nanoscience concepts, to be shared during school visits and events at the
Nashville Adventure Science Center.
