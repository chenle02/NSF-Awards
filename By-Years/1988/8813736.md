Soft X-ray EXAFS and XANES studies will be undertaken to complement previous or
ongoing X-ray absorption spectroscopic studies of amorphous and disordered
materials. Previously, it has not been possible to access all the absorption
edges of all the elements in disordered or amorphous alloys or glassy materials,
and consequently it has not been possible to fully characterize the short-range
order in these systems. However, with the recent commissioning of the soft X-ray
beamline X-11B at the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven, they have
access to the spectral regime in which is found the absorption edges of
aluminum, silicon, phosphorus, and sulfur; this new capability will allow them
to further extend their EXAFS studies and get a more complete picture of the
nature of the ordering in materials containing these elements.
