Knowledge of Late Cretaceous vertebrate faunas in the Western Interior is less
than for Tertiary vertebrates. This is particularly true for mammalian faunas of
the very poorly known "Edmontonian" age. A new fauna from the Williams Fork
Formation, NW Colorado, is the first definitive mammal-producing fauna of this
age. The mammals will serve as a basis for a review of species that span the
poorly known "Edmontonian" and will also serve as a basis for analyses of
higher-level relationships as warranted by the material. Zonations based upon
ammonities and pollen argue very strongly that the vertebrates are best regarded
as "Edmontonian" in age. Four ammonite zones, Didymoceras cheyennense through
Baculites reesidei, bracket the vertebrate faunas, which so far are from the
lower half of the Williams Fork Fm. Large microvertebrate samples to be
collected over the next three years using screenwashing techniques and heavy
liquid separation will more fully document this poorly know faunal interval.
Analysis of both sedimentology and stratigraphy (and soon palynology and
hopefully magnetostratigraphy) will be helpful in establishing a
biostratigraphic framework.
