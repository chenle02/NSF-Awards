NSF matching funds are requested to help purchase an Imaging Plate X-ray Area
Detector for shared use by two independent crystallography groups at the
Rockefeller University. These two groups, headed by John Kuriyan and Stephen K.
Burley, are exploring the intrinsic link between the three-dimensional
structures of macromolecules and their biological function. In collaboration
with groups at Rockefeller and elsewhere, the projects underway include
structure-function studies on: (1) flavo-protein disulfide reductases (J.K.),
(2) bacterial oxidative stress sensors and transcriptional regulation of
oxidative stress-induced enzymes (J.K.), (3) developmental gene products in
Drosophila (J.K.), (4) eukaryotic transcription factor IID or TATA factor
(S.K.B.), (5) eukaryotic transcriptional upstream stimulator factor (S.K.B.). A
rotating- anode X-ray generator and a high speed 4-circle single counter
diffractometer have already been purchased, along with associated computing
equipment. Acquisition of the proposed area detector will result in a state-of-
the-art X-ray data collection facility.
