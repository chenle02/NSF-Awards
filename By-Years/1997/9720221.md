The PI's propose to develop an environment for visualization and interactive
computational steering on a network of distributed workstations. The
visualization and steering front-end being implemented will be capable of
interacting using a client-server model with a computational engine, which could
also reside on a parallel computer, in addition to the distributed network of
computers which is the main target architecture. The target application of this
environment will be 3-dimensional liquid crystal material in a confined
geometry. The model used will be based on the Landau-de Gennes theory. In
particular, one is interested in the changes in the degree of order and
orientation of the liquid crystals as the temperature is varied. Knowledge about
the properties of liquid crystals is of importance, for example, for the design
of liquid displays. The target application is characteristic of a class of
problems which would benefit significantly from computational steering, since it
has multiple solutions with different symmetry structures and exhibits
bifurcation or turning-point behavior for certain values of the determining
parameters. Hence this is a path following or continuation problem.
