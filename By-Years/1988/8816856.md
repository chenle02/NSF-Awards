Many authors have stressed the significance of small-scale stratigraphic cycles
and discontinuity bounded sequences in geochronology and in understanding
depositional processes. As a result of extensive detailed studies of event
stratigraphy of the Middle Devonian (Hamilton Group), we have recognized
numerous small- and large-scale cyclic, bounded packages, some of which are
widely traceable and appear to be allocyclic in nature. We also postulate that:
1) an upward-shallowing motif, at least in larger-scale cycles, is not
pervasive, rather cycles are subsymmetrical near basin centers, but grade
marginward into asymmetrical shallowing-upward sequences; 2) that the bounding
surfaces of packages may record either sea level fall or rise, but 3) that they
represent discontinuities of considerable magnitude; 4) depocenters of
successive cyclic sequences display a regular westward migration that is
consistent with current models of thrust loading in foreland basins. As a test
of the generality of these patterns we will thoroughly document the
sedimentology, taphonomy, paleontology and regional distribution of small-scale
coarsening-upward sequences of the Hamilton Group in central New York State, and
their correlatives in other areas. In particular, we will focus on a)
correlation of bounded cycles across a shelf-to-basin profile; b) lateral
symmetry changes within cycles; c) internal facies anatomy of small scale cyclic
packages; and d) the nature and temporal scale of bounding surfaces. This
research will lead to better understanding of relative sea-level fluctuations
and depositional dynamics of a muddy foreland basin and could serve as a model
for interpreting similar settings throughout the geologic record.
