This energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer capable of detecting light elements
and a computer work station with software capable of performing quantitative
thin film chemical analysis will enable faculty and graduate students to perform
quantitative thin film microchemical analysis at the University of Missouri-
Rolla. This spectrometer is to be installed on an existing transmission electron
microscope. Ancillary equipment that includes a TV camera, cold stage, hot stage
and scanning transmission device are also requested. Current research is being
performed on synthesis of: 1) novel electrodeposited shape memory alloys that
cannot be produced by the standard thermal process, 2) ceramic superlattices
that have unique electrical and optical properties, and 3) new rare earth
magnetic materials that are technologically important. %%% An energy dispersive

essential for the characterization of these new and exciting materials.
