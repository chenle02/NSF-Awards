This award covers experimental Elementary Particle Physics research by a group
at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth in collaboration with other NSF and
DOE supported scientists. The group will finish the analysis of two experiments
at Brookhaven National Laboratory and participate in the construction and
operation of a third, a major upgrade of the multiparticle spectrometer at
Brookhaven in order to study mesonic states with unusual quantum numbers.
