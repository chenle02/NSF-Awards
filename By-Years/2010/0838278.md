Semiparametric methods continue to be an active research area, especially as
computing resources and power grow. These methods are used for inference in
models with both parametric and nonparametric components. Work in this setting
ranges from semiparametric modeling and efficiency to semiparametric regression.
The former involves making efficient inferences in the presence of infinite
dimensional nuisance parameters. The latter corresponds to regression models
with parametric errors and unspecified (nonparametric) regression functions.
Fundamental work remains to be done in high dimensional missing data problems,
both in the setting of frequentist and Bayesian inference and in estimating
regression functions with the complications posed in many different areas of
application. The workshop brings together leaders in the field of semiparametric
methodology and young researchers. The invited speakers all are very
distinguished individuals who have done outstanding work in semiparametrics and
have co-authored three of the seminal texts.

Flexible modeling with few assumptions is an integral component of solving many
scientific problems. Semiparametric methods are a way to accomplish this. Major
advances have been made in the past thirty years. However, fundamental work
remains to be done in high dimensional problems with incomplete data, in
estimating regression functions with the complications posed in many different
areas of application, among other areas. Applications for such work are wide
ranging and include spatio-temporal models, capture-recapture models, and
measurement error models in environmental applications, classification and
testing in in genetics and genomics, and missing data models in longitudinal
observational studies and clinical trials. The workshop provides an excellent
opportunity to discuss the many recent significant developments in
semiparametric methodology and to identify important problems and new research
directions.
