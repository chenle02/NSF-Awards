The NSF Divisions of Chemistry (CHE) and Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental
and Transport Systems (CBET) fund this award to the National Academy of Sciences
to support the core activities of the Board on Chemical Sciences and Technology
(BCST). The BCST has broad representation from academe and industry and uses its
collective expertise to identify the needs of the community and to provide peer-
reviewed consensus reports, workshops, and symposia, as broad outreach into the
chemical community and beyond. The BCST enhances the impacts of the chemistry
and chemical engineering communities by engaging in questions of importance to
federal decision-makers. It addresses timely research problems such as
sustainability and energy, and safety and security. The Board also proactively
examines topics of importance to the larger chemical enterprise, such as
education and training issues, employment concerns, and changes in the research
and funding models. By identifying and recruiting top experts to its ad hoc
studies, BCST ensures that the present state of technical knowledge is applied
to the policy issues facing decision-makers. By raising issues impacting the
conduct of chemistry and chemical engineering research with federal officials,
it helps assure that the community of practitioners can remain at the forefront
of knowledge.
