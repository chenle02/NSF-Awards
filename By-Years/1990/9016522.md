Experimental studies in laboratory animals have demonstrated that bony
morphology responds ontogenetically to behavioral modification. The scapula, in
particular, has been shown to be very plastic during growth. Locomotor behavior
often changes with increase in body size, and it is well known that locomotor
behavior of the gorilla changes with ontogeny. Thus, this study is designed to
investigate ontogenetic shape change in the scapula of two subspecies of
gorilla, the largest extant primate. Scapular shape will be assessed both by
traditional linear measurements and by shape indices. Nearly 400 scapulae from
several museums will be studied. Tensor biometrics will also be used to assess
scapular shape independent of size, and multivariate tests will be used to test
for differences between male and female and for age-related differences. The
results of this comparative study will be useful for making predictions about
locomotor behavior which can then be tested in the wild.
