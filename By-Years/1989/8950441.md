The equipment will continue the development of the ultrasonics laboratory in the
Physics Department at Millersville University. Pulses of very high frequency
sound are used as a probe (analogous to SONAR) to study fundamental physics (the
nature of high temperature superconductors), biophysics (properties of
hemoglobin and of enzymes), and the nature of waves (phase and group velocity,
reflection coefficients, Bragg scattering of light by sound, the Fourier
uncertainty principle for pulse modulated waves, the Kramers-Kronig relation).
These studies can be done on a bench top, at low cost, and are readily
understood by undergraduate students. They provide physics majors fulfilling
their required senior research requirement with an entry into research which is
always interesting, and occasionally publishable. The instrumentation is
unintimidating, and the process of generating and detecting sound is intuitively
accessible. The award will purchase two plug-in electronics modules to cover the
frequency ranges 10 to 90 MHz and 90 to 300 MHz. The institution will provide an
amount equal to 135% of the award toward the cost of the project.
