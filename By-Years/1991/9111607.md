Part of the VLSI synthesis problem is mapping the Boolean equations onto a given
set of primitive cells to minimize a total given cost function. The latter can
be time (performance) or area or both. This process, called technology mapping,
has solutions for Boolean tree networks. Algorithms for this are based on one-
dimensional dynamic programming. The problem of doing the technology mapping of
Boolean networks, represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), is being
explored. The major focus in this work is timing issues. Research tasks are: (1)
deriving optimal (in latency) technology mapping algorithms for DAGs with
recursive structures, and (2) extending these algorithmic techniques to
arbitrary structures. The optimization technique is based on multi-dimensional
dynamic programming.
