9509343 Garland This research will develop and test phylogenetically-based
statistical methods which attempt to account for the independence of datasets,
especially the evolution of continuously variable characters. Two analytical
methods will be emphasized: phylogenetically independent contrasts, the most
widely used and best understood of currently available methods, and phylogenetic
randomization, a new method that will be developed and which has the potential
to nullify a number of criticisms previously leveled at phylogenetically-based
statistical approaches. %%% PC-based computer programs that allow non-
specialists to perform phylogenetic comparative analyses will be produced; these
programs can also be used in teaching at the undergraduate or graduate level.
These programs and accompanying documentation are distributed free of charge.
