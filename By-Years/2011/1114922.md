Case Studies in Bayesian Statistics and Machine Learning continues the tradition
of the workshop series Case Studies in Bayesian Statistics with a meeting
October 14-15, 2011. The usual format for meetings and workshops in statistics
and computer science emphasize methods over applications, which often stifles
discussion about the impact of the methods on the substantive problem. The
unique format of the case studies workshop series has allowed for substantive
discussion of application-specific issues, most importantly a narrative of how
the substantive scientific problem demanded either new methods or the novel
application of existing approaches, the obstacles in the real problem that the
researchers encountered, and the solutions that resulted. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Statistics and machine learning provide essential methodologies
throughout the sciences, yet the connection between the science and the data
analytic problem formulation is rarely emphasized in traditional conferences.
This workshop fosters cross-pollination of ideas from the statistics and
computer science ommunities and promotes work that takes on important challenges
in scientific investigation. The case studies highlight the way novel
application of statistical machine learning methods are used to answer a
scientific question. The workshop especially supports efforts by young
investigators, in part by including a session of presentations exclusively by
younger investigators.
