This NSF award will provide partial support for US-based participants to attend
the conference, The Many Interactions of Symplectic and Poisson Geometry, to
take place June 19-23, 2023, at the Institut Henri Poincar\â€™e in Paris, France.
Symplectic and Poisson geometry are sibling branches of geometry, both rooted
deeply in mathematical formulation of mechanics and mathematical physics. This
international conference will bring together leading experts of the two areas,
as well as nearby domains, to present the recent significant advances in each
area, to discuss the open problems and challenges in each field, and to create a
forum for mathematicians at all career stages to interact, collaborate, and
propose directions for future research. The award will provide US-based early-
career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, and researchers not
otherwise funded by NSF the opportunity to participate in the conference. This
conference aims to help researchers in the related areas identify and jumpstart
promising new research directions, and to immerse graduate students and junior
researchers in the most current research in the fields. Topics will cover a wide
range of areas in symplectic and Poisson geometry, including contact geometry,
Dirac and generalized complex geometry, geometric mechanics, higher structures,
integrable systems, Lie groupoids and algebroids, microlocal analysis, mirror
symmetry, quantization and noncommutative geometry, quantum groups and
representation theory, and symplectic topology. Additional details are available

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
