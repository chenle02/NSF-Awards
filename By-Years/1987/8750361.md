The University of North Carolina at Charlotte is in the process of implementing
a microelectronics program. Interdisciplinary and team- taught courses in solid
state physics and in semiconductor device physics are being established jointly
by the departments of Physics, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical
Engineering and Engineering Science. These lecture courses are being supported
by laboratory courses in both subjects to be first offered in the Fall of l987,
and they are to be required for all engineering students opting for a major in
microelectronics. A dedicated computer and data acquisition system will be
acquired for the laboratory which supports both of these courses; a programmable
lock-in amplifier will also be used in several of the experiments. These
instruments will make for a fully modern laboratory where students will gain
experience in modern data acquisition techniques, as well as in the principles
of solid state physics and of semiconductor device physics.
