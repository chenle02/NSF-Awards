This project is initiating an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
for Energetics Materials at New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology. The
initial research program will address: (1) detonability, detonation stability,
and critical diameter of composite energetic materials; (2) exlplosive hazards
classification and an improved methodology for distinguishing between mass
detonating and mass deflagrating materials; (3) small sample size hazards
research; (4) thermal hazards of energetic materials; (5) fundamentals of
emulsion energetic materials; (6) improved performance tests; and (7) personal
computer programs.
