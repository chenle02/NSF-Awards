Geophysical data analysis techniques are to be brought to bear on similar
problems of the analysis of helioseismic data, with a particular view to the
analysis of Global Oscillation Network Group data. A major project of the
National Science Foundation is the planned measurement of solar oscillations
from six sites spread around the Earth. The analysis of the oscillation
frequencies, like those of a bell, will yield new information about the interior
of the Sun not available by any other means. But existing limited data of this
kind have already shown that it is difficult to transform the data into
information about the solar interior. The investigators for this grant will
apply to solar data the techniques already highly developed to interpret
seismological data of the Earth.
