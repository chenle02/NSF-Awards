The I/UCRC for Electrochemical Processes and Technology plans to advance the
fundamentals of electrochemical science and engineering to enhance production
and manufacturing applications. CEProTECH will combine four research thrusts:
(1) multiscale-modeling (from materials to electrochemical systems), economics
and life cycle analysis, (2) in-situ electrochemical spectroscopy and microscopy
techniques, (3) prototyping and scale-up, and (4) rapid transfer of technology
to industry (technology roadmap based on industry member
needs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed I/UCRC will seek to sustain a holistic
portfolio of novel, advanced and industrially applicable research. This research
agenda will be executed by a multi-disciplinary team, including a significant
percent of underrepresented groups of faculty, research scientists, and numerous
undergraduate and graduate students, as well as post-docs. Student researchers
at the Center will receive important experience that will help contribute to the
creation of an educated and contextually trained new-generation workforce. The
Center plans to encourage a broad dissemination of learning through its
continuing education activities to assist engineers in industry, as well as
engineering students, in acquiring knowledge of electrochemical processes to
better prepare them for career advancements.&lt;br/&gt;
