9357602 Mayes This NSF Young Investigator award deals with research and teaching
in the area of finite size effects on the thermodynamics of polymer blends and
copolymers, roughness correlations in multilayer thin films, the influence of
compressibility on disorder-to-order transitions in block copolymers, and forced
nonlinearity in addition copolymerizations as a synthetic route to new
sequencing schemes. The research is both experimental and theoretical. ***
