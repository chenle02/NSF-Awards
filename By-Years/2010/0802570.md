Video case studies highlighting the role of science in construction problems are
the core of this professional development program that includes video, print,
and web components. Faculty from Oregon State University and Chemeketa Community
College are adapting a research-based instructional model and problems familiar
to the construction industry generated in previous Advanced Technological
Education projects for use in science teaching. The instructional materials are
organized into a complete professional development program for middle and high
school science teachers and community college science and technology faculty.
The project is creating a professional development course in DVD format with
video, print, and web components that (a) demonstrate teaching standards-based
science through construction problems, (b) demonstrate ways to highlight how
high school science is valuable for a wide range of technical professions
specifically in construction fields, and (c) present tools and information for
helping students understand the relationship between content knowledge and
career pathways ranging from the apprentice trades to professional engineer. The
design capitalizes on a personal connection between people and their built
environments through a focus on construction concepts that link science to
people and their communities. Video components supported by web and print
material utilize a research-based form of professional development that links
cases in professional construction environments with model classroom teaching.
Media production is being handled by the Science Media Group at the Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory.
