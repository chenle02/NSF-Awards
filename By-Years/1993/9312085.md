9312085 Niciejewski This two-year award supports U.S.-Ireland cooperative
research in aeronomy between Rick J. Niciejewski of the University of Michigan,
and Frank Mulligan of St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, Ireland. The objective is
to enhance their collaborative investigations on neutral winds and temperatures
in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere by using data from an existing array of
four interferometers. Specifically, the investigators propose to incorporate a
detector for the Fabry-Perot interferometer at Maynooth, Ireland and to add
telecommunication capabilities to the instruments. This will permit real time
access to experiments from the University of Michigan. Graduate students at the
University of Michigan and St. Patrick's College will be trained on the
instruments. Winds and temperature in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere have
been difficult to observe and understand, yet, they are intricately tied to
global change. The interferometers are crucial for providing ground measurements
for interpretation of observational data from satellites. The proposed
measurements will occur during the current Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite
mission. ***
