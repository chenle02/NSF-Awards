This Future of Work at the Human-Technology Frontier Planning (FW-HTF-P) grant
will focus on a preliminary study to gather information on challenges and
opportunities for promoting craftspeople to participate in the future
manufacturing workforce. It also contributes to an integrative research
framework with stakeholders in crafts to push forward the frontier technology.
This project will build a multi-disciplinary team to create new knowledge in
three diverse areas that advance impacts on end-user fabrication, human-computer
interaction, culture and learning, and social psychology. Through this planning
grant, the team aims to characterize the craft end-users, their challenges,
barriers, and opportunity to serve as the future manufacturing workforce at home
given the technology and proper training that the research will result in. It
will promote a new research framework and validation that collaborations between
researchers and practitioners in crafts can push science and technology forward.
The iterative technology development process identifies technologies that
challenge existing patterns of workers and society, by reflecting the real-world
needs and barriers of craftspeople at various levels and adapting current craft
practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project builds a team across several
disciplines to establish the foundational knowledge and build metrics to measure
the success of end-user manufacturing. The team will identify consumer-caring
product properties through in-the-wild surveys, in addition to the partnership
with the Houston Center for Craft to reach professional craftspeople who are
affiliated with the center, identifying customization needs, ideal workflows,
and critical design parameters that need to be supported through end-user
software tool for custom 3D printing. The project will result in a preliminary
understanding of the interplay between material response and processing
parameters (e.g., printing speed, material layout, etc.) in 3D printed objectâ€™s
stiffness and strength, to computationally customize them in composite polymers
using accessible machines and materials. This research will reshape the
manufacturing pipeline through novel techniques and end-user support tools in
which the end-user specifies custom needs and individual end-user manufacturers
can process them to produce personalized products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
