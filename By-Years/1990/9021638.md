This action is for continued support of a field experiment designed to
investigate the performance of buried pipelines when subjected to the ground
shaking induced by a large earthquake; specifically the lateral offsets and
ground strains induced by seismic wave propagation. This experiment has been
constructed at Owens' Pasture, near Parkfield, California. This site was chosen
so as to capitalize on the predicted recurrence of the 1966 Parkfield-Cholame
earthquake sequence on the San Andreas fault. Although this earthquake has not
yet occurred, transient and residual strains in the instrumented pipe segments
were measured during the October 17, 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. The
distribution of strains in the pipes and their correlation with ground movements
yields important insights into the behavior of girth-welded steel pipelines of
the type used for oil, gas and water transmission. Data from the Loma Prieta
earthquake and from the main Parkfield event yet to occur make it possible to
evaluate critical assumptions of analytical models and, if necessary, revise
them. One objective of this experiment is to evaluate current analytical models
in light of the low amplitude data collected at Parkfield during the Loma Prieta
earthquake. The measurements made during this earthquake indicate that when the
predicted earthquake at Parkfield occurs, valuable data will be obtained from
this event. This leads to the second goal, which is to maintain the experiment
through 1993 in anticipation of this predicted event occurring. This is but one
of many experiments at Parkfield, supported by federal and state agencies and
non-profit institutions, which were installed and are being maintained in
anticipation of the predicted earthquake occurring.
