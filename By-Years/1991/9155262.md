This approximately 42-month leadership project is a cooperative effort of the
University of Virginia, and the Charlottesville City and Albemarle County School
Systems. It will prepare 20 three-member teams of lead teachers with a
combination of integrated physical science content mastery, conceptual thinking
skills, constructivist learning concepts, hands-on teaching methods, and
leadership abilities. The project will be conducted in two over-lapping phases
of approximately 28 months each, and will provide the 60 participating teachers
with 270 contact hours (9 credit hours) in courses that integrate physical
science, appropriate methods of science education, and strategies for effective
leadership. It is anticipated that all of the 130 K-8 classroom teachers from
the Charlottesville City schools, and many from Albemarle County will be reached
through inservices and support provided by the lead teachers, the principals,
and the project staff. This leadership project is appropriate for the Teacher
Enhancement Program because of its well-developed plan to prepare lead teachers
in science and, with their assistance, to provide science inservice for all of
the elementary classroom teachers within the city district and of the teachers
from participating schools in Albemarle County. The cost-sharing amount to be
contributed by the University of Virginia is approximately 27% of the amount
requested from NSF.
