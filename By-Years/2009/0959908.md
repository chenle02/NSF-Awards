This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;Funds from the NSF MRI-R2 program have been award
to San Diego State University for the purchase of a Field Emission Scanning
Electron Microscope (FESEM) equipped with variable pressure capability, digital
image capture and 3D measurement software, X-ray microanalysis detector and
software, backscatter detector, enhanced variable pressure secondary electron
detector, and cathodoluminescence detector, as well as a high resolution sputter
coater for SEM sample preparation. The FESEM is housed in the Electron
Microscope Facility in the Department of Biology at SDSU. The FESEM enables
morphological and chemical studies including: description of unicellular
photosynthetic cells; arachnid systematics; geochronology and provenance
studies; carbon nanotube composites and microsintering; and powder technology.
The data collected with the FESEM therefore provides new insights into diverse
fields of biology, engineering, and geological sciences and expands our
capabilities into new areas of research and teaching. The student body at SDSU
is highly diverse ethnically. Many students gain experience with high technology
instrumentation at the SDSU EM Facility. Incoming students and majors tour the
Facility to see the instrumentation in operation. Upper division classes
incorporate this equipment into student laboratory exercises; undergraduate and
graduate students operate the equipment and are involved in research projects.
Student-researchers become co-authors, publish in peer-reviewed journals, and
present their results at local and national scientific meetings. The new FESEM
is also used in regional outreach projects and can send live SEM images to the
next generation of scientists at Clear View Elementary School, 20 miles away in
Chula Vista, CA. Additional details are available at
