Biofuel derived from non-food sources, such as fibrous organic wastes and energy
crops, play an important role in fostering a sustainable, greener, and more
secure energy future. High economic costs, however, have hindered the widespread
utilization of such biomass-based fuels. This EAPSI project will seek to address
the commercialization obstacle by studying the biofuel potential of agave, a
drought-tolerant plant species with low recalcitrance, two features conducive to
the lowering of biofuel processing costs. As one of the few countries that are
invested in agave as an energy crop, Australia has much expertise to provide in
assessing an important aspect of the processing cost: the feedstock value.
Consequently, this project is a collaborative endeavor with Dr. Daniel Tan,
Associate Professor in Agronomy at the University of Sydney, who is at the
vanguard in developing agave plantations in Australia. This project will rely on
techno-economic analysis to evaluate the biofuel potential of agave. The
analysis will utilize actual feedstock costs associated with the cultivation of
agave as an energy crop. In addition, a biochemical process without pretreatment
would be used to model the conversion step. An economic evaluation combining
actual feedstock costs with a simplified process requiring no pretreatment will
furnish important insights into the potential of agave as a biorefinery
feedstock. An analysis that leads to a bioethanol minimum selling price that is
competitive with fossil fuel will not only boost the prospect of agave as
feedstock candidate, but more importantly, it could potentially result in higher
production of biofuel, which would lead to a more promising energy future. This
NSF EAPSI award supports the research of a U.S. graduate student and is funded
in collaboration with the Australian Academy of Science.
