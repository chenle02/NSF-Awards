This pilot project is designed to expand and improve the Berea science education
program by providing 30 teachers in grades 1-5/6 schools with training and
support that will enable them to extend elementary science curriculum to the
outdoors. The Cleveland Metroparks System will offer their excellent facilities
for the program. Naturalists from the park staff as well as university science
educators will serve as instructors in this multifaceted program. Teachers will
work for two weeks in a workshop setting which will include upgrading content on
basic ecological concepts, discussions of grade level teaching strategies, and
actual field work in the park system. Each teacher and a staff member will
develop a unit plan for class field trips. Review sessions will be held in the
winter to share experiences and plans for the spring field trips. Following the
academic year, the program will be evaluated and the participating teachers will
develop Field Trip Curriculum Guides for each grade level, 1-5. These guides
will enable other school systems to provide adequate outdoor science education
to their students through effective use of their park systems.
