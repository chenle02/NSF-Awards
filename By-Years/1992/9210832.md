An understanding of the link between climate change and water quality of
surficial hydrologic systems requires reliable quantifiable estimates of past
changes in effective moisture (precipitation-evaporation) and hydrochemistry.
The fossil record of lacustrine ostracodes (Crustacea) from closed basin lakes
located in the northern Great Plains will be used to develop quantitative
estimates of effective moisture and solute histories. The estimates will be
obtained using a modern calibration data set of paired ostracode and
environmental data, and by applying recently developed multivariate statistical
techniques in order to obtain analogs of the fossil ostracode assemblages. The
estimates obtained from this study will be compared to estimates of salinity and
effective moisture developed from independent data sets derived from the same
lake cores and based on diatoms and ostracode shell trace-elements and
mineralogy. This Research Planning Grant is the first step in a larger research
effort to develop a new method for obtaining paleoclimatic and paleohydrologic
reconstructions for the northern Great Plains that can be used in GCM validation
and for forecasting of climate- induced hydrologic changes.
