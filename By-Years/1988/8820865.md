A workshop organized by the Natural Hazards Research and Application Information
Center will address the scope, agenda, and planning of US research activities
for the fulfillment of the International Decade for Natural Hazards Reduction
goals and objectives. Special attention is given to the integration of physical
and social sciences and engineering, as well as to the social, economic,
scientific and technologic constraints and opportunities for increased hazard
mitigation. The state-of-the-art and the short and long term research needs will
be examined by representatives of the natural hazards research community,
private and public hazards mitigation specialists and administrators. A report
will ensue.
