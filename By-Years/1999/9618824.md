Professor Mark Ediger of the Department of Chemistry of the University of
Wisconsin-Madison is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to perform experimental characterizations of the glass
transition in supercooled organic liquids which include a number of polyaromatic
compounds such as anthracene, tetracene4, rubrene and derivatives. Experiments
are proposed to investigate the nature of molecular motion in deeply supercooled
organic liquids to probe the nature of the liquid/glass transition. The
questions that this research will address are: (1) What types of molecular
motions occur in deeply supercooled liquids; (2) Is the supercooled liquid
spatially heterogeneous; and (3) how is this connected to the non-exponential
relaxation that is often observed. Optical, dielectric and NMR spectroscopies
will be used to answer these questions, and in particular, how long-lived are
the regions of different temperature, what is the connection between non-
exponential dynamics and heterogeneity, what is the connection between
heterogeneous dynamics and the observed enhancement of translation and if the
anisotropic motion is the responsible for enhanced translation. In spite of the
significant progress in the molecular interpretation of the static and dynamic
properties of the liquid state, the properties of liquids and the molecular
motions which occur near the glass transition temperature, are still not well
understood. The experiments being conducted by Edgar are designed to shed light
these problems, on the anomalous rotational and transactional relaxation, and
the role of spatially inhomogeneous dynamics in the glass transition.
