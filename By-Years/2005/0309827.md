This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2003.
The goal of the fellowship is to increase the participation of minority
scientists at the postdoctoral level and to prepare them for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training and research of the
highest quality to recent doctoral recipients. It is expected that Fellows
supported through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the
future workforce.

The research and training plan is entitled "Does epiphyte functional diversity
affect nutrient partitioning and retention in tropical wet forest canopies?"
Despite their importance to biodiversity in tropical forest canopies, little is
known about how epiphytes acquire nutrients. This study investigates nitrogen
and phosphorus partitioning and retention in these plants and if resource
partitioning is a mechanism for maintaining species richness.
