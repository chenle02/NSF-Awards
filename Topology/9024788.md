Various problems in the set theory of the real line will be investigated. These
problems involve independence and consistency results in axiomatic set theory.
This means that the problem is to show that some particular statement cannot be
proved from the usual axioms of set theory. The main technique used is forcing.
The forcing method was first invented by Paul J. Cohen in the sixties to show
that the continuum hypothesis is independent of the usual axioms of set theory.
It has since been used to show many problems not only of set theory, but also
algebra, topology, and analysis are independent of the usual axioms of set
theory. Two areas of the set theory of the real line will be investigated. The
first area considers properties of Lebesgue measure and Baire category on the
real line as well as some ideals which are less well known. The second area is
to investigate pathological or peculiar subsets of the real line. Understanding
set theoretic properties of the real line has obvious foundational significance.
It has also transpired that methods developed for this purpose inspire analogues
which work in the context of theoretical computer science.
