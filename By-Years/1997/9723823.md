Weigel 9723823 Complementary molecular and genetic approaches will be used to
identify and characterize new components in floral induction in Arabidopsis.
Floral induction is the transition to flowering which is controlled by a poorly
understood process involving at least three major pathways: a long-day dependent
pathway, a gibberellin (GA)-dependent pathway and an autonomous pathway.
Specifically a putative GA-response element in the prometer of the LEAFY gene, a
critical component of flower initiation in Arabidopsis will be identified and
characterized; new signal transduction factors in the GA-dependent floral
induction pathway will be identified; new genes affecting floral induction will
be sought through a gain-of-function screen and at least two of the genes
identified in that screen will be characterized. One gene has already been found
and characterized as a homolog of a known regulator of the LEAFY gene and that
gene will be analyzed in detail. The importance of flowers for human sustenance
cannot be overstated. They are organs of plant reproduction and their immediate
products are fruits and seeds, including cereal grains, which provide the
majority of calories consumed by humans. Thus, an understanding of how plants
regulate the formation of flowers is likely to have long-ranging practical
applications.
