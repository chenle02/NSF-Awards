With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Mary S. Linn will spend three
years collecting Euchee (Yuchi) words and texts and entering the information
into a database. The Native American language Euchee is a genetic isolate that
was originally spoken in the Southeast. In 1832, the Euchee were removed to
Oklahoma, where the tribe of approximately 2,500 people lives today. Only 12
elders continue to speak the language. This project will have two major results.
It will produce the first dictionary of the Euchee language, containing
approximately 6,000 entries, and providing reliable spellings, grammatical
analyses, and example sentences for each word, along with an English-Euchee
finder, drawings of culturally specific terms, and full conjugations for verbs.
The project will also create a database of Euchee texts, which will provide the
most significant resource for future work on Euchee grammar, discourse analysis,
folklore and mythology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute
significantly to the Euchee language and revitalization programs. The dictionary
will provide a much-needed tool for teachers and language learners. The database
and its sound files can create supplementary learner's dictionaries, CD
dictionaries and teaching materials, and Euchee literature. The dictionary and
database will add to the growing resources for researchers interested in
historical and comparative studies of the indigenous languages of the Southeast,
and it will be the main resource for investigating possible distant genetic
relationships to Euchee. The project will also be of interest to researchers
working in linguistic typology, ethnohistory, folklore, and
anthropology.&lt;br/&gt;
