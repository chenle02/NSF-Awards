9622536 Karim This proposal is on research to develop effective means of on-line
monitoring, supervision and control of dissolved oxygen (DO) for a variety of
fermentation conditions. Most fermentation systems are complex, time-varying,
and highly nonlinear in nature, especially in a batch culture system, and
therefore control of the important variables can be difficult. It is proposed to
use a nonlinear model predictive control approach by using a recursive nonlinear
autoregressive model with an exogenous input (NARX) to approach this problem.
Specific objectives of this research are to: (1) develop a reliable experimental
setup to control DO, (2) develop on-line identification with reliable models,
i.e. NARX and adaptive NARX (ANARX), (3) use the identified model to implement
model predictive control, and (4) test the NARX and ANARX based DO controllers
in different fermentations, i.e. both low and high density bacterial cell
cultures, including fermentations in the presence of two viscous aqueous phases,
and plant cell cultivations which require low shear stress environments. ***
