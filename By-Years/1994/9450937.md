This project has improved the psychobiology laboratory at the institution, and
is affecting upper division courses in both the psychology and biology
departments. Equipment includes an 18-channel computerized locomotor-activity
monitor for rodents. Monitoring of locomotor activity is an extremely convenient
procedure for the study of the temporal organization of behavior. As part of
ongoing courses, psychology students monitor locomotor activity to learn about
the sensory and neural mechanisms of circadian rhythmicity. Biology students
monitor activity to learn about the endocrine control of estrous cyclicity. This
new, computerized equipment also allows all students more individualized
experience in the laboratory and provides a continuous recording of animal
activity over time. Overall, the project will provide a significant improvement
in the training of students in psychobiology and will serve as a model for other
institutions involved in undergraduate teaching of psychology and biology.
