Abstract for award DMS-0355285 of Mao&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work concerns
some problems in the theory of automorphic forms. The&lt;br/&gt;PI will use the
theory of automorphic representations to study a&lt;br/&gt;computational number
theory problem, and develop an algorithm for L-values&lt;br/&gt;based on a
relation between L-values and Fourier coefficients of half&lt;br/&gt;integral
weight forms. The PI and others will investigate the&lt;br/&gt;generalization of
this relation to L-values of automorphic forms on higher&lt;br/&gt;ranked
groups. The PI will continue development of the theory of
relative&lt;br/&gt;trace formula with S. Rallis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research is in the area of number theory. Number theory has
its&lt;br/&gt;historical roots in the study of natural numbers. It is among the
oldest&lt;br/&gt;branches of mathematics. Within the last half century it has
become an&lt;br/&gt;indispensible tool in diverse applications in areas such as
data&lt;br/&gt;transmission and processing, and communication
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
