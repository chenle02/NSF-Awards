ABSTRACT

The scientific goals of the project are to provide new statistical theory and
related methodology (i) for aiding medicinal chemists in seeking better models
for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) experimental outcomes; (ii) for
reducing the variability and cost of experiments in biopharmaceutical (BE) and
drug abuse liability trials and (iii) in drug stability studies, including shelf
life estimation of drugs. In the process, potential applications of cross-over
designs and trade-off theory will be strengthened in a wide array of
pharmaceutical, biotechnological, agricultural and engineering investigations.
The research activities employ a combination of mathematica, statistical and
computational tools (partly available and partly to be developed).

The aim of this project is to guide experimenters (in areas such as
pharmaceutical, biotechnological, agricultural and engineering investigations)
towards collection of information-rich and cost-effective data while running
planned experiments. The problems proposed in the broad area of design of
experiments and pharmaceutical investigations center around some key issues for
which very little theoretical contributions are available in the published
literature. Every research problem proposed herein is characterized by its
distinctiveness with respect to the innovative tools to be developed and
analytical arguments to be adopted. The anticipated outcomes of this proposal
will have substantial useful applications and will be utilized by scientists and
engineers in a wide array of scientific investigations.
