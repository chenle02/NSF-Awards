This project is funded under the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Small
Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which is designed to provide an
opportunity for small business, particularly the small high technology firm, to
participate in NSF research. Phase I of the SBIR program serves as a filter to
select promising proposals and determine if the firm can do high quality
research. Phase II is the principal research project. Phase III is the
conversion of the NSF-funded research into commercial applications and
technological innovation supported by follow-on private venture capital or other
non-federal financing. The objective of this Phase I project is to develop a
cost-effective multiwavelength local area network based on combining the best
attributes of both wavelength-division multiplexing and Fiber Distributed Data
Interface into a unique network referred to as Highly Parallel Wavelength
Distributed Data Interface (HPWDDI). The research emphasis is on the
technological choices and economic evaluation of the physical layer
implementation. An exploratory multi-channel single-mode HPWDDI system is being
designed, built and evaluated to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept and
its capability for interactive multimedia communications.
