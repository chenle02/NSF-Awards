This is a two year continuing grant to Dr. Goldman of the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institute. This new award will support his studies on the the role
of marine bacteria in the surface ocean nitrogen cycle. In this laboratory
study, selected bacteria will be grown in chemostats under varying nitrogenous
nutrient regimes. The carbon : nitrogen compostition of the substrate will be
varied to ascertain the effect on bacterial composition, growth efficiency and
nitrogen regeneration using amino acids, ammonium, nitrate and urea. Although it
appears that nitrogen availability controls the biological productivity of
surface ocean water, the mechanisms by which this limiting nutrient is
continually made available for plant growth (regenerated) remain unclear. This
is one of the supported studies that will contribute to a clearer understanding
of the microbial loop and its role in ocean productivity.
