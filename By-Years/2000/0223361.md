This project will develop a demonstration system and test-bed for a method of
using branch prediction and speculative execution in space weather forecasting.
The WINDMI model, developed by Horton and Doxas, of magnetospheric substorms
will be used as the basic forecast model, but the branch prediction and
speculative execution technique is not limited to that particular model. The
demonstration system will be a small, portable system that can be taken to
meetings and workshops for educational and outreach purposes.
