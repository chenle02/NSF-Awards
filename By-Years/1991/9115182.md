Dr. Robert Richmond is the Director of the University of Guam's Marine Lab,
which is the only U.S. marine research facility in the western Pacific. The Lab
is actively used by resident and visiting investigators from the U.S. and many
other countries of the world, and this facility is fast becoming a center for
international collaboration on tropical marine research. Dr. Richmond proposes
construction of a dormitory facility for use by visiting research scientists,
and by students taking courses at the Lab. The proposed housing facilities will
relieve current crowding and will allow expanded use of the research facilities
by visiting investigators. The University of Guam's Marine Lab will continue to
develop into a globally-oriented locus of international research. Important
biological research in tropical marine habitats will benefit from the proposed
facilities improvement.
