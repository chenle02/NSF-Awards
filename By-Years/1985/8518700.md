Masonry construction comprises a large portion of building construction in the
U.S. and the world. Reinforced masonry construction use is increasing in
moderate to higher seismic zones because of its apparent features of economy,
fire safety, architectural flexibility, and ease of construction. The present
state of masonry structural analysis and design and materials and construction
technologies does not enable an accurate prediction of building behavior under
lateral loads such as seismic loads. This research project will examine the full
scale out-of-plane seismic response of hollow clay brick masonry walls. This
experimental research project will consider the parameters of dead load,
reinforcement, wall aspect ratio, materials, data consistency, and seismic input
variation. The results will be used to verify and refine analytical models of
wall behavior.
