Hill&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditional preservation environments support
fundamental preservation activities such as appraisal, accession, arrangement,
description, preservation, and access. Digital preservation environments also
support information about individual records, management of data encoding
formats, migration to new forms of technology, management of massive archives,
and validation of trustworthiness assessment criteria. We propose the
development of a reference implementation for digital preservation environments
based on data grid technology. A reference implementation defines the assessment
criteria, the management policies, and the preservation procedures needed for
long-term preservation. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The reference implementation will
demonstrate the basic mechanisms needed to support long-term preservation of
digital records. Based on ten years of experience with applying distributed data
management systems to preservation projects, the components of a reference
implementation are well understood. The components include mechanisms to
automate the management of the preservation environment, automate the validation
of assessment criteria for trustworthiness, authenticity, integrity, and chain
of custody, and support the incorporation of new technology through extensible
policies, extensible procedures, and extensible sets of system information. The
goal is to minimize the labor required to manage the massive US record
collections (measured in petabytes of data and billions of files), while
preserving the essential properties of the records.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
system will be used to inform the National Archives and Records Administration
on the approaches that result in viable preservation environments, and to
demonstrate to the archival community an approach that successfully manages
technology evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
