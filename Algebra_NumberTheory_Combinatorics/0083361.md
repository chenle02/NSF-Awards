The PI will pursue research in areas of algebraic geometry, commutative algebra,
combinatorics, and their computational aspects, with emphasis on syzygies and
their relevance to geometry. The PI will study (1) Syzygies of Lawrence toric
ideals and their relation to chromatic numbers of graphs, (2) Syzygies, the rank
variety and the complexity of Orlik-Solomon algebras, (3) Syzygies of symmetric
sheaves, and corresponding obstruction classes in derived Witt groups to the
existence of symmetric locally free resolutions of such sheaves, (4) Natural
compactifications of configurations of points in projective space and their
applications to enumerative problems.

Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one
which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. The main
thrust is towards discovering connections between the geometry of sets defined
by the vanishing of polynomials and the algebraic invariants derived from the
defining equations of these sets, for instance syzygies. Results in algebraic
geometry and combinatorics have also found uses in communications, security and
robotics.
