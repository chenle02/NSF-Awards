This research will investigate the very long period waves, 100 to 300 second
period, from the second-greatest recorded earthquake in history, the 1964
Alaskan earthquake. The long- period recordings of the WWSSN stations will be
examined in the normal mode band to determine the low-frequency source
characteristics of the event and establish whether this even texcited an unusual
amount of low-frequency seismic energy. The source complexity will be determined
from an analysis of the long-period surface wave data. The results will then be
compared with those obtained by the researchers' similar analysis of the
greatest recorded earthquake in history, the 1960 Chilean earthquake, in order
to better understand the nature of rupture of these very great earthquakes and
to examine the possibility that these events are fundamentally different from
other earthquakes. Because of these events' great size and destructiveness from
both ground motion and tsunamis, their investigation has direct application to
the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
