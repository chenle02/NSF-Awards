The principal investigator will continue his study of the geometry of complete
Riemannian manifolds of finite volume and nonpositive curvature. Particular
emphasis will be given to manifolds of rank 1, a condition implied by but weaker
than strictly negative sectional curvature. The research project will include
the investigation of both geometric characterizations of symmetric spaces with
strictly negative sectional curvature, and algebraic properties of the
fundamental groups of the base manifold. Mathematicians have studied generalized
surfaces, called manifolds, for more than a century. A so called "Riemannian
manifold" may have a well-defined area or volume. For example, as we usually
imagine them, spheres and tori have finite surface area. The principal
investigator will study manifolds of nonpositive curvature. One example of such
a manifold would be the two-holed torus. This line of research has been
particularly active in the 1980's due in large part to earlier pioneering
efforts of the principal investigator.
