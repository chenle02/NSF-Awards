This project will research the development and application of new Next
Generation curriculum exemplars for middle school science and K-12 teacher
preparation foundational level general science (collectively referred to as Next
Gen curriculum materials). The project will address the need to develop middle
school science curriculum that aligns with the expectations of NGSS by (1)
constructing diagnostic tools to assess the alignment of curricula; (2) using
the tool for existing curricula in order to field test it; and (3)
systematically investigating the effectiveness of the tool. The project will use
these tools to revise and test a series of middle school lessons, implement them
in the classroom, and study their results. Research on the efficacy of these
diagnostic tools will address specific content and evidence of learning in two
domains: student middle school science learning and teacher content
learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop curriculum diagnostic
tools for middle school science. The process of development will include field
testing with teachers and students in 60 classrooms (20 life, 20 physical, and
20 earth science classrooms) in high needs areas. It will employ rigorous
standards in developing and applying research-based procedures to produce NGSS
curriculum exemplars. The mixed methodology approach will provide in-depth
information regarding the alignment of new curriculum materials to the NGSS. The
rigorously analyzed and field-tested Next Generation science curriculum
exemplars products produced will be broadly disseminated through state and
national conferences and networks of programs with which the California State
University, East Bay (CSU East Bay) and core partners are in collaboration.
