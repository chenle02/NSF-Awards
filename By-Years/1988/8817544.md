Dr. Jaffe and his group have designed and constructed a spectrometer receiver
for the 500.900 Gigahertz frequency band. The receiver consists of a cooled,
open.structure Schottky diode mixer coupled quasi.optically to the telescope and
to an optically pumped laser local oscillator. This grant will be used to
package the system for use on the California Institute of Technology
Submillimeter Observatory telescope in Hawaii. The receiver built by Dr. Jaffe
can make a valuable contribution to many astrophysical problems. These include
studies of warm, ultra.dense gas in the immediate surroundings of massive
protostars, observations of warm quiescent gas including studies of CII/CI/CO
interfaces in clumpy molecular clouds, and investigations of hot molecular gas
in protostellar flows.
