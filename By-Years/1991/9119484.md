This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at Trinity University acquire a luminescence
spectrometer to support the research and education programs in chemistry at this
undergraduate institution. Among the areas of chemical research that will be
enhanced by this acquisition are 1) photophysical properties of tetrapyrroles
and bilirubin analogs, and 2) sterically hindered substituted polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons derived from fluoranthene. The luminescence spectrometer
will be a significant addition to the department's instrumentation capabilities,
greatly enhancing current and future research efforts dealing with emission from
electronically excited states. Luminescence is light emission which occurs
during the decay of an excited state of a molecule, and is called fluorescence
if it occurs immediately or phosphorescence if it occurs a long time after the
formation of the excited state. Luminescence spectroscopy is a very sensitive
tool for measuring very low concentrations of biomolecules and in studying
kinetics and mechanisms of photochemical reactions.
