This award supports the research of Professor J. Rogawski to work in
automorphic functions. He intends to work on the relations between L-packets and
theta liftings for unitary groups. He intends to first study the quasi-split
unitary group U(3) and then try to extend these results to general unitary
groups. Modular forms arose out of Non-Euclidean geometry in the middle of the
nineteenth century. Both mathematicians and physicists have thus long realized
that many objects of fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic
nature. This field is principally concerned with questions about the whole
numbers, but in its use of geometry and analysis, it retains connection to its
historical roots and thus to problems in areas as diverse as gauge theory in
theoretical physics and coding theory in information theory.
