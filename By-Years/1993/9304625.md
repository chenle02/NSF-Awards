Funds are provided to support the 1993 Cyanobacterial Workshop being held at
Asilomar, California. The workshop is focussing on the use of cyanobacteria to
explore basic biological problems such as photosynthesis, metabolic regulation,
acclimation to diverse environmental conditions, and gene expression. %%%
Cyanobacteria provide an excellent model system for studying photosynthesis,
response to nutrient stress, and the mechanisms of cell development. This
meeting is presenting the latest advances in uncovering how these important
process occur.
