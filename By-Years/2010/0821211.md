A grant has been awarded to Miami University to purchase a spectral imaging
confocal microscope. Along with the existing system this microscope will be
accessible through the University supported Electron Microscopy Facility. The PI
(Joyce Fernandes), co-PIs (Richard Edelmann, Luis Actis, Quinn Li and Chris
Makaroff) and faculty participants (Eileen Bridge, Katia Del Rio-Tsonis, Lori
Isaacson, Kathleen Killian, John Kiss, Michael Robinson) have well-established
research programs in Developmental Biology, Neurobiology, Cell Biology,
Molecular Genetics, and Microbial Pathogenesis. This group of researchers
represents four departments- Botany, Chemistry and Biochemistry, Zoology, and
Microbiology and their common interest in confocal microscopy is especially
useful as an example of how tools and techniques are used across disciplines to
address basic biological problems. Current collaborations among the departments
include an NSF funded program to foster research interests in under-represented
student groups at the undergraduate level and an interdepartmental graduate
program in Cell, Molecular and Structural Biology
(CMSB).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus at Miami University is to provide a
quality learning experience for undergraduates, a goal that is enhanced through
an increasing emphasis on developing our graduate research programs. Acquisition
of the new instrumentation will allow the University to become competitive in
hiring new faculty and research personnel, as well as to enrich the integration
of research and teaching activities, not only at the graduate and undergraduate
levels, but also in our K-12 outreach. Thus, the educational mission of the
University will be enhanced at multiple levels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
