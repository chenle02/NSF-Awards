Biologists categorize life on the basis of characters that organisms share. For
most of the history of biology, morphology has been the prime source of
characters for biologists to accomplish this important task. Often times,
certain morphologies of organisms can look alike because of convergence, and
this convergence can confuse and mislead classification systems if not properly
treated. This proposal will attempt to examine the developmental basis of some
of these confusing convergent characters in flies. In particular, this project
will examine the molecular events involved in the development of the head of
some very bizarre Drosophila species, in the hope that the basis of convergence
can be discovered. The research planned for this project will also be directly
applicable to our understanding of the developmental process in general.
