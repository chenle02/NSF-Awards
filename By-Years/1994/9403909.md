ABSTRACT Raymond Gorte CTS-9403909 This is a study of acidity and acid-catalyzed
chemistry in zeolites and other solid acids. The objectives is a predictive
capability for reaction rates and selectivities. The principal approaches used
include carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of carbonyl-containing
molecules in zeolites to characterize site strengths, site dynamics, and site
locations; microcalorimetry on zeolites with a range of potential reactants and
products, with the results correlated to a proton-affinity model of the acid
sites; and second-harmonic-generation (SHG) measurements of adsorbates in large
single crystals to determine locations of sites in ZSM-5. The NMR work is
complemented with theoretical calculations of the chemical-shift anisotropy of
carbonyl-containing molecules in an acidic environment. The techniques for acid
site characterization are tested with complex solid acids such as sulfonated
zirconia. This is an industry-university cooperative research project between
the University of Pennsylvania and the DuPont Company. The replacement of
solution-phase acids with heterogeneous, solid acids in the production of
chemicals offers major downstream savings to the chemical, textile, and
pharmaceutical industries. Besides their economic benefits, solid acids are
usually much less of an occupational safety problem than liquid acids. This
study provides a conceptual/intellectual framework for selecting acids and
incorporating them into process design. ***
