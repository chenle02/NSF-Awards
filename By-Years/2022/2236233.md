Process Automation continues to be a main driver of digital transformation. Yet,
it is still technically very demanding to create such automation programs. This
project aims to significantly lower the technical barrier of creating web
automation programs. The project’s novelties are a suite of new rewrite-based
program synthesis algorithms that can automatically generate programs from user
demonstrations. The project’s impacts are to enable non-experts in need of
performing a tedious but programmatic web-related task to create a program to
automate the work, even if they have little or no background in web programming.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the core, this project is developing algorithms that
take as input a user demonstration – in the form of a trace A of user actions
(e.g., clicking buttons, scraping data) – and synthesize a parameterized program
P with control-flow structures by rewriting A to P. The approach is based on
finite tree automata and involves both neural and symbolic elements in the
underlying web automation language, with the goal of being able to effectively
reason about the webpage contents while still leveraging the underlying webpage
structure. The project is curating a new suite of web automation tasks that are
independently useful for future research beyond this project. The investigator
is collaborating with partners at Michigan (e.g., Women in Science and
Engineering (WISE), Michigan Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation
(MI-LSAMP) and Engineering Center for Academic Success (ECAS)) to increase
participation of students from underrepresented groups in his
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
