The goal of the proposed research is the use of the extensive experience base
of the investigator in sequence design to design and study code sequences for a
code-division (spread-spectrum) multiple-access (CDMA) communication system. The
primary interest is the case when four phase signalling (QPSK) is the modulation
system. The distinguishing feature of the four phase case compared to the binary
case is the symbol alphabet; the symbols in a four phase modulation alphabet
form a ring and not a finite field. In the new design the work proceeds in a
Galois ring. Relationships to previous results are developed. Understanding four
phase sequences as well as as binary sequences are now understood is a long term
goal.
