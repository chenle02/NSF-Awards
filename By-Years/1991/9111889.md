A computer system especially configured for analysis of multi-parameter
coincidence data will be installed in the University of Pennsylvania Tandem
Accelerator Laboratory. The system, by utilizing several processors operating in
parallel, will have a total computing capacity for sorting event- recorded data
comparable to a large mainframe computer. A massively parallel array of
processors and disk drives will be assembled to constitute an "intelligent
memory" to complement the computer system.
