This project will investigate the complexity of problems in
logics.&lt;br/&gt;The focus will be on results that classify the complexity of
an&lt;br/&gt;infinite number of problems. The first such result dates from
1978,&lt;br/&gt;when Schaefer proved his famous dichotomy theorem for
generalized&lt;br/&gt;satisfiability problems. He defined an infinite number of
propositional&lt;br/&gt;satisfiability problems (nowadays usually called Boolean
constraint&lt;br/&gt;satisfaction problems), showed that all these
satisfiability problems are&lt;br/&gt;either in P or NP-complete, and gave a
simple criterion to determine&lt;br/&gt;which of the two cases holds. In recent
years, quite a few dichotomy&lt;br/&gt;theorems have been shown about problems
in logics. Almost all of&lt;br/&gt;these problems have the following three
properties in common: They&lt;br/&gt;are variations of satisfiability, they are
problems in propositional logic,&lt;br/&gt;and they use Schaefer's constraint
framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project's goal is to extend the existing
research in three&lt;br/&gt;different directions, seeking dichotomy theorems for
problems that&lt;br/&gt;are not related to satisfiability, for problems in
logics other than&lt;br/&gt;propositional logic, and for frameworks other than
Schaefer's&lt;br/&gt;constraint
framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through her school's commitment to, as voluntary
cost-sharing,&lt;br/&gt;reduce the proposer's teaching load by one course per
year,&lt;br/&gt;and through the direct support of her summer
months,&lt;br/&gt;this grant will have the broader impact of helping
support&lt;br/&gt;research at an undergraduate institution. This
harmonizes&lt;br/&gt;well with RIT's desire to become a more research-
friendly&lt;br/&gt;institution. The travel support will allow the proposer
and&lt;br/&gt;her students to attend conferences to develop
professionally&lt;br/&gt;via learning of new advances, and presenting their
results to&lt;br/&gt;the broader theory community.&lt;br/&gt;
