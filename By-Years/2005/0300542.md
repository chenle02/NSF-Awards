Micro power supply sources generated directly from biological organisms will
have great impact for systems of all dimensions, starting from nanotechnology,
to microsystems, and to macro scale devices. The motivation of the project came
from the observation of the energy cycle from "nature" - energy in the form of
light coming from sun assists the photosynthesis process in green plants that
convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose. Animals take green plant as the
food for glucose support and in the aerobic respiration process, convert glucose
and oxygen into carbon dioxide, water and ATP (adenosine triphospate). We
propose to extract energy from these energy translation processes by building up
artificial fuel cells to interact with living bacteria for engineering
applications, such as to power nano or micro devices. Moreover, because these
processes actually occur at the cellular level, they are perfect power sources
for nano and micro systems that we will focus our efforts on. Leveraging from
our core competencies in MEMS fabrication and the advantage of high surface
area-to-volume ratio in the small scale for more effective electrodes, we set
the goals of this bacteria-based micro fuel cells as to develop 1) micromachined
microbial fuel cells (mMFC) that use glucose as the fuel and 2) micro
photosynthesis electrochemical cells (mPEC) that convert light to electrical
power with the assistance of bacteria. For broader impacts, PI plans to offer
summer projects for the SUPERB (Summer Undergraduate Program in Engineering
Research at Berkeley) program at UC-Berkeley. The program is targeted to
students of color, first-generation college students, educationally
disadvantaged students, or students from historical minority institutions.
