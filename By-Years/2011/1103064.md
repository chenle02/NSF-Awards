The Earth's radiation belts consist of a population of energetic electrons that
is trapped by the Earth's nominally dipole magnetic field. A major challenge in
radiation belt physics is identifying and describing the various processes that
contribute to the energization of the electrons, and their loss, particularly
uner highly dynamic geomagnetic conditions. The aim of this 3-year project is to
quantitatively understand a newly discovered wave-scattering mechanism, termed
transit-time diffusion, which has the potential to play an important role in
radiation belt energization. This involves scattering by fast magnetosonic
waves, which is a class of waves that has not previously been considered
important for this problem. A combination of modeling and analytical approaches
will be used to answer a number of fundamental questions about this new
mechanism and its relative importance for radiation belt dynamics compared to
other wave processes.

The project will be led and carried out mainly by a team of three early-career
scientist and a graduate student will also be trained as part of the project.
Energetic electron fluxes in the radiation belts constitute an important space
weather concern, as they are known to adversely affect space-based assets upon
which modern society is increasingly dependent. Consequently, better
understanding and prediction of radiation belt dynamics would be of benefit to
society at large.
