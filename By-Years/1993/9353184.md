9353184 deBossenet The proposed research will develop further the symbolic
manipulation system (SMS), which is a unified approach to knowledge
representation, automated reasoning, and simulation of human conversation. With
a symbolic language (SL) to build databases, the project will simulate the
mental associations of human beings when responding to one another in
conversations. The associations usually are based on deductive or probabilistic
relations. The proposed research will extend SMS theory to include non-standard
association and inference with the flexibility to operate in a conversational
mode. The symbolic manipulation system will also handle imprecise and incomplete
information in its inference operations by using SL to represent ambiguity,
vagueness or incompleteness. The significance of the proposed research would be
the advancement of expert systems through the establishment of a nonstandard
theory of association and inference to address problems connected with the
elicitation of imprecise or incomplete knowledge. ***
