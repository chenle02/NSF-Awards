This research is aimed at theoretical exploration of a new computer algorithm
that has been shown experimentally to have a large convergent region. If
successful, this research would re-direct the course of current investigation
into the topic. This is an important area of inquiry to large-scale systems
since the efficient solution of problems of the type described in the proposal
are typically barriers to efficient operation of such systems.
