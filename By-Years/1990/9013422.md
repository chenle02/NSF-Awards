This research program addresses a ground failure phenomenon known as
liquefaction that can result when certain soil deposits, such as loose saturated
sands, are subjected to the strong ground motions induced by earthquakes.
Structures built in or on ground that liquefies are very prone to failure. Most
of the laboratory research on liquefaction has involved experiments on saturated
clean sands, whereas most of the natural deposits susceptible to liquefaction
range from silty sands to sandy silts. There is, therefore, a need to address in
the controlled environment of the laboratory the more difficult problem of the
liquefaction of silty soils. The objective of this research program is to
understand the liquefaction characteristics of silty soils. One of the main
goals is to establish threshold limits for the liquefaction potential of silty
soils in terms or grain size and soil plasticity: the motivation is to improve
the understanding of the liquefaction characteristics of these soils, as well as
their use in remedial measures to improve the resistance to liquefaction at a
particular site. The post- cyclic (that is, post-earthquake) behavior is also
being investigated: it determines the ability of the soil deposit to function
satisfactorily as a foundation material after the ground shaking and resulting
liquefaction has subsided. The results obtained from this research project will
provide the basis for a reasonable estimate of the dynamic stability of a wider
range of naturally occurring soil deposits. The post-cyclic studies should
provide insights into the phenomenon of delayed failure and permanent
deformations of soil deposits subjected to earthquake shaking.
