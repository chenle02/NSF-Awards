The principal investigators continue their research in geometric character
theory and geometric representation theory of unipotent groups over a field of
positive characteristic. They define the "dual space" of such a group as an
algebro-geometric object parameterizing L-packets of character sheaves on the
group. The principal investigators then develop a conjectural geometric theory
of the spectral decomposition of the equivariant derived category with respect
to the dual space, which is similar to the classical decomposition of
representations as direct integrals of irreducible ones. They also formulate
several conjectures on this spectral decomposition in the setting where the
orbit method is applicable and discuss certain related quantization problems in
the theory of tensor categories. The difference between these quantization
problems and the standard ones is that the role of the universal enveloping
algebras is played by group algebras.

The proposed project combines several active directions of current research in
mathematics and mathematical physics -- geometric representation theory,
algebraic geometry, the theory of tensor categories, quantum groups, and
conformal field theory. The notion of geometric spectral decomposition will
deepen our understanding of the general patterns of geometric representation
theory. The research will also lead to new applications of the quantization
philosophy in the theory of tensor categories.
