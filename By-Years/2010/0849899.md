"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Maryland College
Park is awarded a grant to develop new algorithms and a suite of software tools
based on a general and flexible definition of a "network module" in order to
extract meaningful biological clusters from noisy and incomplete protein-protein
interaction data. Recently developed high-throughput techniques are being used
to sample protein-protein interactions from many organisms and are creating a
wealth of data that must be analyzed computationally. A central challenge in the
study of these networks is finding biologically meaningful and interpretable
modules within them. The new tools and algorithms will be used to improve
visualization of protein interaction networks, identify protein complexes and
biological processes embedded within the network data, and to discover redundant
pathways from synthetic lethal interaction data. They will also be applied to
comparing the interaction networks of several different species. The resulting
network analysis software will expand the capabilities of both systems
biologists and biologists working on particular protein complexes and pathways
to make better use of noisy network data, and the proposed visualization
software will vastly improve researchers? capability to interactively explore
these networks. A public database will be created to curate computationally
predicted annotations made by this, and other, projects using this method. The
work will strengthen understanding of the organization of biological networks,
and it will have broader impact by increasing the information technology
infrastructure available for the analysis of interaction data, providing better
transfer of hypotheses between computational biologists and biologists, and by
the training of undergraduates in a summer internship program. Information about
the project and how to access the database and software will be available at the
project website http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/research/bionet/. &lt;br/&gt;
