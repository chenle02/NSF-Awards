This award supports participation in the Mid-Atlantic Mathematical Logic Seminar
(MAMLS), New England Recursion and Definability Seminar (NERDS), and Northeast
Model Theory Days (NEMTD) conference series. These meetings will be held at
various locations and cover a broad spectrum of modern mathematical logic, with
particular emphasis on complexity theory, theoretical computer science,
fragments of arithmetic, pure and applied model theory, proof theory,
computability theory, set theory, subsystems of analysis, and topos theory. The
organizers anticipate holding NERDS and NEMTD meetings twice each year, and the
annual MAMLS meeting every autumn. The first meeting held under the auspices of
this grant will be the New England Recursion and Definability Seminar, in
October 2018 at Wellesley College in Wellesley,
Massachusetts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference series promotes modern
mathematical logic and its applications to other areas of mathematics and
beyond. The invited presentations provide opportunities for the discussion of
the latest developments in the field, and the contributed talk sessions give
graduate students and young researchers opportunities to present their own work,
thereby contributing to their training and professional development. Financial
support to attend the conference will preferentially be given to graduate
students, postdocs, women, and minorities, as well as to junior faculty who may
not otherwise be able to attend the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
