This research is directed toward the development of a process whereby organic
octane enhanceers, currently synthesized from imported petrochemicals, may be
obtained from a domestic renewable resource such as woody biomass. Pyrolysis of
lignocellulosic materials at temperatures above 300oC invariably leads to
levoglucosan and a bewildering variety of alcohols, ketones, acids, and
aldehydes. It has been demonstrated that lignocellulosic materials may be
selectively pyrolyzed at temperatures below 250oC to simple aliphatic ketones
and pyrones through the agency of an inorganic additive. These organic compounds
have have Research Octane Numbers in excess of 100, which makes them suitable
for boosting the octane number of unleaded gasoline.
