The Anthropology Department is using a multiple depth resistance survey system,
a magnetic gradiometer survey system, and an electronic total station in order
to upgrade its archaeology program. The departmental archaeologists are using
this equipment during their summer fieldwork with student assistants in Alaska
and Spain. Other departmental courses can benefit from the availability of
original data produced through the use of these instruments. The equipment is
also being made available to the new Environmental Sciences Program and is
particularly valuable to the geologists involved in that program. Remote sensing
has become a critical aspect of modern archaeological research. As the
archaeological database shrinks and excavation becomes ever more expensive,
methods of noninvasively probing the earth to discover the structure of the
archaeological record without excavating, or with only minimal testing of
interpretations, become ever more attractive. Particularly in environmental
impact analyses, the ability to investigate an area intensively with minimal
disturbance is highly important to successful research. For all of these
reasons, it is necessary to train students in the use of remote-sensing tools
and in the interpretation of their output.
