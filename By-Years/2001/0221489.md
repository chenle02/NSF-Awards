Jumpponen&lt;br/&gt;0221489&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biological diversity
and its function are focal areas in ecology, and the relationship between plant
diversity and ecosystem function has been intensively studied. By contrast, few
studies have addressed the role of mycorrhizal fungi and their diversity even
though they are presumed to be critical in plant nutrient uptake and nutrient
retention. This grant focuses attention on differential nitrogen (N) use among
symbiotic fungi in the roots of ericaceous dwarf shrubs in the arctic. The
researchers will address the role of diverse fungi in plants ability to access
organic and inorganic N sources. Ericoid mycorrhizal (ERM) symbiosis may be the
key to the abundance of ericaceous shrubs in arctic ecosystems as their fungal
symbionts likely utilize organic N sources thus facilitating plant organic N
uptake. Knowledge of ERM diversity and its function is a necessary foundation
for understanding arctic and boreal ecosystem processes. This knowledge is
especially crucial in arctic ecosystems where supply of inorganic N is low and
plant N limitation is strong.
