The goal of this project is to elucidate the dynamics of local vibrational modes
(LVMs) in semi-conductors, and to connect the rates and pathways of vibrational
energy flow to thermally and electronically stimulated defect and impurity
reactions and migration in semiconductors. The ap-proach is to perform high-
resolution infrared absorption spectroscopy, transient bleaching and photon-echo
experiments to measure the vibrational lifetime and dephasing time of point
defects related to H, B, C, O, and N as a function of dopant concentration,
temperature, uniaxial stress and isotope substitution. These studies will assist
evaluation of energy relaxation mechanisms and further understanding of the
interaction of hydrogen with dopant impurities in semiconduc-tors. Materials of
interest include doped Si, Ge, and GaX (X = As, N, P). Additionally, questions
will be addressed regarding vibrational relaxation and transfer channels,
coupling to bending modes, and the role of local structure and crystal site in
the vibrational relaxation process. &lt;br/&gt;%%% &lt;br/&gt;The project
addresses fundamental research issues associated with electronic materials
having technological relevance. An important feature of the project is the
strong emphasis on education, and the integration of research and education. A
major focus of the project will be the education of graduate and undergraduate
students in an interdisciplinary field including modern optics, ma-terials
science and computational modeling.&lt;br/&gt;*** &lt;br/&gt;
