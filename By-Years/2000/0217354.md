The purpose of the Workship is to examine the influence of alliances, networks
and partnerships on the innovation process. This is done to help to help
statisticians measure activities associated with these linkages, to inform
policy makers, and to promote discussion in the research community. It is the
fifth such Workshop initiated by Statistics Canada and the first in partnership
with the National Science Foundation.
