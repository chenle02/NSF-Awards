Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technology and efficiency differ across firms,
countries and people, and shape important economic outcomes such as living
standards and inequality. Further, these differences affect the extent of
cooperation between regions as well as the policies countries implement. This
research develops new models where the degree of similarity in technology across
different agents plays a central role. By establishing a transparent link
between observed data and economic theory, this proposal explores important
questions in international economics such as the role of international
technology transfer in the rise of superstar firms and industry concentration,
the role of innovation and international spillover of ideas in determining
technological change and country growth, and the role of correlated productivity
in shaping economic policies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research applies a
particular representation for technology that flexibly accommodates theories on
the determinants of productivity. By introducing tools from probability theory
and working with max-stable processes, this methodology delivers closed-form
results, which helps to resolve the tradeoff between model tractability and
empirical realism. As a consequence, this project leads to new models that
incorporate previously absent features of the data related to the creation and
transfer of technology across countries as well as correlation in productivity
across regions. This approach allows to understand how technological
fundamentals shape economic outcomes such as economic concentration and
inequality, differences in growth across countries, and both coordinated and
uncoordinated economic policies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
