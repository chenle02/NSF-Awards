9452705 Gaines The University of Miami seeks to initiate a five-week, commuter
EAI Young Scholars Project in ecology for 36 students entering grade 7. To
engender enthusiasm for science and an understanding of ecological principles in
the context of Florida's environment, students will be engaged in activities in
ecology, statistics, computer literacy, writing, and philosophy of science and
ethics. The program will blend interactive discussions, field exercises,
communication exercises and research experiences. Students will be provided
opportunities to engage in research-oriented activities led by an active
researcher at the University of Miami.
