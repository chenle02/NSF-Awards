This award supports the research of Professor Spencer to work in combinatorics.
Specifically, Professor Spencer is developing the Probabilistic Method for use
in dealing with problems in combinatorics. The interplay between discrete
mathematics and computer science suggests an algorithmic viewpoint. Many
probabilistic proofs of existence supply immediately efficient randomized
procedures for the corresponding algorithmic problems, and in some cases these
procedures can be derandomized and converted into deterministic ones. The
research is in the general area of combinatorics. Combinatorics attempts to find
efficient methods to study how discrete collections can be organized. The
behavior of discrete systems is extremely important to modern communications.
For example, the design of large networks, as in telephone systems, and the
design of algorithms in computer science all deal with discrete objects, and
this makes use of combinatorial research.
