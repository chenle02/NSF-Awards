The Elementary School Teacher as a Science Instructor will improve the
confidence to teach science process and inquiry of 25 pairs of elementary Master
Teachers from 25 urban elementary schools in a 28 month program. Two three-week
summer sequences of workshops will include the study of Astronomy and Physics,
Biology and Geology. During the workshops teachers will develop a science
leadership plan to incorporate their learning into the classroom and, with the
aid of their principals, develop the mechanisms by which they will assume the
role of science resource teacher in their schools. During the academic year the
teachers will be supported in implementing their plans by release from teaching
for two days each month and by interacting with the PI and other staff from
Boston University on Saturday mornings, classroom visits, and a hotline.
