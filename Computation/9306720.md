9306720 Caflisch Vortical and convective fluid flows are important for a wide
range of phenomena, such as fluid mixing, flow around airfoils and obstacles,
and turbulence. In this project the investigator undertakes research in three
related topics: (1) Dynamics, instabilities and singularity formation for
axisymmetric, swirling vortex sheets are studied through bifurcation analysis
and numerical computation, with applications to vortex breakdown. (2) The
effective diffusion rate for a convective flow is studied for flows with
randomness and time-dependence. (3) Singularities are investigated for systems
of PDE's through a combination of PDE theory, algebraic geometry (catastrophe
theory), symbolic computation, and numerical simulation. The research in this
proposal is for analysis and numerical computation of complex fluid flows, such
as occur in many problems of scientific and technological importance. Effective
understanding and application of these flows requires a description of both
their microscopic and their macroscopic features. This investigation first
focuses on singularities as a fine-scale phenomena in idealized flows. A
macroscopic description of flows is also developed through homogenization of the
microscopic variations. The results from this study will be important in
assessing the qualitative features of complex flows,as well as in the
development of effective computational methods. ***
