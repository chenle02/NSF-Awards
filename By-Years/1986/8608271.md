The second workshop on "Comparative Studies of Risk Assessment and Management in
the U.S. and Japan" will continue the activities started with the first workshop
that took place in Japan, October 1984. During the meeting, case studies on such
topics flood control, dam safety, groundwater contamination, earthquake and
hazardous waste control will be examined and compared. For each case, areas such
as the assessment of probabilistic risk the handling of uncertainty, the
techniques used for quantifying risk functions, the status of databases, and the
management of information will be discussed. Recommendations for research needed
will be made and proceedings will be published.
