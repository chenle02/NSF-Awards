Melt condensation polymerization techniques are used in the polymer industry
for the synthesis of thermoplastics and specialty polymers. For example,
saturated polyesters (such as poly(ethylene terephthalate) - PET and
poly(butylene terephthalate) - PBT), polyamides, polyarylates, and
polycarbonates are manufactured in either semi-batch or continuous
polycondensation reactors. Many of these processes are characterized by multiple
reaction stages and complex reaction networks that give rise to various unwanted
side products. The pure molten monomers are polymerized in the absence of added
solvents - a more environmentally friendly process than other industrial
polymerization processes. The process is also advantageous because the polymers
can be directly pelletized or spun into fibers. A common feature of industrial
melt polycondensation processes is that multiple reaction stages are employed
using several reactors in series. For PET production, the sequential reaction
procedure includes: (a) monomers, low molecular weight oligomers, and low
molecular weight prepolymers are synthesized in continuous stirred tank
reactors, and (b) the prepolymers are then polymerized to higher molecular
weight polymers in finishing polymerization reactors (often rotating disc
reactors) where large vapor-liquid surface areas are provided. The final polymer
product properties are mostly regulated in this finishing polymerization stage,
therefore the optimal design and operation of this reactor is important and is
the objective this research. Specifically, the PI will address the following
questions: (1) What are the major factors that affect the formation of polymer
films on a rotating disc? What are the quantitative relations between the disc
design/operating variables and film thickness? (2) What is the role of gas
bubbles of condensation byproducts in the mass transfer process? How can one
quantify the effect of gas bubbles on the total vapor- liquid mass transfer
rate? (3) What interactions occur between the neighboring discs and what will be
the optimal layout of multiple discs on the agitator shaft? What will be the
optimal angle of disc immersion in the liquid pool? (4) What is the overall
liquid (polymer melt) flow pattern in the reactor? (5) How does the continuous
finishing reactor behave under various reactor operating conditions and feed
conditions at steady state and transient state? What polymer properties are most
strongly influenced by what reactor variables? How should one pair the polymer
property parameters with reactor operating conditions for the design of product
quality control systems? Both experimental work and reactor modeling will be
done.***//
