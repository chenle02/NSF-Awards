The research objective of this grant is to elucidate the fundamental mechanism
that is responsible for changes in step-growth and free-radical polymerizations
under nanoconfinement. Nanoporous matrices will be used as model confinement
geometries and work will be carried out in both cylindrical and spherical
confinement regimes and with various surface chemistries. Calorimetric and
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) studies will be performed to
determine reaction rates and limiting conversions and will be augmented by
studies of nanoconfined liquid dynamics and structure using optical Keer effect
(OKE) spectroscopy. The investigation will quantify the importance of
confinement-induced changes in liquid structure and liquid dynamics on
reactivity and thermodynamics in confined
polymerizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the proposed study are
important for controlling polymer synthesis at the nanoscale in nanocomposite,
nanolithographic, and nanoelectronic applications. The proposed effort will also
provide excellent state-of-the-art research training for the undergraduate and
graduate students involved, and strong efforts will be made to include under-
represented minorities. Outreach efforts will include involvement of high-school
students in summer research, as well as participation in two successful outreach
programs coordinated by the TTU Institute for the Development and Enrichment of
Advanced Learners (IDEAL), "Super Saturdays," a science-enrichment program for
fourth- to six-graders and "Science - It's a Girl Thing" (SIGT) aimed at
promoting interest in science and engineering for junior high and high school
girls.
