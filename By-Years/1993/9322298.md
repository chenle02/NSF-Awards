9322298 Sokolsky Construction will start on a new instrument, the High
Resolution Fly's Eye (HiRes), to detect cosmic-rays at the very highest energies
yet observed or expected to be observed on earth and determine their spectrum,
angular distribution and composition. It uses the unique air-florescence
technique that has been demonstrated to be very successful in earlier versions
of the Fly's Eye devices. The detector will be constructed at the U.S. Army
Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah, the site of the earlier Fly's Eye apparatus and
a HiRes prototype. The University of Utah group, in collaboration with
physicists from Columbia University, the University of Illinois, and the
University of Adelaide, Australia, will construct in a 5 year period first stage
arrays of 28 mirrors and associated focal-plane phototubes and electronics at
each of two sites separated by 13 km. They contemplate a full system of 54
mirrors per site to be completed at some as yet unspecified later time. ***
