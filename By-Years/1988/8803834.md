The Alexander-Taku terrane boundary in southeast Alaska represents one of the
major tectonic accretionary sutures in the North American Cordillera. Prior work
has shown that the boundary consists of a major west-vergent thrust belt which
formed in middle Cretaceous time in conjunction with the juxta position of the
two terranes and the onset of regional plutonism of the Coast Plutonic Complex.
This renewal project will complete a detailed analysis of the structure of the
thrust belt and its relations with plutonism, and characterization of the
stratigraphic units and depositional relations along the terrane boundary.
Laboratory analysis will include Pb/U zircon and Nd/Sm-Rb/Sr geochronology,
isotopic studies, bulk rock petrochemical studies and shear zone kinematic
analyses. Completion of this research will provide a detailed structural and
stratigraphic analysis of the Alexander- Taku terrane boundary, which will be a
fundamental basis for considering the petrogenesis and structure of the Coast
Plutonic Complex.
