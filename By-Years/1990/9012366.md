Two problems regarding slow shocks in the solar wind will be studied. The first
deals with the formation of shocks associated with coronal mass ejections (CME).
Under various coronal conditions, it should be possible to learn from the
formation process about the nature of CME associated shocks, whether they are
slow shocks, fast shocks, or a combination of both. It will be shown that the
nature of the shocks and the shock strengths are functions of a dimensionless
momentum impact parameter lamda, the plasma beta value and the shock angle
theta. The next step will be a systematic study of MHD shocks in the lamda,
beta, theta space using a planar shock geometry. The final step will be a study
of the formation of MHD shocks with curved shock geometries. The second problem
concerns the three dimensional slow shock reconnection process. The third
dimension of the model adds a new degree of freedom to the flow system, such
that it is possible to obtain exact numerical solutions to the MHD equations for
the slow shock reconnection. The existence of exact solutions means that the
reconnection configuration is consistent with the governing equations of
magnetohydrodynamics, and from the exact solutions, one can derive quantitative
relationships among various parameters such as the rate of reconnection, the
plasma beta value, etc. ***
