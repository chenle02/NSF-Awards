This award supports research on two topics in commutative algebra. The first is
concerned with excellent rings, formal fibres and the relationship between
certain prime ideals of the generic formal fibre of an excellent local domain R
and some birational extensions of R. The second is related to a conjecture by
Lech concerning the behavior of the Hilbert function under faithfully flat
morphisms of local noetherian rings. This is research in the field of algebraic
geometry, one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a
revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origins, it treated
figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely
polynomials. Nowadays, the field makes use of methods not only from algebra, but
from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding application in those
fields as well as in theoretical computer science and robotics.
