This is a collaborative research project between Prof. N. Asgriz of SUNY Buffalo
(USA) and Prof. A. Manchaca-Rocha of UNAM (Mexico) in the area of collisional
dynamics of liquid drops. The objectives are to investigate the influence of
drop shape and drop internal circulation, and to develop a criterion for the
fragmentation of collided drops. This is a combined computational-experimental
study, where the U.S. participant will focus on numerical simulations, and the
Mexican counterpart will contribute with the experimental investigation. Several
simplifying assumption are adopted in the volume tracking simulations, such as
neglecting of the interstitial gas because of high inertial effects. Fundamental
understanding of complex droplet collisions for a large range of variation of
the collision Weber number, as well as obtaining practical fragmentation
correlations, are expected. The project has relevance to a variety of
technologies and natural processes, including spray technology, fuel combustion,
nuclear physics and rain drop dynamics. This project is in response to the NSF-
CONACyT initiative announcement.
