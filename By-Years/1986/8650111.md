The College of Education of New Mexico State University is offering the
opportunity for elementary school principal/teacher teams from rural school
districts in New Mexico to upgrade their science education backgrounds and
expertise. A four-week workshop will involve 30 participants in learning science
concepts, science education methodology, science area content, and demonstration
field trips. The teams will coordinate their efforts toward the development of
units of work which will be shared among the whole group. Follow-up activities
include a series of on-site visits and conferences with teachers and principals.
This project serves a rural, largely Hispanic area, and has a strong bilingual
education component.
