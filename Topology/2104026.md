Understanding the behavior of knotted objects in 3-dimensional spaces is of
fundamental importance in mathematics and the sciences, for example in
understanding DNA. This project investigates the relationship between knotted
loops and knotted objects with branch points. It will show how the properties of
knotted loops affect the properties of these more complicated objects and vice
versa. These connections will elucidate fundamental properties not only of
knotted objects but also the 3-dimensional spaces in which they reside.
Potential areas of application include furthering understanding 3-dimensional
and 4-dimensional spaces, as well as DNA and knotted polymers. Undergraduate
students will make significant contributions to this project and the project
builds mentorship connections between undergraduate and graduate students in
mathematics. This project also supports a summer camp that uses the arts and
math games to build basic numeracy skills in elementary school children who test
below grade level in mathematics.

The PIs have developed the theory of thin position so that it illuminates the
additivity or non-additivity of 3-manifold and knot invariants such as Heegaard
genus, bridge number, tunnel number, and Gabai width. This project will further
develop these tools so that non-additivity behavior can be completely understood
in terms of the structure of knots and spatial graphs. These techniques will
also be used to produce lower bounds on the bridge number of certain
generalizations of satellite knots. Additionally, sutured manifold theory
techniques will be used to study the topological and geometric structure of the
complements of certain knotted spatial graphs of two vertices joined by three
edges.

This project is jointly funded by Topology program and the Established Program
to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
