Mathematical Sciences (21). This project is developing a significant set of
enhancements and extensions to the functionality of WeBWorK, an Internet-based
system for generating and delivering homework problems to students, already in
use at a number of colleges and universities in the country. These enhancements
and extensions are streamlining and modularizing the system code and improving
its functionality, speed and reliability. In addition to acting as a hub to
integrate contributions and ideas from users, the project team is forming a
comprehensive library of WeBWorK problems covering topics such as single and
multivariable calculus, differential equations, finite mathematics, college
algebra, linear algebra, statistics, and other subjects, thus expanding the
current collection of calculus and differential equation problems and
facilitating the sharing and selection of WeBWorK problems. The WeBWorK system
and problem library are expected to be freely distributed to educational
institutions.
