This State-of-the-Art survey award will send Dr. Rameshwar N. Bhargava, of
Philips Laboratories of Briarcliff Manor, New York, to Japan to do an in-depth
critical survey of recent Japanese developments in optical properties of
nanocrystals and nanocom- posites of II-VI semiconductors. Dr. Bhargava will
attend the 5th International Conference on II-VI Compounds and then spend three
weeks visiting related Japanese industrial and academic research institutions
working on the optical properties of nanoclusters and nanocomposites.
