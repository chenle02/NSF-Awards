This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase I proposed innovation is an
optically addressable, dynamically reconfigurable, bi-directional, high-density,
optical interconnect micro-array based on the phenomenon of grating-coupled
surface plasmon resonance). The proposed device addresses the need for dense,
fast, low power dissipation interconnect technology created by highly parallel,
next generation computationalsystems. These systems will require highly dense
connection networks containing many&lt;br/&gt;long-distance connections. In such
highly connected, highly parallel systems, the module-to-module and long
distance chip-to-chip connections are responsible for the majority of the power
dissipation, time delay and surface area. Thus, it has become critically
important to minimize the area, power and time delay of the&lt;br/&gt;chip-to-
chip and module-to-module interconnects while, at the same
time,&lt;br/&gt;increasing density and bandwidth.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential commercial applications effort will find
applicability in a number of commercial markets. These include emerging
interconnect devices in electronics, generalMEMs fabrication and in
photolithography, where it would save time and eliminate expensive photomasking
processes. Other potential markets include&lt;br/&gt;optical processing, certain
applications in telecommunications and other miscellaneous applications for
spatial light modulators. &lt;br/&gt;
