The goal of this project is to develop a stream processing system that captures
data uncertainty from data collection to query processing to final result
generation. This project focuses on data that is naturally modeled as continuous
random variables. For such data, it employs a principled approach grounded in
probability and statistical theory to capture data uncertainty and integrates
this approach into high-volume stream processing. The first contribution of the
project is to capture uncertainty of raw data streams from sensing devices.
Since the raw streams may not present data in a format suitable for query
processing and can be highly noisy, this project employs probabilistic models of
the underlying data generation process and machine learning techniques to
efficiently transform raw data into a desired representation with an uncertainty
metric. The second contribution is to capture uncertainty as data propagates
through various query operators. To efficiently quantify result uncertainty of a
query operator, this project explores various techniques based on probability
and statistical theory to reduce statistics that input streams need to carry and
to expedite the computation of result distributions. This project integrates
research and education through curriculum development and enables broader
participation of women in research through college outreach and CRA's
distributed mentor program. This project also includes software release and
real-world deployments in domains such as object tracking and monitoring and
hazardous weather monitoring, resulting in significant scientific and social
impacts. Results of this project are disseminated at the project web site
