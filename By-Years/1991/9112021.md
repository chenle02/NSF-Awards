This project will provide a commercial Low Energy Electron Microscope (LEEM) to
Arizona State University. It will be one of two such instruments located at
Universities in the United States. The instrument will be located in the Physics
building, next to the NSF supported Center for High Resolution Electron
Microscopy, and will complement the scanning tunneling microscopes as well as
the electron microscopes. Several features distinguish the LEEM from other
microscopes: (a) it uses very low energy illuminating beam, about 10 eV; (b) the
low beam energies are usually below the threshold of electron stimulated
desorption and do practically no damage to the surface; (c) it uses a static
rather than a scanning beam, and thus operates in a parallel detection mode
which allows real-time imaging of surface kinetic processes at video rates with
a lateral resolution of 5 nm. The surface science research group in the
Department of Physics and Astronomy has proposed several experiments aimed at
studying the dynamics of surface processes in real time, such as surface
reconstructions and phase transitions induced by temperature change and/or
adsorbate coverage, surface compound formation and epitaxial growth, step
motions induced by externally applied stress, and influence of defect structure
and defect density on nucleation and growth of thin films. Theoretical models
and simulations of their observations in the LEEM will complement the
experimental effort in order to achieve a full understanding of the surface
processes.
