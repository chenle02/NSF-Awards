This PYI's research is associated with the optical properties of semiconductors.
His principal activity has been in the area of light scattering and he was a
pioneer in studying interference effects in Raman scattering. Some of his
current research involves light scattering from semiconductor heterostructure
interfaces. He is also collaborating with G. Maracas on the physics and
engineering of brand offsets in strained-layer semiconductor heterojunctions.
There is also a second collaboration with H. Hochst in the growth and
characterization of amorphous tin-germanium alloys. The PYI award will allow
this investigator to complete the installation of a sophisticated light
scattering laboratory and to concentrate in opening new research areas.
