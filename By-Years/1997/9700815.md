EEC-9700815 Kriz Abstract This award provides funding to Virginia Polytechnic
Institute and State University, under the direction of Dr. Ronald Kriz, for the
support of a Combined Research-Curriculum Development project entitled,
"Combined Research-Curriculum Development: Computer Simulation of Material
Behavior--From Atomistic to the Continuum Level." This project will focus on the
range of computer simulations covering and linking the physical length scales
necessary for taking a material from laboratory to the marketplace. A sequence
of two courses is proposed in which state-of-the-art computer hardware and
software will be used to teach the concepts and techniques of modern material
performance simulation. The courses will have Web-Java based modules on specific
topics in atomistic aspects of Materials Science and Micromechanics and will
stress the way in which macroscopic materials properties are controlled by
phenomena at the atomistic and microstructural levels.
