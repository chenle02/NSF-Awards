Two research projects will be supported by the acquisition of a high resolution
graphics display terminal. The first is three dimensional modeling of the brain
from two dimensional tomographic slices. The second is the simulation of
numerically controlled tool paths for a five axis machine center. The display
terminal will provide a needed visualization tool. High resolution graphics
terminals are necessary in order to see what one is computing. The equipment
provided by this grant will give two research groups the needed visualization
capability. The first group will use the terminal to map out, in three
dimensions, functional structures of the human brain using data from tomographic
studies. The second group will use the terminal to examine, under simulation,
the machining of metal parts.
