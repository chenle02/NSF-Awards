This research project naturally sits at the intersection of representation
theory and geometry. Representation theory is a branch of mathematics devoted to
the study of symmetries that occur in nature using techniques from linear
algebra, for example the study of symmetries in three-dimensional space or more
generally the study of continuous symmetries of mathematical objects and
structures (known as theory of Lie groups). Geometric methods have been very
successful in solving problems in representation theory. The main goal of this
project is to study various questions in representation theory using geometric
methods. The PI will attack several longstanding problems concerning dualities
for Lie groups. The PI will also investigate applications of representation
theory to algebraic geometry, number theory, and related areas. Differential
equations and integrable systems whose coefficients are residues modulo a prime
are the subject of the other parts of the research
project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, three projects will be pursued. In
the first project, a generalized Springer correspondence will be developed for
symmetric spaces. This project is closely related to deep questions in algebraic
geometry, real groups, and harmonic analysis on p-adic groups. In the second
project, the geometry of the so-called wonderful compactification of symmetric
spaces will be used to prove Soergel's Koszul duality conjecture for real
groups. In the third project, a theory of Hitchin fibrations for higher-
dimensional varieties will be developed with the goals of constructing a non-
abelian Hodge theory and establishing the geometric Langlands correspondence in
positive characteristic for higher-dimensional varieties.
