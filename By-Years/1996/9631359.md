Abstract Rochberg et al The analysis group in the Mathematics Department is
currently expanding the components of its research and training program related
to new computational tools in analysis, particularly those in harmonic analysis
associated with wavelets. In addition to furthering the group's advanced
research in those areas, the support described will enable them to develop a
Bachelors/Masters level curriculum titled "Mathematical method in multimedia
signal processing". The support will also allow them, in cooperation with other
units of the University, to create a signal processing working group which will
serve as a training ground for undergraduates, advanced degree candidates, and
postdoctoral researchers. Wavelets and related techniques of waveform analysis
were first introduced as theoretical tools in mathematics and mathematical
physics. In addition to becoming a very active area of mathematical research
they have also proved to be an extremely fertile source of new numerical
techniques of broad utility. This proposal will allow to develop a curriculum
which will mix theoretical and computational work and which will enable us to
bring students to state-of-the-art understanding in both the theory and the
applications of these exciting new mathematical and computational tools.
