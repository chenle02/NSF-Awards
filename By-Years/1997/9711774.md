John M Faustini Oregon State University The doctoral dissertation research will
test dominant hypotheses about controls on mountain stream channel morphology
using unique long term data sets from the H.J. Andrews LTER site. The
hierarchical study design involves scaling up from the channel unit scale by
characterizing channel morphology, relating channel response to fluvial
processes, and interpreting channel morphology and response to floods at cross-
section sites in relation to geomorphic context. The work will also evaluate
geomorphic thresholds as predictors of the type and magnitude of channel
response. Use will be made of an existing data base of over 1400 cross section
measurements spanning the period from 1978 to 1996. Additional work will
supplement this data base. The relationship between observed channel/valley
floor responses and indices of landscape structure and condition will be
explored using a GIS analysis. The results will provide an improved
understanding of mountain stream channel dynamics which is critical in a
theoretical sense but also for siting and design of engineered structures.
