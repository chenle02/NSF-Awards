The objectives of this proposal are (1) to enrich the variable selection
alternatives by merging ideas from the variable selection and dimension
reduction areas, and (2) develop variable screening procedures using alternative
methods of association learning. The specific goals include: a) develop post-
dimension reduction model checking procedures, b) develop variable selection
procedures using the model checking procedures and multiple testing ideas, c)
develop dimension reduction procedures for very high dimensional data using
matrix regularization, d) develop variable screening based on partial
correlation learning, e) develop variable screening using nonparametric
association learning.

In many areas of contemporary research, including gene expression and proteomics
studies, biomedical imaging, functional magnetic resonance imaging, tomography,
tumor classifications, signal processing, image analysis, finance, text
retrieval and climate studies, the data collected include a large number of
variables with only a few of them being relevant for prediction. Procedures for
identifying the relevant predictors have mostly been developed under certain
model assumptions and may fail to discern the relevance of some important
predictors. The proposed research aims at developing variable screening and
variable selection procedures which do not rely on potentially restrictive
modeling assumptions.
