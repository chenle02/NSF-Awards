One of the central issues in fixed point theory is to compute the Nielsen number
of a self map of a compact manifold X. This problem is closely related to
understanding induced twisted conjugacy classes in the fundamental group of X. A
related question is the coincidence problem of two maps from X to Y. A special
case is a Borsuk-Ulam type problem. Wong proposes three sets of problems on (i)
the study of the Reidemeister number; (ii) the study of the positive
codimensional coincidence problem when the dimension of X is greater than that
of Y ; and (iii) combinatorial approaches to Borsuk-Ulam type
problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topological fixed point theory is a classical
topic which generated much research in algebraic topology during the first half
of the twentieth century. This proposal concerns the calculation of Nielsen
numbers, an invariant in fixed point theory. Nielsen numbers have been shown to
have applications in dynamical sysytems and nonlinear analysis. Wong proposes to
study Nielsen numbers in some especially difficult situations where another more
easily computed invariant, the Reidemister number, may differ from the Nielsen
number. Combinatorial approaches to these calculations are also envisioned.
