Yuen &lt;br/&gt;Vasilyev &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wavelets represent a new
mathematical tool, developed mostly over the last &lt;br/&gt;fifteen years. The
fundamental strength of wavelets lies in its inherent ability &lt;br/&gt;to
achieve very high resolution locally using relatively few localized functions,
called wavelets. However, its application in solid-earth geophysics has remained
relatively limited. In this three-year proposal a multidisciplinary team,
steeped in the skills of applied mathematics, numerical analysis, fluid dynamics
and theoretical &lt;br/&gt;geophysics, will employ the latest tools from
wavelets to address two classes of &lt;br/&gt;geophysical problems. These
include finite-amplitude viscoelastic deformation in strongly variable viscosity
media where thermo-mechanical coupling and mechanical compaction play mutually
interacting roles, and modeling of gravity currents in both 2D and 3D geometries
with strong thermo-mechanical coupling from variable viscosity and viscous
heating. The aim is to disseminate the use of wavelets to the geophysical
community in frontier research and basic education of graduate and undergraduate
students. &lt;br/&gt;
