The properties of microwave/millimeter wave nonlinear magnetic excitations in
bulk and thin film magnetic materials are to investigated experimentally. Two
key manifestations of nonlinear dynamics in magnetic systems will be studied:
(1) high-frequency spin wave solitons, and (2) nonlinear spin-wave-interaction-
driven auto-oscillations and chaos. The primary tools for these studies will be
Brillouin light scattering, utilizing/high contrast and high-resolution Fabry-
Perot interferometry, and microwave/millimeter wave pulse techniques.
