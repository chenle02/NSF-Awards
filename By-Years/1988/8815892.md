This award will support a seminar on "Mitochondrial Biogenesis - Mechanism and
Pathobiology," organized by Prof. Roderick A. Capaldi of the University of
Oregon and Prof. Takayuki Ozawa of the University of Nagoya, Japan. Participants
will meet in Honolulu, Hawaii, December 4-6, 1989 to exchange recent research
results and promote future joint research projects. The seminar will deal with
the biogenesis of the mitochondria, mitochondrial diseases, and in particular
the role of mitochondrial DNA in human diseases. Research in this field has
progressed rapidly, but is usually conducted and reported along narrow
disciplinary lines. This seminar, on the other hand, will bring together
biochemists, geneticists, molecular biologists, and clinicians in an attempt to
find common threads, related to mitochondrial genetic variations, in the
propagation of a variety of human diseases. This interdisciplinary and
international discussion of some of the latest research results in this area
could have important implications in medicine.
