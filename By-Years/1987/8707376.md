This project is a paleomagnetic study of rocks of Carboniferous-Jurassic age
from five locations in northern and northwestern China. The results should
contribute significantly to the solution of three major problems in the tectonic
evolution of China: namely, the configuration of terranes of northern China
during this time, the amalgamation of the North and South China Blocks, and the
accretion of China to Siberia. The sampling locations in key areas were selected
in consultation with Chinese geologists at the Lanzhou Institute of Geology
according to the ages of rocks desired, excellence of exposure, suitability of
lithologies for paleomagnetic study, and goodness of structural and age control.
