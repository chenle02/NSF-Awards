This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) will help the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Colorado purchase a parallel
processing computer. This equipment will enhance research in a variety of areas
including reactions studies relevant to atmospheric chemistry, fundamental
studies of molecular reactivity, and aspects of materials. A network of fast,
modern computer workstations is a new way to satisfy the computing needs of
chemistry departments. Such a `computer network` also serves as a development
environment for new theoretical codes and algorithms, provides graphics and
visualization facilities, and supports research in state-of-the-art applications
of parallel processing.
