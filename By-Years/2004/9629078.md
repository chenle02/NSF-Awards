Proposal Number: DMS-9629078 Gallian With one exception, every year since 1977,
the principal investigator has directed a summer undergraduate research program
in discrete mathematics at the University of Minnesota, Duluth. The program has
an extraordinary record of attracting the nation's top talent and producing
professional level research. Over the years a tradition has evolved whereby
former program participants who are in graduate school or have obtained a Ph.D.
have returned for lengthy visits to assist with the program. The visitors take
part in all aspects of the program and serve as live-in councilors and role
models for the undergraduates.
