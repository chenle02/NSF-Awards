The Chautauqua program provides an annual series of workshops in which scholars
at the frontiers of various sciences and engineering meet intensively for
several days with undergraduate college science teachers. These workshops
provide an opportunity for invited scholars to communicate new knowledge,
concepts, and techniques directly to college teachers in ways which are
immediately beneficial to their teaching. The primary aim is to enable
undergraduate teachers in the sciences to keep current and relevant. This
program is national in scope and will immediately benefit large numbers of
college faculty (7,500 participants over three years) who in turn positively
influence more than 1,000,000 undergraduates. This program which has impact on
the quality of undergraduate programs in both two- and four-year institutions is
an essential element in attracting and maintaining an adequate supply of
graduates in science, mathematics and engineering. The program follows the
recommendation of the National Science Board that the Foundation use highly
leveraged program support to address the serious national problems in
undergraduate education. The project is 1/3 supported by NSF.
