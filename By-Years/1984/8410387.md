In this study, sophisticated spectroscopic investigation of mixed metal oxide
catalysts containing tin, antimony, molybdenum, and/or iron is being conducted.
These catalysts are used in a number of important industrial processes, but are
poorly understood. Emphasis will be placed on the relations between
preparational procedures, catalyst structure, catalyst activity, and
selectivity. This proposal represents a considerable broadening of the use of
Raman techniques in the study of catalysts.
