This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2). In this project, funded by the Mathematical and
Physical Sciences Directorate and housed in the Chemistry Division, Professor
Oriana Fisher and her students at Lehigh University will study the behavior of
copper ions in bacteria using a wide range of chemical and biochemical
techniques. The research will provide a detailed understanding of how bacteria
process copper, and this will help lead to a better understanding of the
chemistry of antibiotic resistance. Dr. Fisherâ€™s plan to pilot a summer research
program that will recruit students from groups underrepresented in science will
broaden participation in chemistry at Lehigh and will provide long-term
mentoring of a cohort of underrepresented minority students as they navigate the
transition from undergraduate the graduate school.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Fisher will biophysically and structurally
elucidate proteins that orchestrate copper acquisition in Bacillus subtilis,
with the aims of elucidating how Cu is recognized and chaperoned extracellularly
and investigating the structural and biophysical basis for transcriptional
control of the ycn operon, which may hold a key to understanding bacterial
copper acquisition and regulation. While copper export proteins are highly
conserved throughout evolution, copper importers in bacteria appear to be
completely distinct from their eukaryotic counterparts. Previous studies have
focused on this problem&lt;br/&gt;primarily from a biological perspective;
research under this award will provide new insight into a molecular level
understanding of proteins that govern these processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
