The dynamics group in the Department of Mathematics at the University of
Maryland, College Park, seeks support for a dynamics conference in spring of the
years 2004, 2005 and 2006. This represents our half of the Semi-annual Workshop
in Dynamical Systems and Related Topics, cosponsored for the last 12 years by
the dynamics groups of Maryland and Penn State. The organizers will rotate among
the dynamics group, including K. Berg, M. Boyle, M. Brin, D. Dolgopyat, B. Hunt,
M. Jakobson, D. Rudolph, and J. Yorke. Each year 2 or 3 of us will organize the
meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this conference are to promote the
communication of mathematical results; to facilitate interaction and progress in
dynamical systems and related fields; to nurture the sense of community and
common mission in these fields; and to contribute to the training of graduate
students and recent Ph.D. recipients and to their integration into the dynamics
community.
