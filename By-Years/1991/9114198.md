Title: U.S.-Australia Joint Seminar: Perspective of Plant Carbon and Water
Relations from Stable Isotopes; Riverside, CA; 1992 This award will support the
participation of seven U.S. scientists in a U.S.-Australia joint seminar on
plant carbon and water relations emerging from stable isotope analyses.
Participants will discuss and exchange recent experimental results on such
topical areas as isotope effects in plant processes, environmental effects on
carbon isotope discrimination and water-use efficiency, genotypic differences in
water-use efficiency and interpreting plant hydrogen and oxygen isotopic
composition. Seminar co-organizers are Dr. James Ehleringer of the University of
Utah and Dr. Graham Farquhar of the Australian National University in Canberra.
The seminar will take place during the first half of 1992 in Riverside,
California. Local arrangements are being coordinated by staff of the University
of California, Riverside, and is held under the auspices of the U.S.-Australia
Cooperative Science Program. The applications of stable isotope technologies to
the plant sciences in recent years have had a significant impact on increasing
the understanding of plant gas exchange, water relations, and photosynthesis
from genetics levels through ecosystem levels, and across such fields of study
and application as agriculture, forestry and ecology. Much of this research has
been driven by U.S. and Australian scientists. This seminar will provide an
opportunity for the exchange of information and ideas on the topic subject, and
will promote possible future joint research projects.
