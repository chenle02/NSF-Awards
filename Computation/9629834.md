Zellner 9629834 the investigator and colleagues organize a workshop on Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. These techniques, originally developed in
mathematics and physics, have come to be of great importance in many sciences
and fields of application. Their use allows researchers and applied workers to
solve many theoretical and applied problems. While MCMC techniques have already
been shown to be of great value, more work has to be done to improve them. For
example, new methods are being developed to speed convergence of MCMC
techniques, to check on the convergence and accuracy of MCMC output, and to
provide computer systems and programs needed to implement MCMC techniques in a
user-friendly, interactive environment. These are a subset of the topics,
including new applications, that are discussed at the workshop. the investigator
and colleagues organize a workshop on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
techniques. Monte Carlo techniques are ways to make probabilistic estimates of
quantities. For example, the volumes of a complicated shape can be estimated by
making random samples of the shape when embedded in a simpler shape. MCMC
techniques have already been of great value in solving important problems in
science, industry and government. In this connection, models are employed to
explain past behavior, predict future outcomes and evaluate proposed policies.
Deriving good solutions involves needed calculations that are best carried out
by use of MCMC techniques in many instances, e.g. in connection with the
analysis of global warming, financial asset-pricing, industry personnel
decisions, on-line quality control and governmental policy problems. Better MCMC
techniques, and more informed users of them, contribute to better solutions to
these and other private and public scientific and policy problems.
