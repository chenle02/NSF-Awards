9618661 Gieskes This award will support collection and analysis of piston cores
from the transition zone between subduction and collision south of Taiwan, in
order to evaluate sedimentologic processes and evidence of fluid advection
during the early developmental stages of an active arc-continent collision.
Field work will be completed as part of a joint project aboard a Taiwanese
research vessel in which Taiwanese scientists are examining the texture and
physical properties of margin sediments. The significance of this project lies
in the value of constraining active sedimentary processes and fluid expulsion in
modern, arc- continent collision to provide a model for use in examining such
settings now incorporated into the continental record. additionally, this work
will provided the regional geologic context within which to evaluate the results
from deep sea drilling which has been proposed for the Taiwanese margin.
