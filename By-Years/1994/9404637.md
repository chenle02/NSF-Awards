9404637 Zelditch The research covers several topics in the general area of
spectral analysis and geometry. Particular attention is to be paid to the
geometry of Laplace type operators and the relationship of Schroedinger
operators and stationary phase. Random walks on Lie groups studied in view of
Fourier integral operators, is also to be pursued. The possible applications of
this research may apply to chaotic phenomena arising in quantum dynamical
systems and to other fields of current interest in mathematical physics. ***
