9311614 Richardson This project, supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and
Organometallic Chemistry Program, will utilize ion cyclotron resonance
spectroscopy for the study of gas phase reactions between transition metal
complex ions that have direct solution analogues. The primary focus of the work
is to understand the effects of solvation on the reactivity of such species in
the condensed phase. Of special interest are electron transfer equilibria of
substituted ruthenocenes, the reactivity of Group 4 complexes with olefins and
alkynes, and the thermochemistry and spectroscopy of high charge, or high mass,
ions that are to be produced by electrospray ionization. A new ionization source
will be developed for the latter application, which will involve divalent metal
complex ions and small proteins. %%% This project seeks to understand the ways
in which the interaction of the solvent with solutes affects their chemical
reactivity. The results of these studies may be used to improve industrial
polymerization catalysts, improve solar energy conversion devices, and to better
understand and control biological processes. ***
