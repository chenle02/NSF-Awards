9506502 FISCHER This research is to use S-wave splitting to constrain subduction
zone anisotropy. Initial results indicate that in subduction zones with an
oceanic upper plate and active back-arc spreading (Tonga, Izu-bonin and the
Marianas), shear-wave splitting manifests a fast direction roughly parallel to
the azimuth of convergence. In regions where the upper plate is quasi-
continental (north-central Japan, the Kamchatka peninsula, and the eastern
Aleutians) fast directions are roughly perpendicular to the direction of
convergence. The focus of this work will be to better resolve the location,
orientation and strength of subduction zone anisotropy. An existing three-
dimensional finite-difference method will be modified for the calculation of
synthetic seismograms in anisotropic media. This method will aid in
distinguishing waveform perturbations due to anisotropy from those caused by
other subduction zone structure. ***
