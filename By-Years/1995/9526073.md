9552596 Davis The Virgin Islands (VI) Department of Education proposes to
formalize and extend initial reform planning activities begun under the
Governor's Initiative on Science &amp; Technology, which resulted in a variety
of programmatic initiatives focused on curriculum, teachers, technology and lab
equipment. There is ample evidence of the need for comprehensive reform of k-12
education in VI: (1) there is only one university, and 80% of the students are
admitted with deficiencies in mathematics and science; (2) "virtually all
standard instruments used to measure student achievement in VI indicate that the
students are performing poorly." Compounding the problem, 43% of the 22,000 K-12
students live in poverty; 70% are eligible to receive a free lunch, and 1/3 live
in single parent homes. A one-year self-study grant is proposed. Expected
outcomes include a full implementation proposal for systemic reform. The goal of
the VI Systemic Initiative will be to improve the educational system while
developing local science and technology talent to insure the economic survival
of the islands. This includes the development of the teacher and administrative
workforce and students; revision of education policies (curriculum;
certification); the creation of a student assessment program, a communications
system and precollege programs. ***
