9732222 Jiracek The SAGE (Summer of Applied Geophysical Experience) program
gives upper class undergraduate and graduate students an intensive field-based
geophysical research experience using modern geophysical techniques to study
significant geophysical problems. Since the beginning in 1983, 370 undergraduate
and graduate students have participated in hands-on geophysical research into
the tectonics of the Rio Grande rift using the methods of seismic reflection and
refraction, gravity, magnetics, electrical resistivity, and electromagnetics.
Recently students have also engaged in the geophysical characterization of
material disposal sites at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and of a
groundwater basin in New Mexico. NSF-supported Research Experience for
Undergraduates (REU) students from large and small schools alike share the
excitement of SAGE. Students participate in every phase of the field program:
they collect data with the most advanced equipment, they process and interpret
the data with work stations and PCs, and they present their results in both oral
and written form. The interaction between the students and faculty at SAGE is
especially close in an environment approaching that of co-workers. ***
