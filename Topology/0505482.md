This proposal concerns the application of Algebraic Topology to the
classification of high dimensional manifolds. The PI and collaborators have
recently shown that every finite loop space is homotopy equivalent to a compact,
smooth manifold, solving a 40 year old problem posed by Browder, motivating
Surgery Theory. This still leaves open the question whether all finite H-spaces
have this property. The conjectures of Borel, Novikov, Baum-Connes and Farrell-
Jones assert that the assembly maps in K- and L-theory are either monomorphisms
or isomorphisms. All these assembly maps can be expressed in terms of controlled
algebra, an area the PIU intends to continue working on, to obtain results for
larger classes of groups.

A manifold is a geometrical object which locally is like euclidean space, but
may be curved globally such as a sphere. These spaces arise both in mathematics
and in Physics. Manifolds have been studied by topologists for over a hundred
years as they hold the key to understanding the nature of space. The PI proposes
to extend vurrent algebraic classification methods to achieve a deeper geometric
understanding. Of particular significance is controlled algebraic methods, which
capture the essence of both algebra and topology
