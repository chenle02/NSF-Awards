This proposal describes plans to fabricate and test a buoy mounted radar (915
MHz) wind profiler for remote sensing of the marine boundary layer. During Phase
I the PIs solved a variety of technical challenges, including the development of
two algorithms to compensate the radar for buoy motion; development of a novel
antenna design to achieve multiple beams and low sidelobes from a single, planar
aperture; and development of a radar capable of unattended operation for periods
of several months, using only solar cells, storage batteries, or a small propane
generator. The PI requests funds to develop a prototype of all profiler
subsystems, testing the prototype system at sea under a variety of weather
conditions, validating the performance of the prototype system using balloon
launched radiosondes, and marketing the MBL Profiler in at least two
configurations.
