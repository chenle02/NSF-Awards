Profs. Manogue and Dray will investigate topics in mathematical physics
connected with the behavior of waves in unusual geometries due to gravitational
fields. These studies may help to understand possible phenomena to be expected
in a quantum theory of gravitation. Among the topics to be investigated are the
effects of change in topology and signature of the matric; field theory in
rotating spacetimes; and the octonionic superstring.
