Interactive PC-Based Scanning Electron MicroscopyThis project develops an
innovative laboratory for the teaching of scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
Although SEM is one of the most heavily used and depended upon of all analytical
techniques in the materials field, it has been extremely difficult to teach
because of the single-user nature of SEM instruments up to now. The laboratory
consists of a network of PC-based engineering workstations linked to a state-of-
the-art SEM, and provides up to 20 or more students with direct, simultaneous,
interactive access to the SEM. All controls, functions, and features of SEM, and
all image and data analysis software and control are available at each
workstation. This approach allows undergraduates extended exposure to advanced
SEM methodologies.
