The project in algebraic geometry is a study of varieties, which are geometric
spaces defined by polynomial equations. Among all geometric spaces, varieties
have the advantage of being easier to study from a computational viewpoint.
Moreover, since every space can be approximated by varieties, they are crucial
construct for algebraic geometers. Inspired by the study of spaces with a metric
satisfying certain Einstein field equations, the main aim of the proposal is to
provide a new framework to understand varieties which are positively curved, in
both global and local settings. One focus will be how these varieties vary in
families, and degenerate to others with more special structures.

There are several research thrusts to this project. First, the PI aims to solve
the local higher rank finite generation conjecture, and thus, complete the local
stability theory by establishing the stable degeneration conjecture for any
Kawamata log terminal singularity. In addition, the project includes
investigation into the moduli theory for general Fano varieties without a
K-stability assumption and a study of K-stability for explicit examples of Fano
varieties. There are also aims to combine birational and non-archimedean
geometry together to understand degenerations of Calabi-Yau manifolds. Graduate
students will participate in the research project.
