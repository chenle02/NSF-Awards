They will investigate charge density wave dynamics (depinning, damping,
polarization) in the low-temperature, high-field regime, and to study the
crossover from the low-temperature, undamped, rigid charge density wave to the
high-temperature, overdamped, deformable charge density wave. The experimental
task will focus on the search for charge density wave coherent response, such as
narrow band noise, interference experiments, temperature dependence of the
threshold field, and polarization, and, if time permits, the magnetic field
effects on niobium selenium3.
