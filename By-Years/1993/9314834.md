9314834 Snyder This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research
in computer and computation research between Wayne Snyder, Boston University and
Pierre Lescanne of the CNRS' Center for Research in Information Sciences and
INRIA (The French National Institute for Information Sciences and Applied
Mathematics). The objective of the research is to develop more powerful theorem
proving programs using completion and paramodulation-based techniques. They
propose to investigate applications of paramodulation and completion developed
at Boston University and in France. They will also undertake the development of
a new version of ORME (a term-rewriting software system currently used in
France). This project takes advantage of French expertise in term- rewriting.
The U.S. investigator will use the French developed software, ORME, for testing
his ideas. He brings to this collaboration expertise in integrating methods of
theorem proving with those of term-rewriting. The proposed research will advance
the use of completion-like techniques in software engineering. ***
