The catastrophic and deadly floods affecting eastern Kentucky during the last
few days of July 2022 provide an unprecedented opportunity to understand within
a geologic context the distribution of potentially harmful contaminants in
recent flood deposits in a way that will help inform future public health
assessments and interventions in public health, geology, and climate science.
With a multidisciplinary team bringing together expertise in geomorphology,
sedimentology, geohealth, epidemiology, and toxicology, the researchers will
perform a rapid evaluation of flood deposit geomorphology and toxicity in the
wake of an unprecedented flood event in eastern Kentucky.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research goals are to measure the extent, morphology,
and stratigraphy of mappable flood deposits within key selected drainages
affected by the July 2022 floods in eastern Kentucky, and to measure the
distribution and timing of metals, organics, and other contaminants with public
health implications within the newly deposited sediments. The team will use
geomorphological mapping, UAV-based lidar microtopographic surveys, digital
terrain modeling, and both field- and lab-based geochemical sampling to begin
understanding the geologic and hydrologic controls on contaminant distribution
of the flood deposits. In addition to identifying the instantaneous spatial
variability of recent flood deposit geochemistry, the research will form the
foundation for future long-term studies of flood sediment deposition,
contaminant migration and fate. It will also inform on how steep mountain
landscapes respond to catastrophic flooding events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
