Memory hierarchy performance, and cache memory performance in particular, is the
limiting factor in most or all modern computers. The machine cycle time is
usually limited by the cache access time. Cache misses and slow main-memory
access times significantly increase mean instruction execution time. Shared bus
multiprocessor designs are limited in overall performance by bus bandwidth, and
bus traffic declines with cache effectiveness. Finally, multiprocessing in an
environment with caches requires a mechanism to maintain memory consistency.
This research is focusing on a number of the following topics: (1) develop and
evaluate hardware-based cache consistency algorithms, and extend their utility
beyond common bus design; (2) develop and evaluate efficient algorithms for
trace-driven simulation ?beyond those already known!; (3) quantify the effect of
cache parameter selection; (4) investigate the design and use of caches in a
vector processor; (5) study the effect of bus design ?in particular, the IEEE
Futurebus design! and its proper use to maximize performance; (6) further
develop and evaluate software-based cache consistency algorithms; (7)
investigate the feasibility of virtually addressed cache designs in realistic
systems; (8) evaluate cache performance via hardware measurement; (9) further
characterize program behavior and cache workloads; (10) develop and evaluate
better cache prefetch algorithms; (11) examine possible optimizations for caches
or ROMs with unchanging code ?e.g. microcode caches!; (12) evaluate the utility
and design of instruction buffers in systems which may also have instruction
caches; (13) evaluate the utility of multilevel caches as a function of
technology; (14) look at the most appropriate designs for cache controller
chips; and (15) study TLB design. This project focuses on a number of problems
contributing to the limitation of the performance of high-speed computers.
Results will contribute to the alleviation of some of the bottlenecks.
