The present effort involves the research into the interface between optical
transmission and electronic devices and circuits. This is one of the most
challenging problems to be faced in future opto-electronic systems and is an
area in which a significant University based activity is lacking. The research
relating to this effort will impact future optical communications, local area
network, and optical signal processing systems.
