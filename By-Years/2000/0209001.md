The constant enhancements in capabilities of palmtop, embedded
and&lt;br/&gt;wearable devices, together with the advent of pervasive
connectivity,&lt;br/&gt;represents a new paradigm for interaction among devices.
A new vista&lt;br/&gt;is open for research in the area of mobile data management
where&lt;br/&gt;mobile devices gather and exchange information from not just
wired&lt;br/&gt;sources, but also their environment and one another. Each device
is&lt;br/&gt;both a data source and a data consumer pursuing its individual
and&lt;br/&gt;collective tasks. New ideas are proposed for a research program
aimed&lt;br/&gt;at realizing ubiquitous computing systems based on the
cooperation of&lt;br/&gt;autonomous, dynamic and adaptive components (hardware
as well as&lt;br/&gt;software) which are located in vicinity of one another.
This is&lt;br/&gt;significantly different from ``infrastructure-based''
mobile&lt;br/&gt;client/server computing between PDAs and network services.
The&lt;br/&gt;proposed research will enable a new class of applications
that&lt;br/&gt;effectively exploit mobility and pervasive computing. New
prototypes&lt;br/&gt;and applications will be built in the context of mobile
information&lt;br/&gt;management within dynamic communities of ad-hoc services
and&lt;br/&gt;devices. The research team is part of the eBiquity research
group&lt;br/&gt;located at The University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC)
and&lt;br/&gt;will closely interact with collaborators from industry including
IBM,&lt;br/&gt;Fujitsu, and HP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
