9552983 Serrell Under the Small Grants for Exploratory Research Guidelines,
Serrell and Associates will do "A Meta-Analysis of Visitor Time/Use in Museum
Exhibitions." The research will examine the long considered and debated
questions revolving around visitors expenditure of their time (duration and
allocation) in science museums exhibits. Serrell will undertake the largest,
systematic study of its kind. Using a large number of systemically made
observations of visitors time/use, baseline data will be developed that will
answer some of the fundamental questions about visitor's movements in an
exhibit. This work builds on and expands, considerably, the current data base of
observations from 48 exhibits to over 100 exhibitions. This is not a new
research topic but it is one that deserves more attention because it has not
been studied systematically. Researchers generally assume a positive correlation
between time spent on task and learning but beyond that there are a number of
provocative questions and unverified theories. Many questions lack sufficient
data to draw conclusions. This study will provide statistical correlations
between variables observed and will be absed on large, methodologically similar
database, which does not currently exist.
