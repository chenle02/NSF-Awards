This award will partially support the production of a documentary video that
will be used as a high school/college teaching tool and will also be suitable
for airing on public television. The purpose of the video is to improve the
public's perception of mathematics and thereby encourage an increased number of
students to pursue careers in the mathematical sciences. This will be
accomplished by portraying the human side of mathematical discovery and
creativity. This project is being supported by the Divisions of Astronomy,
Materials Research, Mathematics, and Physics within the Directorate of
Mathematics and Physical Sciences, and the Division of Elementary, Secondary,
and Informal Education within the Directorate of Education and Human Resources.
