ABSTRACT Proposal Number: CTS-9614207 PI: Argrow This is an SGER grant to
develop advanced computational methods for dense gases that display non-
classical behavior. Recent numerical simulations of transient shock tube flows
and steady flows of dense gases over airfoils display a number of phenomena that
have not been previously observed either experimentally or computationally. The
utilization of this non-classical behavior in practical applications has been
the subject of debate for many years. The most obvious application is the use of
this class of fluids as the working fluid in a Rankine cycle for power
generation where efficiency could be improved. the focus of the computational
technique will be on developing coupled thermodynamic equations of state/fluid
dynamic algorithms.
