The University of Illinois will carry out the project, "Teacher Preparation
Archives: Case Studies of NSF-funded Middle School Math and Science Teacher
Preparation Projects." The project will analyze and evaluate the nine middle-
school teacher preparation projects funded through a program solicitation in
1985-86 and will archive information and materials from these projects. Each
middle school project will be visited by a researcher who will carry out an in-
depth study of the project, collect and archive materials from the project, and
prepare a case- study report describing the site. A set of common issues and
questions will be examined across all sites, and researchers will be encouraged
to pursue additional topics specific to each site. Researchers will explore the
development of each project, its successes and accomplishments, and the
difficulties experienced and lessons learned. A repository will be established
to archive the collected materials from all the sites, and the site visit
reports will be incorporated into a document which will be widely disseminated
to mathematics and science educators. This document and archived materials will
provide a mechanism for the middle school projects to influence teacher
preparation practice throughout the country.
