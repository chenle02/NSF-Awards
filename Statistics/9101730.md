Optimal design determines the experimental conditions for each observation for
the most efficient statistical analysis of the data; and the best choice of
design depends upon the kind of analysis to be done. This research constructs
optimal designs for modern data analytic approaches and also examines the design
problem when certain experimental conditions are already fixed. A second
research component focusses on extending modern data analytic approaches,
particularly interaction spline models and wavelet models.
