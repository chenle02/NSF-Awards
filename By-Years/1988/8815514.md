The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary cooperative research project between
Dr. Gerald Fasman of Brandeis University and Dr. Miklos Hollosi of Eotvos Lorand
University, Budapest, is to synthesize and study the conformation of an
important, but complex and little understood class of compounds: glycopeptides
and phosphorylated peptides. Joint efforts should yield needed information about
the effect of sugar residues on peptide conformations. Characterization of the
conformational features of relevant model peptides could be of significant
benefit in understanding the action mechanism of both glycoproteins and
phosphoproteins which play essential roles in numerous biological processes.
This project in biophysics fulfills the program objective of advancing
scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and
Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research resources in
areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
