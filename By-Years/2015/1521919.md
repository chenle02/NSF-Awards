This proposal will support U.S. Ph.D. students working in robotics the
opportunity to share their knowledge and interact with each other and more
senior researchers, to learn about different sub-fields within robotics, to meet
potential employers, and to become apprised of new technology that will be
demonstrated by vendors. This goal will be accomplished by partially supporting
the travel costs for U.S. Ph.D. students to attend the International Conference
on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), which is one of the two flagship conference
of the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society. The conference attracts an
international group of attendees that includes academics, industry workers,
entrepreneurs, and funding agency leaders.
