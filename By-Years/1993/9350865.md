9350865 Timmerman Mechatronics is a new area of manufacturing engineering
science where mechanical, electronic, and computer components are employed using
a concurrent design philosophy. The lack of content in the standard Mechanical
Engineering curriculum in the areas of microprocessors, computer interfaces, and
communications oriented programming presents exceptional challenges to
Mechanical Engineering students who need to master mechatronics for industrial
careers. This project establishes a laboratory for a second course in controls.
The first course in controls includes traditional classical controls subjects
such as Laplace transforms, frequency domain design, and root locus design; and
presents the mathematical tools needed for industrial control practice. This
laboratory, for a second course in controls, continues this subject by
presenting the programming and interfacing skills needed for the implementation
of controls concepts on the factory floor. The class is intended to fill the gap
between academic engineering knowledge and practical engineering knowledge, and
to prepare the student to be of immediate use to industry upon graduation. ***
