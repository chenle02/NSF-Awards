PI: Scott A. Jackson (University of Georgia)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CoPIs: Robert
J. Schmitz (University of Georgia) and Marc Libault (University of Oklahoma-
Norman)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legumes are a group of plants that interact with
soil-borne microorganisms to fix atmospheric nitrogen for plant use, an integral
part of sustainable agriculture. Although this is a fundamental process, there
are many components that are poorly understood and for which a better
understanding may lead to plants that more efficiently fix nitrogen. In this
project, epigenetic factors, e.g. non-Mendelian, will be examined to determine
how these factors respond to interaction with soil microbes and during
maturation of the nitrogen fixing organs in the plant. Data generated will
include transcriptomes during and after microbe infection as well as epigenomes
including DNA methylation and DNA histone modifications that may be induced or
responsive to infection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to a more fundamental
understanding of the process of developing organs for nitrogen fixation in
legumes, undergraduate students from colleges in New Mexico will be included in
summer research internships and collaborative research during the academic year.
Outreach seminars will be held in New Mexico to help develop genomics and
bioinformatics opportunities for teachers and students to integrate these tools
into curriculum and to expose them to the opportunities in this growing field.
All sequence data will be deposited at the NCBI Short Read Archive (SRA) with
associated metadata deposited at the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). In addition,
all epigenetic data generated in this project will be available through
appropriate genome databases including Phytozome, SoyBase and Medicago.org.
