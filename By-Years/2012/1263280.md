This award supports a new Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site at
the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Rutgers. Undergraduate students will
spend ten weeks doing forefront research in astronomy, high-energy/nuclear
physics, and condensed matter physics. The students will also engage in a
program of professional development activities that educate them about the
conduct of research and the prospects for careers in physics and astronomy, and
that give them the tools for applying to, gaining admission to, and succeeding
in graduate school as the first step towards those careers. In a mixture of
formal and informal settings, the students will benefit from interacting with
each other, with Rutgers undergraduate physics and astronomy majors, with
assigned graduate student "near-peer mentors", and with a diverse peer group
from outside Rutgers working in completely different scientific fields. The
faculty mentors involved in this project(including five APS Fellows and four NSF
CAREER award winners) are an enthusiastic, collegial, intellectually diverse,
and award-winning set of scientist-educators with exciting research programs and
excellent records of working with undergraduates.
