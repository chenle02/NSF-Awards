Over the past decades, NSF has played a central role in enabling the
transformation of Science and Engineering (S&amp;E) research using computation-
based methods, not only as a leading funder of pioneering research for all of
S&amp;E, but also as a funder of the nation’s advanced research computing
ecosystem. The leadership-class computing facility (LCCF) project is part of
NSF’s broad holistic advanced computing strategy that is intended to provide
unique resources and services to enable discoveries in the largest and most
computationally intensive S&amp;E frontiers that could not advance otherwise.
NSF’s stewardship of the LCCF draws on decades of leadership and experience in
serving the full S&amp;E research community with transformative
cyberinfrastructure(CI). This award supports the design activities for the Final
Design (FD) phase of the LCCF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The LCCF is envisioned as an
advanced distributed leadership computing facility that will serve as a nexus
for world-class computational capabilities. Integral to the facility will be the
delivery of software and services that will support the continued transformation
of the scientific discovery enterprise, as well as extensive partnerships that
will leverage the nation’s collective expertise across the broader CI ecosystem.
Importantly, the LCCF will have a comprehensive education and outreach plan that
will foster and nurture the future S&amp;E workforce for our nation. During FD,
the LCCF planning will to be guided by the research community to ensure its
broadest possible impact to S&amp;E research. Furthermore, the project will
continue to refine its project baseline definition and construction execution
plan. These refinements will include a more detailed bottom-up scope, cost,
schedule, and risk analysis to finalize the risk-adjusted Total Project Cost
(TPC) and schedule for construction. The project will also make final decisions
on the selection of technologies, vendors, and performance targets for the
construction of the facility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
