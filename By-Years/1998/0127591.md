Engineering - Materials Science (57)&lt;br/&gt;In order to solve simple as well
as involved materials science problems the use of spreadsheet solutions has been
underutilized by educators. We have developed a suite of problems in materials
science that lend themselves to spreadsheet solutions. Our materials enable
students to work on the collection of data, graphing techniques, and analysis of
may problem types. Toward this end a workbook containing a complete set of
tutorials, applications, problem solutions, and a study guide has been created.
In addition an instructor's manual is also available. These materials have been
designed for use in high schools and colleges. We are disseminating our
materials through symposia and publications. We are also distributing our
materials through a publisher as well as the Internet.&lt;br/&gt;
