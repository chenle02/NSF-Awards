Significant advances in earthquake engineering have been made but the expertise
is too often confined to universities and government institutions. Bodies of
knowledge which would significantly aid decision makers across all segments of
society (business, inventors, planners, etc.) are not readily accessible. The
technology is not being effectively transferred because: the knowledge is multi-
disciplinary, its application requires expert integration of spatial data and an
efficient transfer vehicle is not available. This project addresses the
integration of earthquake knowledge from various domains such as earth science,
geology, seismology, engineering, finance and social science, and the efficient
transfer of the integrated product. The integration/transfer vehicle is an
enhanced geographical information system, or IGIS, and implemented on
microcomputers for wide commercial distribution. Spatial data are aggregated and
analyzed by knowledge processes to infer earthquake hazard and structural
vulnerability, which are then used in decision and management support systems.
The Phase I program is designed to show the feasibility of integrating advanced
geographic information systems and artificial intelligence technologies in
earthquake risk assessment, and the synergism which results from the
integration. End- users of this activity will include such commercial groups as
insurance companies and banks.
