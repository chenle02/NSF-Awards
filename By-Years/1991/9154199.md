Statistics indicate that most astronomy teachers at two-year and four-year
colleges are not full-time astronomers. However, these faculty annually teach a
large number of astronomy students. The purpose of this project is to enhance
the faculty effectiveness of a number of astronomy instructors by assisting them
to begin their own observational astronomy research programs. The entry-level
type of research can be mastered by physics-trained faculty members. The data-
gathering required for the type of research proposed can be undertaken by
beginning-level undergraduates using the type of equipment found at small
colleges. The project will enrich educational experiences for a large number of
undergraduate students who would not normally have such an opportunity.Two
groups of fifteen college astronomy teachers come to the Center for Astrophysics
for a week-long workshop. While at the Center, teachers learn the rudiments of
photoelectric photometry, photoelectric and CCD (charged coupled device)
observation of occultations. The program gives the participants the necessary
theory and background knowledge to allow them actually to do astronomical
research and provide research opportunities for their students.
