The Parallel Performance Visualization (PARASEER) project applies the metaphor
of "visual abstraction," proven successful in scientific visualization, to the
problem of visualizing parallel performance information. A formal methodology is
developed for mapping parallel performance data to visual displays based on a
theory of "performance behavior abstraction" and "performance views." The
methodology is implemented as a high-level, representational framework that can
be used to describe how, independent of graphics technology, conceptual
performance characteristics embodied in the performance abstractions are
rendered in the performance views. The ultimate goal of the PARASEER project is
to explore new parallel performance visualization techniques and to evaluate
their effectiveness in real parallel performance problem domains. In addition to
the formal framework for performance visualization design, PARASEER will take
two approaches to developing performance display graphics. The first builds
interfaces to existing data visualization software to provide a flexible
environment for performance display prototyping. This approach leverages the
tools' capabilities for handling large data sets, their support for distributed
processing, and their extensible visualization to graphical user interface
software to provide more programmatic performance visualization support.
