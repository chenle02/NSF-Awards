&lt;br/&gt;How does a computer determine that user requests are authentic?
Currently, users must prove their identity from time to time, and this
authentication is assumed to hold for all user requests until it is either
explicitly or implicitly revoked. This model is poorly matched to mobile
devices, which are prone to loss or theft. An adversary, holding the device of a
trusted user, has the full authority of that user for the remainder of the
authentication period. Systems that require more frequent authentication are
burdensome; users disable or work around such safeguards, forfeiting their
protection. This problem is addressed by a technique called transient
authentication. Rather than invest long-term authority with a mobile device---
something easily set down or stolen---it is retained within a small
authentication token worn by the user. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
explores the implications of making authentication, traditionally a persistent
property, into a transient one. Transient authentication will be applied to
process state and file system state. An application programming interface (API)
will be designed, and a number of applications and services ported to it. The
system will be evaluated through controlled benchmarking, establishing the
claims of performance and usability. The resulting system will provide strong
protection against loss or theft without inconveniencing authorized users.
