With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Vernon D. Parker
studies the reactions and energetics of organic radical ions in solution.
Professor Parker, of the Department of Chemistry at Utah State University,
addresses the influence of coupling between charge and radical centers on the
reactivity of one or both of these centers. For example, dimerization rates of
arene radical cations are greatly enhanced by methoxy and N,N-dimethylamino
substituents which separate the charge and radical centers. Kinetic support for
the hypothesis of a correlation between reactivity and extent of coupling is
sought through study of radical ions with varying degrees of spin-charge
coupling. Professor Vernon D. Parker, of the Department of Chemistry at Utah
State University, is supported by the Organic Dynamics Program for his studies
of the factors influencing the reactivity of a class of compounds known as
radical ions. These compounds, which contain an atom bearing a positive or
negative charge (an ion) as well as an atom bearing one less electron than
ordinarily found (a radical), often display reactivity distinct from that of a
molecule containing only one of these structural elements (radical or ion).
Professor Parker is exploring the hypothesis that atomic or molecular groups
intervening between the radical and ion centers influence the reactivity of
these centers, with those groups providing the greatest `coupling` leading to
the most dramatic alteration of reactivity. Radicals and ions appear as
important intermediates in a wide variety of chemical and biochemical systems
and are additionally significant in areas such as radiation chemistry and
toxicology. Professor Parker's studies are leading to the development of a more
fundamental understanding of those factors influencing the chemical properties
of these important species.
