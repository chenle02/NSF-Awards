They are establishing a program at Cornell to study novel transport phenomena in
solids, with emphasis on charge-density- wave transport. Charge-density waves
(CDWs) provide a new and fundamentally different electrical conduction
mechanism. Their primary objectives for the next five years are (1) to establish
the quantitative experimental phenomenology of CDW transport; (2) to develop a
more detailed theoretical understanding of CDWs; and (3) to explore CDW
applications. To meet these objectives, they are adopting a materials-oriented
approach. Chemical, structural, and electrical characterization methods will be
used to identify defect types and concentrations. An intensive materials
preparation effort is being mounted to determine crystal growth conditions which
minimize defect densities and to identify new CDW compounds with novel and/or
more desirable properties. Transport measurements on high-quality, well-
characterized materials will be used to study CDW dynamics, to quantify the CDW-
defect interaction, and to evaluate possible CDW applications. In collabration
with theorists at Cornell and elsewhere, these emperiments will be analyzed in
an attempt to understand the fundamental processes underlying CDW transport.
