This research project will develop techniques to make database systems cache-
resident. The approach will develop three classes of techniques and they are (i)
static data placement for deep memory hierarchies, (ii) cache buffer management
and (iii) addressing coherence overload on multiprocessor systems. The research
will also develop optimization techniques and investigate data layout
alternatives. The career development plan will bridge database systems and
computer architecture education programs and also promote interactions between
computer architecture and database systems students and researchers.
