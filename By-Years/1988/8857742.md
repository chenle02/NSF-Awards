The primary research interest of this investigation include the fundamental
limits to the high speed response of optoelectronic devices and inventing ways
to surpass those limits. Specifically, the first priority will be to demonstrate
the first colliding pulse mode (CPM) locked semiconductor laser. Recently, the
PYI and a UCSB graduate student demonstrated a ten times reduction (to 560fs) in
the shortest pulses ever obtained from an actively mode locked laser. Based on
this research, it is felt that further reduction in pulse width is possible.
Other related interests include the study and demonstration of high speed
semiconductor lasers, modulators and photodetectors, capable of modulation at 16
Gbits/s and perhaps even higher bit rates. Specifically the investigator is
involved in the integration of superlattice waveguide photodetectors with
coplanar striplines to demonstrate shorter impulse responses than has ever been
previously demonstrated in PIN or Schottky photodetectors, and simultaneously to
solve the bandwidth-efficiency product problem that is supposedly inherent to
such structures.
