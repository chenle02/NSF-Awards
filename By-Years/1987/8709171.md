The objective of this Engineering Initiation Award research project is to
develop methodologies for the investigation of characteristics of fast, reliable
and implementable FMS scheduling techniques. A family of algorithms based on
controlled sampling from the set of active schedules will be defined. Behavior
of the algorithms will be investigated using analytical techniques and digital
simulation. The analyses will be performed to reveal the characterization of
efficient schedules with respect to tardiness, utilization and congestion, and
cost related scheduling criteria as well as sensitivity of schedules to changes
in flexibility and availability of resources in flexible manufacturing systems.
The proposed research is expected to enhance the understanding of scheduling in
flexible manufacturing systems, provide new insights for the study of
manufacturing systems, and lead to development of new problem solving
methodologies.
