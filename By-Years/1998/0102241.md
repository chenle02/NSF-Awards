The project proposes to convene publishers, curriculum developers and state and
district science education leaders for two separate but related conferences. The
first targets curriculum developers. The second will include developers, and
adds individuals responsible for curriculum development in states and districts.
The goals of the conferences are for participants to gain a more complete
understanding of the Project 2061 curriculum evaluation instrument, and to
analyze and critique it. In addition, the conference proceedings (including
commissioned papers) will be published on-line and information about the
proceedings will be distributed through the project's newsletter (circulation
50,000).
