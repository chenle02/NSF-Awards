PI: Robert Reitherman, CUREE The NEES Consortium is holding its first Annual
Meeting May 21 and 22, 2003 in Park City, Utah. The meeting will bring together
a core group of future participants in NSF's NEES (George E. Brown, Jr. Network
for Earthquake Engineering Simulation) initiative. The program for the event
features presentations by NSF program managers to explain timely opportunities
for NEES research funding, demonstrations of Equipment Site and System
Integration capabilities, and discussions of if grand challenges research
possibilities. Information on the Annual Meeting is posted at
http://www.nees.org. This proposal requests Participant Support to encourage
attendance at the meeting, targeting such support for members of
underrepresented groups and junior faculty. The Organizing Committee for the
event consists of a subset of the in progress NEES Consortium Development
Project funded by NSF through an award to the Consortium of Universities for
Research in Earthquake Engineering (CUREE). This Organizing Committee will
review applications and allocate stipends.
