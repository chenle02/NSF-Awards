9304746 Speicher This proposal seeks to describe the mechanism by which alpha
actinin forms homodimers. The approach is primarily biochemical, involving
chemical cross-linking and site directed mutagenesis. %%% Alpha actinin is
involved in the organization and function of muscle and is also involved in
cell-to-cell and cell-to-substratum adhesion. Electron microscopic studies have
resulted in low resolution models for alpha actinin structure, which involve
alpha actinin dimers. The protein chemical studies proposed will establish at an
atomic level whether the current model is correct and will further refine our
understanding of the function of this important representative of a class of
organizational biomolecules. ***
