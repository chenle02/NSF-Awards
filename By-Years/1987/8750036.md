The Chemistry Department at Eastern Kentucky University has recently acquired
the equipment needed to develop and implement modern, instrumentation-oriented
laboratory courses in biochemistry. This equipment (which represents the basic
tools of the biochemist) includes spectrophotometers, a high-speed centrifuge
(used in almost every phase of biochemistry), and electrophoretic apparatus
(used in the characterization and purification of many types of large
molecules). The use of this instrumentation, together with other important
equipment such as clinical centrifuges (for applications not requiring high
speed), and chart recorders (to record data on a continuous basis), affords
students excellent laboratory experiences in biochemistry and provides them with
better preparation for advanced study.
