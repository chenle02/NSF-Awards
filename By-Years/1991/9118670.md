The biological importance of small peptides relates to their activity at
receptor sites of many different types. The conformational flexibility of small
linear peptides as a function of their environment requires a very accurate
understanding of conformational dynamics in order to make predictions by
computational methods. This project work will measure the activation energies
for conformation changes by time dependent infrared spectroscopic methods. The
N-H vibrational motion of peptides is very sensitive to geometric changes and
solvent interactions. By experimentally exciting a large temperature jump on a
picosecond time scale the peptide conformations rearrange and time dependent
experimental measurements of the changes in the N-H region of the infrared over
20 nanoseconds can be related to conformational dynamics. The data will allow
testing and refinement of molecular dynamics models. %%% The impact of this work
is to enable accurate computational predictions of peptide interactions in a
wide variety of biological phenomena. Such accurate predictions are essential to
understand structure and function relationships.
