ABSTRACT: (SGER: A Novel Process for Preparing Exfoliated Graphite Layers using
Supercritical Fluids)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key challenge to developing new
applications for nanocomposites is to find ways to efficiently disperse the
composite filler, in order to produce an exfoliated structure. Conventional
methods for preparing exfoliated graphite require extreme temperature conditions
and long-term acid treatment. In this proposal a novel technique for preparing
expanded/exfoliated graphite by using supercritical fluids as a processing aid,
is described. This method includes contacting the graphite structure and a
supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) soluble organic material such as polymer,
oil, or monomer with scCO2 for a certain time. At the elevated pressures, the
organics dissolve in scCO2 and diffuse between the layers. The solubility of
organics drastically drops during depressurization causing it to deposit on the
graphite layer surface. If sufficient amount of coating agent is introduced in
the scCO2, each layer surface is coated, and the weak bonds between the layers
cannot reform. Preliminary results have been encouraging. The proposal may lead
to novel, superior graphite-based, nanostructured materials.&lt;br/&gt;
