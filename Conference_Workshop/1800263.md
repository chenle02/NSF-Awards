This award will provide support for US based researchers to attend conferences
and workshops, which will take place as part of the thematic program on
Descriptive Set Theory and Polish Groups at the Bernoulli Center at the École
Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Lausanne, Switzerland from January
1 until June 30, 2018.

Descriptive set theory is classically defined as the study of definable sets in
Polish spaces - those topological spaces which are separable and completely
metrizable. The subject has long thrived in its connections with classical areas
of mathematics such as harmonic and functional analysis and logic. Over the
course of the last 25 years, however, a vast number of new interactions have
opened up the field to novel and exciting directions. The semester long program
will organize a number of activities in and around modern aspects of descriptive
set theory and its links with other areas of mathematics. An important focus is
to facilitate research on the structure of Polish topological groups, which
recently has gathered momentum partially due to work in descriptive set theory.
