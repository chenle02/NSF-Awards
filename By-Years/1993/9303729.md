9303729 Freyermuth This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Plant Biology. The applicant received her Ph.D. from Duke
University and her Ph.D. research was in the area of microbial biochemistry. She
also has research experience in cell wall metabolism in Arabidopsis. She plans
to carry out her postdoctoral fellowship research in the laboratory of Dr.
Joseph Polacco at University of Missouri. The proposed research entitled
"Interactions between soybean and a bacterial commensal urease and nitrogen
metabolism" will expand the scientific experience of this Fellow into plant-
microbe interactions and nitrogen metabolism. ***
