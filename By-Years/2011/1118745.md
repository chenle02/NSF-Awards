Developers and researchers at the University of Michigan and the State
University of New York, Buffalo are engaged in a project to design materials and
an accompanying support system to enable the development of expertise in the
teaching of mathematics at the elementary level. The project has four main
components: a set of online professional development modules; practice-based
assessments; a set of resources for facilitators; and web-based technologies to
deliver module content to diverse settings. Three modules are planned: one
focused on fractions and one focused on reasoning and explanation designed by
Deborah Ball, Hyman Bass and the University of Michigan development team; and
one on geometry developed by Douglas Clements and Julie Sarama at the University
of Buffalo, State University of New York. Each module is organized into ten 1.5
hour sessions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each module goes through a two-year design
and development process that includes initial design, piloting, revision, and
dissemination. Modules are piloted in a variety of settings, including
university based courses for practicing teachers and district based in-service
activities. These contexts include face-to-face professional development, real-
time distance learning, and combinations of the two. Data are collected on
participant engagement with the modules, on teacher classroom practice, and on
mathematical knowledge for teaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The modules and
associated materials will be widely available and will be free to schools. The
materials can be imported into any learning management system, such as
Blackboard, Moodle, and others.
