9320043 Hooks This is a study of the regional stimulus provided by federal
outlays and investments, by county, over the period 1954-1990. It will build on
existing data concerning World War II federal investments by encoding data
contained in General Services Administration reports on federal properties,
classified according to the function performed (research and development,
industrial, administrative, and miscellaneous) and by the agency controlling the
installation. Analysis will examine the effects of these facilities on several
dimensions of county-level growth: value added in manufacturing, employment,
wage levels, and education level of the work force. %%% In addition to
addressing issues of central concern to social scientists, this research will
generate valuable information for the policy makers who are making decisions
concerning the redirection of federal investments and prime contracts in the
post Cold War era. Specifically, there is widespread concern that counties in
which major military installations are being closed or reduced in size will
experience significant economic dislocation in the coming years. Additionally,
there exists much disagreement over the possibility that federally-owned toxic
waste sites, especially those used for nuclear weapons production, may inhibit
local economic growth. Because the data set will include military bases destined
to close and toxic waste sites, the findings generated by this research can
assist policy makers to anticipate which counties will experience the greatest
economic dislocation. ***
