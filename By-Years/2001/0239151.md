This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is aimed at developing
MEMS-based miniaturized fluid viscosity and density sensors that can operate
within small confines provide electronic readout, and that are capable of
surviving harsh environments (high temperature, high pressure, corrosive,
abrasive) typical of many fluid sensor applications. The Harsh Environment Fluid
Viscosity-Density Sensor consists of a packaged flexural plate wave (FPW)
resonator instrumented with low cost, compact electronics for sensor read-out.
In Phase I, the technical objectives were successfully accomplished by
fabricating resonant FPW fluid sensors from harsh environment compatible single
crystal SiC and epitaxial piezoelectric AlN materials, and demonstrated their
ability to independently measure fluid viscosity and density. In Phase II, fully
functional, packaged and electronically instrumented Harsh Environment Fluid
Viscosity-Density Sensor prototypes will be developed and optimized for specific
customer applications. The fluid sensors will be field tested in our customer's
systems to demonstrate precise and accurate fluid viscosity and density
measurements and stable operation in the customer's fluids and environmental
conditions. After successful completion of Phase II, the Harsh Environment Fluid
Viscosity-Density Sensor will be ready for scale-up manufacturing and
commercialization in Phase III.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Harsh Environment Fluid
Viscosity-Density Sensor has commercial applications in 1) Condition-Based
Maintenance of oils and other fluids in engines and industrial process
equipment, 2) Process and Quality Control in manufacturing, chemical processing
and water/waste treatment industries, and 3) down-hole sensors for Petrochemical
Exploration and Extraction&lt;br/&gt;
