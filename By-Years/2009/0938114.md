Modern supercomputers are complex, hierarchical systems consisting of huge
numbers of cores, systems for disk storage, and nodes for I/O forwarding. These
numbers continue to grow and the need for tools to understand the behavior of
the system software becomes paramount: without these tools it is impossible to
effectively tune that software, and high degrees of efficiency is unattainable
by applications. This project addresses the challenge of understanding the
behavior of complex system software on very large-scale compute platforms, like
the current petascale computers. In particular, this project is developing
software infrastructure to provide end-to-end analysis and visualization of I/O
system software. Specifically, the objectives are to develop, improve, and
deploy (1) end-to-end, scalable tracing integrated into the I/O system (MPI-IO,
I/O forwarding, and file system); (2) information visualization tools for
inspecting traces and extracting knowledge; (3) testing components that drive
this system to generate example patterns, including a component to generate
anomalies; and (4) tutorials and tools for helping other system software
developers incorporate this analysis and visualization system into their
production software. The software and techniques developed in this project will
be directly applicable to and useful in other system software libraries which
perform complex interactions on large systems.
