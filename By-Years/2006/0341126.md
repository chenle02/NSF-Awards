Professor Valerie Kuck and collaborators at Seton Hall University are supported
by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program for a conference entitled
"Dissolving Disparity, Catalyzing Change: Are Women Achieving Equity in
Chemistry?" The special symposium is to take place at the American Chemical
Society Meeting in New York Sept. 7-11, 2003. The novel aspect of this gathering
is the input from international colleagues from the United Kingdom, Germany and
Sweden, and in addition, several sociologists are presenting.
