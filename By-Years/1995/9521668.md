9521668 Garcia This proposal is on research to study the synthesis of
immobilized soft metal ion systems and the conditions that will provide the
capability of reversible, specific binding of biotin labeled biopolymers and
cells. The investigators would develop paramagnetic beads containing immobilized
silver or platinum to be used as aids in DNA manipulations and for cell sorting
and recovery. A second technique to be studied is the immobilization of soft
metal ions onto polyacrylamide gel films for cell sorting and enzyme linked
immunosorbant assays (ELISA). Also, a systematic characterization of the two
separation techniques by examining silver loading, the chemical nature of the
immobilized silver to detect the presence of oxidized silver, and the chemistry
of immobilization is proposed. ***
