9451440 Billera The Mathematics Department at Cornell University serves the
mathematical needs of a diverse group of undergraduate students in a variety of
liberal arts fields, as well the more specialized needs of undergraduates in
such fields as physics, chemistry, astronomy economics, biology and computer
science, engineering, agriculture, mathematics education, meteorology, and
industrial and labor relations. To better take advantage of educational
innovations involving the use of computers in the teaching of mathematics, the
department is opening a new undergraduate computer teaching laboratory. This
teaching laboratory is enabling the department to use technology effectively in
the teaching of upper-level undergraduate mathematics courses, especially those
required by students in other fields.
