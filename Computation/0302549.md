Abstract: Algorithms for polynomial systems

The proposed research belongs to the interface between mathematics and computer
science. Professor Gao will investigate efficient algorithms for polynomial
systems. Topics include large systems of linear equations, polynomial
factorization, primary decomposition, and Hilbert irreducibility theorems. These
topics are closely interrelated and are fundamentally important in algebra,
number theory, and symbolic computation.

Algebra and number theory are the oldest branches of mathematics, and polynomial
systems play an important role throughout the history of mathematics. With the
increasing use of computers in science and engineering, efficient solution of
various problems related to polynomials are of vital importance. In addition,
many cryptographic schemes for protecting sensitive digital information (from
cellular phone communications, bank transactions, e-commerce to national
security) are based on algebraic structures, and their security relies on
various hard problems in algebra and number theory. The current research studies
a sample of problems related to these applicati
