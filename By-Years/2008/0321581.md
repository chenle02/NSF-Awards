This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a
new convergent x-ray beam based crystallography system for measurement of the
quality and the structure of protein crystals in an effort to support crystal
growth development efforts and as a prescreening tool for very small protein
crystals prior to refined, high-resolution structure determination at dedicated
synchrotron-based macromolecular structure facilities. Measurements of a broad
range of crystal types, sizes, and degrees of perfection will be carried out in
an active protein crystal growth and characterization laboratory at the
Wadsworth Center of the New York State Health Department. Parallel measurements
using the same crystals will be made in this laboratory with a conventional
state-of-the-art protein diffraction system in order to examine the potential
benefits and limitations of the convergent beam method (CBM). Measurements will
also be made in an industrial laboratory to evaluate the potential of CBM as a
commercial, compact, high-intensity, low-power, low-cost, protein screening
instrumentation.

The commercial application of this project will be in the area of structural
proteomics. Development of a compact, high-efficiency, high-sensitivity system
for measurement of the quality and preliminary structure of small protein
crystals is crucial to implementation of the huge opportunities offered by
recent advances in human and non-human genomics, with far-reaching consequences
in the areas of disease therapy and drug discovery. Furthermore, such a system
could find broad applications in academic, scientific and industrial programs
for high- resolution microscopy of structure, texture, and strain in
metallurgical, geological, environmental and biological or other materials.
