This research will examine two technologies presently entering the
commercialization stage to determine the impact that academic research
infrastructures, particularly those supported by the National Science
Foundation, have had on their emergence. The study will trace these technologies
over the stages of their evolution, from initial awareness of their potential
through development, to their present early commercialization. Studied will be
two technologies that have faced a range of issues over their course. Fiber
optic cables and high temperature superconductors are prime candidates for
study. The aim will be to track the linkages (or lack of linkages) of university
research infrastructure to technological innovation. The study will analyze how
factors internal and external to the university influenced the role university
research infrastructure played in the emergence of these technologies. The study
seeks to provide anecdotal data on the technologies studied that may help in
understanding the role that NSF/ENG can play in technological innovation in
emerging engineering technologies.
