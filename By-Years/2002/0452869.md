This project is a research experiences for undergraduates (REU) site in
Psychology at Middlebury College that offers eight undergraduate students an
eight-week summer research experience. Intellectual Merits- The site is designed
to provide undergraduate psychology students with the excitement of the research
process as well as a foundation of skills and knowledge necessary to conduct and
evaluate research. To do this, the program provides students early in their
academic career the opportunity to work closely with a faculty mentor at
Middlebury College investigating psychological research questions. These
projects cover a wide range of psychological topics, such as improving
children's memory, gender differences in spatial reasoning, the relationship
between tolerance and alcohol consumption, the bases of false memories, and the
influence of alcohol consumption on risky sexual behavior. A special component
of this REU program is that students work in research teams of three. Teams work
in collaboration with each other and two to three faculty members. In addition,
students participate in weekly workshop-seminars to develop their understanding
of the research process. Students also attend informal faculty lectures in which
faculty highlight the unique dilemmas they have faced as researchers. Broader
Impacts- This project contributes to the training of the next generation of
scientists by providing them with an opportunity to learn how to conduct high-
quality research through a first-hand, intensive experience. Students are given
experience with all aspects of the research process from conceptualization of
research questions to dissemination of research results. A special effort is
made to recruit students who are unlikely to gain research experience at their
home institutions.
