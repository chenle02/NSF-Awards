The PIs at the National Academy of Sciences are funded to have an ad hoc
committee review the Interagency Working Group on Ocean (IWGOA) strategic plan
for federal research and monitoring on ocean. This study is a congressionally-
mandated by the Federal Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring (FOARAM) Act
of 2009 and funded by NSF and NOAA. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knowledge about the impacts of ocean acidification
from local to global scale are still not well understood. The review of the
IWGOA plan will provide additional guidance to help strengthen the science as a
basis for sound decision making and action.
