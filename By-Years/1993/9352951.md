9352951 Snyder The State University College at Buffalo will initiate a five week
summer residential program in environmental science for 24 students entering the
11th and 12th grades. Special emphasis is given to those scientific concepts
that relate to Great Lakes research. The major goal of the program is to
increase awareness of and heighten interest in environmental science as a career
choice.Environmental science concepts and research methodologies as they relate
to Great Lakes research will be explored through lectures and hands on
laboratory activities. Students carry out independent research projects and
present their findings at a closing day program. Information on careers in
environmental science, careers in pre- college math/ science teaching and
college planning is provided using discussion groups, panels of experts and
field trips. A Great lakes education module outlining ways that high school
teachers can use Great Lakes environmental matters in their biology courses will
be developed by YSP faculty. Research projects based on approaches suggested in
this module will be submitted to state or regional science fair competitions.
