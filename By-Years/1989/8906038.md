Funds are provided for the purchase of high speed cameras for use in Dynamic
Moire Interferometry experiments on the initiation and fast propagation of
cracks. Experiments of this type are heavily dependent on the ability to record
optical events with short exposure times and on the ability to store and analyze
images. The project funds two recently introduced Xybion cameras.
