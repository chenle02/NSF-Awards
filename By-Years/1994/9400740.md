9400740 Bussell This research project, from a primarily undrgraduate
institution, is concerned with studies of hydrodesulfurization catalysis. It
combines the use of ultra high vacuum electron spectroscopic methods with flow
reactor studies of high surface area molybdenum based catalysts. Molybdenum
carbide based materials are the focus of the research, which has been carefully
designed to enable the participation of talented undergraduates in the work.
This project is supported jointly by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division, and the Chemical Reaction Processes Program
of the Division of Chemical and Transport Systems. The results of this work will
impact strongly on the rational design of hydrodesulfurization catalysts. %%% A
combination of ultra high vacuum and flow reactor methods will be used in this
project to probe the catalytic chemistry of molybdenum carbide based catalytic
materials. This work will provide the basic understanding needed for the
rational design and utilization of these complex catalytic systems. ***
