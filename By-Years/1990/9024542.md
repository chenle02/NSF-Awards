The primary objective of this US-Poland research project between Dr. John
Mulvey of Princeton University and Dr. Andrzey Ruszczynski of Warsaw University
of Technology is to study computational methods for solving large-scale
optimization problems that have a dynamic structure and uncertain parameters.
The researchers intend to focus on decomposition-type methods which split
problems into smaller parts corresponding to time stages or scenarios. They plan
to employ the following methods: 1) primal and dual decomposition with the
application of regularization and augmented Lagrangians and 2) special versions
of barrier or interior point methods. The results of this project in linear
programming are expected to open new possibilities for solving large-multistage
stochastic programming problems. This project in computer science research
fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling
experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents
and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
