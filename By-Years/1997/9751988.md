Preserving the Legacy, as its subtitle reveals, is "A Comprehensive Curriculum
and Materials Development Project in Support of Advanced Environmental
Technology Education, specifically, a set of textbooks and videos produced by a
collaboration between INTELECOM Intelligent Communications, the Partnership for
Environmental Technology Education (PETE) and Van Nostrand Reinhold Publishers.
These materials are being created to answer the pressing need for high-quality,
professional-level instructional materials for training two-year community and
technical college students--as well as secondary school students, 4-year
university students, and corporate and government employees. Educational
institutions can incorporate Preserving the Legacy within distance learning
programs that link instructors and students through telecommunications. Others
can integrate the materials within training programs for business and industry.
Preserving the Legacy is designed for flexible use in any number of curricular
programs and educational delivery modes. When Preserving the Legacy is complete,
textbooks and videos will be available nationally and internationally to present
the basics of environmental technology, not only to inform and train students,
but also to inspire future students. As one of its promises, then, the
Preserving the Legacy project helps ensure that we create a national legacy of
well-trained environmental technicians.
