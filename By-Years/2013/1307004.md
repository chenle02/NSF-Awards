Objective: The objective of this program is to develop memory devices and
magnetic tunnel junctions, based on controlling the magnetic state of dilute
magnetic III-Nitride semiconductors. These device structures will show that
manipulation of spin states is feasible in dilute magnetic GaN. The success of
this program will be a step towards the realization of non-volatile memory in
dilute magnetic GaN. Intellectual Merit: The program will utilize controlling
magnetism at hetero-structure interfaces to build memory devices and magnetic
sensors that manipulate the spin states by an external electric field. The
research project will focus on meeting the following goals: i) Establish
correlations between mediated carriers and the ferromagnetic properties in
magnetically doped GaN. ii) Demonstrate electric field control of ferromagnetism
in memory cells. iii) Demonstrate magnetic sensors based on the magneto-
resistance properties of magnetic-GaN/p-GaN layered structures. Broader impacts:
Coupling semiconductor devices with spin-electronic applications has the
potential for room temperature nitride-based magnetic devices. The structures
considered are transformative by the realization of room-temperature non-
volatile memory and sensor devices based on III-nitrides. For educational
outreach, a study group will work with the School of science on the NCSU
Centennial Campus to make exciting new electro-magnetic devices.
