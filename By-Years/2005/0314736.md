Shi&lt;br/&gt; The investigator develops and studies some&lt;br/&gt;reaction-
diffusion models of population ecology and of pattern&lt;br/&gt;formations of
biochemical systems. The spatial distribution of&lt;br/&gt;populations can be
affected by depressed growth rate at lower&lt;br/&gt;density, which is called
the Allee effect. For instance, it can&lt;br/&gt;be caused by shortage of mates,
lack of effective pollination,&lt;br/&gt;or harvesting. The main goal is to gain
insight into the ways&lt;br/&gt;that Allee and harvesting effects and dispersal
behavior&lt;br/&gt;influence the persistence and extinction of species and
the&lt;br/&gt;success or failure of biological invasions. New
mathematical&lt;br/&gt;tools in nonlinear elliptic and parabolic partial
differential&lt;br/&gt;equations and nonlinear functional analysis are developed
to&lt;br/&gt;study the complicated dynamics. Emphasis is on the
nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;phenomena that can not be obtained through linearization and
on&lt;br/&gt;patterns in higher spatial domains that can not be observed
in&lt;br/&gt;simplified one-dimensional problems. The project is guided by
a&lt;br/&gt;series of practical problems, from fishery management,
animal&lt;br/&gt;aggregation, and autocatalytic reactions. A second line of
the&lt;br/&gt;project is focused on a pattern formation mechanism,
generalizing&lt;br/&gt;the pioneer work of Alan Turing. A nonlinear and higher
spatial&lt;br/&gt;dimensional mechanism is established to refine Turing
pattern&lt;br/&gt;theory, which has been successfully applied to
phenomenological&lt;br/&gt;models, empirical substrate-inhibition systems, and
autocatalytic&lt;br/&gt;reactions.&lt;br/&gt; One part of the project studies
the impact of human&lt;br/&gt;interference on the natural evolution of marine
species. In the&lt;br/&gt;second part of the project, the investigator considers
the origin&lt;br/&gt;of the generation of complex patterns found everywhere in
the&lt;br/&gt;nature, like seashells and spotty patterns on a zebra or
a&lt;br/&gt;leopard. These studies aim to understand and control
many&lt;br/&gt;important natural phenomena, such as the persistence
and&lt;br/&gt;extinction of commercial marine species, and complex
pattern&lt;br/&gt;formations in biochemical processes. Results of the project
can&lt;br/&gt;be helpful for formulating policy on managing
commercial&lt;br/&gt;fisheries and forests, and for developing new
biotechnology&lt;br/&gt;simulations of natural life forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
