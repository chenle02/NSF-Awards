The proposed research will include experimental and analytical works to study
explicitly the interface behavior and its effect on the global material
behavior. Principal Investigator expect to quantify the role of interface
strength on the behavior and provide knowledge that will be essential in
engineering the difficulty in high strength concrete. Thus, the proposed
research is expected to have a direct impact on the production and use of high
strength concrete in structures in efficient, economical, and safe manner.
Results of the proposed work will provide insight into the deformation behavior
and failure mechanisms, and will allow the development of methods for predicting
failure in high strength concrete structures, thus increasing the safety in
engineering design applications.
