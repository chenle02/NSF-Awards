In some animals regeneration of sensory or neural tissue can occur after
damage. The implications are tremendous of understanding such repair mechanisms,
to extend the knowledge to mammalian and human systems. The auditory organ of
the inner ear is the cochlea in mammals, and in birds the comparable organ is
also called the cochlea. Recent anatomical studies show that the receptor cells
of the bird cochlea can regenerate after damage caused by intense noise or by
certain drugs, and may establish connections with auditory nerve fibers. This
study uses the powerful approach of electrophysiological recording from single
auditory fibers, to compare the activity in normal ears with the activity in
ears having regenerated tissue, to answer the fundamental question of whether
functional recovery accompanies the anatomical regeneration. Results from this
unique and needed work will have impact on sensory neuroscience, developmental
neurobiology, and on biomedical engineering.
