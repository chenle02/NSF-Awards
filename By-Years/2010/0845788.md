The Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program at the National Science Foundation
will support the research of Professor Donna Chen of the University of South
Carolina. Prof. Chen and her students will develop new Titania-supported gold-
platinum cluster model catalysts for the direct conversion of propylene to
propylene oxide. The structural and chemical properties of the catalysts will be
characterized at the atomic scale using scanning tunneling microscopy and low
energy ion scattering and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies. In collaboration
with Prof. Monnier, Prof. Chen and her students will construct a catalytic
reactor to enable studying the mechanism and kinetics of the propylene oxidation
reaction under real world conditions. The study will provide training
opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students in the areas of surface
science and catalysis. In addition, Prof. Chen will participate in USC run
programs aiming to increase public awareness and understanding of nanoscience
and nanotechnology research, including nanocatalysis.
