Stochastic phenomena, the dynamical effects of thermal and molecular
fluctuations, are of continuing interest in physics and biology. Our approach
involves theory, numerical simulations and contact with experiments. In one part
of the research, quantum mechanical consequences of chaotic dynamics in
classical systems will be studied. Classical measures of fluctuation
amplification by chaos, such as Lyapunov exponents, can be related to the growth
rate of quantum variances in systems that can be described both classically and
quantally. This connection will be explored in the context of magneto-optically
trapped cesium atom experiments. This work leads to a reevaluation of
fundamental classical concepts such as point and trajectory that turn out to be
unstable characteristics of chaotic systems. In another part of the research,
stochastic properties of the propagation of action potentials along neurons is
explored. These studies provide a first principles account of ion channel
fluctuations and their affects on action potential propagation, timing, and
interspike statistics, each of which has been recently highlighted as of
importance for the information coding problem in neuronal signals. The
fluctuations cause spontaneous firing patterns that have been measured and which
will be compared with numerical simulations of a stochastic theory.
