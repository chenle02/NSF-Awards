9306171 Woese In renewed studies on bacteria, Dr. Carl Woese of University of
Illinois continues investigations of the evolution, phylogeny, and
classification of microbes through the analysis of genomic sequence data from
ribosomal RNA in order to quantify genetic differences between groups of
bacteria. By comparing the sequence of ribosomal RNA from a variety of
organisms, a branching pattern of genealogical affinity can be constructed with
the use of computer analyses of the hundreds and thousands of nucleotide bases
involved. Few nucleotide differences between taxa indicate close evolutionary
relationship (the sharing of similar genomes from a close common ancestor)
whereas greater mutational differences indicate more ancient divergence between
lineages. Three groups are targeted for study this time: purple photosynthetic
bacteria; certain neglected groups of Gram positive bacteria; and cytophaga,
flexibacter, and bacteroides subgroups. %%% An additional benefit of the
phylogenetic analysis of bacteria is the ability to design diagnostic molecular
"fingerprinting" probes, that can be used in ecological and medical studies to
identify unknown bacteria. Also, the phylogenetic relationships revealed through
comparative nucleotide sequence analyses provide an evolutionary framework for
studying other aspects of microbial physiology, biochemistry, and ecology.
