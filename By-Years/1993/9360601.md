Proposal Number: III-9360601 PI: Stanley Harrison Institution: Harrison
Engineering Title: Low-Cost Scanning Electron Microscope and Multimedia Teaching
Materials for High School Science This project aims to improve upon an existing
prototype of a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The prototype developed has a
magnification of 1000x. It is intended to improve this to a maximum of 10,000x
and to cost about $1,000 for the SEM system exclusive of the vacuum system. In
addition modules for the use of such a system in the precollege classroom will
be developed and tested.
