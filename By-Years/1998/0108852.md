Williams&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0108852&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boron substitutes for Al in
clay minerals with a relatively large isotope fractionation. Illite/smectite
(I/S) clays incorporate more boron than other clay types and they are also most
common in sedimentary basins. We want to test the hypothesis that the boron
contents and isotopic ratios of these clays represent valuable monitors of the
temperature and composition of the paleofluids from which they grew during
burial to depths of hydrocarbon generation. Research on B in sediments has
primarily focussed on the behavior of adsorbed-B and its variations as a
function of T and pH. As temperatures exceed 100 degrees C, however, the
distribution coefficient for adsorbed-B approaches 0. Therefore, under
diagenetic conditions it is more important to understand the fractionation of B
during substitution in the clay mineral lattice. There is a large increase in
the amount of interlayer-B in I/S during R1 ordering, when the layer charges
cause partial collapse of smectite to form illite. Using a mannitol wash,
followed by alkali cation saturation we were able to separate adsorbed,
interlayer, and tetrahedral layer-B. Each population from different
crystallographic sites had a different B-isotope ratio. Using this technique we
will study the potential of B as a single-mineral geothermometer under low
temperature conditions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
