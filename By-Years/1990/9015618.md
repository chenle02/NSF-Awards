the Conference on "Hydrology and Water Management of the Amazon River" to take
place in Manaos, Brazil, on August 5-9, 1990. Afterwards, the US team will visit
the universities of Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Porto Allegre, Parana and Ceara
where investigators from both countries will identify research areas of common
interest. These activities are undertaken in fulfillment of goals set by the
ongoing United States-Brazil Science Technology Initiative.
