ABSTRACT

Principal Investigators: Jin, Jiashun Proposal Number: DMS - 0505423 Proposal
Title: New Tools for Sparse Inference in Large-scale Multiple Comparisons
Institution: Purdue University A research effort is proposed to create new tools
for large-scale multiple comparisons. Work in this field has been concentrated
on idealized models such as the standard Gaussian model, what has not been
addressed is the potential of many other models which have more realism and
impact. In this proposal, the investigator studies problems in three areas: (a).
Formulation of massive data -- Develop models which have Scientific realism and
impact, as well as mathematical simplicity such that careful study is possible.
(b). Development of new tools -- By exploring a wide variety of models, expose
new phenomena and develop tools which are easy-to-implement and theoretically
sound. (c). Delicate asymptotic study -- Lay out framework for asymptotic study,
carefully compare the existing and newly proposed inference tools, study on the
optimality of such tools.

The motivation of this project lies in that, massive datasets produced in
scientific areas such as Genomics, astronomy, and image processing lead to a new
field in statistics: large-scale simultaneous hypothesis testing or multiple
comparisons. The vision is advances in this new field will enable the scientists
from various scientific fields to quickly extract the information they need from
massive datasets, and it is the immediate interest of the statistics community
to develop easy-to-implement tools. This project pushes the boundary of the
field by developing new tools and novel theories, as well as exposing new
phenomena. The project produces tools which are theoretically sounding and
practically feasible for solving problems in areas such as Genomics, astronomy,
and image processing.
