The goal of this work is to conduct a comprehensive set of synthetic,
mechanistic, and X-ray structural experiments on two types of carboxylate salts
having alkene or acetylene groups. Solid-state reactions will be induced by
irradiation (UV, X-rays, gamma rays) and/or by heating. The investigation will
focus on the physical and chemical mechanism of the reactions. These experiments
will lead to improvements in the understanding of structure-reactivity
relationships for solid-state reactions, and in the effecient planning and
execution of stereospecific and regiospecific syntheses in solids. To enhance
the understanding of the radiation chemistry of molecular crystals, metal
complexes will be irradiated by synchrotron x-radiation at specific wavelength
near the absorption edge of the metal. %%% The distinct advantages of solid-
state syntheses of chemical compounds include improvements in efficiency or
selectivity, and the ability to prepare compounds unavailable by conventional
solution chemistry at greatly improved yields. A broad investigation is proposed
on the solid-state reactivity of salts of unsaturated carboxylic acids. The
discovery of extensive general reactivity, particularly for metal salts,
promises to open new areas of solid-state synthesis. The mechanism of single
crystal reactions will be probed from both chemical and physical points of view.
Information gained regarding the role of the metal in the reactions of
unsaturated carboxylate will enhance the understanding of radiation chemistry of
molecular crystals.
