The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the commercial
availability of the reconfigurable antenna product for the mobile market. The
reconfigurable antenna can provide enormous benefits including power savings,
improve signal reception, bandwidth, link budgets, reduce drop-calls and improve
overall call quality, improved gain/range and increasing the number of devices
served by the same wireless infrastructure. The potential opportunity is at
least $2 billion as the cell phone market alone accounts for more than 1 billion
antennas per year. Smart phones would be the most relevant portion of the
market. The percentage of smart phones is climbing every year and already
exceeds 1 billion units annually.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business
Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project will develop a miniaturized
reconfigurable antenna that will enable portable wireless devices to
continuously operate at optimal efficiency, improving bandwidth, range, energy
efficiency, capacity and overall performance of portable wireless devices. The
proposed antenna addresses the efficiency and linearity shortcomings of
competing approaches. The proposed project will focus on RF MEMS integration,
optimization, and experimental verification.
