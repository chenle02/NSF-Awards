A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation on the R/V
Marcus Langseth, a 235? Global seismic vessel with general oceanographic
capabilities operated by Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University
as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research
fleet. The request includes three items listed by
priority:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) BOLT fire chambers and spreader bars
$254,806&lt;br/&gt;2) 50% Diverter Doors $24,400 &lt;br/&gt;3) EM 122 Water
column logger license $9,197 &lt;br/&gt; Total
$288,403&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt; The principal impact
of the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support
for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support
of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo
separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition,
maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded
researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated
instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and
expanding the base of potential researchers.
