This project contributes to our understanding of the causes of macroeconomic
instability. It investigates the conditions under which sunspot equilibria--
rational expectations equilibria in which the allocation of resources responds
to random events of no intrinsic significance-- exist in a variety of infinite
horizon competitive models. This is an important line of research because
sunspot equilibria imply that agents' beliefs can be self-fulfilling and that
competitive equilibria can be indeterminate and unstable. Although young, the
investigator is considered one of the best researchers studying sunspot
equilibria. He is capable of accomplishing the goals of this project. Issues to
be addresed include the role of absence of contingent claims markets, the role
of finite as opposed to infinite horizons over which agents optimize, and the
role of restrictions upon borrowing against future income, in allowing sunspot
equilibrium fluctuations to occur. Particular emphasis is given to models of
interest to monetary theory-- overlapping generations models, cash-in-advance
models, and models where money is held to smooth income fluctuations.
Alternative monetary policy regimes are compared as to whether they allow
endogenous fluctuations of this kind or not.
