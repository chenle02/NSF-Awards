The goal of this research is to study the Monte Carlo simulation technique
implemented using parallel processors for solving problems of any complex
geometry. Comparisons are also made against standard technique, such as the
finite difference and finite element methods. A prototype model, built using low
cost transputers, is currently under development. An investment in massive and
inexpensive processors is of significant importance in solving a large class of
problems in field theory, weather processing, nuclear science, thermodynamics,
and other areas. The approach proposed can help solve engineering and
manufacturing problems and present an important application for large scale
parallel processors.
