A large number of semi enclosed, cavity like configurations in the form of spur
dikes (groynes), embayments, and jetties are located along rivers and in tidal
regions around the world. The survival and maintenance of proper balances of
living biomass and masses of nutrients, dissolved gases, vegetation, fish, and
marine life, as well as the inadvertent or planned intrusion of a wide variety
of pollutants and contaminants, are major concerns. The effectiveness with which
water is drawn into, or purged from, these cavity like regions has important
consequences for water quality. Such mass exchange involves shallow mixing
layers, which have scales of instabilities and vortices much larger than the
water depth. This program aims to fundamentally alter the approaches to, and our
understanding of, shallow mixing layers of finite streamwise extent. Space time
quantitative imaging will yield new representations of the flow structure of
finite length shallow mixing layers, and thereby provide insight into the mass
engulfment/exchange between the cavity and the region exterior to it. Such
imaging will account for stabilization and destabilization of instabilities and
vortex formation within the shallow mixing layer, arising from the effects of
finite length scale and a standing gravity wave within the cavity. This approach
will lead to a new, physics based framework for mass exchange between the cavity
and its surroundings, in contrast to exchange coefficients empirically
determined from flushing or purging times, and eventually contribute to enhanced
water accessibility and quality, which is of increasing concern to nearly all
developed and underdeveloped countries. An outreach program for underrepresented
students will involve an integrated program, with several different initiatives,
for a middle school and a community college having high percentages of
minorities, in anticipation of the increasingly important role of community
colleges.
