9627979 Grand The PIs propose a collaborative project integrating seismological
and geodynamic tools and concepts to elucidate the dynamics and fine structure
of the lower mantle and "D" region. Seismic data will be used to determine
details of apparent down- and up-welling, and contamination from shallow earth
structures will be elucidated by the interplay between direct seismic modeling
and prediction made from dynamic models. Dynamic models will be used to
construct 2D and 3D velocity models which in turn will be used to construct
synthetics, and their predictions will be compared with appropriate data sets
for verification and feed-back to produce improved models. Recent tomographic
models will be used to construct 2D cross-sections and corresponding synthetics
in year one, and fully dynamic models will be used to study thermochemical
boundaries in hot regions where partial melting or entrainment of core material
could play a role in a year two. ***
