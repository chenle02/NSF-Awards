This award is the result of the NSF initiative on QNDE of Large Structural
Systems. The objective is to demonstrate the use of magnetic hysteresis and
Barkhausen measurement technologies in establishing the safety of steel
components in large railroad bridges from a practical viewpoint. In particular
the growth of fatigue cracks will be emphasized.
