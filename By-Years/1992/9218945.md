This is a renewal; PI is constructing a calibrated sea- level curve based on
stratigraphy of the stable part of the Russian platform. Curve thus far is
mostly at stage-level of resolution and has hiatuses due to (local)
unconformities. This next phase will refine the curve to zonal level and fill
gaps by incorporating data from the adjacent Caspian and West Siberian basins.
PI will also correlate bio- and sequence stratigraphic units in order to improve
correlation to other areas on the globe, and apply the resulting sea-level curve
to subsiding basins and passive margins to generate accurate basin subsidence
histories and thermal subsidence curves. Work will include incorporation of data
provided by the Russian Academy of Sciences, and fieldwork to appropriate sites;
collaboration with Russian colleagues is established.
