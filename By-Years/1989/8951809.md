This project improves instruction in casting and machine work for the
industrial engineering students by adding a computer controlled three coordinate
measuring system to existing facilities. The system provides students total
systems view of design, manufacturing, and dimensional control of production. It
also enables students to develop and experiment with the dimensional control
database for direct manufacturing processes. This award is being matched by an
equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
