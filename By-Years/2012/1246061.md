This project develops an infrastructure to support managing the transfer and
analysis of big data as required by several projects at the University of
California at Davis. For example, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST)
Project will soon produce 30 terabytes of data each night. Scientists at UC
Davis examine the data, testing new search and analysis algorithms to find new
or unexpected phenomena. This collaborative project requires high-speed
connections to the other 22 institutions involved in the project. Similarly, the
Genome project and other projects benefit, or will shortly benefit, from the
changes being made to the internal networking infrastructure.

The project also provides data for campus research groups that study networks.
For example, the Robust and Ubiquitous Networking Laboratory and the Computer
Security Laboratory use network traffic and performance measurements in their
research, and the enhancements to the network enable them to gather this data in
ways that do not violate University privacy regulations. Further, the network
architecture enables administrative staff to deploy enhanced monitoring
capabilities to detect network traffic problems. Support personnel including
undergraduates act as a bridge between the research projects using this enhanced
network and the network managers, so researchers can obtain the optimum network
performance that they need, and the network itself can be tuned as appropriate
to minimize overhead.
