This project is funded by the Interdisciplinary Grants in the Mathematical
Sciences Program, with both research and educational components. The PI will
spend a year visiting the Department of Economics at Wake Forest University.
Three main goals will be achieved through this project. First, the PI will gain
a cross-disciplinary structured education, with the understanding of economic
systems, economic history, and more specifically, mathematical models in
economics. Of particular interest for the PI's future research will be
Environmental Economics and Economic Dynamics. Second, through this project the
PI will study the Mathematical Economics program at Wake Forest University in
order to adapt and implement a similar program at the PI's home institution of
North Carolina A&amp;T State University including course development and team-
taught courses in mathematical economics. Third, this grant will enable the PI
to establish a collaborative research program in mathematical economics with
members from the Economics faculty and the Environmental Sciences faculties at
North Carolina A&amp;T.
