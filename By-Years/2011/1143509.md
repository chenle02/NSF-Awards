This project provides funding for international travel support to approximately
4 early-career professionals and 8 students to attend the international
conference "Fragile Earth: Geological Processes from Global to Local Scales,
Associated Hazards & Resources" that will be held in Munich, Germany, from
September, 4-7, 2011. Major topics addressed at this conference are: (1)
subduction zone processes at global, regional, and local scales; (2) intraplate
earthquakes, natural hazards and risks; (3) geological resources and sedimentary
geodynamic processes; and (4) geoeducation in highschools, universities and
public outreach through geoparks and geoheritage.

This international conference addresses many current and central research topics
in tectonics and related fields, including sessions devoted to the recent Tohoku
earthquake. The conference affords international participants the opportunity to
share recent research results and initiate new international research
partnerships. Conveners will make efforts to broaden participation through
support students and early career researchers from underrepresented groups in
the earth sciences.
