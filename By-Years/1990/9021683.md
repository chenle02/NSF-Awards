The proposed investigation will utilize a recently developed analytical
technique (homogenization theory) to design composite microstructure for
specific loading histories, such as compression, torsion and multi-axis loading
histories. These analytical techniques are novel and allow determining both the
microstructural and macroscopic response of fiber-reinforced ceramics to
multiaxial loading histories. The approach allows the analysis of complex
composite systems, including those with 3-D fiber architectures. Moreover, the
approach can be used to determine the microstructural and macroscopic response
of composites at elevated temperatures, where non-linear behavior may be
present. The philosophy of the proposed work is to identify specific
microstructure (including requirements for interfacial bonding) that will
optimize the fracture resistance of fiver-reinforced composites for various
static and cyclic loading histories. The development of fiber- reinforced
ceramics is still at a very early state; thus, the proposed investigation has
the potential to significantly reduce the development time for these composites.
