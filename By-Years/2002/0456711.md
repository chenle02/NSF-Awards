Rudy Marcus of CalTech is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry program within the Division of Chemistry to carry out
research on the theories of electron transfer and chemical kinetics in a variety
of systems. The systems which are being studied include blinking quantum dots,
mass-independent isotopic effects in reactions of atmospheric ozone and isotope
effects in chemical reactions of possible importance in the development of the
solar system. This work is having a broader impact on the fields of biology and
atmospheric science and is advancing our basic understanding of electron
transfer in chemical reactions. &lt;br/&gt;
