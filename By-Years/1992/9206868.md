In this project, the PI will collect and analyze upper ocean velocity data using
an ADCP on a hydrographic line along 32.5|S to 30|S from South America to
Australia. This line is currently designated as part of the World Ocean
Circulation Experiment (WOCE) cruise P-6 (Pacific - line as the principal heat
flux line in the South Pacific, and is the single most important zonal line in
the entire South Pacific US WOCE program. Hydrographic and tracer work have
already been funded, and this effort will add velocity data to the line, which
is critical to the interpretation of the entire data set.
