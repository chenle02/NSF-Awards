9410654 Longoria In this project,innovative techniques are developed for
modeling, analysis and synthesis of systems and processes using scattering
variables. The scattering approach can represent dynamic phenomena described by
variables that take on values which can be continuous or discrete in amplitude
and/or time. In engineering, scattering techniques are most prevalent in
microwave circuit design and classical network theory. This existing knowledge
is extended to include multi-energy domain devices and processes in the context
of mechanical engineering systems. In particular, the scattering technique is
used to facilitate the analysis of systems with interacting lumped and
distributed parameter elements. Additionally, the scattering approach is
developed for dynamic modeling and analysis of discrete flow processes. ***
