The interaction between a host plant and a pathogen causing disease to the
plant is examined in this study of a tomato race and a xanthomonad. The specific
objective is characterization of the essential role played by the avirulence
gene, avrRxv, from the bacterium, that induces a resistant response in the
plant. An examination of the inductive conditions for expression of the gene
will utilize Western and reporter gene analyses; cell fractionation studies will
be carried out in order to learn the subcellular localization of this product,
and specific elicitor activity will be isolated and characterized. The intricate
interactions between a host plant and a pathogen for it is to be examined, in
this case between a tomato and a bacterium, Xanthomonas. Focus of the study will
be on the role of a particular bacterial gene that brings about a resistant
response in the tomato host. //
