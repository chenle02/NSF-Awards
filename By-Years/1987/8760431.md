This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in the general
area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfield of mass
spectrometry. The goal of this research activity is to evaluate the organic
microanalysis capability of laser ionization mass spectrometry (LIMS). This
technique, which is also referred to as laser microprobe mass spectrometry, has
been shown to provide useful organic microanalytical data for selected organic
solids. However, a systematic evaluation of this potentially unique chemical
analysis capability has not been performed. This Phase I research will determine
the overall utility of the LIMS technique in organic solids analysis and could
lead to the development of new LIMS protocols and instruments for this important
type of analytical problem. This Phase I project consists of four research
tasks: (1) Acquiring a LIMS data base of representative organic solids at
several analysis conditions; (2) Analyzing these mass spectra for structurally
significant ion peaks; (3) Comparing, where possible, these LIMS data with those
produced by more conventional mass spectrometric techniques; and (4) Applying,
where appropriate, factor analysis techniques to identify or distinguish the
mass spectra produced from different solid analytes. This experimental strategy
should provide the necessary information from which the general utility of LIMS
organic microanalysis can be assessed.
