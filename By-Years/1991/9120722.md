This award provides funds for the purchase of a high performance workstation,
frame grabber and high resolution camera to support research in image processing
and computer vision. The equipment will be used for several research projects
including Fourier domain motion estimation, representation and matching of
deformable objects, and multirate model-based image compression. High
performance computer equipment is required to handle the complex, data intensive
problems found in image processing and computer vision problems. The University
of Illinois at Chicago will be purchasing an image processing system to support
research in motion estimation, representation and matching of deformable
objects, and image compression.
