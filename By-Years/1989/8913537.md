Mixed convection in a pipe or an annulus aligned with the direction of
acceleration (vertical direction under normal gravity) is unstable. The flow
pattern and transition differ significantly from those for an isothermal flow.
Experimental evidence indicates that the pipe flow is supercritically unstable
for an aiding mixed convection while it is unconditionally stable to
infinitesimal disturbances for an isothermal flow. This problem has received
very little attention in spite of its practical importance. A three-year project
is proposed to study this phenomenon analytically and numerically. Convection
driven by the acceleration due to gravity in the presence of a temperature
difference can be an effective and useful mechanism to transfer heat if the
appropriate scales for length and time are not too small. This is particularly
true in rapidly rotating machinery, in which the centrifugal acceleration can be
105 times larger than the gravity acceleration; consequently, the buoyancy
effect due to density stratification must be considered.
