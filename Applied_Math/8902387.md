8902387 Rauch The principal investigator will study the qualitative behavior of
solutions of hyperbolic partial differential equations. These are the equations
which govern the propagation of waves which can carry sharp signals. Studies
will be made of sharply peaked fronts and high frequency wave train solutions
for nonlinear equations. Another main area of research is the study of the
control, observation, or stabilization of waves in a region. The understanding
of the behavior of solutions of hyperbolic partial differential equations is
important in many fields of application.
