Chromosomal inversions, or structurally reversed portions of a chromosome, are a
common and enigmatic form of genome structure evolution. Because inversions can
suppress recombination between many genes, they are often characterized as
'supergenes' and have the potential to influence evolution in distinct ways from
mutations in single genes. This project aims to dissect the evolution of one
recently formed inversion in Drosophila melanogaster by identifying the genes
that the inversion has captured. To accomplish this, the researchers will employ
genetic mapping techniques using strains that do not bear the inversion, but
that display a similar phenotype as inversion-bearing strains. After identifying
the relevant genes, the researchers will use publically available data to
analyze these genes to understand both their short and long term evolution.

Beyond the direct scientific advances of this project, the broader impacts of
the proposed research are numerous. The human genome is known to be highly
polymorphic for chromosomal inversions and inversions have been directly
implicated in human health concerns including reduced fertility and numerous
diseases. It follows that understanding the natural selection that affects
inversion evolution may yield valuable insight into many common human diseases.
This project includes numerous opportunities for both undergraduate and high
school students to participate, and the researchers are actively recruiting
additional students to assist with this project and develop their own related
projects. Finally, the software and theoretical tools developed for this project
will enable other researchers to conduct similar research on chromosomal
inversions in many other species.
