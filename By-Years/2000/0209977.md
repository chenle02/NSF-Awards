Christopher C. Cummins of MIT, Carl Hoff of the University of Miami and Elena V.
Rybak-Akimova of Tufts University are supported by the Division of Chemistry and
the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Mathematical and Physical
Sciences Directorate for their interdisciplinary collaboration aimed at
obtaining a complete mechanistic description of several atom and group transfer
reactions. These model reactions are rapid and quantitative, making them
amenable to study by stopped-flow kinetics and solution calorimetry. The
controlled transfer of a single atom (oxygen, sulfur, phosphorus, nitrogen) or a
small group such as NCN offers great possibilities for environmentally benign
synthesis of commodity chemicals, pharmaceuticals, plastics additives and other
specialty chemicals. This focused study of this important class of reactions
should provide increased understanding of the driving force and kinetic barriers
to atom transfer reactions as well as how to incorporate this knowledge into
design of new catalytic systems.

Collaborative Research in Chemistry (CRC) awards are given to interdisciplinary
teams of scientists working on problems of broad chemical interest. The emphasis
in these awards is on new collaborative modes of research and training.
