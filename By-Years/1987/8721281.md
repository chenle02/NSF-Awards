It is proposed to complete ongoing studies of a contact metamorphased zone
around a well studied granitic intrusion. A variety of analytical methods will
be used to evaluate the effects if heating of calcareous wall rocks by a hot
intrusion and to quantify (1) the consequent mineral reactions, (2) the origin
and evolution of infiltrating fluids, (3) the scale of heat and fluid transport
in the wall rock contact zone, and (4) the extent of chemical exchange between
the intrusion and country rocks.
