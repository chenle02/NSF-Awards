The primary aim of this project is to create a modern laboratory environment for
the introductory physics student in which the student is allowed to focus his or
her attention as completely as possible on the physics of the system under
study. A secondary aim of this project is to create a technologically literate
introductory student. These have meant removing the distractions of poorly
functioning equipment, outmoded data collection techniques, and mathematical
tedium. These have meant adding the support of up-to-date computers, electronic
data collection via a variety of transducers, and software for sophisticated
data analysis. This new laboratory environment has been put into place and it
allows the student to identify more easily the underlying physical principles in
a wider range of real-world phenomena than was possible with the previously
existing equipment, thus the students understanding of physics and its relevance
to his or her own field of interest has been improved. Care has been exercised
in the design of laboratory experiments so that the student can use the power of
this technologically advanced equipment without treating it as just another
blackbox. In achieving the aims of this project, one ensures that the physics
student of today will approach the problems of tomorrow with a better grasp of
physical principles underlying those problems and of the technology necessary to
solve them.
