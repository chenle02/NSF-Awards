A new laboratory curriculum in calculus-based and algebra- based introductory
physics courses will be developed. In this curriculum the acquisition and
analysis of the data is completed with the help of microcomputers. The students
will use the computers to collect data then utilize computational software to:
build a theoretical model of the phenomena being investigated; reduce the
experimental data; perform fundamental statistical and error tests; analyze the
experimental data; and finally synthesize the experimental results with the
theoretical model. The equipment selected for this project includes: IBM
compatible computers and printers; computer interfaced measuring devices
designed to allow for experimentation with a broad range of kinematic,
electrical and heat phenomena; a spreadsheet and a mathematical computational
tool. This new curriculum model will result in significant improvements in both
the qualitative and quantitative understanding of the phenomena and produce
large numbers of students with fundamental investigative skills directly
transferable to industry and/or continued research.
