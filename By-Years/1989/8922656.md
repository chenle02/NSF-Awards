Permitting procedures for hazardous waste incinerators usually require a test
burn in which the incinerator is shown to achieve at least 99.99% destruction of
the principal hazardous components. Hazardous waste incinerators are designed to
achieve this goal with a substantial safety margin. Unfortunately, however, they
sometimes fail to achieve the required degree of destruction of the material,
especially when the hazardous materials are present in low initial
concentrations. Theoretical arguments are advanced which show that the
conventional tests of incinerability involve a fallacy and can overestimate the
extent to which a hazardous material will be destroyed. These arguments are
supported by computer modeling and directly confirmed by laboratory
measurements. A novel method for improving incinerator effectiveness is
proposed. Computer modeling shows that this method can be highly effective and
experiments with a number of difficult to incinerate, hazardous chemicals show
that improvements in incinerator effectiveness of 1,000 or more can be achieved.
Commercialization of this technology would allow incinerators to destroy toxic
organic materials with reduced emissions of those materials to the atmosphere.
While this is of critical importance to incinerators used to destroy dioxins,
PCBs, nerve gases, and other extremely toxic materials, the costs of this
improvement are thought to be modest, and the scheme is expected to have broad
applicability.
