Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal No: 0101563 -
Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some problems of mathematical and numerical
analysis related to&lt;br/&gt;singularly perturbed boundary value problems will
be studied. The&lt;br/&gt;mathematical problems include obtaining sharp bounds
for derivatives of&lt;br/&gt;the solution that take into account boundary
layers, interior layers, and&lt;br/&gt;corner singularities. The numerical
problems include the development of&lt;br/&gt;stabilized discretizations for
these singularly perturbed problems and&lt;br/&gt;the study of the best
approximation properties of singular
perturbation&lt;br/&gt;problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work studies
physical systems in which some quantities&lt;br/&gt;undergo rapid changes in
certain regions. Such systems include fluid flow,&lt;br/&gt;where the rapid
changes occur at boundary layers, shocks, and interior&lt;br/&gt;layers. These
systems arise in the design of fluid machinery, the study&lt;br/&gt;of
underground oil and water transport, the modeling of airflow over&lt;br/&gt;cars
and airplanes, and other areas. The results of this research will&lt;br/&gt;be
of use in the development of more accurate computer simulations
of&lt;br/&gt;these systems, with consequent improvements in the design of
equipment&lt;br/&gt;used in such real-world problems. In addition, the proposal
provides&lt;br/&gt;for regular visits of Professor M. Stynes to the U.S.; it is
planned&lt;br/&gt;that Prof. Stynes will interact with graduate students in
mathematics who&lt;br/&gt;are working in related areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
