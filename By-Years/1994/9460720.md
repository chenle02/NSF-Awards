9460720 Lin This SBIR Phase I project explores a holographic optical associative
memory (HOAM) technology for asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) communication
network applications. With the recent intensive development efforts in high
speed optical transceivers and optical switching arrays, the bottleneck of
future fiber optic ATM networks will be in the data processing of header
information of incoming ATM cells (rather than in the transceiver and switch
array). In other words, an ultrafast processor is needed to determine the
routing decision and provide the decision to the switching array for physical
switching operations. It is found that the processing time of the processor
should be much shorter than the data packet duration of an ATM cell. In such a
way, the processor enable an ATM switch node to handle incoming ATM cells on-
the-fly, and requires a very small buffer memory in the node. A small network
testbed with a preliminary HOAM based switch node will be constructed in Phase I
to examine the feasibility of the proposed technology. Packaging issues will
also be evaluated because the ultimate goal is a compact HOAM processor chip
that can be mounted on a circuit board.
