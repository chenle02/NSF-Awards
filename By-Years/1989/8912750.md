Theoretical physics research on a fundamental alternative to quantum field
theory called Quantum Net Dynamics (QND) will be carried out. The net in
question is a discrete quantum microscopic causal structure hypothesized for
spacetime. QND is local, locally finite, locally relativistic and has a
fundamental construct with the dimensions of time supposed to set the scales of
times, energies, and lengths of high-energy physics. QND permits a quantum
condensation that approaches Minikowski spacetime and the Dirac equation for
times large compared to the fundamental time. The QND analogue of Feynman
diagram calculational rules will be studied with an eye to practical high-energy
particle calculations free of ultraviolet infinities. Quantum field theory is
essentially the only known approach to practical calculations in elementary
particle physics. Since quantum field theory does have its shortcomings, studies
of alternatives, such as the study to be undertaken here, are valuable.
