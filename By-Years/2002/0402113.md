The Partnership for Plant Genomics Education (PPGE) is developing plant
genomics and biotechnology educational materials in the form of interactive
software and associated curricula for national dissemination. In order to
increase the pool of qualified community college and high school students
interested in pursuing careers in the biotechnology industry, summer internship
programs provide students with technical experiences. Training workshops assist
teachers in making the best use of the software and associated activities,
thereby fueling the growing network of educators tackling these concepts in the
classroom. In addition, a weeklong summer genomics teacher institute, a
biotechnology institute for Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and an
agriculture biotechnology workshop expand the pool of teachers qualified to
teach these topics effectively in the secondary classroom. The software project
impacts students on a national scale by providing interesting, virtual-hands-on
experience, information about the essentials of plant genomics and modern crop
biotechnology and ethical issues related to the technology. Training workshops
and the summer teacher institute target educators serving underrepresented
minorities. In addition, the project continues to host a summer biotechnology
workshop given in collaboration with eleven 1890 institutions. In order to
increase the pool of qualified students interested in pursuing careers in the
biotechnology industry, summer internship programs place students in laboratory
settings with a designated mentor at UC Davis. During this eight week program,
students develop marketable lab skills and prospective technicians gain insight
into real-world work environments. Students receive a stipend to facilitate the
effective recruitment of under-represented groups to the student internship
program. The project helps to cultivate an informed citizenry that understands
the concepts, technical terms, and issues involved in agricultural biotechnology
and the burgeoning field of genomics. The project also generates a trained pool
of qualified students and teachers, thereby expanding the pipeline of secondary
students entering into biotechnology training programs in community colleges,
universities, and private industry. The PPGE builds from the structure of a
previous successful program in introducing DNA based concepts and technologies
to local high school biology programs.
