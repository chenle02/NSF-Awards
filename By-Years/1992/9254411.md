This three year project will take exemplary curriculum materials in economics
and incorporate them into a CD-ROM format. This will provide teachers with an
extensive library of economic materials through an interactive software system.
The project will be disseminated through the National Council on Economic
Education. Following the preparation of the CD-ROM materials teachers from every
state will be involved in teacher enhancement programs to implement the
curriculum in the schools.
