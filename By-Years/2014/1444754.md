Support to student travel for select students participating in the 19th Annual
SIGART/AAAI Doctoral Consortium. AAAI (Association for the Advancement of
Artificial Intelligence) is the major professional association for AI. This year
it holds its yearly conference in Quebec City, Canada, where this DC will also
take place. At the Doctoral Consortium (DC), PhD students who are pursuing work
on AI-related topics present their proposed research and receive feedback from a
panel of established researchers, as well as from other student participants.
This provides the students with invaluable exposure to outside perspectives on
their work at a critical time in their research and also enables them to explore
their career objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The DC program includes
interactive sessions for feedback on dissertation topics from authorities in the
field, collaboration-building sessions, early career advice, and well-placed
networking opportunities. It is held this year in the venue of several
important, co-located conferences: 28th AAAI Conference on Artificial
Intelligence (AAAI-14), the 5th Symposium on Educational Advances in Artificial
Intelligence (EAAI-14), and the 36th meeting of the Cognitive Science Society
(CogSCI-14). Participation in a doctoral mentoring opportunity such as this one
raises the potential to bring in participants who might not have attended an AI
conference out of lack of habit or resources. This is especially true for those
at smaller institutions and those which have less developed AI programs.
Engaging such participants has the potential to draw more talent into AI
research, improve research ideas in their formative stage, and engender
collaborations across the breadth of disciplines associated with intelligent
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
