This project will examine the relationship between household technology and use
of time in two ways: 1. Re-analysis of 1965, 1975, and 1985 national household
technology time diary data, and 2. Two new surveys, one local and the other
national, the latter focused on four household technologies. The new surveys
will build on phenomena suggested by the re- analysis of the existing data.
Particular attention is paid to the impact of new communication technologies on
the lifestyles and ways of spending time among younger people.
