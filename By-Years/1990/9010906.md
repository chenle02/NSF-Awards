Strategies for exploiting the resources of a privately owned workstation cluster
while insuring little or no interference to the owners of workstations are being
developed. By building a simulation environment that takes advantage of the
usage characteristics of workstation owners, improvements of the quality of
service is enjoyed by all users. The system will enable users to submit project
descriptions of simulation models to the system from which they will receive
graphical displays of the results. The project descriptions include a
specification of the simulation jobs to be executed, the time constraints of the
project, and characteristics of the jobs. An important feature to be developed
and evaluated is the system's deadline-driven scheduling facility. Simulation
jobs will be scheduled to meet the deadlines of the time constraints imposed on
the jobs. In addition, the scheduler will allow users to be allocated partitions
of idle workstations for developing distributed applications. In order to
provide scheduling strategies for meeting deadlines and allocating partitions of
idle workstations, workload models of the usage characteristics of workstations
are being developed.
