This project will create and validate an analytical model for the complex
behavior of unanchored liquid-filled tanks during an earthquake. This type of
analysis is complicated, because the bases of these tanks separate from and lift
off their foundations during strong ground motion excitations. This base uplift
changes the dynamic behavior of these structures considerably and leads to
severe loading conditions that can lead to stress or buckling failures and
subsequent loss of contents. To advance the design of such structures, the
response of the tank and its contents due to both lateral and vertical base
excitation must be modeled. Attention will be paid to the formulation of the
nonlinear base uplift problem. Effects due to shell flexibility, liquid sloshing
and ground flexibility will be investigated. Results of this research effort
will improve the seismic performance of liquid storage tanks related to critical
urban services such as petroleum storage, water supply, and other distribution
systems.
