This is a study of char deactivation processes emphasizing surface oxides formed
from oxidative pyrolysis of coal using four oxidants individually and in
combination. The oxidants are oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitric oxide, and water.
In addition, rates of scavenging by carbon monoxide are measured. Oxidation and
desorption products are monitored using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.
Transient kinetics and temperature-programmed desorption are used to charcterize
the surface species on the young chars. Isotopically labelled oxidants are used
to further identify the mechanisms of char formation.
