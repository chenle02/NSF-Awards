Structure, Rotation, and Magnetic Fields in Starless Bok Globules. In order to
better understand the conditions of star formation and processes in molecular
clouds, Dr. Clemens will carry out an investigation of the relation between the
structures and kinematics of small clouds and the properties of the magnetic
fields threading those clouds. This study is aimed at understanding the physical
conditions present in clouds prior to star formation, in particular the
occurrence frequencies, distributions, and natures of embedded magnetic fields
and angular momenta. Correlations will be sought between the magnetic and
kinematic properties, such as aligned magnetic and rotation axes, vorticity or
streaming of the field lines, and length scales in the magnetic field and gas
clumps.
