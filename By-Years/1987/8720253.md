This action permits Drs. Phillips and Gladfelter to complete archaeological
excavation at four sites in the Wadi Feiran area of the Southern Sinai in Egypt.
They have previously conducted two seasons of NSF supported research in this
area and located a number of sites which cover a long span of time. All sites
date to the Upper Paleolithic period and contain not only lithic remains but
floral and faunal materials as well. Analysis of these remains, coupled with
geological work will permit the investigators to reconstruct the environment
over the period of occupation and determine how the Upper Paleolithic hunters
and gatherers utilized it. Because several of the sites represent camping
places, it should be possible to reconstruct the spacial distribution of
activities and gain some insight into social organization. The Upper Paleolithic
period marks the appearance of anatomically modern human beings as well as
cultural elements such as art. Evidence seems to indicate that the transition
from Neanderthal to modern human may have occurred in the Near East and
archaeologists are interested in documenting this transformation and determining
the cause of it. This research will help to achieve that goal.
