The use of a recently acquired 60 MHz muclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectrometer with lock/decoupler and variable temperature accessories is
modernizing and significantly broadening the training of undergraduate students
in chemistry and other sciences at Linfield College. This is being accomplished
through the implementation of six instructional objectives: (1) training
students in the use of NMR to rapidly generate detailed information about the
physical structure of small molecules; (2) helping students verify the identity
of organic compounds synthesized in the laboratory; (3) providing a way to
measure subtle temperature-dependent physical changes in molecules; (4)
illustrating physical principles related to nuclear spin; (5) introducing
students to a means of rapidly determining the relative quantities of known
compounds in mixtures; (6) encouraging undergraduates to become involved in
research projects.
