Two of the major factors that affect the foraging patterns of insect herbivores
are hostplant chemistry and natural enemies. However, the relative importance of
hostplant chemistry and predation in determining foraging patterns of insect
herbivores and the degree to which these factors interact are largely unknown.
The range of expression of hostplant defensive chemistry, using a system of
iridoid glycosides in plaintain, will be controlled using cloned genotypes that
have been previously characterized chemically. In an experimental garden, the
foraging patterns of two caterpillar species, a specialist and a generalist, in
the absence and presence of two different kinds of invertebrate predators, wasps
and stinkbugs, will be assessed. Concurrently, the corresponding iridoid and
nutritional chemistry of the hostplant , and the iridoid chemistry and growth
rate of the caterpillars will be determined. In addition, plant fitness due to
the presence and absence of the herbivores' predators will be examined. The
results will indicate the relative importance of hostplant chemistry and
predators in determining the ecology of foraging patterns of two representative
caterpillar species and the ensuing effects on the herbivores' hostplant.
