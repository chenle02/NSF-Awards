EAR-0447129&lt;br/&gt;Anderson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides partial
support for an dual system ion chromatograph (IC) equipped with automated
sampling system for determination of major anions and cations in aqueous
solution. The IC will be used for investigations of surficial hydrochemcial
processes in support of paleoclimate, paleoceanographic and alpine research. The
IC will facilitate ongoing and future research and research training by
University of Colorado faculty, research scientists and their students involved
with the Institute for Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR) which draws on
faculty and students across multiple UC departments. &lt;br/&gt;***
