Minimal surfaces are physical objects that appear in mathematics and applied
science, where for instance they are used to model black holes or tensile
structures. Intuitively, minimal surfaces are shapes that are in some
equilibrium position (like soap films for example), which can be either stable
or unstable. Over the last years immense progress has been done regarding the
existence of unstable minimal surfaces and their qualitative behavior as the
degrees of instability increase. Many questions which were open for a long time
have just been settled and this project plans to continue that investigation
further. This project is also expected to continue the training of graduate
students in this active area, as well as research seminars and conferences. This
project plans to continue exploring the variational theory of minimal surfaces.
Several problems are proposed where the common theme is that the analogous
question for geodesics follows from the fact that geodesics are closed orbits of
an Hamiltonian flow. This perspective does not have a direct analogue in minimal
surface theory and hence its interest. The PI will study asymptotic properties
of the minimal hypersurfaces as their degrees of instability increase and also
the properties of minimal surfaces of large area when the ambient space is
negatively curved. The project involves combination of Morse theory, variational
methods, geometry, and topology.
