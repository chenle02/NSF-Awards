The Coldroom facility for storage of bird and mammal pelts will be improved to
enhance conservation of these collections. A unistrut system will be constructed
that will maximize space in the Coldroom as well as providing an inert frame for
draping pelts. The collection will also be reorganized to provide more space and
to make searching the collection much easier.
