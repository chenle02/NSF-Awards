Dr. Crippen is working on the problem of understanding the specific binding of
small molecules to biological receptor macromolecules. It is preferable to
determine directly the structure of such complexes but the required
crystallographic and/or NMR studies are much more difficult to carry out than
simply measuring the binding constant. What is needed is a method of objectively
deducing receptor site geometry and energetics given only the binding constants
for a series of compounds. The ideal method would be completely objective and
independent of assumptions by the investigator. Dr. Crippen is continuing his
development of mathematical models for receptor-ligand interactions. This
involves the modelling of binding energies while allowing the ligands to assume
their full range of energetically allowed conformations within the site. No one
else is developing methods at this level of sophistication and it is clear that
the models for proteins of known structure can be tested vis- a-vis experiment
thus giving confidence in the model for unknown proteins.
