9633554 Broecker Climatic cooling enhances the deposition of ice rafted detritus
(IRD) every 1000 to 2000 years. Several such dampened events can be found in the
Holocene that thus something other than ice sheets may be modulating these
events. The PIs plan to target 3 layers, the Younger Dryas, and H3 and H6
Heinrich events for special focus. Multiple tools will be used to determine the
likely sources for IRD, including grain size, stable isotopic analysis, and
composition of Pb isotopes in feldspar grains and Ar/Ar in hornblende to
determine the provenance. Samples from the Hudson Straits, Gulf of St. Lawrence,
Denmark Straits and East Greenland current areas may help identify the sources
from Greenland, Scandinavia, etc.
