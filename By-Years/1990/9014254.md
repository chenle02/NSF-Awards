This award is for the continued support of the semi-annual meetings of the
Universities Research Conference. The purpose of this conference series is to
bring together economists from throughout the country for two days of in-depth
discussion of a specific topic of current interest. Conference topics are chosen
for their relevance to current economic policy issues, as well as for their
interest to academic economists. Recent conferences have focused on
international aspects of fiscal policies, monetary policy, trade policy, and
government spending programs. Papers for presentation are solicited from over 70
economics departments and 50 business schools. Conference organizers are careful
to select a mix of established and less well known researchers. Discussants and
other participants are also chosen to encourage interaction among economists
with similar interests at different universities. A typical conference includes
7 to 10 papers and about 80 participants from 25 universities. This conference
series represents a unique and valuable forum for researchers who might have
little opportunity to interact with other specialists in their field. Past
conferences have been well run, the quality of the papers presents has been
high, and the topics selected for discussion have been important and timely.
