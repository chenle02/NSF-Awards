This research is concerned with the synthesis and characterization of novel
crystalline and polymeric, conductive and magnetic materials that are based on
metal-organic complexes. The question of quantum effects on electrical
conductivity in molecular metals that are quasi 1-D, yet remain highly
conductive as temperature goes to zero, is addressed. New alloys will be
prepared to study the Kondo effect in 1-dimension, and to examine low-
temperature condensation that arises from indirect carrier-mediated coupling
between the localized moments. Mechanism of spin coupling and characterization
of magnetic ordering in new materials also are explored. Further, new
porphyrazine-thiolates are prepared that are eventually suitable for the
development of multimetal molecular complexes and ribbon and sheet polymer for
use as conductors and magnets.
