Economists at the University of Pittsburgh play a major role in the newly
developing area of experimental economics. Experiments place participants in
carefully designed market situations, provide real financial incentives and
allow subjects to interact via a computer network. Such research allows human
motivation and actual behavior to be directly observed and thus factored into
theoretical models. To proceed effectively, such research requires up to date
computer networks. The current system employed by the Pittsburgh Economics
Department is configured around two Novell Netware network file servers and is,
unfortunately, old and no longer adequate for experimental purposes. With NSF
support the system will be upgraded. Purchases will include PittNet Ethernet
Ports, 31 Gateway 2000 workstations, and related hard and software. Installation
of the new system wille stablish a `star` configuration for the network,
providing each network device with a dedicated cable run to the network hub.
Areas of research focus include learning in games, behavior in auctions where
bidders demand multiple-units, public goods exchange and industrial organization
theory. The instrumentation will have a major infrastructural effect in the
training of graduate students and the development of software of general use.
