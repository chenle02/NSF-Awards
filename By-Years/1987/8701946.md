The purpose of this project is to develop algebraic techniques for reasoning
about communicating processes. Many of these techniques will be generalizations
of techniques used in the linear algebra of nondeterministic automata theory. A
primary result will be reasoning techniques which yield mathematically clean
proofs, typical of the linear algebra method in other areas. Some technical
questions about related mathematics will also be undertaken.
