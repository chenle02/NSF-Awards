The purpose of the CAREER effort is to take some important steps towards the
development and application of new, adaptive, high-order accurate methods for
solving conservation laws. While the technical emphasis will be on efficient
implicit time-stepping methods and techniques for local error and regularity
estimation, the effort will maintain a focus on large scale, realistic
applications from the applied sciences and engineering, and the use of national
high performance computing facilities. The complexity of this multidisciplinary
task, the development of a computational platform focusing on educational
elements, and the fundamental nature of the problems being considered will
provide a stimulating environment in which to train future computational
scientists in emerging computational techniques for solving conservation laws.

Application of basic physical principles of conservation of mass, momentum, and
energy has proven itself to lead to accurate and reliable mathematical models of
the physical world surrounding us. Such models, known as conservation laws,
display a richness, much like the physical world, that continues to challenge
developers of computational techniques for solving such problems. The mere
universality of such models, however, warrants that new and improved methods be
developed to enable the efficient and robust modeling of problems in areas as
diverse as the dynamics of fluids and gases, optical communication and high-
speed electronics, applications in electromagnetic radiation, or even climate
modeling. Hesthaven proposes to develop new adaptive high-order methods for such
problems and to train computational scientists in this area.
