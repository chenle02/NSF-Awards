Scripps Institution of Oceanography will undertake a project to develop an
absolute gravity meter that will operate on the ocean-bottom. The instrument
will be based upon the design of an existing terrestrial absolute gravity meter.
The work involves development, construction and field testing of the new
instrument off the California coast. Absolute gravity measurements are useful
for ocean-floor geodesy to infer vertical seafloor motions. Two physical
mechanisms for vertical motions: inflation events, and dilatant expansion,
produce changes in gravity that are several times larger than a change in sea
level. If an ocean bottom gravimeter can achieve the same 3 to 10 micro-Gal
accuracy as the land instrument, vertical motions on the order of two to six cm
could be measured. Such measurements at sea would be the first of their kind to
shed light on important processes such as magma motions and dike intrusions at
or near ridge crests, deformation near subduction zones, and the large scale
behavior of plates. The ocean bottom absolute gravity meter addresses present
data requirements. The resulting information on vertical seafloor motion will be
useful in testing existing tectonic models, as well as possibly prompting new
ones associated with the RIDGE global geoscience initiative.
