9409344 Sox The objectives of this research are to develop mathematical models
and solution procedures for dynamically planning and scheduling manufacturing
and distribution inventories of multiple products with random demand and finite
production capacity. Dynamic implies the planning and scheduling are done in
rolling horizon. The production capacity at each stage in a given time period
may be augmented in a given time period with overtime or additional shift. The
distribution system may be a single finished goods warehouse or a two level
system with a central warehouse and multiple, nonidentical retailers. General
distributions that account for seasonality and are non-stationary are used. The
research seeks to develop benchmarks for evaluating the performance of the
developed algorithms both in the quality of the solutions and the time to
compute a solution. The models and algorithms developed in this research will
offer a methodology to integrate and centralize the planning and scheduling of
production and distribution systems. The resulting tools will also provide a
means to assess the value of such a planning system. Furthermore, the developed
planning and scheduling methodology can supplement just-in-time (JIT) control by
leveling out variation in load and mix.
