This award supports the National Research Council's (NRC) Board on Science
Education and Board on Testing and Assessment (BTOA) to conduct a fast-track
12-month consensus study to create a strategic plan for tracking the
implementation and improvements in STEM education outlined in the NRC's report,
"Successful K-12 STEM Education" (2011). The study is in response to the
language in the FY12 Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations Bill,
approved by Congress November 2011, that calls for NSF to support such tracking
and submit a report to the Committee by November 2012.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A
committee, with the appropriate expertise, will identify existing and additional
measures needed to track to the 2011 report's recommendations; discuss the
feasibility of including such measures in existing programs of data collection
and link them to existing and improved measures of science learning outcomes;
and identify additional research needed to inform a full-scale evaluation of
progress toward the report's recommendations.
