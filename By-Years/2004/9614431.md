9614431 Rice This research involves a continuation of the study of seismicity in
coupled subduction segments and their surroundings (overriding plate, sea floor
and subducting slab) to understand the strength and heterogeneity of coupling
along the thrust interface. Specific areas of investigation are 1) investigation
of the relations between heterogeneous seismic coupling along the main thrust
zone and seismicity in the sea floor and upper plate areas; 2) explanation of
seismicity in the descending slab at intermediate depths and its relation to
coupling; 3) correlation of seismicity with changes in a Coulomb measure of
stress change (shear minus friction coefficient times normal stress change) in a
subduction zone and its vicinity; and 4) investigation of compressional
earthquakes in zones near the trench and towards the outer rise as signals of
the maturity of the earthquake cycle of the thrust interface. This research is a
component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
