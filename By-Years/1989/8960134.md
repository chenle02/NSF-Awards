This project is to investigate the feasibility of using a commercially
available digital signal processor chip as a high performance coprocessor to
perform statistical computations at speeds approaching that of lower end
supercomputers. Initially, the building blocks necessary for statistical
computation will be selected. From these building blocks, optimized algorithms
and hardware/software configurations for this chip use will be determined based
on analytical, simulation, and experimental results. The ultimate goal is a
flexible, interactive, high- speed, and low-cost statistical workstation capable
of solving a wide range of complex statistical problems. There are potential
commercial applications in research laboratories, commercial enterprises,
universities, and other areas where economical high-speed statistical computing
is needed.
