Abstract

Award: DMS-0311913 Principal Investigator: Susan Szczepanski

The Co-PI's of this project will organize and host the next two occurences
(eleventh and twelfth) of the Lehigh Geometry and Topology Conference. These
three day conferences will be held on the campus of Lehigh University, in
Bethlehem Pennsylvania in June, 2003 and June, 2004. The conferences will be
international in scope with a combined emphasis on the areas of geometry and
topology and will be designed to attract participants at all stages of careers
from a large geographic area.

Prominent researchers will be invited to prepare lectures for the general
audience on a range of topics highlighting significant recent research
developments and their connections to the fields of geometry and topology as
well as the applications of results in topology and geometry to other areas of
mathematics and science. All attendees will be encouraged to present current
research results and to participate in mathematical discourse. In particular,
special effort will be undertaken to ensure that this conference will benefit
individuals in the early stages of a career in mathematical research. Financial
support will be provided to undergraduates, graduate students, recent PhD's and
untenured assistant professors, and members of under-represented groups; the
invited speakers will be expected to serve as their mentors by providing comment
and suggesting additional problems for study.
