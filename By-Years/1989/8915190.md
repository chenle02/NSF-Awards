Dr. Eric Herbst at Duke University will continue his three-pronged research
effort into gas phase interstellar astrochemistry. This effort will include:
modeling studies in which interstellar abundances of molecules in assorted
sources are calculated and compared with observational data; calculations of the
rates of important reactions difficult to study in the laboratory; and
collaborations with experimental investigators in the determination of sundry
reaction rate coefficients. During the past twenty years, astronomers have
managed to detect the presence of about eighty different molecules in
interstellar and circumstellar clouds. The existence of these molecules has
stimulated a large amount of research directed towards an understanding of why
the molecules are present and how they are produced. Based on past research, it
is safe to sayu that many if not most of the molecules detected in clouds can be
synthesized from precursor atoms via gas phase processes. Dr. Herbst's research
will add to our understanding of the chemistry of dense interstellar clouds.
