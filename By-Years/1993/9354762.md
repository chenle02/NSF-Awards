9354762 Grygiel The field of data communications and computer networks has
developed to the point where there are more topics than can be reasonable
covered in any one course. Moreover, there is a strong emphasis on
interconnection and interoperability. This is a proposal for a computer science
course in computer networks which: 1. takes a top down approach; 2. focuses on
the performance of upper layers of computer network architecture, on routing,
and on routing protocols; and 3. requires implementation, experimentation, and
mathematical analysis. Part of the project includes upgrading existing software,
for the implementation of and experimentation with a simple internet. It also
includes the development of other software to run experiments on routing
protocols. Interconnection and interoperability is gained at layers above the
data-link layer. A course which requires implementation, experimentation, and
mathematical analysis, and which focuses on the performance of those layers will
much better prepare computer science students than one which surveys the field
of data communications.
