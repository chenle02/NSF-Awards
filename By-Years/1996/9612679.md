A request has been made for funding to help offset the cost of travel, living
expenses and registration fees for US participants in a joint US-France workshop
on premixed turbulent combustion. This workshop will focus on the study,
structure, modeling and simulation of the flamelet regime associated with
premixed turbulent combustion, and will bring together the leading experts in
this field in the US and France. The workshop will attempt to develop a
consensus view of the current state of knowledge and of where research efforts
should be directed. This is a timely request since the need to understand
premixed turbulent combustion is becoming more and more important because it
offers the possibility of better control of combustion generated pollution and
the mitigation of the resulting environmental problems. This meeting is to be
held on December 7, 8, 1996 in Hilton Head, SC.
