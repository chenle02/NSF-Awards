9526163 Wolf This grant provides $54,476 as partial support of the costs of
acquiring equipment necessary to complete a cold-seal hydrothermal experimental
petrology laboratory at Augustana College capable of experimentation at upper
crustal temperatures and pressures. This RUI request will allow the PI to
continue his post-doctoral research on the behavior of large-ion lithophile
elements (LILE) and the distribution of halogens in silicic magmas and will
provide a unique opportunity for undergraduate students to become involved in
both the laboratory techniques and scientific concepts pertaining to
experimental igneous petrology. ***
