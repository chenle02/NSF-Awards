Dr. Mary Rakowski-DuBois of the Chemistry Department, University of Colorado at
Boulder, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic
Chemistry Program for investigation of C=O, C-S, and C-N bond cleavage reactions
promoted by transition metal complexes containing sulfide ligands. In the case
of C=O, for example, it is expected that carbon monoxide would insert into an SH
bond of an SH ligand which serves as a bridge for a molybdenum dimer. The
formylthiolate thus produced is susceptible to reductive cleavage of the C=O
bond by hydrogen. This could model a first step of the conversion of CO to
methane, a reaction not commonly promoted by transition metal complexes, and
here promoted by bonding to sulfur rather than to the metal. This study might
provide insight into the mechanism of CO reduction catalyzed by heterogeneous
molybdenum sulfides. In studies of C-N bond cleavage by hydrogen, the sulfided
metal complexes would serve as models of the heterogeneous catalysts used in
commercial HDN (hydrodenitrogenation) processes. In addition to the reactions
described above, novel complexes containing Ir, Rh, Re, Mo, and Mo-Cr and a
variety of sulfur- and nitrogen-containing ligands will be prepared. %%% This
project is expected to provide insight into the reactions of transition metal
complexes with small molecules, which are important in the use of such complexes
as heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts. Specifically, these studies may
provide information pertinent to understanding the behavior of commercial
heterogeneous catalysts used for hydrodenitrogenation.
