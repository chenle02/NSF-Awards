comprehensive program of activities that will significantly increase the
quantity and quality of preparedness of minority students to pursue science,
engineering and mathematics careers. Activities at the member cooperating
institutions and organizations and in the schools will include: parent-student
S/E awareness symposia; Saturday Science Academies; Summer Mathematics/Science
Institutes;Saturday Science Seminars; in-school MSE clubs; scientists and
technologist mentoring groups; middle and precollege transition/bridging
programs; Science Engineering Education Days; curriculum in-service teacher
workshops and certification training, science , engineering, and physics
enrichment projects. Center will serve as a clearinghouse of information and
will broker relations between those who need and those prepared to deliver
quality educational services. Program participants will be placed in the system
database formatted by the prototype center and tracked through the education
pipeline. Center will do evaluations and assessments of the effectiveness of
intervention strategies and projects.
