ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Alexander Kiselev&lt;br/&gt;Proposal:
DMS-0129470&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of
Chicago&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will focus mainly on two
directions.&lt;br/&gt;The first objective is to further study and apply to
concrete&lt;br/&gt;quantum systems of interest the criteria relating
behavior&lt;br/&gt;of solutions of Schroedinger equation, spectrum and
dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;In particular, the applications may shed new light on the
&lt;br/&gt;dynamics and spectrum of certain classes of random and
&lt;br/&gt;quasiperiodic operators, such as Fibonacci Hamiltonian, as
&lt;br/&gt;well as provide a better general understanding of the quantum
&lt;br/&gt;transport phenomena. The second objective is to continue the
&lt;br/&gt;study of advanced WKB methods for one-dimensional Schroedinger
&lt;br/&gt;operators, using the tools of harmonic analysis. WKB methods
&lt;br/&gt;are a classical part of quantum mechanics, and their main
&lt;br/&gt;goal is to find a good approximation for the wave function of
&lt;br/&gt;the system under certain natural assumptions. This project will
&lt;br/&gt;pursue the development of new WKB-type techniques, which can be
&lt;br/&gt;applied to obtain information about dynamics of a class of
&lt;br/&gt;Schroedinger operators. Extensions to higher dimensions
&lt;br/&gt;will also be sought. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The spectral and dynamical
theory of Schroedinger operators &lt;br/&gt;is the cornerstone of Quantum
Mechanics. This theory describes &lt;br/&gt;the laws which govern behavior of
the quantum particles, such &lt;br/&gt;as electrons, atoms and molecules. Much
of the fundamental&lt;br/&gt;scientific knowledge about many important physical
processes &lt;br/&gt;(such as, for example, chemical reactions or conduction
&lt;br/&gt;properties of various materials) comes from the theory of
&lt;br/&gt;Schroedinger operators. This project focuses on the development
&lt;br/&gt;of new methods in spectral and dynamical theory of Schroedinger
&lt;br/&gt;operators which may allow a new approach to some long-standing
&lt;br/&gt;problems in Quantum Mechanics. These problems concern, in
&lt;br/&gt;particular, the conductance properties of materials with
&lt;br/&gt;impurities and of quasicrystals, and have direct applications
&lt;br/&gt;to modern engineering devices, wave guides and transistors to
&lt;br/&gt;name two. The project will also involve development of a
modern&lt;br/&gt;mathematical methods curriculum for undergraduate students
&lt;br/&gt;majoring in biology and chemistry. Given rapidly evolving
&lt;br/&gt;interface between mathematics and these sciences, a new set
&lt;br/&gt;of ideas and material needs to be incorporated into such
&lt;br/&gt;service courses. In addition, graduate courses will be
&lt;br/&gt;developed with the main objective to help beginning
graduate&lt;br/&gt;students make a transition to independent research.
