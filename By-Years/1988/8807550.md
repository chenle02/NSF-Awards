Research on applications of cyclides in solid modelling will be conducted.
Cyclides are a class of fourth-order surfaces with circular lines of curvature,
discovered by Dupin in the early 19th century. They possess interesting
properties that can be algorithmically exploited to enhance the capability of
the current solid modelers. The impact of cyclides in the realm of computer
aided geometric design is envisioned to include application in: (1) the
generation of offsets of complex solids and (2) variable radii blends of solids.
Both are important problems with varied applications. Initial investigations
indicate the cyclides can be successfully used to solve both problems. This work
deals with specific research issues that pertain to the use of cyclides in
offsets and blends of solid models.
