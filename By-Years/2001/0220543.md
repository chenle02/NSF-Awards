This dissertation would investigate marriage market determinants of
cohabitation and marriage using 1991-1995 data from the National Survey of
Family Growth. The analysis uses characteristics of the labor market area (LMA),
a group of counties defined by commuting patterns that generally constitute the
spatial boundaries within which most individuals interact. Sex ratios and the
economic characteristics of marriageable men in the area are expected to
influence both cohabitation and marriage rates among never married women.
