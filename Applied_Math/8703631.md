This investigation will continue the study of models of biological and physical
systems which are related by the fact that they can be formulated in terms of
functional and partial differential equations with nonlocal terms. The main
three areas of this study are concerned with: a) the effect of age-structure and
other internal variables of a population on the dynamic behavior of epidemic
models; d) the effect of the size, shape and compartamental nature of a cell on
the critical phenomena that control the cell cycle; c) the formation and
stability of spatial patterns in systems of coupled degenerate diffusion
equations modeling physical, chemical as well as some population processes. The
project will employ both analytical and numerical simulations that will be aimed
at fitting the mathematical results to experimental data. Each of the three
problems requires the development of new mathematical techniques of analysis
that can be applied to broad classes of equations that occur in the analysis of
certain biological and physical phenomena. One of problems of general interest
that is related to this research is the process of vertical transmission of
infectious diseases in populations. Mathematical modeling of this process may
help to understand better the process of disease transmission.
