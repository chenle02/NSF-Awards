The proposers will organize and conduct the first of what is hoped will become
an Annual Symposium on Children's Science Books that will focus national
attention on this important and overlooked channel for science literacy. This
first two day symposium will involve 75 editors, authors, librarians and
educators in an intensive exploration of science books intended as independent
or collateral reading materials for children at home, classroom or library. A
national advisory committee will help shape the symposium's content.
Professional and popular articles and a book will disseminate the results of the
meeting. This project will explore an often-overlooked area of popular science
education, and will involve science researchers committed to participating in
improving popular education and communication in science. NSF support will be
supplemented by university funds and income from the symposium.
