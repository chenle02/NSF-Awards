Cells in tissues and organs coordinate their activities by communicating with
each other, and this communication is mediated by specialized channels, called
gap junctions. Through the gap junction channels, cells synchronize their
electrical and metabolic activities, transmit intercellular signals, resulting
in regulation of cell growth and differentiation, and maintenance of metabolic
homeostasis. This proposal aims to develop a novel microfluidic sensor that is
capable of probing intercellular communications via gap junction channels at the
single-cell level. The proposed approach utilizes the multi-stream laminar flow
characteristics of a microfluidic chip to precisely confine adjacent cells to
different environments, thereby enabling a controlled means to study
intercellular communications between a single pair of cells in real-time by both
fluorescence and/or impedance methods. The sensor would provide an ability to
study the specificity of reagents and response of gap junctions to extracellular
stimuli. Several research goals will be accomplished in this project, including
design and control of the multi-stream flow in a microfluidic channel, on-chip
cell culture in the functionalized regions of the sensor, detection of
intercellular communication pathways using fluorescence and impedance
measurements and their response to extracellular stimuli, and develop sensing
strategies for studying water permeability of gap junction channels.
