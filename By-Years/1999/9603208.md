*** 9603208 Mogensen This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research
in plant genetic engineering involves H. Lloyd Mogensen and Paul Keim at
Northern Arizona University and Christian Dumas and Mireille Rougier at the
Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, Lyon, France. The objective of the research is
to conduct B chromosome-facilitated studies of male gametes and fertilization in
maize. The U.S. investigators bring to this collaboration expertise in
hybridization analysis and cell sorting. This is complemented by the French
investigators' novel techniques in in vitro fertilization of plants. The project
will advance fundamental understanding of the B chromosome and sperm cell
behavior and is of direct importance to reproduction in maize specifically, and
flowering plants in general. ***
