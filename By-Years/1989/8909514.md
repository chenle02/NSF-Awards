Because fixtures are special tools in the sense that each is generally used for
making one type of parts, the time and cost of fixturing for small-batch
production are excessive on a per-part basis. A critical need is shown to exist
for automating the design of machining fixtures in the context of automatic
process planning for small-batch production. This project is directed towards
the development of an integrated methodology for the following fixturing
decisions: conceptual design, the number of fixtures needed, workpiece
orientation in each fixture, fixturing points and clamping forces. The
methodology will be based upon engineering mechanics and sound principles used
in fixturing practice. The former is used to ensure proper design and the latter
is used as high level guidance for fixture synthesis. In addition, the reasoning
of part geometry is addressed, which provides a basis for the integration of
process planning and fixture design. A prototype system will be developed using
knowledge system tools.
