Functional divergence, the means by which duplicated genes obtain related or
novel functions, is a significant driving force of evolution. Because modern
salmonid fishes (e.g. trout, salmon) possess an abundance of duplicated genes,
our understanding of the process of functional divergence and its physiological
implications can be strengthened by studying gene families in these fish. This
project focuses on the myostatin gene family in rainbow trout and the central
hypothesis is that differences in gene and protein structure contribute
mechanistically to functional divergence with notable physiological
consequences. This hypothesis is based on our research in the PI's laboratory in
which four related, but distinctly different, salmonid myostatin genes have been
identified. Unlike mammals, where myostatin's growth inhibitory actions are
limited to skeletal muscle, it is hypothesized that the function of fish
myostatins has diverged considerably and may influence many different
physiological systems. To test this hypothesis, studies will determine how each
myostatin influences trout and mouse muscle cell growth, identify non-muscle
target tissues for each myostatin, and determine how the different myostatin
proteins interact with negative regulators of myostatin. The students who
perform these studies will be recruited, in part, from underrepresented groups
and research results will be incorporated into lectures given by students in a
course taught by the PI. Results of this research will be disseminated through
publications, presentations at national scientific meetings, and outreach to the
general public.
