How can spatial heterogeneity buffer plant communities against climate change?

Spatial heterogeneity in the physical environment plays a critical role in
driving many ecological patterns and processes and has recently been implicated
as an important factor responsible for buffering some communities against
climate change. However, the specific mechanism by which spatial heterogeneity
confers temporal stability remains unclear. Here, field experiments and
empirical models will be used to test two classes of mechanisms for how spatial
heterogeneity might buffer communities against climate change. Some buffering
mechanisms may operate independently of species interactions, such as when
heterogeneity provides physical refugia for species. Alternatively, in
communities structured by competitive interactions, spatial heterogeneity might
buffer communities via a class of mechanism involving species coexistence
mechanisms. This project will test the relative importance of these mechanisms
using field experiments in annual serpentine grasslands and simulation models
parameterized with data collected from the experiments.

This NSF fellowship will support postdoctoral training in research and teaching.
Professional training will include extensive analyses using modern statistical
programs, such as R, and current modeling approaches. In addition to
participating in teaching seminars and course to improve pedagogical skills, the
Fellow will teach core courses and serve as a mentor to undergraduate and
graduate students at the host institution, Utah State University. Another
promising avenue for community outreach is through participation in Distributed
Graduate Seminars on climate change in the sagebrush steppe plant community.
Finally, the Fellow will continue to provide logistical and long-term planning
support to the K-12 science education program, Kids into Discovering Science
(KiDS).
