This Division of Earth Sciences Instrumentation and Facilities Program award
supports the continued development and maintenance of the Global Navigation
Satellites System (GNSS At MIT) GAMIT/Global Kalman Filter (GLOBK) suite of
programs, shell scripts, and documentation that continue to be used worldwide
for the analysis of GNSS data for scientific studies of a wide range of problems
in Earth sciences. Support provides expert assistance to users in understanding
their own data sets and analysis issues, and to continue the development of the
suite to accommodate new analysis models, new generations of satellites and
updated product and data formats. GAMIT/GLOBK is the sole academic developed
GNSS software suite and is open source and freely distributed. It provides an
important independent check on solutions produced using alternative packages
(NASA/JPLs GIPSY-OASIS, the commercial Bernese package) and provides a check on
reproducibility of GNSS position solutions. The investigators will also plan and
conduct periodic technical short courses on the theory and use of the packages,
both within the US and internationally, supporting student training.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMIT/GLOBK is used worldwide by scientists and students
to determine GPS/GNSS antenna positions, atmospheric signal propagation delay,
earth orientation parameters, and satellite orbital parameters from GNSS
observables. GLOBK, when used in conjunction with other geodetic data such as
satellite laser ranging (SLR) and very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) is
used to generate derived GNSS products such as station velocities, co-seismic
offsets and post seismic motions. The software packages have thousands of users
who employ it for research on crustal deformation processes, including
earthquakes, volcanic activity, atmospheric water vapor tomography, ionospheric
dynamics, cryosphere dynamics and even to determine soil moisture and snow pack
depth, the latter relying on GNSS signal/noise ratio observations that record
the effects of microwave ground reflections proximal to the GNSS
antenna.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
