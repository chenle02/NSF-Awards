The understanding of processes involved in species, sex, individual and kin
recognition are of fundamental importance to virtually all multicellular
animals. Among many mammals, chemosensory signals provide one of the most
important channels of communication for such recognition. Dr. Johnston will
examine the ways in which animals recognize others of their species by chemical
cues and investigate the neural mechanisms underlying such recognition. His
research involves the development of innovative habituation paradigms to measure
individual discrimination and individual recognition. He will utilize the
behavioral information to determine the roles that the two main olfactory
pathways, the main olfactory system and the vomeronasal system, play in
mediating the recognition processes. Not only will this multidisciplinary
approach provide information towards our understanding of animal communication
systems but will contribute to our understanding of (1) recognition mechanisms
in general, (2) the functions of the sense of olfaction, (3) the organization
and functions of the neural pathways of the olfactory system, and (4) the
processing of olfactory information in different brain regions. The
understanding and treatment of clinical disorders associated with taste and
olfactory dysfunctions in humans can only benefit from advances in basic
knowledge of animal olfaction and chemical communication research.
