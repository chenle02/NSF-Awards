The process of glass fining involves the formation of bubbles, which are mostly
generated by chemical reactions within the raw material, and grains, which are
dislodged by the glass currents from the "batch blanket" i.e. from the slab of
raw materials fed into the furnace. Occurrence of these imperfections in the
final glass product depends upon glass circulation, temperature, gas chemistry
and concentration, electric power density and location of air bubblers. Because
of the complexity of the physical and chemical processes involved in glass
manufacture, glass production has remained in part an art. This study is an
attempt to develop a quantitative model of physical, chemical and transport
processes in glass melting tanks. In the model, the number, distribution and
size of both bubble and grains will be allowed to grow and/or shrink according
to glass circulation, temperature, electric power density, location or air
bubblers and dissolved gas concentration patterns within the glass melt. The
model should provide a quantitative method of predicting the quality of glass,
thereby leading to improvements in furnace design and reduction in glass
defects.
