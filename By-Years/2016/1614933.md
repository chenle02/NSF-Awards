White dwarfs are very dense, planet-sized, stellar remnants produced at the end
of a low-mass star's life. About 98% of all stars - including our Sun - will end
their lives as white dwarfs. This research team will find and analyze dozens of
white dwarfs that are located in very young star clusters in the Milky Way
galaxy. Their study will provide critical insights about stellar astrophysics.
They will measure and compare the masses of white dwarfs with those of other
stars still undergoing fusion, in order to determine how much mass is lost over
their lifetimes. This will be used to define the critical mass that separates
white dwarf formation from core collapse supernova. They will use data from
existing surveys and obtain new data using optical telescopes. A secondary goal
is to determine the precise ages of the young star clusters in the study.
Broader impacts include further training of a postdoctoral researcher in science
and public outreach. The PI will continue his public lecture series on stars and
stellar death. He will also collaborate with African American and Indian
students at nearby schools and help with the NAACP Scientific Olympics in
Maryland.

Once white dwarf candidates are identified in a star cluster, the researchers
will perform a detailed analysis of each cluster's color-magnitude diagram to
derive the properties of the parent system. Next, they will obtain data of the
newly discovered white dwarfs with multi-object spectrographs on 4 to 10-m
telescopes and determine fundamental stellar properties (such as effective
temperature, log g, mass, luminosity and cooling age) by fitting the Balmer line
spectra to the team's white dwarf atmosphere and cooling models. They will
measure the critical mass separating white dwarf from supernova formation by
establishing a truncation in the white dwarf mass distribution.
