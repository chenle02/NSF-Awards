This award supports the research of Professor Stephen Milne. His work will
concentrate on the interrelationships among the fields of Combinatorics, Lie
Algebras, and Hypergeometric Series. His principal goal will be to develop the
theory and applications of his recent U(n) generalization of the Bailey
Transform and the Bailey Lemma. This program has already led to the discovery
and proof of many new theorems for multiple q-series and summations, connection
coefficient theory, orthogonal polynomials, and related combinatorial
applications. This research falls in the broad category of Combinatorics, which
is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics. Fundamentally,
Combinatorics represents a systematization of the very first of all mathematical
activities, counting. In its modern development, however, Combinatorics has gone
beyond just counting to make use of a wide variety of advanced mathematical
techniques, and although its roots go back several centuries, the field has had
an explosive development in the past few decades because of its importance in
communications and information technology.
