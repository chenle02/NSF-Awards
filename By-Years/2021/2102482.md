With funding from the Chemical Catalysis program in the Division of Chemistry,
Professor Zhong of the State University of New York at Binghamton will study the
role of oxygenation on the surface of nanoparticle catalysts in oxidation
reactions of hydrocarbons. Developing active, stable and low-cost catalysts for
advanced emission control systems and fuel-efficient technologies is a major
part of the global drive toward energy and environmental sustainability. Low-
temperature catalytic partial and complete oxidation of hydrocarbons contributes
to this global drive in areas ranging from clean fuel production to clean air.
Traditional approaches require large quantity of expensive and scarce platinum
group metal (PGM) in the catalysts. In this project, Professor Zhong and his
team will develop an understanding of how alloying a lower-amount of PGM with
lower-cost non-PGMs can achieve a higher catalytic performance. The precise
determination and control of the surface composition of the nanoscale catalysts
are critical for achieving the desired catalytic performance and the societal
needs in sustainability. Professor Zhong will be actively engaging in outreach
activities that build upon his research to promote engagement of students in
science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. These
activities, including creating summer research internships in Professor Zhongâ€™s
laboratory and participating in Bridges to Baccalaureate, McNair Scholars, and
Smart Energy Scholars Programs, will be directed at improving the education of
promising high school seniors, community college students, and underrepresented
students and encouraging their interest in STEM careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In
this project, Professor Zhong and his team will develop a fundamental
understanding of the role of dynamic oxygenation on the surface of nanoparticle
catalysts consisting of selected noble metals (NM) alloyed with 3d transition
metals (3dTM) in oxidation reactions of hydrocarbons, focusing on small
hydrocarbon molecules. The NM/3dTM nanoalloy catalysts with tunable metal
compositions and controllable oxygenation on the surfaces will be prepared by
molecular-engineered nucleation, growth, and nanostructuring. The detailed metal
composition and the oxygenation on the surface will be correlated with the
activity and stability of the catalysts in the hydrocarbon oxidation reactions.
The dynamic changes in surface active sites and intermediate species will be
determined using in-situ/operando techniques such as Diffuse Reflectance
Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
