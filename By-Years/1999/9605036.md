This international collaboration between the PI and Reint de Boer of the
University of Essen will simultaneously apply two complementary approaches to
investigate a variety of important issues in the study of porous media. It will
examine issues of effective stress principle, uplift, friction, and capillarity
in compressible porous solids phase saturated with a compressible and an
incompressible liquid, and a three-phase system. The Essen group uses a
continuum thermomechanical macroscopic methodology to derive the balance
equations and the associated constitutive expressions. The PI's group uses a
micromechanical approach, based on a new application of the principles of
classical ensemble averaging to porous media. An agreement between the results
obtained by these two methods will be a substantial contribution to porous media
theory in providing a computational algorithm to estimate many of the
phenomenological constants in the macroscopic theory. The international
collaboration will thus lead to improved modeling of saturated porous media,
relevant to many disciplines such as soil mechanics, geophysics, civil and
petroleum engineering, biomechanics, and materials processing.
