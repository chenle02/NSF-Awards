This project seeks to establish a new CyberCorpsÂ®: Scholarship for Service (SFS)
program at the Cal Poly Pomona (CPP) to prepare highly-qualified Cybersecurity
professionals for entry into the federal, state, local, and tribal government
workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cal Poly Pomona has been NSA/DHS Center of
Academic Excellence in Information Assurance/Cyber Defense Education since 2005.
The cybersecurity program for CyberCorps scholars at CPP distinguishes itself
from other programs by its emphasis on interdisciplinary learning-by-doing
approach through participation in the Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition
(CCDC) and National Cyber League (NCL) and research opportunities in
contemporary cybersecurity topics such as smartphone security. The project will
focus on the following major activities: (a) Student recruitment and academic
mentoring to successfully place students in Federal jobs; (b) Hands-on training
in various areas through the state-of-the-art cybersecurity laboratory, and by
participating in the CCDC; (c) Promoting undergraduate research by having all
SFS students participate in research-based capstone projects; (d) Professional
development and certification training; (e) Interpersonal skill development in
leadership, collaboration and communication skills of SFS scholarship recipients
through their participation in the Air Force Association?s CyberPatriot activity
with the Los Angeles Unified School District. The Cal Poly Pomona CyberCorps
program will graduate professionals with hands-on training in cybersecurity as
well as problem-solving skills to secure critical federal information
infrastructure in innovative ways utilizing their experience in undergraduate
research. The program scholars will develop community service skills through the
outreach activities with K-12 students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will
impact K-12 cybersecurity education and awareness by involving scholars in the
CyberPatriot program. The scholars will also directly contribute to the
community through their presentations at the Annual Cyber Security Fair. CPP is
a Hispanic Serving Institution and ranks among the top 50 institutions granting
degrees in science and engineering to Hispanic students. Many CPP SFS students
will be first generation college, minority students, transferring from community
colleges, and often from low-income backgrounds. Through academic mentoring to
professional and interpersonal skills development, this SFS program will strive
to train, place and retain them in federal Cybersecurity positions.
