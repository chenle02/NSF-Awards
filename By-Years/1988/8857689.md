This is a Presidential Young Investigator award in the area of communication
theory. Dr. Verdu's work involves the application of probability and random
processes to the analysis of the performance limits of information transmission
through noisy communication channels, including multiple-access channels. A
common strategy for sharing a communication channel is to let each user modulate
a distint assigned waveform without requiring a multiple-access protocol to
coordinate transmission periods with the other transmitters. From both the
practical and theroetical viewpoints, the main object of interest is the
asynchronous Gaussian multiple-access channel where the users transmit
simultaneously and independently without maintaining common timing. The
objectives of this research are the analysis and design of multiuser
demondulators and the derivation of the main performance limits of the channel,
assessed in terms of the minimum bit-error-rate and the region of informaiton
rates at which reliable communication is possible. Also under investigation is
the analysis of random-access protocols for channels that, unlike conventional
collision channels, allow the reception of several simultaneous transmissions.
