Due to potential large economic impact as well as public safety issues, the
study of atmospheric mesoscale convective systems (MCS) is a high priority topic
of research. Under this award, the Principal Investigator will pursue several
research tasks that involve meteorological phenomena associated with MCSs and
other convective storms:

o Perform a detailed observational analysis of the environment in which MCSs
initiate and develop with a focus on predictability. o Perform simulations to
investigate the sensitivity of MCS development to initial convective ensemble
configuration in numerical models. o Examine the impacts of forward flank
downdraft and rear flank downdraft cold-pool variability on mesocyclones and
near-surface tornado-like vorticity in simulated supercell tornado-producing
storms. o Simulate and diagnosis, using airborne Doppler radar, derecho cases
(high straight line winds) observed in the Bow Echo and Mesoscale Convective
Vortex Experiment (BAMEX).

This research will contribute to fundamental understanding of the behavior and
evolution of severe thunderstorms and MCSs. The methodological approach involves
a combination of numerical simulations and diagnostic studies.

Successful completion of this research will lead to better understanding which
may result in better short range prediction of weather phenomena associated with
severe storms and MCSs, including tornadoes, heavy rainfall, and severe winds.
