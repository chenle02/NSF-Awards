The number field sieve is the latest algorithm for factoring integers into
primes. The investigator will continue his research into the speed of the number
field sieve. The plan is first, to study the precise distribution of certain
vectors constructed in the number field sieve; second, to develop tools to
analyze the probability that vectors chosen from a non-uniform distributimn will
be independent; third, combine these results to sharpen the known heuristics for
the time taken by the number field sieve. The investigator will also consider
various problems in multiprecision arithmetic from a geometric viewpoint. This
research falls into the general mathematical field of Number Theory. Number
theory has its historical roots in the study of the whole numbers, addressing
such questions as those dealing with the divisibility of one whole number by
another. It is among the oldest branches of mathematics and was pursued for many
centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within the last half century it
has become an indispensable tool in diverse applications in areas such as data
transmission and processing, and communication systems.
