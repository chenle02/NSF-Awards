The goal of this project is to improve students' laboratory experience in
electrochemistry at the University of Arkansas-Little Rock. Students enrolled in
the instrumental analysis course and those pursuing research projects will use a
versatile computer-controlled electrochemical analyzer, an instrument capable of
performing most of the major electroanalytical techniques by software commands.
The instrument will be used to design and carry out several laboratory course
experiments as well as student research projects. With this equipment, students
will gain thorough knowledge of the fundamentals and analytical applications of
electrochemistry.
