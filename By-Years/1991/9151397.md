An upper-division mathematics computer classroom/laboratory (CCL) has been
established in the Department of Mathematics. The CCL has nine standalone
DECstation 3100s capable of running, without accessing a server, powerful
mathematical software. These workstations and the software serve as catalysts
for transforming a traditional mathematics classroom into a mathematics cauldron
of interaction, experimentation and discovery. The CCL is used in a broad range
of theoretical and applied courses and to promote student research projects.
