The PI will work on problems in finite simple groups, lattices and vertex
operator algebras (VOAs). Work on VOAs is joint with Chongying Dong. The main
goal is to build moonshine-like VOAs for finite simple groups (as done for the
monster in the mid 80s). Lattice constructions and analyses support this goal
but recent work on lattices has a life of its own due to new techniques and
applications. (1) The PI plans to strengthen recent joint work on uniqueness for
the important moonshine VOA by reducing hypotheses. (2) The PI plans to give new
constructions of sporadic groups and VOAs which enshrine them. This will involve
revisions of existing moonshine VOA theories and adaptions to particular
sporadic groups, and other work with the more classic lattice type VOAs. The
result would be a new and uniform setting of most finite simple groups. (3) The
PI's recent work on lattices has concentrated on spinoffs of the Barnes-Wall
series. The PI will continue this study. The PI will build new series of
lattices with series of finite groups as automorphism groups. Certain of these
series and spinoffs will be used in part (2). Some of these lattices have
relatively high minimum norms (and could be extremal), so the PI will try to
settle those norms. Automorphism groups of some of these lattices will be
determined. Uniqueness theories will be developed. (4) The PI plans to do more
work on automorphism groups of low rank VOAs and on the connections between
nonassociative algebras and VOAs.

The PI hopes this proposal will help integrate sporadic groups into
traditionally mainstream mathematics. Sporadic simple groups are finite simple
groups which are not naturally part of the infinite series (classical groups,
alternating groups). The program with lattices links certain infinite series of
lattices involving classical groups over finite fields with those associated to
sporadic groups. The program with VOA theory will link finite groups, general
algebraic groups and infinite dimensional Lie theory. Lattices, VOAs and simple
groups are connected to many parts of mathematics and mathematical physics.
