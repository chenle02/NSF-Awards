This three year program, a collaborative of public and private sector
organizations and business in Dayton, Ohio, will address needs for the
improvement of the K-12 science education program in the Dayton Public Schools.
This will be accomplished through in-service training of teachers and through
pilot testing and assessment of components of a revised science curriculum. The
collaborative brings together the resources of 27 partners. The lead agency will
be the University of Dayton. University faculty from science disciplines,
science education, and teacher education will provide academic year and summer
coursework to help teachers from five elementary and secondary Professional
Development Schools in the City of Dayton Public Schools improve content
knowledge and science teaching skills. A seminar series for secondary level
teachers will be taught by scientists, engineers, and other personnel employed
by private sector partners. The participating teachers will receive intensive
training to prepare them for roles as trainers and on-site resource staff for
personnel in other schools within the district. Training will emphasize the
development of critical thinking skills and the use of interactive learner-
centered science lessons. Content areas to be covered for elementary teachers
includes environmental science and organismal biology. Biology, geology,
chemistry, and physics will be offered to secondary teachers. Fifty elementary
school and 30 secondary school personnel from the five Professional Development
Schools will participate in the project. Workshops will take place both during
the academic year and summer months. Summer workshops will be two weeks in
duration. An amount equal to 151% of NSF costs has been provided as cost
sharing.
