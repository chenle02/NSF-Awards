9631710 Kikinis In surgery it is necessary to recognize the boundary between
healthy and diseased tissues. This is especially true for surgery in the brain
where it is important to preserve as much healthy tissue as possible in the
process of removing all of the diseased matter. Also, the boundary, which is
irregularly shaped, must be identified in three dimensions. Surgeons typically
examine medical images from magnetic resonance (MR) and computerized x-ray
tomographic (CT) scanners to extract diagnostic information for surgical
procedures. Currently surgeons are forced to imagine the three-dimensional
situation for presurgery planning, something the human brain is not well suited
to performing in a precise and reproducible manner. In order to provide a
complete engineering solution to this problem using high performance computers,
the following steps have to be performed: (1) acquisition of data in a suitable
geometric raster; (2) generation of three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions; (3)
registration of the 3D reconstructions to the patient on the operating room
table; and, (4) labeling of relevant tissue structures in the data
(segmentation). The technology required for achieving steps (1) - (3) is being
developed outside of medicine. However, this is not true for segmentation, which
is the least advanced of the four steps; this investigation seeks to develop
core segmentation algorithms for solving the problem. Work during this
investigation is to concentrate on template- based segmentation and operator-
driven segmentation in neurosurgical applications. In template-based
segmentation the goal is to improve the ability to establish correspondence
structures automatically in cases with moderate pathology. The operator-based
segmentation portion of the investigation would develop a working platform for
the integration of a volume editor and a force feedback device needed for
algorithmically more complex projects such as segmentation in three-dimension s.
