9322119 Spinrad Since the timings, locations, and results of specific entry
events is difficult to know ahead of time, Dr. Spinrad plans a comprehensive
series of observations on the large-scale circum-Jovian environment to be
carried out at the Lick and Leuschner Observatories. The scientific goals
include imaging the boundaries and observing the flows in the outer Jovian
magnetosphere, detailing potentially radical changes, and watching the recovery
of the Io plasma torus. Dr. Spinrad will also observe the spectra of some large-
impact fireballs via satellite reflection spectra and will image morphological
changes in the Jovian atmosphere.
