The objective of this research is to develop a novel framework for analysis of
large volumes of streaming data, where data characteristics change over time,
and all new data are unlabeled and unstructured. The proposed work will be
seminal for analyzing streaming nonstationary and unlabeled data while removing
the unrealistic assumptions and simplifications made by existing approaches. The
proposed approach uses small initial training data to label the currently
unlabeled new data, creates an envelope around this data and shrinks the
envelope to determine the core support region of the data. Samples are extracted
from this region to serve as future training data to iteratively label the new
incoming unlabeled drifting data. Once initialized, this approach never needs
labeled data, and can indefinitely track the changes in data distribution. The
primary intellectual merit is a new framework, addressing arguably one of the
most challenging learning problems, accomplished by strategic integration of
machine learning and computational geome-try. Significant fundamental knowledge
will be obtained through formal development of this framework, which will then
benefit many real-world applications, currently not properly addressed under
existing ap-proaches. Broader Impacts: The proposed framework promises to bring
us closer to truly adaptive and intelligent (brain-like) learning, and allow
proper analysis of data drawn from aforementioned scenarios, whose ap-plications
include network intrusion, cyber security, web-usage analysis, natural language
processing, anomaly detection, climate change and energy demand analysis.
Project's educational component will form Integrated Research and Learning
Communities, drawing undergraduate students to whom this field has been mostly
inaccessible.
