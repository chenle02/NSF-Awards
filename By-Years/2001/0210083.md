Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: 2002 Gordon Research
Conference on Catalysis&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
CTS-0210083&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Jingguang
Chen&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Gordon Research
Conferences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gordon Conference on Catalysis
(GCC) in 2002 will be held on June 23-28 Colby-Sawyer College in New Hampshire.
The conference will focus on several areas that are key to the fundamental
understanding of catalytic systems: molecular level characterization of
catalysts, quantitative descriptions of reaction pathways, novel materials, fuel
cell catalysis, chiral catalysis, and the conversion of nitrogen oxides in
combustion products. The themes and speakers are of interest to both academic
and industrial communities. Current and future trends in heterogeneous catalysis
will be the general theme. This grant will provide partial support for speakers,
graduate students, post-doctoral students, and younger faculty. &lt;br/&gt;
