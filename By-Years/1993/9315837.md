This Minority Research Initiation Career Advancement Award is made by the
Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program to Dr. Gregory H.
Robinson of the Chemistry Department, Clemson University, for exploratory
research on the synthesis of novel organoaluminum compounds. Emphasis will be
placed on the preparation and characterization of species containing aluminum-
aluminum bonds. The synthesis of a new class of compunds containing eight
aluminum atoms in a cubic arrangement will be attempted. Should the synthesis be
successful, it would have important implications for main group chemistry and
the development of novel materials. This award will enable Dr. Robinson to
enhance the synthetic component of his research laboratory, which currently is
well-known for structural characterization of main group compounds.
