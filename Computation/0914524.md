Most algorithmic research in optimization has focused on models consisting of a
single objective together with a number of constraints, all defined precisely
and deterministically, where an exact solution is required. This paradigm is
inadequate in many applications. First, there is often uncertainty in the model
and data; this is being dealt with by a recent upsurge of work in stochastic and
robust optimization. Second, users often require a simple approximate solution
rather than a more complicated exact solution. When the problem is formulated in
the appropriate space, simplicity is often manifested as sparsity - the vector
of variables has relatively few nonzeros. Inclusion of nonsmooth regularization
terms in the formulation can steer the model toward sparse solutions. This
proposal focuses chiefly on algorithms and theory for sparse and regularized
optimization, and on application of the methods to such important areas as
compressed sensing, machine learning, computational statistics, and image
processing. The project also takes a higher-level view, cross-fertilizing
algorithmic ideas across different application areas, and devising and analyzing
algorithms in general settings that encompass many specific applications.

Optimization methods can be used to solve a great variety of practical
problems, such as design of cancer treatment plans, removing noise and blur from
images and videos, identifying genomic and environmental risk factors for
diseases, and reconstructing pictures, signals, and other data sets from limited
random samples. Precise mathematical formulations of these optimization problems
are available, and exact solutions can often be obtained, but what is needed in
many cases is a simple, approximate solution that is easy to compute,
understand, and apply. To take one example: Many images can be stored by taking
a small number of random combinations of the pixels that make up the image. The
optimization algorithm that reconstructs the original picture from the samples
should look for the simplest picture that is roughly consistent with the random
observations; this image is likely to appear more natural than complicated
images that give an exact match to the data. This project investigates how the
mathematical statements of problems like this one, and the mathematical methods
that solve them, can be modified to produce simple solutions.
