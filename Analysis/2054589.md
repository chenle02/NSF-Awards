Designing materials with revolutionary properties is a central theme of
industrial and applied research. Prototypes include topological insulators
(extraordinarily robust one-way communication devices that promise to stabilize
quantum computations), invisibility cloaks (textiles that deviate light away
from themselves) and atomic-thin batteries (such as paints that absorb and
reutilize energy from Wi-Fi or telecommunication waves). This project aims to
(a) develop quantitative tools to predict the behavior of quantum particles
within such tailored environments; (b) apply these tools to engineer materials
with optimized anomalous effects; and (c) train a workforce with a solid
background in both quantum science and quantitative analysis. These objectives
can aid the design of a new generation of technological devices via an enhanced
understanding of quantum phenomena.

The focus will be on three themes that carry high promises in technological
fields: (i) the asymmetric propagation of energy along edges of topological
insulators; (ii) the generation and the effects of pseudo-magnetism; and (iii)
the density of states in thin-layer materials. The first topic quantitatively
analyzes the characteristics of energy transport between topologically distinct
materials: the group velocity of waves, the profile of asymmetric channels, the
influence of perturbations. The second topic investigates mathematically Landau
levels and quantum Hall effects in custom-made materials that enact artificial
magnetic fields of intensities inaccessible to classical experiments. The last
topic focuses on twisted bilayer graphene, a revolutionary structure that - for
specifically tuned parameters - exhibits high-density state-packing and
superconductivity. The mathematical investigation of these phenomena relies on
developing and applying diverse and sophisticated analytic tools such as
semiclassical calculus for periodic operators, scattering theory and distorted
plane waves in Dirac-like systems, multiscale and homeogenization techniques of
quasiperiodic structures, and spectral theory of non-selfadjoint operators.
