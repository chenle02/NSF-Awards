This instrument is allowing NMR experiments to be incorporated into the
curricula at all levels, which result in enhanced laboratory experiences for the
students. At the introductory level the NMR is used to demonstrate to general
education students the relationship between structure and the utility of
petroleum products; to allied health students, the application of NMR in
medicine; and to science majors, the affect of hybridization on chemical shifts.
In organic chemistry students gain hands-on experience with NMR through the
structural analysis of reaction products, unknowns, and during ten-week
individual projects. The biochemistry students will determine a specific drug
binding to proteins through NMR. In physical chemistry, students discover the
quantitative utility of NMR by using it to determine both equilibrium and rate
constants. The advantages of signal averaging, the principles of Fourier
Transform and pulse NMR spectroscopy, and the significance of reaction rates is
illustrated in instrumental analysis. An accessible NMR provides the
undergraduates with the opportunity to participate in research at a higher level
than would otherwise be possible. The institution is matching the NSF grant with
an equal amount of funds.
