This project in the Physical Chemistry Program investigates the Soret effect
(thermal diffusion) in electrolyte solutions. The heat (or entropy) of transport
will be measured. An hydrodynamic theory for the standard heat (or entropy) of
transport at infinite dilution will be formulated. It is pointed out that the
hydrodynamic approach enables one to conduct a systematic investigation of the
Soret effect based on the structural and dynamical models of electrolyte
solutions. This helps to identify how the structure and dynamics make their
contributions to the Soret data. New concepts such as "thermal moment" and
"thermal polarization" are found to be important in the discussion of the Soret
effect. Experimental investigation of the Soret effect at low temperature for
simple electrolytes and complex-ion systems at room temperature will study the
size and exchange effects on the heat of transport.
