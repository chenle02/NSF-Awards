0307421&lt;br/&gt;Mays&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a cooperative
project between Dr. Herman Mays, Auburn University, and &lt;br/&gt;Dr. Yuan
Hsiao-Wei, National Taiwan University, on breeding ecology, mating systems and
antiphonal duetting in an endemic Taiwanese passerine. This is important
research on tropical birds and can provide new insights into the population
biology of birds in Southeast Asia and a foundation for understanding duetting
behavior. The project provides opportunities to train U.S. undergraduate
students. The project is jointly supported by the National Science Foundation
and the National Science Council of Taiwan. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
