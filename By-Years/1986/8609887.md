The flow cytometry/cell sorting facility of the University of Wiscon- sin,
Department of Zoology will expanded and upgraded. This facility, established
initially with funds from the National Science Foundation augmented by
supplemental funding from the University of Wisconsin and the National
Institutes of Health, now serves the campus-wide research community. New
advances in technology as well as the increased use of flow cytometric
techniques in a broad range of research studies drive the need to upgrade the
facility. The facility as a whole serves broadly many types of research work in
immunology, physiology, develop- mental biology regulatory biology, cell
biology, molecular biology and genetics. The staff serve as a major source of
expertise for the design of experiments utilizing flow cytometric techniques,
and the facility has as one of its key functions the carrying out of ex-
ploratory and feasibility studies. A new analytical sorter will be obtained with
50% cost sharing between NSF and the University of Wisconsin. The facility has
been place on line to University central facility, via a DECNET, allowing
general user access.//
