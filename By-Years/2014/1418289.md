Today the Internet constitutes a critical infrastructure: an attack or
disruption has the potential to cause serious damage to institutions supporting
key resources, such as water, power, transportation, finance, emergency
response, business operations and manufacturing supply chains. Consequently,
there is interest in a myriad of interdisciplinary approaches to achieve
increased security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes to conduct a 2.5-day
workshop for 20-30 invited participants in order to gain a deeper understanding
of the challenges and potential solutions for a secure Internet. The workshop
brings together experts in network design, cybersecurity, and policy, spanning
industry, academia, and the government. The goal of the Ideas Lab is to explore
pathways and find solutions for a secure Internet based on interdisciplinary
approaches that take into account technology, social sciences, policy and
education. The Ideas Lab will be coordinated by a five-member Steering Committee
composed of leading experts and the PI. In addition, expert facilitators will be
used to create a highly productive workshop that will be tailored to achieve the
specific objective of finding solutions for a secure Internet.
