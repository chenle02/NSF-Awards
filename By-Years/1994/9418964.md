9418964 Doniach New computer simulation techniques for representing the
conformational kinetics of polypeptides and proteins in solution will be
developed. These techniques will comprise two developments: the use of
overdamped constrained Langevin dynamics to represent the kinetics of a
polypeptide chain, in which the positions in Cartesian space and forces on all
atoms of the peptide are taken into account; and the development of the
representation of the interaction of the peptide with solvent. The overdamped
constrained Langevin dynamics, which has recently been published by Gronbech-
Jensen and Doniach, is obtained by projecting out all components of the force
field which would tend to alter constrained bond lengths, and hence, bond angles
in the peptide backbone and side chains. The treatment of solvent will be based
both on a Langevin dynamics approach to explicit water molecules, their
interactions between each other and with the peptide, and on a novel "mean-
field" approach to the calculation of the hydration shell of a polypeptide out
to a distance of 8 Angstrom from the surface atoms. These new techniques will be
applied to the simulation of the helix-random coil transitions in small
polypeptide chains 13 to 20 residues which are known to have nascent helix
properties. ***
