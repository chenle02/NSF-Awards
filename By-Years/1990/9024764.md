Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will include studies of the
manner in which the angular momentum of a nucleon is divided among the
constituents of the nucleon, analyses of possible signals of a light Higgs
particle (whose discovery would provide important information on the origin of
mass), investigations of the physics behind the confinement of quarks within
nucleons, and an extremely precise calculation of the magnetic dipole moment of
an electron. The sharing of the angular momentum of a nucleon among its
constituents has been made very puzzling by recent data. Questions relating to
the origin of mass or the confinement of quarks are of central importance in our
attempt to understand the elementary particles.
