Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wetzel-9911237&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Effects Of
Elevated Atmospheric CO2 On Plant Detritus Nutritional Quality And Heterotrophic
Utilization In Aquatic Ecosystems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The influence of elevated
atmospheric carbon dioxide levels on aquatic ecosystems is relatively ignored
compared to research occurring in terrestrial systems. The proposed research
will examine the influence of leaves grown under elevated carbon dioxide levels
on stream microbial communities and selected small animals and insects. Aspen
trees will be grown under identical conditions except one set will be exposed to
elevated carbon dioxide. The microbial colonization of these two sets of leaves
in streams will be studied to determine how leaf quality affects utilization and
loss of leaf litter. This processed litter will then be fed to crustaceans and
insects to determine a potential impact of global change.&lt;br/&gt;
