ABSTRACT: 9224738, PI-Smith: The PI will test whether the effects of Iceland hot
spot are decoupled from the processes that build the axial topography and thus
shallow crust at Reykjanes Ridge, or whether the hot spot produces an observable
morphological signature at the axis. She will use hydroweep multibeam cum TOBI
deep tow data to investigate the characteristics of volcano morphology in three
areas of the axis of Reykjanes Ridge.
