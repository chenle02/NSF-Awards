The supraspecific taxa of the Pterolichidae (Acarina), a family restricted to
the non-Passeriformes (Aves). Mite ectoparasites are know from all groups of
birds except penguins, emus, cassowaries and todids. About 1,800 species have
been named (an estimated 10% of the existing fauna). These are assigned to 357
named and 58 new genera and arranged in 31 families. Access to information about
these mites is very difficult as few revisions have been completed and a
biblography has never been published. The objectives of this grant are to
provide means for the identification of groups above the species level, with an
indepth study of one family. Included will be illustrations of representative
species, know host-parasite associations, and a bibliography of approximately
700 entries. The resulting publications will provide comprehensive baseline data
on the mite ectoparasites of birds and will open this field of research for
present and future investigators on a worldwide basis.
