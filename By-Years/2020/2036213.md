The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
project is to develop smart, robust healthcare infrastructure in the U.S. by
leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence to streamline clinical
decision support. Voice biomarkers detect a variety of health conditions,
emotions, and diseases and provide a unique, seamless feedback for real-time
triage. Transforming voice intonations into voice biomarkers would allow disease
prediction and monitoring. The proposed voice biomarker technology is
potentially a scalable behavioral health screener to provide equitable care in
all virtual care visits, mitigating the complex and costly (2-3X) comorbidities
of depression and anxiety in 80% of $3T in chronic conditions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
project is dedicated to providing scalable mental health screening in primary
care. The research objectives are to understand the underlying behavioral health
triggers for chronic health conditions from global voice biomarker data combined
with unique, longitudinal metadata. The major technical challenges in this
proposed research include (1) collecting sufficiently diverse metadata labels on
environmental and physiological variables,(2) training distinct models based on
gender, age, and other features that have high variance through principal
component analysis, (3) identifying and minimizing bias for sparse populations
in design, validation, and deployment phases, and (4) improving the current
voice biomarker diagnostic on dimensions of sensitivity, specificity, and
diagnosability in various call center, telehealth platform, remote patient
monitoring, and care management platform modalities. The highly complex
deployments across infrastructure in healthcare require multiple models tuned
for specific health populations and a deep understanding of classical and deep
learning techniques for improving both accuracy and generalizability across
unseen populations. The anticipated technical results in solving this series of
highly challenging machine learning tasks is profound for real-time triage and
access to reliable mental healthcare at scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
