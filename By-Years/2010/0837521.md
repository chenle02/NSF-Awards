Interdisciplinary (99) This project is developing an innovative capability to
add the detailed study of micro- and nanoscale phenomena using
Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) into a variety of laboratory settings in
engineering and physics. The centerpiece of this effort is the development of a
low-cost MEMS Education Chip and controller system accessible through standard
and widely available laboratory tools (both microscope and computer). Use of the
chip permits the illustration of, and hands-on engagement with, important micro-
to nanoscale concepts for students at many educational levels and in various
disciplines and classes. The intellectual merit of this project rests on strong
interaction among theory, computer simulation, design, and on-chip experiments.
In addition MEMS devices incorporate concepts that span many engineering and
science disciplines and typically require interdisciplinary research and
development efforts for successful implementation. As micro- and nanoscale
systems continue to become mainstream devices, this project's broader impacts
arise through its ability to support new laboratory programs and modes of
teaching and learning that promote an environment conducive to producing
undergraduate students who are well prepared for high-tech careers and advanced
studies. Having a standardized MEMS chip for testing and simulation is cost
effective and allows many universities to participate, allowing more
interactions and advancement of the MEMS education community.
