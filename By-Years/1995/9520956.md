9520956 Bennett A generalized inverse, or four-dimensional variational
assimilation scheme for the Equatorial Pacific ocean will be developed. A time-
dependent, multi-level, non-linear primitive equation model will be a weak
constraint. Initial conditions and forcing will be varied in order to fit data
from the TOGA TAO Array, surface drifters, tidegauges and altimetry. The
produced fields will allow detailed interpretation of the TOGA TAO data and
provide more accurate and dynamically consistent initial conditions for forecast
models.
