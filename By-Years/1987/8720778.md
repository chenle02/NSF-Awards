They will study the structural, thermodynamic, kinetic and electronic properties
of surfaces using low-energy diffraction and related techniques. The general
problems addressed include the physics of surface reconstruction, surface phase
transformations and kinetics, metal/surface interfaces, and the interactions
between adsorbed atoms. They will emphasize two new experimental techniques
which should contribute to the understanding of the atomic arrangement of many
reconstructed surfaces: the ability to study surfaces with an externally
applied, uniform and variable strain and the ability to use collimated beams of
alkali metal atoms to study the equilibrium adsorption of alkalis on
semiconductor and metal surfaces.
