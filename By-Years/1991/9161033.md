This study looks at the feasibility of producing fiber-reinforced diamond
composites specifically for structural and tribological applications. Phase I
research involves increasing the toughness of diamond matrix composites by
adding continuous silicon carbide fiber reinforcement and by modifying the
fiber/matrix interface. Mechanical properties such as, strength, strain-to-
failure, and fiber pullout length are determined in bending and tensile testing
at the Materials Department, University of California, Santa Barbara. The long
term goal is a new class of composite materials which are tough and have high
thermal conductivity and more corrosion and wear resistance than current ceramic
composites.
