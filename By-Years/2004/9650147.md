The objective of this project is the acquisition of a Laser Doppler Velocimeter
(LDV) and water tunnel for the newly developed Thermal Sciences Laboratory. The
LDV serves as an instructional tool for linking material taught in the three
foundational thermal science courses of fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and
thermodynamics and as an introduction to a state-of-the-art measurement system
that is becoming more and more utilized in industry and academia. The addition
of the LDV and water tunnel experiments supports a change that adds a 1-credit
Thermal Sciences Laboratory and a 1-credit Fluid Mechanics Laboratory to the
Mechanical Engineering curriculum. The target audience for the project is
undergraduate mechanical engineering students, but the project also affects
undergraduate students in the fields of chemical and civil and environmental
engineering. The equipment is also being used to demonstrate LDV operation and
basic fluid/thermal phenomena to high school students in an established pre-
engineering program at the university. The impact of the project is an increased
student understanding of often elusive thermal science principles and student
familiarity with an instrumentation system that could enhance the
competitiveness of their future employers.
