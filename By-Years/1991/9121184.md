This proposal is for support of student travel to the 35th International
Symposium on Electron, Ion and Photon Beams, in Seattle, Washington, May 28-31,
1991. The symposium will cover the latest research results in the fields of
nanofabrication, microfabrication, electron and ion lithographies, x- ray
lithography, particle beam optics, and forefront applications of
nanofabrication. At this conference the latest research from groups around the
world are usually reported first. The proceedings of the conference will be
published in the Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology.
