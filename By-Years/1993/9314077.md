9314077 Souganidis This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
research in applied mathematics between the Center for Mathematical Sciences,
University Wisconsin and the University of Paris- Dauphine. The U.S. team leader
is Panagiotis E. Souganidis, and his French counterpart is Pierre-Louis Lions.
Their research is in the general area of nonlinear, partial differential
equations and mathematical analysis. This project emphasizes variational
problems, fully nonlinear elliptic equations, kinetic theory of conservation
laws, generalized front propagation and mathematical models in finance. Taking
advantage of complementary expertise in almost all these areas, the
investigators will form small groups to address modelling, theoretical and
numerical analysis as applied to practical cases. These problems have important
applications in theoretical physics, mechanics, biology, chemistry and finance.
