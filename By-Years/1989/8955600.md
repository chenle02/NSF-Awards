Washington State University will initiate a 2-week residential multidisciplinary
Young Scholars project for 30 students in grades 10-12. This project focused on
science and engineering research builds a comprehensive support team for high
school students, including the underrepresented. This team will work with the
young scholars during the two week residential session and academic year follow
up research project. During the summer session the students will participate in
group activities to build an understanding of the integral relationship between
science and engineering and research. These activities will also develop an
appreciation of the interactions between science and engineering professionals
and society. At the completion of this project a model will be in place enabling
high school students to access resources leading to careers in science and
engineering research.
