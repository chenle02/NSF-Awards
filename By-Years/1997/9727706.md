9727706 Coe This grant provides partial support to the University of Californa-
Santa Cruz for the costs of upgrading superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM)
and building an in-line alternating field (AF) demagnetizer. The current SRM at
UC-Santa Cruz was purchased in 1985, the third SRM ever built by 2G enterprises.
It suffers from repeated freezing blockages within the liquid helium plumbing
lines, rapid liquid He boil-off rate and an order of magnitude lower sensitivity
than currently available on state- of-the-art SRM's equipped with DC SQUIDs. 2-G
Enterprises will refurbish this SRM with DC SQUIDs and with improvements in the
plumbing and thermal design that will both reduce operating costs and increase
safety. The AF demagnetizer will be built in-house. The increased sensitivity
afforded paleomagnetic investigations through addition of DC SQUIDS will improve
the reliability of paleomagnetic declinations and inclinations calculated for
weakly magnetized rocks and sediments. Funded tectonic studies in southern Asia
and the eastern California shear zone will immediately benefit from this
upgrade. Furthermore, the capabilities of an in-line AF demagnetizer will enable
elimination of secondary component magnetizations in samples that have been
struck by lighting and will prove useful for paleointensity measurements made on
Miocene flood basalts from Steens Mountain and early Cretaceous flood basalts
from the Parana Basin in Brazil. These measurements are crucial for
understanding past variations in the geomagnetic field. ***
