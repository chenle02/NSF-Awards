NSF SaTC (Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace) program has provided a steady
support of innovative research, education, and transition to practice projects
over the past decade. However, the cyber security research front has
continuously moved forward with recent developments in internet of things,
artificial intelligence, social media, quantum computing in a post-covid world,
requiring a rethinking of future directions. and a new investment strategy and
investment priorities of the NSF SaTC program. This proposal outlines the
background, structure, and timeline for the SaTC 2.0 strategic planning
activity, as well as the development of a SaTC 2.0 vision document. The effort
will begin with pre-planning and information gathering activities, followed by a
multi-day, working workshop. The outcomes from the workshop will be a collection
of recommendations and ideas for the future of cybersecurity research (over the
next 10 years).

The SaTC v2 workshop and the vision document will help NSF to revamp its
flagship cyber security research program through increased partnerships and
collaboration among academia, industry, government, and to achieve NSF’s long-
term goal of increasing diversity to improve the well-being of traditionally
underrepresented individuals in society, improving national security and
enhancing our nation’s competitiveness, and building a better infrastructure for
research and education.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
