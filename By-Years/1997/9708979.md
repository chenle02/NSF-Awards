9708979 Drewes Of over a quarter of a million herpetological specimens at the
California Academy of Sciences, 97,861 specimens bear metal tags. The metal
tags, upon which catalog number and/or locality data are embossed, were part of
the standard curatorial procedure during the first half of this century as
outlined by then-curator Joseph R. Slevin in 1927. Because of their large size
relative to the size of the specimens, and their mass, the tags have caused
physical damage to specimens, particularly small fragile ones. Over the years
many of these tags have corroded, making the catalog numbers they bear
illegible. This project will replace the metal tags with fiber catalog tags
consistent with the rest of the collection, in order to mitigate and prevent
further damage to specimens and loss of irretrievable data. NSF funds will
provide dedicated technical assistance and new prenumbered fiber tags to replace
all metal tags in the collection.
