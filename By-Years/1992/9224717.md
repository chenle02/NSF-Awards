9224717 Weber This is an award the objective of which is to understand the
mechanisms for methylation of inorganic tin and dimethylation of methyltin
compounds in estuarine salt marshes. This knowledge has potential applicability
in determination of the potential hazards that aquatic sediments contained with
these compounds pose to aquatic organisms and to their ecosystem. Specifically,
the research addresses the seasonal variations of inorganic tin and methyltin
compounds in marsh grass, the methylation of these tin compounds in marsh
sediments, in sediment slurries and in mixed and pure cultures of microorganisms
isolated from the estuarine marsh habitat. Methyl and butyltin compounds are
ubiquitous in marine coastal environments, thought generally to have originated
from use of tin compounds as ingredients of marine antifouling paints. These
compounds wear off or flake from the surfaces to which they are applied and
become associated with benthic deposits. Methylated tin compounds are
considerably more toxic to life-forms than tin itself, and are more mobile and
easily bioaccumulated. Results of this research are expected to provide insights
into appropriate management of contaminated aquatic sediments to reduce their
potential biocidal effects on the ecosystem into which they are introduced or to
which they may be transported.
