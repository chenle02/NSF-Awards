Saltman This award supports research on both Brauer groups and the rationality
problem for invariant fields. The principal investigator is specifically
interested in the rationality problem for the center of the generic division
algebra. A considerable part of this proposal concerns all these subjects,
linked by the unramified cohomology. The principal investigator will determine
if the unramified cohomology can be used to show the center of the generic
division algebra is nonrational and if it can be used to show other invariant
fields are nonrational. He will also see if the Merkuriev-Suslin theorem can be
made more constructible and if the theory of toric varieties can be used to find
good projective models for multiplicative invariant fields. The research
supported is in the general area of field theory. Fields are algebraic
structures similar to the rational numbers, the real numbers, and the complex
numbers in that each nonzero element has an inverse with respect to
multiplication. Field theory is a rich and deep subject with its historical
roots arising from the early attempts to systematically describe the zeros of
polynomials. ***
