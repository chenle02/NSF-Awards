This award is in the joint ENG/CISE research thrust in Intelligent Material
Handling Systems. Its objective is to develop an integrated procedure for the
implementation of a stockless system by hospitals for a more cost efficient
material management program. Given the scope of a stockless system, the research
aims to integrate the entire distribution pipeline, from medical supply
distributors to supply stations at Nurses Stations at hospitals and will address
engineering and operational issues throughout the pipeline. The project will
investigate organizational, operational, and engineering needs that must be
instituted both at hospitals and supplier distribution centers to operate a
successful stockless system. This includes hardware designs for material
packaging and containerization at warehouses, material supply stations at Nurses
Stations, and the use of such hardware for material dispensing to patients from
Nurses Stations. Accurate information exchange is crucial to the success of a
stockless system. The procedures also include material location,
packaging/palletizing, and order retrieval. Therefore, the project will also
address equipment requirements and develop techniques for warehouse layout and
order picking which impact the distribution system.
