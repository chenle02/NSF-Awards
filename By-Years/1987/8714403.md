In recent years, there is an increasing body of knowledge about juror and jury
decisionmaking, especially in terms of the determinants of convicting or
acquitting a defendant at trial. While some of the more interesting studies in
this arena have begun to examine how jurors reason in rendering legal judgments,
only slowly have social scientists begun turning their attention to the
interrelationship between rules of evidence and the inference process of jurors.
Two critical forms of information that come into play in conviction and
sentencing are aggravating and mitigating evidence. Dr. Tanford aims to examine
the impact and interplay of both through a series of four experiments. Designed
with the highest standards of rigor and sensitivity to generality and
plausibility, these studies emphasize the penalty phase of a capital murder
trial. All studies use jury-eligible subjects and videotaped trial reenactments.
The aggravation and mitigation manipulations include future dangerousness versus
future value to society, intent versus lack of intent, brutality/
psychopathology versus external justifications. By systematic manipulation of
such factors, this research should be able to isolate how jurors reason and
weigh evidence and what accounts for differences in inference processes and
decisionmaking.
