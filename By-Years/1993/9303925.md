In ranked data each observation is a permutation of n items. Because the
permutations do not have a natural linear ordering, many common statistical
methods are inappropriate for ranked data. However, the permutations of n items
can be naturally placed on the vertices of a polytope inscribed in a sphere in
n-1 dimensional Euclidean space. This geometry suggests new graphical and
analytical methods for analyzing full and partially ranked data. Of particular
interest are probability density histograms, spectral analysis, kernal smoothing
methods, and confidence regions. Statistical methods are proposed to analyze
ranked data. Ranked data occur when a group of "judges" are asked to evaluate a
set of items and then to rank them in order of preference. Hence, each "judge"
states his first, second, etc., and last choices among the items that he has
evaluated. Proper methods to graphically display and analyze ranked data are
very important. This type of data is encountered frequently in the social
sciences, in market research, and in elections. A less well known, but equally
important area in which ranked data are encountered is expert systems for
military applications.
