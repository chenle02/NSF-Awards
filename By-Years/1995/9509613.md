9509613 Rastetter Multiple Resource Interactions and Ecosystem Function
Terrestrial ecosystems perform many important functions including the cycling
and sequestration of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, and water, and the
production of biomass and soil organic matter. These functions are tightly
constrained by (1) the nutritional requirements of plants and soil
microorganisms, (2) the ability of plants and microorganisms to adapt to changes
in their environment, (3) the amounts of various nutrients in the ecosystem, and
(4) the rate at which these nutrients are supplied to or lost from the
ecosystem. This study will synthesize the effects of these various constraints
on ecosystem function through the development mf a theoretical model that
includes the interactions between ecosystem element cycles, the acclimation of
vegetation and soil microorganisms to changes in the availability of these
elements, and the changes in species composition resulting from competition for
the elements. The results will improve the understanding of both ecosystem
biogeochemistry and community processes, should result in closer linkage between
ecosystem and community ecology, will help to predict and interpret the
responses of ecosystems and plant communities to changes in the environment, and
will help explain why different ecosystems respond differently to changes in the
environment. ??
