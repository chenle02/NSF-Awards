This award provides partial funding for the design and development of a
daylighting and lighting simulation facility being constructed at the University
of Michigan's College of Architecture and Urban Planning. The facility includes
various research and design tools, including a 30-foot diameter hemispherical
sky simulator for daylighting studies; a full scale photometric simulation
laboratory; an integrating sphere for window and shading systems studies. The
facility also provides state-of-the art computer simulation modeling in
daylighting, lighting, and energy. The objectives are to provide a facility in
which various architectural spaces can be modeled and tested, and will be
available to research, teaching, and design faculties, as well as professionals
in design communities. Due to the high cost of energy, the contributions of this
type of facility have been recognized by the research, education, and design
communities throughout the country. The University of Michigan is a member of
Daylighting Network of North America and has regional research center
designation. This new facility is designed in such a way as to be used as a
prototype for fabrication by other interested educational and research
institutions.
