Funded by a Research Initiation Award, experimental research will be carried
out on microbursts. Microbursts are intense downdrafts which can occur during
intense thunderstorms. Experimental information is lacking, and this research
will create laboratory simulations with heavy saline water in a water tank
experiment with otherwise freshwater. Flow visualization and particle imaging
velocimetry will provide data on the dynamics of microbursts and their
interaction with the ground. Microbursts have been responsible for the
catastrophic crashes of aircraft, and their structure and development is still
largely unknown.
