This project establishes an interdisciplinary laboratory for the education of
manufacturing engineering technicians, robotics technicians, and drafting/design
technicians in a realistic, collaborative environment. The laboratory involves a
CAD-based advanced prototype design and production system involving
participation by students from all three disciplines. In this interaction,
students from the different programs collaborate on the design, prototyping, and
manufacture of discrete parts. The equipment used includes a computer-
controlled system utilizing a ultra-violet laser and photo- sensitive resin to
produce accurate prototypes of parts from CAD drawings. Additional equipment
allows these prototypes to be measured and refined and then used to reconfigure
an existing factory laboratory to manufacture the parts. As a result of this
lab, students in the three disciplines gain knowledge in the use of advanced
prototype production equipment and, more importantly, in how the different
disciplines must interact and collaborate in an industrial setting. Thus, the
proposed laboratory improvement upgrades the education of technical and
engineering students in the different disciplines, and provides a model for how
those disciplines can and should interact in order to prepare those students
realistically and effectively for careers in an industrial environment.
