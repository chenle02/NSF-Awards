The PIs will study superlocalization, and the Ioffe-Regel linewidth condition
for strongly localized states (fractons); calculate many physical properties of
random structures utilizing the percolating network as a model; investigate the
effects of lattice anharmonicity for tenuous structures; calculate the Debye-
Waller factor for the Mossbauer effect in random structures; calculate the
structure factor for various classes of site-diluted magnets; examine some
vibrational models with scalar elasticity; perform additional studies of quasi-
crystals; examine further polymers on surfaces; and develop a better description
of growth models with two coupled growth fronts.
