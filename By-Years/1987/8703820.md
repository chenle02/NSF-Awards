Genetic Modification of Rubisco in Chlamydomonas: The chloroplast enzyme
ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) catalyzes
either the carboxylation or oxygenation of RuBP. The relative efficiencies of
these two reactions determine net carbon dioxide fixation in photosynthesis. A
significant increase in plant productivity may be realized by increasing the
ratio of carboxylase/oxygenase activities. Since the catalytic site of the
enzyme is located on the chloroplast-encoded large-subunit polypetide,
photosynthesis-deficient chloroplast mutants of the green alga Chlamydomonas
reinhardii will be analyzed for altered enzyme specificity. Detailed biochemical
analysis of Rubisco enzymes from these mutants will be correlated with the
primary structure of the mutant large-subunit protein; mutant genes will be
cloned and subjected to DNA sequencing. Photosynthesis-competent revertants will
be selected from the mutants, and Rubisco will be analyzed as described for
mutants. The proposed work is significant for several reasons. First,
Chlamydomonas reinhardii has a Rubisco that is similar to the enzyme in higher
plant. Beneficial changes identified in the proposed project could be engineered
into other plants. Second, C. reinhardii is the only organism in which
chloroplast mutations can be induced and recovered on a routine basis. Third,
mutations that cause only a partial deficiency of Rubisco function are being
recovered randomly. Thus, structural determinants of enzyme function may be
identified that have not been identified by previous biochemical or molecular
approaches. Fourth, revertants can be selected for restored Rubisco function and
an elevated carboxylase/oxygenase ratio. Complementing mutations will define the
relationships between three-dimensional enzyme structure and Rubisco function.
In conclusion, the project will combine biochemistry, molecular biology and
genetics to generate new information about the structure/function relationships
of Rubisco.
