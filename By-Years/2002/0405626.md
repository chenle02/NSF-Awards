0405626 Kowalczyk

This U.S.-Chile award will provide support for Dr. Michal Kowalczyk, Kent State
University, to collaborate with Drs. Patricio L. Felmer and Salome Martinez of
the University of Chile in Santiago, Chile. The investigators will collaborate
in the area of nonlinear partial differential equations that arise in the study
of concentration phenomena. More specifically, they aim to study the existence
of transition layers that collapse and disappear in the singular limit. They
will establish asymptotic profiles. It is predicted that this scale will in
general differ from the natural scale of the problem.
