ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Adamchik, Victor&lt;br/&gt;0204003&lt;br/&gt;Carnegie Mellon
U&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Great progress has been made in recent years in the
construction of software for numeric and symbolic computation of transcendental
functions. The algorithms have been implemented in the most widely used symbolic
algebra systems such as Maple and Mathemat-ica. Recently, the National Institute
of Standards and Technology started a project of creating the Digital Library of
Mathematical Functions (http://dlmf.nist.gov/). The goal of the project is to
collect all recent scientific results regarding theory and computational
algorithms of the well-known special functions and make them available to the
public in electronic form. How-ever, enormous gaps remain for "new"
transcendental functions. One of such functions is the multiple gamma (also
called Barnes) Gn-function. The Gn function, defined by a recurrence-
functional&lt;br/&gt;equation as a generalization of the Euler gamma function,
was originally intro-duced (but in different forms) by Kinkelin, Glaisher, and
Barnes around 1900. Today, due to the pioneer work of Peter Sarnak of Princeton
University, the interest to the Barnes function is revived. Sarnak has been
pushing the idea that zeros of certain "zeta functions" (L-functions) can be
understood in terms of the distribution of eigenvalues from classes of random
matrices. It has been conjectured that the limiting distribution of the non-
trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function is the same as that of the
eigenphases of matrices in the CUE (the circulat uni-tary&lt;br/&gt;ensemble) It
has been shown in works by Mehta, Sarnak, Conrey, Keating, Snaith that the
Barnes function naturally appeares there as a closed representation for
statistical averages over CUE of N x N unitary matrices (as well as some other
classical compact groups), when
