9450518 Bright This is a five-year project to prepare five regional service
teams in North Carolina to provide teacher enhancement in Cognitively Guided
Instruction principles and techniques in K-3 mathematics in schools throughout
the state. The five teams, a total of 30 teachers and 10 mathematics educators,
will receive 52 days of training in CGI, leadership skills. In years 3-5, they
will provide teacher enhancement programs, averaging 11 days, to about 130
teachers annually and awareness programs to an equal amount in requesting
districts. It is expected that the teams will continue this enhancement at the
request of additional schools after the NSF support ends. The enhancement
program used with teachers will be developed by the project leaders in
conjunction with the teams. Formative evaluation of the program and team
effectiveness. Summative evaluation will document changes in project teacher's
knowledge about CGI and beliefs about mathematics, and changes in their
students' mathematical knowledge. A monograph on the program and suggestions for
future CHI inservice will be produced.
