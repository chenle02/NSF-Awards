Language scientists have discovered that bilinguals cannot easily "switch off"
one of their languages. If bilinguals cannot easily function as monolinguals,
then how do they control the use of the intended language? This research program
investigates the conditions that enable bilinguals to select the intended
language when words and grammatical structures in both languages are available.
The work will explore how some sentence contexts restrict language processing to
one language alone but others encourage code switching between the bilingual's
two languages. The work uses the experience of bilinguals as a window into the
nature of the interactions that characterize language processing and their
consequences for cognitive control. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has a
number of broader implications. It seeks foundational knowledge about
multilingualism that can inform educational issues in a society in which many
learners are faced with the task of acquiring a second language after the
earliest stages of childhood. The research will also contribute to the training
of a diverse group of cognitive scientists by including bilingual undergraduate
and graduate students and by fostering an international scientific collaboration
with scientists in Spain.
