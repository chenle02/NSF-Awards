This award supports a cooperative pilot project on multiple-natural hazard
mitigation between the US and Taiwan. The effort will be divided into four
tasks. Task I is to inventory information on available natural hazard reduction
technologies and organizations responsible for natural hazards mitigation;
design the data base format, and enter the information. In Task II, a site in
Taiwan will be selected as the demonstration locale and comprehensive data,
e.g., nature of natural hazards, historical records on frequency of occurrence,
population at risk, building inventory, economic vulnerability, etc., will be
compiled. Similar information but in more general terms will be collected for
the US. During Task III, the bilateral program will be designed taking into
account the existing coping mechanisms for the most frequent hazards and
integrating them with the measures taken for less frequent recurring natural
disasters. Three key areas will be addressed: 1) education and training of
specifically identified audiences on strategies to minimize effects of natural
disasters; 2) ways and means to implement available mitigation techniques, e.g.,
building codes for new structures and upgrading for old ones; and 3) research
needed for better dealing with multiple hazard vulnerability. Task IV will
consist of the evaluation of the preceding activities at a workshop, where
findings and recommendations for multiple hazard reduction program
implementation will be presented. The US PI is Dr. George Lee, SUNY, Buffalo,
and the Taiwan PI is Dr. Chao-Shiuan Liu, National Taiwan University.
