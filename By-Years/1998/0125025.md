We will develop techniques that can be used to understand the biology and
ecology of rare and endangered species without direct observations or
experiments on those species. Rare and endangered species are often difficult to
study because their populations are very small and because direct observations
and experiments can harm the species. We will apply geochemical and
paleontological methods to the analysis of shells and bones in museum
collections, archeological sites and natural accumulations. We will use growth
lines in bones and teeth to determine age spans and growth rates. We will use
the geochemistry of the bones and shells to determine diet, water sources, and
salinity. We will examine three rare and endangered species in the northern Gulf
of California: the Colorado delta clam (a mollusk), the totoaba (a fish) and the
Gulf of California harbor porpoise (a marine mammal). These species are
endangered by either direct human activity or through environmental changes
caused by the near-complete diversion of Colorado River water for human uses.
The techniques developed and tested in this project may be applied to the
conservation biology and restoration of other rare and endangered species.
