The objective of this project is to understand the interaction of combustion and
shear layer control techniques. The proposal is to study the fluid mechanics of
combustion of a small aspect ratio rectangular channel sudden expansion. This
configuration utilizes a combination of several control techniques. Active
forcing will be used to drive the system's acoustic resonances and to organize
the shear layer vortical structures for phase locked analysis. Passive forcing
will be introduced via the configuration geometry; the elliptic vortex rings
formed in the shear layer undergo self-induction, deforming the jet cross
section and introducing transverse velocities not found in plane and axi-
symmetric configurations. The approach is experimental, using laser doppler
anemometry and flow visualization to examine the velocity field and premixed
flame in a rectangular sudden expansion. The equivalence ratio will range from
lean, where the stabilization of the flame in the shear layer downstream of the
backward facing step is affected by the passive, active and three dimensional
control techniques, to rich, where the flame/flow interaction is dominated by
acoustic resonances. This will allow determination of the extent to which these
control methods are effective in this configuration. The study will be initially
limited to premixed combustion. The results can later be extended to address
issues in nonpremixed combustion such as the optimization of fuel injection
locations to take advantage of the flowfields produced by the control
techniques. This research is expected to have a significant impact on combustion
applications ranging from industrial pulse combustors and toxic waste
incinerators to subsonic and supersonic combustion in ramjets. The understanding
of the effects of shear layer control techniques on mixing and combustion can
produce immediate results in increased combustion efficiency and control.
