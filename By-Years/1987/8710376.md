The research centers around the developing of a fixed base flight simulator with
an out the window display. The simulator incorporates parallel processing on
several Apollo computers. The pilot inputs are read using an analog/digital
processing system in a crew station. The simulator output is used to drive
cockpit instrumentation and to create graphical imagery. In addition, the flight
simulator may be applied in programs under development for determining
aerodynamic coefficients and stability derivatives of new configurations. The
first part of the research deals with the proper equipment and the second part
deals in software development and hardware/software interface. The simulation
system differs from existing systems in that each subroutine is to be
interchangeable with another from a differnt aircraft type. This
interchangeability of various aircraft subsystems allows greater flexibility in
the analysis of different configurations. This project is one supported under
the Creativity Awards for Undergraduate Engineering Students.
