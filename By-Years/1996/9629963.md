ABSTRACT CTS-9629963 This is an exploration of a novel concept of catalyst
design intended to improve selectivity in bifunctional catalysts. The proposed
catalysts contain two types of active sites: one type that is in contact with
all molecules in the fluid (gas or liquid) medium, and another type, typically
metal clusters, effectively inaccessible to most reactants but reachable by
small molecules such as hydrogen. This situation should minimize undesired
reactions such as metal-catalyzed carbon-carbon bond fission. The restricted
accessibility of the metal clusters is achieved by depositing them in a zeolite
with one-dimensional micropores that are filled with a physisorbed vapor; it is
desired to obtain steady-state conditions characteristic of single-file
diffusion. The physisorbed molecules may be converted to carbonaceous materials
which would more thoroughly isolate the metal clusters from large molecules
while leaving largely unchanged their ability to dissociate hydrogen. The
hydrogen atoms can then migrate over the zeolite surface to the more accessible
site ("spillover"). This approach if successful would have application to many
existing and potential industrial processes, including production of aldehydes
from carboxylic acids, ethers from esters, and nitroso compounds from nitro
compounds. It could also have utility for enantioselective hydrogenation or
hydroformylation. These processes are of great economic importance to the
chemical, drug, cosmetic, and agrochemical industries.
