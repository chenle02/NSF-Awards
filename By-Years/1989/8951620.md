A microcomputer laboratory equipped with Macintosh IIs and running MacMaple is
allowing students to use the power of a computer algebra system in their
mathematics classes, including calculus, linear algebra, statistics, operations
research, and differential equations. This laboratory is changing the way
students learn mathematics and is changing their attitude about the subject.
Results of the experience students are having will be disseminated through the
Computer Algebra Systems in Education Newsletter, of which the PI is editor. The
University will contribute an amount equal to the award. The institution will
provide funds to match this grant.
