This grant will support the use of the high precision radial velocity
spectrometer at the E.W. Fick Observatory in Iowa to continue and complete three
projects involving radial velocity measurements of F, G, and K type stars: (1)
Monitoring of radial velocity variations for a list of binary star systems with
orbital periods between 1 and 20 years; (2) a distance-limited sample of all F,
G, and early K stars within 25 parsecs of the Sun; and (3) a survey complete to
9th magnitude in a band around 30 degrees declination. High precision radial
velocity measurements are needed (a) to improve our knowledge of the frequency
of binarity among stars; (b) to determine the orbital parameters of binary stars
which leads to improved determinations of the stellar masses; and (c) for use in
stellar motion studies, including the distances of nearby clusters, the
determination of membership in clusters or moving groups, verification of wide
binary pairs, improved determination of the solar motion and the local standard
of rest, and statistical parallaxes. Since major projects underway elsewhere are
expected to yield high precision astrometric data over the next five years, the
collection of new, high precision radial velocities is both necessary and
timely.
