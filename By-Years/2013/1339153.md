This CAREER award by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program supports work
by Professor Glen Jackson at Ohio University to develop a hand-portable mass
spectrometer. The instrument is designed to operate above 1 mbar (0.75 Torr),
eliminating the need for expensive, complex pumps. The design includes a robust
and flexible ion source that can analyze gas-phase neutrals (such as volatile
organic compounds and chemical warfare agents) or ions formed from nonvolatile
materials via atmospheric pressure ionization techniques. Resolution exceeding
that of portable ion mobility spectrometers (the current instruments of choice
for screening protocols at most US airports) is
expected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential applications include national security,
forensics, health, and environmental monitoring. The instrument will also serve
as a focus for educational outreach, including demonstrations and hands-on
experience for high school students, undergraduate students, and field-
scientists through both formal and informal avenues. Students will help
disseminate knowledge of the new instrument and its capabilities to the broader
scientific community by presenting results at national conferences and
publishing the results in peer-reviewed journals.
