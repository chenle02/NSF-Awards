9710138 Morss This grant outlines a development Web page effort to seek out the
existing sources of stratospheric data and analyses from available Government
and military sites. This grant will accomplish three specific tasks: 1) To
search out, using Internet search engineers and personal contacts within the
scientific community, all pertinent sites with data or analyses pertaining to
the stratospheric portions of the Earth's atmosphere. 2) To design and create an
appropriate set of Web pages to bring this information to one location; this
would be comprised of a master homesite with links to appropriate sub-pages
relating to specific topic or data areas. This approach keeps the site
manageable in terms of updating in the future and relating the information page
content in a more meaningful manner. 3) To revise the syllabi of those courses
the PI teacher to reflect the content of the stratospheric pages and their
relationship within the course structure. The results of this development will
bring widely scattered information to one reference site for future use by
Creighton students, as well as by the other member institutions of the Unidata
community interested in middle and upper atmospheric studies. The exposure to
real-world data in addressing problems within the classroom will serve the
students well in preparing them for the work force.
