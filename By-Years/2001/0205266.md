A system called Aura will be designed, implemented, deployed and
&lt;br/&gt;evaluated. Aura will exploit the abundance of computing resources
&lt;br/&gt;made possible by Moore's Law to reduce demand on the scarcest
&lt;br/&gt;resource, human attention. Aura is targeted for environments
&lt;br/&gt;involving wireless communication, wearable or handheld computers, and
&lt;br/&gt;smart spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research spans every system
level: hardware, operating system, &lt;br/&gt;applications and end users. Aura
applies two broad concepts. First, &lt;br/&gt;is proactivity, or the ability of
a layer to act in anticipation of &lt;br/&gt;requests by a higher layer. Second,
is self-tuning: layers adapt by &lt;br/&gt;observing the demands and adjusting
performance and resource usage to &lt;br/&gt;match. Both techniques contribute
to lowering demand on human &lt;br/&gt;attention. These ideas will be evaluated
through controlled &lt;br/&gt;experiments and live use by a small community. The
metrics used in &lt;br/&gt;evalutation include both traditional computer systems
metrics plus &lt;br/&gt;user-centric metrics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are
three major research thrusts. First, operating system and &lt;br/&gt;networking
capabilities required by Aura-like systems are &lt;br/&gt;investigated. Second,
how high-level user intent can be captured and &lt;br/&gt;exploited for
proactivity is explored. Third, how contextual &lt;br/&gt;information can be
used is examined. A unique aspect of the research &lt;br/&gt;is its tight
integration with education since the Aura prototype will &lt;br/&gt;be used in
graduate-level courses.&lt;br/&gt;
