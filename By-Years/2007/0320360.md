This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I proposes to explore the
feasibility of creating a low-cost gas sensor highly specific to trace levels of
HCN and SO2. The project consists of two parallel efforts; one to create a
nanostructured substrate that selectively binds HCN and SO2, and another to
create a low-cost, species-specific Raman spectrometer. Together, both
technologies form a complete, quantitative, near real-time sensor for monitoring
HCN and SO2. Such a sensor would have broad applicability to homeland security
monitoring, environmental emissions monitoring, and to fire rescue applications
(smoke inhalation of HCN). The project advances the practice of Raman
spectroscopy in several significant ways. First it seeks to apply Au
nanostructure technology to solid-gas interfaces. Secondly, it proposes a Raman
monitor that is compact and low-cost. The technology used to make the Raman
monitor is both novel and highly practical for the development of commercial
Raman monitors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This sensor should have broad
applications for users of cyanide or sulfur dioxide products. Hydrogen cyanide
is particularly toxic and used in large quantities in the production of plastics
and mining of precious metals. Perfunctory analysis of the market indicates
several large chemical firms that are interested in the proposed device. The
device is also needed to provide rapid detection of hydrogen cyanide or sulfur
dioxide. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
