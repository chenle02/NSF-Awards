This research concentrates on algorithms that discover information about
graphs. To discover almost anything interesting about a graph it is necessary to
look at the whole graph. On the other hand, there are important sequential
algorithms whose running time is proportional to the size of the input graph.
Two of these algorithms solve the problems (a) of finding a depth-first spanning
tree and (b) of finding a breadth-first spanning tree. This research seeks to
answer two questions: (1) How quickly and efficiently can the problems that
these algorithms solve be solved in parallel? (2) Can several instances of these
problems, on the same graph, but with different starting vertices, be solved by
a much more efficient technique than just solving each instance separately? An
affirmative answer to the second question will result in a faster algorithm that
finds the diameter of a graph, an important problem in network design.
