A materials-oriented approach to chemistry is being developed through the
preparation of "A Materials Chemistry Companion to General Chemistry", by an ad
hoc committee of two dozen leading chemistry researchers and teachers.
Consisting of text, problem sets, model kits, software, videotapes,
demonstration and laboratory experiments, the "Companion" is scheduled for
publication by the American Chemical Society in 1993. The "Companion" will
demonstrate how virtually every topic typically covered in introductory
chemistry courses can be illustrated with solids such as polymers,
semiconductors, metals, superconductors, and ceramics. The project focuses both
on innovation - the completion of material for the "Companion" - and on change -
the implementation of a national strategy for assimilating materials chemistry
into introductory chemistry courses. Strategies for effecting change include
national testing of the "Companion" at over two dozen volunteering college test
sites (more than 15,000 students); development of modules based on the
"Companion" and their use in workshops for college and pre-college teachers; and
critical evaluation of the instructional materials. The "Companion" and
supporting activities will revitalize general chemistry courses, enhance the
scientific literacy of students and teachers, and increase the number and
diversity of high-quality students electing to pursue careers as chemists,
chemistry teachers, scientists and engineers.
