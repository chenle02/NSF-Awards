The objectives of this project are to identify and characterize the active sites
for hydrogenation reactions on supported metal catalysts and to determine the
dependence of the concentration and activity of the active sites on the physical
properties of the catalyst. This involves determining whether hydrogenation
occurs on the oxide support, the rates of transfer between sites on the metal
and on the oxide, what the limiting steps in the process are, and how these
factors depend on the properties and mode of preparation of the catalysts.
Temperature-programmed reaction, temperature-programmed desorption, isotopic
labelling, transient isotope training, and infrared spectroscopy are used to
study multiple reaction sites on supported platinum and palladium catalysts.
Substrates to be hydrogenated include adsorbed methoxy and adsorbed organics. A
series of catalyst preparations is used, with the catalysts characterized by
hydrogen chemisorption, surface-area measurements, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, and atomic absorption. This project examines fundamental aspects
of hydrogenation reactions in systems similar to those used in industry.
Although the study is not directed to any particular application, it could lead
to improvement in industrial hydrogenation in many contexts. Such processes are
common in the specialty chemical, pharmaceutical, food processing, and petroleum
industries.
