It is now well understood that in economies with asymmetric information, a
contract between a principal and an agent typically generates informational
externalities. The goal of this research is to understand the interaction
between two important restrictions on economic agents' abilities to reach
efficient outcomes: incentive problems resulting from imperfect information and
the difficulties of coordinating the actions of groups of individuals. An
example of such an environment is one in which agents are subject to moral
hazard and trades cannot be publically monitored. Criteria will be developed for
describing constrained efficiency in such environments and for use in analyzing
models of market games played by agents subject to this combination of
restrictions. Cooperative and non-cooperative solution concepts will be
developed to investigate the sense in which the outcomes of such games are or
are not constrained efficient. The extent to which the outcomes in such
economies can be characterized in terms of competitive equilibria or Lindahl
equilibria of Arrow-Debreu economies for a suitably augmented commodity space
also will be studied. The results will be used to reinterpret the role played by
government in improving the allocations in economies subject to these
restrictions and how the government's role varies, depending upon its monitoring
powers. The issues of asymmetric information addressed in this research are
fundamental but potentially also they have great practical importance. The
proposed modelling of the advantages the government has in monitoring vis-a-vis
private agents can reshape the advice given to policy makers concerning
appropriate government intervention in the presence of informational
asymmetries.
