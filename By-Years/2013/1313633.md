In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division, the research group of Professor Guijun Wang
of University of New Orleans designs and synthesizes novel classes of
glycoconjugates and studies the formation of self-assembling systems from these
carbohydrate-based molecular entities. Carbohydrates are abundant natural
products and renewable resources on earth. This research aims to advance our
understandings on the correlation between molecular structures and macroscopic
properties of glycomimetics and to take advantage of the sustainable resource to
yield biocompatible materials that have potential applications as light
responsive materials or unique supramolecular architectures suitable as ligands
for carbohydrate-binding proteins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides being food and
energy sources, carbohydrates also play important roles in biological systems
such as mediating signal transduction, cell growth and adhesion, etc. This
research utilizes sustainable resource as the bases to form smart materials that
are responsive to various stimuli including light and heat. The development of
new synthetic methods for glycomimetics with desired functionality would enable
the generation of novel systems that are potentially useful for biomedicines and
biomaterials. The broader impact activities of this project also include
outreach activities to expose children to a fun science atmosphere, internship
opportunities at pharmaceutical companies, and the multidisciplinary research
training of undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers
(including members of underrepresented groups).
