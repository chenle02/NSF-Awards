This project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
is in the area of main-group chemistry and deals with the chemistry of carbon-
boron compounds with cage structures. Such compounds are of considerable
interest to theoreticians because of their unusual electronic structures, but
are also of considerable practical interest as starting materials for the
synthesis of new ceramics and of new compounds for boron-based in vivo imaging.
The chemistry of cage compounds of carbon and boron (carboranes) will be studied
and will include: (a) cage opening of carboranes with fluoride ion, (b)
exploration of the influence of a wide variety of attached groups on the
pliability and rearrangements of substituted carborane systems with the
expectation that mechanistic details of cage rearrangements will emerge, (c)
equilibration studies involving isomeric substituted carboranes with the
anticipation that cage stabilizing and destabilizing influences of various
substituents can be assessed, (d) a study of net front-side cage displacement
reactions, (e) the synthesis of new substituted carboranes that offer
possibilities of substantially affecting cage bonding, and (f) the synthesis of
new carborane systems.
