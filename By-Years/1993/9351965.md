This project has established a course for biology students using modern
instrumentation to characterize physical environments and responses of plants to
them. Students master the instruments in supervised laboratory exercises, then
use each instrument to characterize the "natural" environment or plant responses
in tropical, desert and mesic areas of a large multi-room greenhouse. Factors
that are measured include temperature, air velocity, humidity, soil moisture
status, and radiation quantity. This program is helping students become more
aware of the physical environment and its biological consequences. The project
is also allowing students to acquire proficiency in the choice and operation of
modern instruments and research in this field.
