The objective of this workshop is to provide an evaluation of the current needs
for experiments in geotechnical earthquake engineering, as well as the
capabilities that presently exist to support these needs. The specific
objectives are: 1) Determine the current needs for experimental data in support
of geotechnical earthquake engineering issues; 2) Establish the level(s) of
fidelity by which test methods must represent earthquake ground motion fields in
order to meet the needs of geotechnical testing; 3) Report on, and document,
past experience as well as the current status of testing techniques, such as:
Monitoring earthquakes and the associated aftershocks, including, construction
of experiments and strong- motion arrays at seismically active sites; Shake
tables; Explosive simulation; External shaker and pulser excitation; and Dynamic
tests on geotechnical centrifuges. 4) Evaluate the role of analytical studies
and numerical simulations in planning and analyzing test programs; 5) Evaluate
the fidelity and suitability of each test method for meeting current needs,
including: Cost-benefit factors for each method; Integration of the methods into
a hierarchy of testing for cost effective achievement of experimental
objectives; and Compatibility of the methods with university research goals; 6)
Determine the availability and suitability of existing and proposed geotechnical
test sites for large scale testing; 7) Develop recommendations for: Test method
enhancement, improvement and evaluation; Test programs which will lead to
improved safety of geotechnical designs. These workshop goals are directed
toward meeting the objectives of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction
Program (NEHRP).
