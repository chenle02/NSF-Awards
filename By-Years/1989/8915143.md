The research objective is to explore experimentally and theoretically the
stability of interphase boundaries. Understanding the structure of such
interfaces is a first step in designing desired interface properties into
advanced materials. Experiments involving small crystallite rotations on thin
films during low temperature annealing are used to determine the cusp
orientations of grain boundaries and interfaces between dissimilar metals.
Energy values of the interfaces are calculated using the Embedded Atom Method
and compared with the experimental results.
