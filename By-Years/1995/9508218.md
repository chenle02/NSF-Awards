Most current tectonic models for the Arctic Caledonides show Laurentia abducted
onto Baltica, producing high-pressure regional metamorphism, now exposed in the
Scandinavian Caledonides. East Greenland represents upper plate positions in
these models, and are not expected to contain high pressure tracts. However,
early reports of eclogite in east Greenland have been confirmed and this project
will focus on determining the extent, geometry and timing of these eclogite
rocks and will attempt to reconcile this occurrence with tectonic models for the
Caledonides. Results are expected to make important mmdifications to the
structural history and evolution of this orogen.
