This project is to study the interaction of electric and magnetic fields with
deformable solids. Two distinct areas will be investigated, namely,
electroelastic interactions and biasing effects in piezoelectric devices and
deformable semiconductors. It is planned that procedures that have been
developed and shown to be very accurate in the calculation of the acceleration
sensitivity of acoustic surface wave resonators be applied to high precision
crystal resonators.
