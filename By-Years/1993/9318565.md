9318565 Meserve This project investigates the response of small mammals and
perennial and annual plant populations to natural variation in weather
conditions and to manipulations of predator and herbivore densities in a Chilean
semiarid thorn scrub. The research provides a unique set of long-term population
data for small mammals in the arid tropics as well as data on their effects on
plant populations. The manipulative experiments of small mammal and predator
densities in combination with annual weather variation (including an El Nino
event) provide unique insights into the interactive effects of biotic and
abiotic factors on natural populations of mammals and plants. %%% This research
is important because it provides some of the first long-term data on the
response of mammal and plant populations to short-term climate change in the
arid tropics. The results of this research will improve our abilities to
understand the ecological consequences of anthropogenic climate change. ***
