This equipment proposal requests funding for three Apple McIntosh II-based
workstations for access to parallel-processing machines to be used for
simulation of hierarchical processing architectures for manufacturing
environments. The simulation approach will be used to test the efficiency of
various proposed hierarchies. Initial research will focus on performance
analysis of an on-line real-time production scheduler developed by the PI in
collaboration with researchers at the National Bureau of Standards, Automated
Manufacturing Research Facility.
