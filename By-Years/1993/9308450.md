9308450 Shapley This project, supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and
Organometallic Chemistry Program, is concerned with the synthesis and reactivity
of high oxidation state Fe, Ru, and Os complexes. A major focus will be on new
complexes that contain two multiply bonded ligands (oxo, sulfido, imido), which
are expected to be effective for atom (O, S) or group (NR) transfer to
unsaturated hydrocarbons. Also to be investigated are coordinatively unsaturated
ruthenium based olefin polymerization catalysts, unique chromium-osmium
heterobimetallic oxidation catalysts and their use in kinetic resolution of
alcohols, and novel high oxidation state organoiron derivatives. %%% This
project focusses on the design and synthesis of new transition metal containing
molecules that are predicted to have unique, and potentially useful, chemical
reactivities. These compounds may ultimately be utilized in the synthesis of new
pharmaceuticals, and as catalysts for the preparation of polymers. ***
