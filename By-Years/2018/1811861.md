Broadly speaking, this project is about the relationship between two subjects:
algebraic geometry and symplectic geometry. Algebraic geometry studies geometric
objects called varieties, created by equations that are built from addition and
multiplication. Symplectic geometry involves geometric objects related to
classical mechanics. We are interested in `topological' properties of some of
these varieties such as how many `holes' they have and `enumerative' properties
such as the number of curves they contain. The PI is interested in pairs of
varieties which are birational to each other, which means that they become
identical after removing smaller varieties. We wish to know what topological or
enumerative properties they have in common. One of the main aims of this project
is to see how tools from symplectic geometry can be used to investigate such
issues. The PI believes these ideas are new and can be used to explore other
areas of algebraic and symplectic geometry using this different perspective. The
PI will help out with a program involving high school students called Seawolf
math, and will also help out with a math summer camp for high school students at
Stony Brook. The PI will also help out in workshops designed for graduate
students learning closely related fields of study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
primary aim of this project is to understand the relationship between birational
geometry and certain Floer theoretic invariants. These invariants include
symplectic/contact cohomology, Floer cohomology of a symplectomorphism and the
Fukaya category. The PI will use these Floer invariants to prove certain
statements related to birational geometry. One of the main goals of this NSF
funded project is to give a completely new approach to the crepant resolution
conjecture using an extended version of symplectic cohomology. The PI will prove
a weak version of this conjecture using these methods. The PI believes these
methods point to certain generalizations of this conjecture. The PI will study
terminal 3-fold singularities and also Newton non-degenerate singularities using
Floer theory. Studying such singularities could lead to new insights just as
studying quotient singularities led the PI to study the crepant resolution
conjecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
