The principal investigators propose to acquire a Langmuir Trough thin film
deposition system. This equipment will deposit monomolecular layers or multiple-
monomolecular layers of organic molecules on substrates of various types by a
highly-controlled dipping technique. Films deposited in this manner, so-called
Langmuir-Blodgett films, show promise of application in the fields of electron
beam microlithography, flat displays, chemical and biological sensors, and a
number of other electronic applications. This support is co-funded by the Solid
State and Microstructures Program in the Division of Electrical, Communications,
and Systems Engineering and the Thermal Systems and Heat Transfer Program in the
Division of Chemical, Biochemical and Thermal Engineering.
