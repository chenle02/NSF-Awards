In computable algebra, one applies the methods of classical computability theory
to study computational properties of algebraic structures. Solomon proposes to
study several questions concerning the members of these and other classes of
algebraic structures. Do the members of a given class display the most general
forms of ineffectiveness found in computable algebra? Are instances of
ineffectiveness caused by the coding methods (and hence can be removed by a
reasonable coding) or by some inherent property of the underlying algebra (and
are therefore unavoidable)? How does adding structure (such as an ordering) to
the members of a class effect the computational properties? These questions aim
toward a deeper understanding of the connection between computation and
algebraic behavior in mathematics.

Many theorems in mathematics state that given certain conditions, a particular
mathematical object must exist. There are numerous ways to study the
effectiveness of such a theorem. One method, called computable or recursive
mathematics, uses an idealized model of a computer in which computations are
allowed to run for arbitrarily long (but finite) amounts of time and to use
arbitrarily large (but finite) amounts of memory. The fundamental question is
whether such an idealized computer can construct the desired mathematical object
from the theorem. If the answer to this question is no, then the theorem uses a
method of construction that cannot be performed on an actual computer no matter
how much technology increases computer speed and memory size. Because this
question requires that mathematical objects be coded into the binary language of
computers, the answer sometimes depends on the type of coding used. Solomon
proposes to study a number of algebraic constructions from this point of view
and in particular to study when ineffectiveness is caused by a poor choice of
coding (and hence can be fixed by a better choice of coding) and when it is
caused by inherent conflicts between mathematical structure and computation (and
hence cannot be removed by clever coding). Solomon also proposes to use a second
method, called reverse mathematics, to study the effectiveness of numerous
mathematical theorems. In this approach, one isolates the mathematical axioms
required to prove the theorem. Reverse mathematics and computable mathematics
are closely related. If only simple axioms are required to prove a theorem, then
it is likely that a computer can carry out the construction, while if
complicated axioms are required, then a computer probably cannot perform the
construction.
