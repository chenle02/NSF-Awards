This research concentrates on stochastic optimization models. The research
combines Markovian probability analysis, dynamic programming, nonlinear
programming, statistical curve fitting, and computer simulation analysis
containing sophisticated statistical autoregressive time series methods to
investigate the mathematical characteristics of stochastic optimization models.
The models relate to decision-making about production and inventory levels,
capacity levels, scheduling, and resource allocation. Advanced theoretical
analyses are employed to understand the mathematical properties of optimal
policies under the most general assumptions that yield analytic solutions. In
many cases significant extensions of existing theory are required. The
properties of optimal policies are exploited to derive analytic approximations
that are numerically accurate and more amenable to computation. Issues of
computational simplicity and limited statistical information regarding parameter
values are central to motivating the applying statistical estimates as values
for the model parameters. In some cases, the approximations can be explicitly
modified to accommodate this statistical context, while in other cases the
research examines the effects of using standard statistical estimates in place
of actual parameter values.
