9626590 Lalley The main focus of the investigation will be on how the coarse
geometry of a state space constrains the behavior of stochastic processes
supported by the state space, in particular, on categorizing the behaviors
possible for random walks and random growth processes (such as branching random
walks and contact processes) in hyperbolic geometries. Particular attention will
be paid to behaviors that cannot occur in Euclidean state spaces, such as
exponential population growth with eventual extinction in every compact subset.
Related problems regarding the mixing rate for various finite state Markov
chains will also be investigated, with the immediate aim of contributing to the
understanding of the so-called "cutoff phenomenon". Random growth processes
serve as crude models of population growth in structured environments, and thus
are of natural interest in population biology. They are also important as models
in various areas of theoretical physics, in particular, statistical mechanics.
Problems concerning mixing rates of finite-state Markov chains are of practical
importance because of the increasing use of "Markov chain Monte Carlo" methods
in simulation studies. ***
