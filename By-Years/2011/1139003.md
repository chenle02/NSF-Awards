This award will provide participant support for early career scientists and
graduate students to participate in the "Sterile Neutrinos at the Crossroads"
International Workshop at Virginia Tech on September 26-28, 2011. The workshop
will include plenary session overview talks on nuclear theory (reactor fluxes,
nucleosynthesis) and experiment (reactor experiments, flux measurements,
LSND/Karmen, MiniBooNE), cosmology (WMAP/Planck) and neutrino
phenomenology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Broader Impacts, it has a particular
focus on early career scientists and graduate students. Contributions in the
form of posters, especially by students, are strongly encouraged. The workshop
will feature a tour of the Kimballton Underground Research facility.
