This engineering education research initiation grant seeks to engage an
engineering faculty member with physics education researchers to understand the
alignment between students' mathematical and conceptual understanding in optics.
The research will use an innovative interview method to elicit both conceptual
and mathematical representations of optical polarization and plane
waves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this
project arises from its ability to inform others how students learn to integrate
conceptual and mathematical representations of abstract ideas. The investigator
will also engage undergraduate students in the planned research, thus
contributing to their professional development and mentoring. This project
overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through
preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.
Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results
and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and
practices.
