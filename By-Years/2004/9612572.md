Much AI work in planning uses deduction to draw conclusions about the future,
so that the inferences work forwards in time from preconditions to consequences
of actions. This project is developing an alternative approach in which the
direction of reasoning is independent of temporal direction, so that information
may have onsequences in the past or in the futre. It is based on an ontological
framework of pieces of space-time with 'natural' boundaries. The role of
inference is also somewhat different; its purpose here is to provide an
efficient source of explanations' for apparent anomalies in tentative partial
plans. Planning - even if only of a simple kind - is of central importance in
many AI applications, but has suffered from some stubborn theoretical
difficulties; this lternative approach seems to provide a solution to the 'frame
problem' and the 'prediction problem', both of which can be seen to arise from
identifying temporal direction with direction of inference.
