During summer 1988, twenty junior high and twenty high school mathematics
teachers attended a six-week institute designed to enhance subject matter
competence in probability and statistics, improve teaching skills, and address
problems in student transition from junior high to high school mathematics. An
additional forty teachers are attending a similar institute in summer 1989. The
purpose of the proposed project is to prepare the top forty current participants
for leadership roles in: 1) assisting other teachers in enhancing their
knowledge of probability and statistics; 2) disseminating information relative
to the new NCTM standards for probability and statistics; and 3) introducing new
materials and methods of instruction. The leadership training will be
accomplished through a summer institute in 1990 and eight hands-on follow.up
sessions during the 1990-91 academic year. At the conclusion of the program, the
participants will be available to conduct workshops in central Alabama.
