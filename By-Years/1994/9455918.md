The ChemLinks Coalition is undertaking a five-year project to change the way
students learn chemistry, increase scientific literacy for all students taking
chemistry, and promote the process of educational reform. In collaboration with
the ModularChem Consortium, faculty are developing, testing, and disseminating
modular course materials that use active and collaborative approaches to
learning. These materials, focused on the first two years of the chemistry
curriculum, start with interdisciplinary questions important to students and to
society (the molecular basis of life, the environment, technology), and in
answering them develop an appreciation of how science is actually done. This
approach is designed to reach a broader student audience more effectively than
do traditional courses, an audience that includes students who are members of
groups traditionally under-represented in science, non-science majors, and those
taking chemistry as a supporting course, as well as chemistry majors. By
providing a model for students preparing for careers in teaching, this approach
has an impact on Teacher Preparation Programs. Collaboration among faculty from
different disciplines and a number of institutions supports and reinforces those
who want to make changes. These leading liberal arts colleges (Beloit, Carleton,
Colorado, Grinnell, Hope, Kalamazoo, Knox, Lawrence, Macalester, Rhodes,
Spelman, St. Olaf, Wooster) and research universities (Chicago, Washington - St.
Louis) already have experience working together on chemistry curricular reform.
An alliance with the Advanced Technology Environmental Education Center's
coalition of 2-year institutions assures an impact on Advanced Technology
Education Programs. By using the extensive Project Kaleidoscope network to
promote reform, the ChemLinks Coalition involves a much larger and more diverse
group of institutions in making systemic and sustainable changes in
undergraduate chemistry education.
