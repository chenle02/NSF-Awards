The semantic foundations of imperative languages shall be studied in this
project with the aim of sharpening the understanding of how state can be
utilized. Local variables and interference control will be emphasized in this
study. Denotational models for local variables will be investigated and the
connections between locality and parametricity will be explored. In addition,
type systems which control the manner in which the state is utilized will be
developed. This work is intended to lead toward programming frameworks which
support the flexibility and efficiency of imperative programming and the
simplicity and elegance of functional programming as well.
