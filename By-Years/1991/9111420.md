The main motivation of the research is the development of physically realistic
and computationally manageable theoretical procedures which can be applied to
studies of complex atomic structures. Work during the grant period will
concentrate on extending our recently developed CI procedures for continuum
states to multi-channel cases. New work will be directed towards detailed
calculations of widths and positions of doubly excited autoionizing states,
excited states with inner shell vacancies and multiphoton processes.
