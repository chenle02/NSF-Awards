"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Analytical and Surface Chemistry
(ASC) program of the Division of Chemistry will support the research program of
Prof. Sunghee Lee of Iona College. Prof. Lee and Iona College undergraduate
students will study the role of surfactants in monolayer-directed
crystallization at liquid-liquid interfaces. Micro-droplets containing salt
solutions will be used as model systems to study the nucleation process. The
study will correlate templating ability to degree of charge in surfactant
monolayers; determine the influence of the structure of the hydrocarbon change
on nucleation; investigate the impact on nucleation of surfactant hydrocarbon
chain solvation by the oil phase; study surfactant phase transition upon
nucleation; and explore the role of artificial bilayer area in crystal
nucleation and growth. The study will provide excellent training opportunities
to undergraduate students in Iona College, a Research Undergraduate.
