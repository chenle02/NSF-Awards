This collaborative research project will involve undergraduate students in the
study of the mechanical properties and the molecular mechanisms that give rise
to the functional specificity in spider silks. It is significant to biology
because the diversity of silk types seems to have radiated with the diversity of
spiders. This study will compare silks from the black widow cobweb weaver
Latrodectus, the funnel web weaver Hololena sp., the cobweb building house
spider, Pholcus sp., and a tarantula, Grammostola rosea. These species each
represent one of four major clades of the spiders (Arenae). By including this
broad array of spiders, this project will explore the mechanical diversity of
spider silk as a function of phylogenetic relationships. The study is also
significant to materials science because spider silks display an extensive range
of material properties from a small range of molecular differences. Thus, they
represent an ideal system for correlating molecular structure and material
properties.

These spider silks will be studied on three levels: 1. Primary structure using
microarray technology and gene sequencing, 2. Secondary structure from NMR
spectroscopy, and 3. Mechanical properties from materials testing. The material
properties will be correlated with the secondary structure and the primary
sequence of the silk proteins in order to construct models of each silk on a
molecular level. By exploring a variety of silks through multidisciplinary
undergraduate research, this project will enable the correlation of the
molecular differences with mechanical differences in spider silk. In addition to
its research activities, the project will also include workshops for high school
teachers and, consequently, will have a significant impact on high school
education.
