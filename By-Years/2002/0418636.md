The award from the Chemistry Division supports an Undergraduate Research Center
(URC) planning grant. The PI is Thomas Wolosz. The center will be based at SUNY
Plattsburgh, Departments of Chemistry, Physics and the Lake Champlain Research
Institute. Collaborators are Clinton Community College, North Country Community
College, Trudeau Institute, Brookhaven National Laboratory and Wyeth
Pharmaceuticals (Rouses Point, NY). The first goal of the planning program is to
design a means of incorporating undergraduate research into the freshman level
experience through modification of the introductory chemistry laboratory and
lecture. This will be approached through a series of meetings of representatives
of all partner institutions. These meetings will also explore faculty mentoring
and facilities improvement issues. Logistical and scheduling problems among
widely dispersed partners will be investigated. Planning efforts will be
reviewed and evaluated at quarterly meetings rotating at different partner sites
during the project period.
