Our contemporary world has been radically reshaped by revolutions which occurred
in the late 18th century: the American Revolution which gave rise to what would
become the most powerful democracy in the history of the world, the French
Revolution which overthrew the traditional order not only in France but in all
of Europe, and, more surprisingly, the Chemical Revolution initiated by Antoine
Lavoisier. Despite the fact that the latter two were intimately linked, no study
has been made showing these links. This is the project which Professor Donovan
is undertaking. Antoine Lavoisier (1743-1794) is remembered as the central
figure in the 18th century Chemical Revolution and as the most famous scientist
to be executed in the Terror of the French Revolution. Understandably, but
unfortunately, Lavoisier's importance in the history of science has had the
effect of isolating him from the history of his era, the result being that his
science is usually studied without reference to his many administrative
activities. The immediate goal of this project is to prepare a biography of
Lavoisier, one that will describe his science and his many administrative
undertakings as closely related efforts to realize a comprehensive program of
reform. The larger goal is to demonstrate that in Lavoisier's case, and by
implication in other cases in the 18th century, the pursuit of science was
shaped by a lively awareness of political and social issues and that this
attention to larger contextual concerns had profound consequences for the
development of both science and society.
