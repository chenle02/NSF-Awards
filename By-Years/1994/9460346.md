This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will: determine
variables important to quality control of DNA sequencing such as error
dependency on sequence content; design optimal testing protocols and sampling
plans for assessing precision and accuracy of DNA sequencing laboratories; and
develop methods for predicting insertion and deletion errors (frameshifts) in
sequence data. The power of statistical tests will be studied using results for
sequencing combinatorially designed, synthetic DNA fragments. This investigation
will be based on theoretical analysis, computer simulations, and on data
provided through our collaboration with the Yeast Genome Center at Stanford
University. The growing use of DNA sequence data in research, databases,
diagnostic and therapeutic biotechnology, and even litigation requires that the
quality of data being used by objectively assessable. The proposed research
addresses the following problems associated with sequence data: the inability to
associate consistent, quantitative error rate estimates with sequence data; the
concomitant lack of quality control on the sequence data; and the inability to
make informed decisions balancing cost per base of different methods (or
laboratories) against the relative stringency of quality requirements imposed on
different sequencing tasks.
