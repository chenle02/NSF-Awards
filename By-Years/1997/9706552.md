9706552 Sussman Plants contain an unknown compound that travels from the leaves
to meristems and initiates flowering. The chemical nature of this so-called
florigen has not been found, although the topic is around for more than 50
years. Indications are that it may be a peptide. As outlined by Dr. Sussman, he
has a population of Arabidopsis which contain a marker protein expressed under
control of an "early-flowering" promoter and he seems to be able to look in a
titerplate assay for peptides fro a combinatorial peptide library for the one
that induces this promoter. It is a dangerous experiment, but the rewards can be
tremendous - both from a basic science viewpoint (there is only one other
peptide "hormone" identified in plants), and from an application standpoint.
Spray a peptide and induce flowering in the field simultaneously and earlier
than nature would do it.
