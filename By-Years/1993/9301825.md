9301825 Mende The Lockheed Palo Alto Research Laboratory has supported the radar
at Sondrestromfjord with a monochromatic all sky imager and meridian scanning
photometer for many years. Joint studies between the imager and the radar are
powerful in explaining the relationship between the electrodynamics of the upper
atmosphere and the auroral precipitation patterns and their associated
magnetospheric regions. In this proposal, funds are being requested to refurbish
and modify the Sondrestrom all sky monochromatic imager software to incorporate
digital data compression techniques. The instrument will be interfaced to the
Sondrestromfjord local area network. ***
