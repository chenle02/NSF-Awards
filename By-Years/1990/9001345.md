The life cycle of freshwater unionid mussels is atypical among bivalves and
involves both a free-living adult and a parasitic larva, the glochidium.
Following fertilization, developing embryos are incubated in the water tubes of
the mother's gills where they may remain for several months before being
released into the water column and becoming parasitic on fish. The principal
objective of this study is to assess the morphological and physiological changes
that occur within the gills of brooding female Anodonta cataracta, an abundant
freshwater mussel in North Carolina. During brooding, two of the mussel's four
gills become packed with nearly a million glochidia, causing the gills to swell
to up to thirty times their non-brooding size. The major goals of the proposed
research include quantifying the morphological changes that occur within the
marsupial gills, comparing the pumping and filtration dynamics of brooding and
non-brooding mussels, determining the effect of brooding on oxygen uptake and
oxygen extraction efficiency of mussels, and assessing the activity of the cilia
responsible for irrigation both the marsupial and non-marsupial gills. The
results will provide a more complete understanding of the reproductive biology
of A. cataracta, especially the effect of glochidial brooding and release on the
physiology and gill morphology of adult females. This information also may have
application for the management and conservation of other freshwater bivalves
including threatened and endangered species.
