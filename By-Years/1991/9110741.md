This research initiation grant will develop a computer graphics system to
analyze the potential outcome of hip replacement surgery. The thrust of the work
is to incorporate a geometric model of a hip prosthesis into a model of the
human lower limb and to determine how the prosthesis design and surgical
procedure affect post-surgical hip muscle strength. The project emphasizes
general principles rather than the planning of surgery for specific individuals.
The research is expected to provide an interactive system that is useful for the
planning of surgery and for teaching the biomechanical principles of surgical
procedures.
