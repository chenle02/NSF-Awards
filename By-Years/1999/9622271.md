9622271 Cao This Research Planning Grant provides support for the initiation
and detailed evaluation of a program in sheet metal forming, especially on the
role of the design and wear of the die that is to be used. The objective is to
examine a die design algorithm which will permit the design of a profile that
will reduce wrinkles and tearing. If successful, this will dramatically reduce
the try out time and cost required for a new product design. ***
