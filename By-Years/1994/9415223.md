9415223 Haines This award supports a 12-month Japan Society for the Promotion of
Science Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Paul Haines at Waseda University, Tokyo,
Japan. Dr. Haines will work with Dr. Kei-ichi Maeda in the Department of
Physics, on a research project entitled, "Voids in the Thin-Shell Formalism."
The research project will use the thin shell formalism of General Relativity to
predict peculiar velocities of galaxies near voids in the distribution of
galaxies, and then to test these using real data. Dr. Maeda is a leading expert
on the thin shell formalism of general relatively and Dr. Haines will work with
him to test actual data supplied by the 1.2 Jy IRAS survey. Dr. Haines and Dr.
Maeda will study the large scale structure of the universe and will see to what
extent the thin shell formalism of general relativity can be used to described
the large voids found in the spatial distribution of galaxies. ***
