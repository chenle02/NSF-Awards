Dielectric resonators are the building elements for miniaturized microwave
circuits, used in communications microwave measurements, and radars. An accurate
numerical solution of the electromagnetic field in and around the dielectric
resonator is needed in order to provide the design data for building the
components which contain dielectric resonators. The design diagrams and tables,
which will be obtained in the present investigation, are of importance to
practicing microwave engineers, since the characterization of dielectric
resonators is considerably more difficult than the characterization of the empty
microwave resonant cavities, which the dielectric resonators are replacing with
substantial savings in cost. Furthermore, for the applications in the
computerized-assisted design methods (CAD), the development of numerically
effective and reliable computational procedures is of great importance. The
experimental investigation in this project will concentrate on the development
of automated measurement procedures, and processing of the data obtained by
these procedures. The applications of this investigation are foreseen in the
improvements of the complex permittivity measurements at microwave frequencies.
