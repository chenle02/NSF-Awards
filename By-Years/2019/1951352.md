A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the
science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and
research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the
Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings and
research capacity at these institutions expands the opportunities of their
students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for
research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a
community and generational appreciation for the role of science and mathematics
in workforce preparation and addressing quality-of-life issues. This project
aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will inform the research literature
on environmental engineering in several key areas of interest to and relevance
to Indian country. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Navajo Technical University (NTU) will
position the Navajo Nation to address the monumental task of uranium mine
remediation and mitigation, by developing a tiered degree program that can
culminate in an accredited BS in environmental engineering, while partnering in
research opportunities inherent to the remediation
process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
