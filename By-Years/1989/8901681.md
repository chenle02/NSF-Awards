Neutron stars are the result of core collapse during supernova explosions. They
are compact objects with masses comparable to 1 to 2 suns, but with radii of
about 20 km. Their principal constituents are neutrons, and their interiors are
believed to have superconducting characteristics. Furthermore, they usually
possess extreme magnetic fields (ca. 1012 times as strong as the earth's
magnetic field). Some radiate in a pulsating fashion and are known as pulsars.
When neutron stars accrete matter from a close companion star or from the
interstellar medium (as many stars do), highly energetic events ensue because of
the deep gravitational well into which the matter falls. The results are
frequently the emission of X- and gamma-rays, and the gradual evaporation of a
nearby stellar companion by the irradiation with high energy photons. The
Principal Investigator proposes to study theoretically six topics related to
neutron star physics: 1. Gamma rays from solitary neutron stars; 2. gamma ray
emission from accreting X-ray pulsars; 3. X- and gamma-rays from low mass
binaries; 4. evolution of low mass X-ray binaries; 5.evaporation of very light
companions in close radio-pulsar binaries; and 6. flux tube expulsion from
neutron star superconducting cores. Dr. K. S. Cheng of Australia has been and
continues to be a collaborator. The proposed work is a continuation of research
previously funded by NSF.
