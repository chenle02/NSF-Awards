9502678 Ifju The broad objective of the research component of this CAREER award
is to develop the capability of measuring, in composite materials, the combined
effects of various types of residual stresses and applied loads. The material
systems that will be investigated include typical thermoset and thermoplastic
type polymer matrix graphite fiber composites. To meet these objectives,
advances in experimental mechanics capabilities will be made. The educational
plan involves improved visual stimulation in the class room and improving
laboratory courses. ***
