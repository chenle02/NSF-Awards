Mertzman Franklin and Marshall College is an independent coeducational college
with a long history of distinction in science education. In order to sustain its
record of producing quality students in the sciences, the college is undertaking
a major renovation of the Pfeiffer Science Building, a 25 year old facility that
houses the departments of geosciences, physics, chemistry and astronomy. This
represents the first step in a more comprehensive $8 million renovation for the
entire science complex. Students actively engage in the research enterprise by
participating in the student-faculty research program. The program has been a
valuable and productive effort, one of the largest in the country. However,
despite the breath of scientific endeavors, the basic requirements of the
research programs exceed the current limitations of the building in terms of
temperature and humidity control, operable fume hoods, and the accessibility to
distilled water. This award will provide the funds required to modernize 30,214
square feet of research and research training space. Renovations will include:
modifying electrical and plumbing systems, installing a distilled water system
and an effective ventilation and air conditioning system, and improving the fume
hood system to comply with EPA standards. These renovations will provide a safe,
physical environment conducive to quality faculty and student-faculty research.
Engaging undergraduate students in science by allowing them to do research has
been and will continue to be a fundamental strength of Franklin and Marshall
College. ***
