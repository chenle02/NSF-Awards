9409959 Lyons This research will examine the microstructure of foreign exchange
markets. The work includes both theoretical and empirical dimensions, each of
which enhances its policy relevance. The theoretical dimensions of the project
will examine the link between the microstructure of these markets, for example
the behavior of individual traders and the macro-relevant aspect of these
markets, for example forward exchange rate bias. The empirical part of the
project focuses on understanding how foreign exchange markets work. This part of
the study uses a unique data set to examine the effects of the pace of market
activity on prices and quantities of trades, etc. The data contain information
on quotes, trades, and inventory positions of a foreign exchange dealer at
identified points in time. The study also examines the policy implications of
what is understood about the behavior of foreign exchange markets. This project
is important because it promises to improve our understanding of how foreign
exchange markets work at a time when several countries are in transition towards
market economies, and each country is seeking better ways to organize the market
that sets its foreign exchange rates.
