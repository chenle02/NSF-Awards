This proposal will research into the requirements which an advanced design
support system has of a geometric modeler and how form features which are
relevant to assembly but may not be explicitly present in the functionally based
design description can be recognized. The PIs propose to research methods for
identifying standard assembly situations by using the capability of
interrogating the modeler and developing a formalism for expressing the form of
the part and the function it serves. The extraction of feature information and
identification of shape is essential for automatic robot programming and
automatic assembly.
