Professors Studden and Coster will work on problems related to the optimal
design of statistical experiments, the estimation of mixture distributions and
density estimation. Design problems will be considered in polynomial, spline,
and rational function regression models. Solutions to problems involving multi-
objective methods for optimal designs will be sought. Estimation problems
concerning mixtures of geometric distributions will also be considered along
with some density estimation using spline kernels. This research is in the area
of statistical experimental design which aims to provide experimental scientists
with strategies that will optimize their utilization of resources, improve
scientists' chances of correctly interpreting experimental observations, and
thereby speed the rate of scientific progress.
