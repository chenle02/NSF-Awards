Despite some evidence of both partisan cycles (cycles in which political
incumbents pursue partisan economic policies) and electoral cycles (in which
incumbent parties manipulate the economy to improve the prospect of reelection),
satisfactory theoretical models consistent with this evidence have not been
developed. This two-year project develops and tests such models, concentrating
on reconciling the partisan and electoral models and on resolving the
inconclusiveness of previous tests. More specifically, the project (1) develops
and simulates a simple stochastic model of an economy in which gents are
rational, markets are efficient, but information is incomplete, where an
incumbent government with given preferences over inflation and unemployment can
generate stochastic business cycles; (2) extends this model to account for
partisan cycles by introducing a second party, elections, and heterogeneous
voters; (3) tests the partisan model against observed policies, central
macrovariables, and micro-level voter behavior; (4) extends the partisan model
to include a forward-looking incumbent party which induces electoral cycles to
signal its preferences so as to increase the probability of reelection; (5)
explores the natures of the partisan equilibrium with electoral cycles; and (6)
tests the synthesized partisan electoral model against data for the United
States (both pre and post-World War II) and for other countries with fixed
electoral terms.
