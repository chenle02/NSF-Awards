This Chemistry Division award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) site at SUNY Buffalo for the summers of 2005-2007. The program director is
Janet Morrow who is assisted by co-PI Sherry Chemler. Nine students, recruited
from other institutions, will participate in a ten-week program. The theme of
the program is to reflect the multidisciplinary nature of chemistry. In a ten-
week summer program, students will be introduced to research that spans the sub-
disciplines of chemistry, and in many cases, research that spans disciplines
including: engineering, physics, materials and biological sciences. The students
for the site will be recruited from a diverse group of applicants including
groups traditionally underrepresented in science. Students will be recruited
from throughout the northeast with a focus on New York and programs that support
and nurture underrepresented minorities (SUNY LSAMP and CSTEP) and, from the
University at Puerto Rico, Cayey. Industrial and biological research institute
scientists in the western New York area will have an opportunity to play a
direct role in science education and the promotion of the chemical sciences.
