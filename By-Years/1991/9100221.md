This action will provide for equipment for about five fully instrumented
mirrors of the High Resolution Fly's Eye design. These would be used with five
others to be built later and deployed on Little Granite, in Dugway, Utah, the
developed site of the existing Fly's Eye Detector. Together with the Chicago Air
Shower Array and the Michigan Array, both also at Dugway, these ten mirrors
would be used to understand the cosmic ray shower development with unprecedented
precision and measure spectrum at 10^17 electron volts. The instrument of ten
mirrors would be a unique scientific instrument capable of making significant
cosmic ray measurements.
