This research is concerned with the atomic and electronic properties of
tetrahedrally coordinated compound semiconductor surfaces and their interfaces
with metals. The technologically important (100) surfaces grown by molecular
beam epitaxy will be studied in addition to II-VI wurtzite surfaces. The work
will focus on an in depth investigation of photoemission induced surface
photovoltage and its implications on the validity of the present Schottky
barrier models in addition to the structural characteristics of (100)
interfaces. The study of gallium antimonide surfaces and their interfaces with a
wide range of metals. Following the successful determination of the atomic
structure of (1120) and (1010) wurtzite cadmium selenide and sulfide studies
will be initiated of their interfaces with totally reactive species such as
antimony and bismuth. The objective is to identify atomically ordered and abrupt
model interfaces which can be employed in experimental and theoretical studies
of the role of the overlayer electronic structure, interface bonding, dangling
bonds and local defects in the formation of Schottky barriers on these
compounds.
