The Center for Nondestructive Evaluation and six community colleges form a
dissemination focal point to enhance the education of technical workers in the
fields of nondestructive testing/nondestructive evaluation (NDT/NDE). The
project builds upon previous projects that developed simulations in ultrasonic
detection. Education for NDT/NDE is fragmented, taking place in various
technological studies. The focal point provides a website that informs high
school and community college faculty and students about the knowledge and skills
required for jobs in NDT/NDE. This website brings standards, skills, curricula,
materials and job information together materials in one place. The materials can
be used in related technology programs such as manufacturing, welding, airframe,
power plant and chemical processing. The project also provides opportunities for
faculty development and student awareness.
