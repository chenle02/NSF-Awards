In this project, the PI's team will study the circulation of the North Pacific,
from the sea surface to the bottom, and relate it to results from an earlier
study of the South Pacific. These results will be compared with circulation
patterns determined by the PI in the South and North Atlantic, using similar
techniques. These will then feed in to studies of the ocean/ocean relations and
determination of inter-basin exchange processes.
