This is an interdisciplinary program to teach mathematics, science and
technology at middle schools in Arkansas. The approach is based on a "learning
through doing" paradigm, using the theme of optic and electronic concepts in
everyday life. Goals are to be achieved by creating (teaching) teams consisting
of graduate fellows, school teachers, university faculty, administrators, and
parents of students. This project is being co-funded by the Directorate for
Mathematical and Physical Sciences, Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.
