The development of intelligent robot planning techniques is an essential
element of future underwater and space exploration and industrial automation.
These technologies find application in autonomous underwater and planetary
rovers, autonomous rendezvous and docking, operation and maintenance of a
nuclear power plant, extravehicular activity, autonomous landers, robotic and
telerobotic control and automation, and in the general construction and
operation of a laboratory, ship or industrial site. The purpose of this project
is to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of robot planning by making use
of parallel hardware and machine learning techniques. The project is made up to
two component parts, each of which contributes independently and collectively to
the automation of robotic activity. The first subproject focuses on developing
parallel algorithms for heuristic search, which is a fundamental component in
robot planning. The second subproject focuses on incremental modification and
reuse of plans by searching for similarities between old and new plans. These
two projects have been developed and tested on several search and planning
problems. We propose to extend the existing research by improving the parallel
search algorithms, developing parallel planning algorithms, and applying dynamic
graph match to allow reuse of plans in a dynamically changing environment.//
