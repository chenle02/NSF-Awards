The renovation and modernization program awarded will upgrade laboratory
facilities and research instrumentation in the interconnected third-floor areas
of 1960's vintage Klamath Hall and Onyx Bridge, within the Department of
Chemistry at the University of Oregon. These areas are occupied by the advanced
chemical research groups of a highly interactive group of organic, inorganic,
materials, biological chemists, organized as an interdisciplinary program in
Molecular Synthesis, Structure, and Dynamics (MSSD). The project will: (1)
renovate ca. 5,200 square feet of laboratory facilities in Onyx Bridge that have
grown inadequate and unsafe for modern synthetic chemistry; (2) renovate ca.
2,300 square feet of space in the core area of Klamath Hall for consolidation of
major existing instrumentation into a monitored shared instrumentation facility;
(3) enable the MSSD program to add substantially to its pool of undergraduate,
graduate, and postdoctoral research students by providing suitable laboratories
for them; and (4) upgrade shared instrumentation and equipment in these
facilities to modern specifications and standards for current and future
chemical research.
