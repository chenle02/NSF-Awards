The project uses a high-quality, large-format CCD camera on the 16-inch
computer-controlled telescope at Gettysburg College Observatory. The camera,
with an associated image-processing workstation, is used to introduce exercises
and research projects involving modern astronomical observing and analysis
techniques to our upperclass physics majors. In the junior- level advanced
laboratory course, it allows the replacement of an existing exercise on aperture
photometry using a photoelectric photometer with an exercise on CCD photometry
of short-period variable stars in clusters. Senior physics students doing a
required senior project, as well as other majors interested in astronomy, can
participate in research projects such as the measurement of asteroid parallaxes
and the photometry of supernovae, and can be trained in the digital analysis of
astronomical images. The asteroid and supernova projects not only affect our
Gettysburg students, but involve coordination of observations and sharing of
data with students and faculty at other institutions.
