In this project the PI will bring representatives from several Universities
(UCSD, Johns Hopkins University, Harvard University, University of Maryland,
University of Illinois at Urbana Champagne, and Cambridge University in the UK),
which are pioneers in the development of the interdisciplinary field of Physics
of Living Systems together with Program Directors at NSF for a one-day meeting
at NSF to chart a course and discuss a graduate training program at the
interface between physics and biology. This meeting would allow for different
programs to compare and contrast different ideas and varying experiences
regarding how to formulate the proper mix of methods and subjects. Such a
meeting of the minds would prove invaluable for tuning existing programs and for
offering guidance to the many other departments who are moving aggressively
towards incorporating more biological physics in their mix.
