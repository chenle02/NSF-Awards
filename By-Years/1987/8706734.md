The properties of atoms confined to a small space by metallic boundaries will
be studied experimentally. This work concerns the modification of the
spontaneous emission from excited atoms in such a space and the Van der Waals
force experienced by atoms near surfaces. An optical standing wave will be
introduced into the space to exert an additional optical force on the atoms.
This will allow the control of the position of the atoms to much less than a
micron and to perform precise atom - surface studies. This research is closely
related to several fields of current interest in atomic and laser physics.
First, this work my be viewed in the context of quantum electrodynamics as a
test of the understanding of the electromagnetic vacuum state and of the atomic
self-energy (cavity QED). Spontaneous optical emission has been suppressed and
such control over the quantum noise of a optical resonator is bound to have
interesting applications. Second, this project relates to the active field of
trapping and cooling of atoms using light. It may be possible to achieve quantum
limited confinement in one dimension which will give spectacular control over
the atoms as well as permitting some interesting demonstrations of quantum
mechanics.
