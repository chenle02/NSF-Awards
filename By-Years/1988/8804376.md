Computational equipment within the Protein Identification Resource (PIR) will be
upgraded. PIR is a national resource designed to aid investigators in the
analysis of protein sequence data. PIR began as the Atlas of Protein Sequence
and Structure data 20 years ago and has evolved into an essential electronic
database, used by biologists in evolutionary, molecular, cellular, biophysical
research. The databank will continue to interact with international efforts in
protein databanks, with the DNA sequence databanks, and now with the three
dimensional crystallographic databank. The computational equipment will
facilitate these interactions, quality control efforts on the databank, internal
or core research, communication with the research community, and the utility of
the databank for the biological community.
