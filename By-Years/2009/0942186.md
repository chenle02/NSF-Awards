This project is developing, assessing, and disseminating materials for teaching
a quantitative reasoning course. In contrast with many similar courses, which
cover a set of mathematical topics using relevant examples, this course is being
driven by complex stories about, for example, inflation, fuel economy, and
paying off debt. Students are developing quantitative, common sense approaches
to examine the issues of interest, and instructors review relevant mathematical
material as necessary. Spreadsheets are being used as a tool for investigation
and computation. Materials being developed include a textbook, homework problems
and solutions, model spreadsheets, and supplements for both students and
faculty. Course materials are designed to incorporate best practices in
teaching. The project is evaluating the ability of the course to change, in the
long term, the way students approach quantitative data. Dissemination plans
include faculty development workshops for prospective instructors of the new
course. Overall, the project is seeking to develop students' willingness and
ability to assess numerical evidence in order to make informed decisions. It has
the potential to impact a wide variety of students enrolling in general
education mathematics courses.
