Theories of defeasible reasoning previously developed and supported will be
further investigated. Expansion will include networks with expressive
enhancements such as: nets with limited cyclicity; Boolean combinations of nodes
in nets; study of arguments which interfere with a given argument by disabling
inferences leading to a particular conclusion; hydra inheritance; higher order
links; semantic foundations for defeasible inheritance; and additional work on
roles and relations. This is basic research on reasoning focusing on inheritance
and having significance in non-monotonic methods.
