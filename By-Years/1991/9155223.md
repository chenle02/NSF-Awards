This program, sponsored by the Catholic University of America, will provide a
two-year summer workshop for 50 less well-prepared teachers of chemistry from
the Washington D.C. region. The target group is minority teachers or teachers of
minority students. Also included in the project is a follow up program during
the academic year between the two summer sessions which will emphasize
implementation of the techniques learned in the summer. The teachers will study
chemistry content, learning theory and instructional strategies for learning
chemistry concepts. Lecture, pedagogy and laboratory activities will be
integrated throughout. In the laboratory component of the project teachers will
learn about microchemistry techniques, computer-lab interfacing, demonstration
activities and instrumentation. The University is providing a match to the NSF
funds equavalent to 10% of the grant award.
