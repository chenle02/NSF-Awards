Proposal Number: ECS-9623893 Principal Investigator: Mark Lee CAREER:
Application of a High Tc Superconductor for Large Bandwidth Far-Infrared Mixing
Receivers Superconductors have a uniquely sensitive and rapid quantum mechanical
response to electromagnetic radiation near the gap frequency. The new high Tc
cuprate superconductors posses an effective gap at least ten times that of Nb
therefore allowing access to the higher frequency far-infrared regime, 1 to 10
THz, for the first time. This is a region in which the electromagnetic
frequencies are beyond the optical range for conventional receivers. Also recent
experiments show that the response bandwidth of the high Tc receivers can exceed
40 GHz, a ten-fold improvement of any existing technology. This will vastly
increase the amount of information which can be carried in the THz band. The
physical principles governing the electrodynamics o these superconductors are
still unsettled. This work will simultaneously elucidate fundamental aspects of
thigh Tc superconductivity while advancing practical detectors to fill this
technological void he electromagnetic spectrum.
