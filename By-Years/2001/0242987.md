This project examines the role that accessory gland proteins play in
fertilization, particularly in the context of gametic competition. It is known
that these proteins play a pivotal role in sperm success, because Drosophila
(fruit flies) mutants that lack the ability to produce accessory gland proteins
have much reduced fertility. These mutants also exhibit characteristics that
suggest that accessory gland proteins are particularly important in the
sequestration and storage of sperm by females. In insects, normal females may
store sperm from a single mating for several weeks, an attribute that is
particularly important for sparsely distributed animals. Genomic methods are
being employed to identify all of the genes encoding accessory gland proteins,
and comparison of the DNA sequences of related species will allow identification
of which parts of the molecules are evolving most rapidly. In addition within-
species polymorphism in the Acp genes will be assessed and tested for its
association with variation in gametic competitive ability.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a renewal and extension of a project that
received prior support from NSF, and it has served as a vehicle for training and
education of many students. Seven undergraduates have worked in the laboratory
directly on this project, and 3 have become co-authors on publications.
Postdoctoral fellow Alberto Civetta secured a faculty position at the University
of Manitoba on the basis of the work he did on the project. In the coming years,
student involvement will continue to be vital. The method of constructing a cDNA
library and aligning multiple random genes of species X with known sequences of
species Y, devised under the past NSF support, has received widespread attention
as a means to exhaustively identify genes expressed in specific tissues and
simultaneously to identify those that are undergoing the most rapid
turnover.&lt;br/&gt;
