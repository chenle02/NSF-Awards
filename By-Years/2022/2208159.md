The identification from only external measurements of unknown targets that are
fully occluded inside a region is a challenging interdisciplinary research
effort among mathematicians, physicists, and engineers. Important applications
of this field include nondestructive testing, for example, checking for cracks
inside a product, seismic exploration, for example, searching for oil under the
sea, security, for example, the identification of buried anti-personnel
explosive devices, and others. Current, widely used optimization-based methods
for such tasks require some a priori knowledge about the true solution, which is
not always available, and their computational cost is expensive. This project
aims to develop new, theoretically sound techniques that are designed to quickly
deliver reliable solutions for estimating occluded targets that are independent
of the initial estimates. Both undergraduate and graduate students will be
trained through involvement in this research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this
project, data for identifying unknown targets inside a medium will be collected
through a measured scattering wave. The methodology to be developed in this work
will be able to handle data where the phase may or may not be able to be
measured, the latter which occurs in many challenging situations, such as the
case of nano imaging, where the wavelength of the incident wave is particularly
small. The new methods combine Carleman estimates, the contraction mapping
principle, and an algebraic formula to retrieve the lost phase when needed. The
use of the contraction mapping principle will guarantee key strengths of the new
approach: relaxed requirements on the initial guesses and inexpensive
computational cost. These new methods will be applied to partial differential
equations that govern wave propagation, including the three-dimensional
Helmholtz equation and Maxwellâ€™s system. The new methods will be tested on both
simulated and experimental data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
