This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, explores the mechanisms and kinetics of the reactions of chlorinated
hydrocarbons on iron and palladium surfaces. Using a unique suite of
experimental tools, including laser induced thermal desorption and reflection
absorption infrared spectroscopy, developed in Professor Donald P. Land's
laboratory, Land and his colleagues at the University of California-Davis are
obtaining kinetic information about the decomposition of chloroethylenes on well
characterized iron and palladium in ultra-high vacuum. These model studies
promise a fundamental understanding of reactions that are important in
wastewater remediation chemistry. In addition, the work provides basic molecular
level information about an important class of surface reactions.

The decomposition of chlorine containing hydrocarbon compounds is of significant
relevance to the remediation of wastewaters and ground waters in industrialized
areas. The work carried out in this project at the University of California-
Davis is exploring the detailed molecular mechanisms of these reactions on well
characterized metal surfaces. The insight gained from these studies will enhance
clean-up strategies, as well as provide fundamental understanding of an
important class of surface reactions.
