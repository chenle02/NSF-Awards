The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to potentially provide personalized hearing
health care for those with hearing loss. Providing a customized amplification
device and app solution that allows the user to understand speech more clearly
may avoid audiologist appointments and allow the user to take control of their
hearing right from their phone. Hearing loss is often associated with decreased
employment and potentially lower income. An effective amplification device may
enable those with mild-to-moderate hearing loss to improve their employment and
earnings. Additionally, this technology may remove the discomfort that certain
populations experience within the medical system and provide individualized
empowerment in relation to their hearing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase
II project seeks to deliver personalized sound profiles from the comfort of the
userâ€™s home at a fraction of the cost of traditional hearing aid solutions. This
self-fitting technology differentiates is differentiaed from the majority of
over-the-counter or direct-to-consumer hearing solutions as the new technology
allow the hearing aid enable personalize sound profiles in a variety of
different listening environments. The technological goals are to allow users to
optimize sound profiles in situ for live sound environments, and to standardize
the software platform to enable partnerships with any hardware manufacturer in
order to expand the suite of products that can help people hear clearly. The
proposed project will continue the development of the technology including:
increasing the range of frequencies that are adjusted during the self-fitting
process, including the adjustment of non-linear gain parameters in the self-
fitting process, an allowing users to obtain profiles for different listening
environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
