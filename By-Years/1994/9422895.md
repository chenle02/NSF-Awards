9422895 The Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy (COSEPUP)
undertakes major independent studies of national issues in U.S. science policy
and U.S. technology policy. In recent years, for example, it has conducted
prominent studies on U.S. policy goals for science and technology, policies
related to global warming, integrity in the conduct of scientific research, U.S.
policy for civilian technology, and recruitment and retention of Presidential
appointees. COSEPUP's core activities, including meetings of the Committee
itself and a staff of two, are underwritten substantially by internal funds
(individual studies are separately funded). NSF has supported COSEPUP for 30
years. Beginning in 1979 the NSF contributed to COSEPUP's core funds in a
sequence of two five-year contracts (each allocating funds in five annual
increments), and one two-year transition contract.
