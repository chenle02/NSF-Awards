Multidisciplinary-Engineering (99)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Engineers are
increasingly required to have the ability to work with complex, integrated
systems, which often include mechanical, thermal, and electrical components, as
well as microprocessor control. As is the case in many undergraduate engineering
programs, students at Ohio Northern University (ONU) currently have limited
exposure to such systems. ONU is working with a faculty member at the University
of Notre Dame (ND) to adapt a graduate-level Intelligent Systems course recently
developed at ND, and implement it as an undergraduate course at ONU. In this
course, consisting of classroom lectures and hands-on, multidisciplinary
laboratory projects, students learn to model and control a variety of complex
systems. This course is designed for both mechanical and electrical engineering
students who have completed a controls systems course. As part of the course,
ONU students are implementing an algorithm to control an experimental system at
ND. Likewise, ND students are doing a similar project to control a system at
ONU.
