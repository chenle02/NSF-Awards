Organic nitrates (RONO2) play important roles in the atmospheric chemistry of
Nitrogen oxides NOx (NOx = NO, NO2) and represent a major area of interaction
between atmospheric cycles of nitrogen and organic carbon. Nonetheless, the
detailed removal process of organic nitrates from the atmosphere is not well
understood. This research project will study organic nitrates and their related
reaction using a sensitive new multipass absorption technique, cavity ring-down
optical spectroscopy. The immediate goal of the research and planning activities
is to gain additional experience with this new instrument and obtain some
preliminary experimental results with it. During the planning period, specific
experiments will be performed to examine the spectroscopy and photochemical
reactions related to ethyl nitrates in the atmosphere. The activities associated
with this research planning grant will lay the necessary groundwork for the next
stage of experiments. The experimental results will demonstrate the principal
investigator's ability in performing competitive research in field of
atmospheric chemistry and will lead to the development of subsequent NSF
proposals.
