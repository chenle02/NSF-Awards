Integrated electronic systems are pervasive in all aspects of our lives, used in
everything from computers to mobile phones to automobiles. However, designing
and manufacturing systems that both work and are reliable is becoming extremely
difficult due to the significant complexity inherent in the underlying
technology. In this NSF EAGER project, we will demonstrate how statistical
learning in chip (SLIC) can cope with the non-idealities that arise due to
imprecise design and fabrication, and the uncertainty that stems from the
system's user and operating environment. Specifically, SLIC will enable an
integrated system to "learn" optimal operating points across various
applications so as to maximize performance, and to minimize power consumption.
This will be accomplished by developing customized statistical learning
algorithms for in-chip implementation that are capable of deriving actionable
information from system data produced both on- and off-line. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator (PI) is committed to having a broader
impact through training a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate
researchers. His research group has members from under-represented groups that
include women, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Native Americans. In
addition, as director of the Center for the Silicon System Implementation (CSSI)
at Carnegie Mellon University, the PI manages a program that recruits undergrads
researchers from various universities (including minority-serving institutions),
and the annual convention of the National Society of Black Engineers. This
program has been very successful, resulting in the recruitment of many
undergraduate researchers, including both women and African-Americans. In the
last few years, the PI has supervised nine undergraduate researchers, three of
which were African-American (two male and one female), and will continue to
recruit a diverse group of students, both at the graduate and undergraduate
levels, for participation in this project.
