This proposal on "Evaluation of Critical Depth Hypothesis for Phytoplankton in
Polar Waters" between Dr. Osmund Holm-Hansen of the Institute of Marine
Resources, Scripps Institute of Oceanography, University of California at San
Diego, and Dr. Egil Sakshaug of the Biological Station, University of Trondheim,
Norway, is sponsored by NSF. Dr. Holm-Hansen proposes to spend two months
primarily analyzing data he and Dr. Sakshaug have acquired in numerous cruises
in both polar regions during the past seven years, as well as data both have
produced in the laboratory which is essential to interpreting their field data.
Their computerized data bases consist of simultaneously acquired information on
physical-biological-optical characteristics in vertical profiles in the upper
200 m of the water column. The investigators wish to model the dynamic
interaction between growth and physiology of the phytoplankton and the mean
irradiance to which the cells are exposed as influenced by vertical mixing
processes. They shall interpret data within the general framework of the
Critical Depth hypothesis first described by Sverdrup in 1953, expecting that
their large data base should provide a more realistic formulation of this
concept.
