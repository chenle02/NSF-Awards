This international collaborative research project will create advanced digital
library applications to adapt existing computational linguistic and data mining
techniques for the special requirements associated with humanities content and
build an international framework for issues such as the long-term preservation
of data, metadata standards and interoperability. The results of the project
will lower the barriers for researchers and students to reading classical Greek,
Latin, and old Norse texts. The suite of applications envisioned include multi-
lingual information retrieval capabilities, concept identification, vocabulary
and syntactic parsing tools, text analysis and visualization tools, scholar-user
text annotation and emendation, and related capabilities. Storage of resources
and data will be in numerous locations and offer open access via the internet.
This is a international collaborative effort involving multiple institutions in
the US and European Union countries.&lt;br/&gt;
