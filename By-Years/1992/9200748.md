Zemanian This research is on three dimensional modeling methods for predicting
performance and characteristics of VLSI-ULSI circuits and devices. The research
topics are: 1. three dimensional corner corrections for capacitance
calculations; 2. inductance computations and transmission line parameters; and
3. dominant paths in interconnect networks including path ranking. These
computations are needed for assessment of delay times in off-chip
interconnection lines and for modeling pulse propagation through MOSFET
circuits. The approach is to use infinite electrical network theory to simplify
the computation of coupling between interconnection lines and adjacent devices.
This theory leads to efficient numerical methods, including domain contraction
techniques, which yield more powerful computation algorithms.
