A joint US-USSR workshop on plant molecular biology is proposed to be sponsored
by the National Academy of Sciences, USA and the Academy of Sciences, USSR.. The
workshop will be held in Washington, D.C. in October of 1989 and will be
organized around three major themes: Molecular biology of plant viruses, viroids
and other survival elements; Soil microorganisms in plant protection; and
Engineering of molecular structures in plants and microbes. Soviet science is
particularly strong in the field of virology. The younger Soviet scientists are
significant organizing forces in the development of plant molecular biology in
the USSR. The American contingent is composed of both established investigators
and young scientists recently emerging as leaders in the field. This joint
workshop will allow the timely interaction of these individuals who will play a
major role in the field of plant molecular biology.
