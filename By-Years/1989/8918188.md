The proposed conference is attempting to bridge the gap between two groups of
professionals: the first composed of geneticists, molecular biologists,
biochemists and cell biologists involved in cloning and cell culturing, and the
second composed of engineers involved in large scale facility design,
bioprocessing and manufacturing. Although each session will present the state-
of- the-art of knowledge with a strong focus on underlying fundamentals, an
attempt will be made to `educate' other professionals with vastly different
backgrounds. The conference will initially focus on molecular aspects and slowly
move to more applied and technical issues. The Proceedings of the Conference are
to be published via the New York Academy of Sciences.
