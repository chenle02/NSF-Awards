9313542 McMurtry The Communications and Space Science Laboratory (CSSL) at the
Pennsylvania State University is part of the Electrical and Computer Engineering
Department. The research activities of this lab range from shuttle-based
observations of ozone and chlorine monoxide in the atmosphere to rocket-based in
situ measurements of the stratosphere and mesosphere to ground-based lidar
measurements of these same regions. Many of these activities require state-of-
the-art electronic instrumentation which is designed, constructed, and tested at
CSSL. This award to Penn State University will allow the modernization of lab
spaces to facilitate the design and development of spacecraft-rated hardware. By
improving environmental conditions, the labs will become acceptable to both
faculty and students alike who are doing research on basic research problems
about global climate change. A class 10,000 softwall clean room will also be
installed to provide the proper conditions for the assembly of flight hardware.
This project will better enable research and the training of students studying
the earth's atmosphere. ***
