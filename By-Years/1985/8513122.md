Th objectives of the project are of using interactive computer graphic
techniques for flash flood forecasting to design, implement, test, and
demonstrate a system with the following capabilities: linkage with flash flood
warning systems; radar and raingauge defined rainfall data; watershed streamflow
simulation analysis and hydrologic database management system; and interactive
computer graphics system.
