Dr. Vaida plans to continue and expand a program of research aimed at the
development of a detailed picture of reactive excited electronic surfaces for
polyatomic molecules. Reactive molecular systems where excited state lifetimes
are shortended by chemical processes provide a challenging spectroscopic
problem. She has developed an extensive experimental program to investigate
these interesting chemical systems. This approach involves a combination of
spectroscopic techniques such as electronic absorption, multiphoton ionization
and photodissociation in conjunction with sample preparation in the controlled
environment of a supersonic jet. The information obtained experimentally is to
be used with extensive theoretical modeling aiming for a complete description of
the structure and dynamics of reactive excited electronic surfaces. The work is
important because of the focus on developing a quantitative understanding of
chemical reactivity for model molecular systems. The combination of high
resolution experiemtnal results and detailed theoretical treatment is expected
to provide a cosistent picture of the dynamics of a number of important
reactions.
