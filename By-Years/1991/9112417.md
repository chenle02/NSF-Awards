Treeless parks dominated by sagebrush or grasses and herbs are a conspicuous
feature of the montane and subalpine vegetation zones in the central Rocky
Mountains. Carbon-dated pollen records taken from cores of pond sediments can be
used to reconstruct the vegetation history of a site or region. The area around
Fish Creek Park in the Wind River Mountains of Wyoming will be studied in this
way to determine the pattern of spatial and temporal vegetation change. An
effort to reconstruct the vegetation history of the Taylor Park, Colorado area
might also be warranted, depending upon preliminary findings. Information about
the age and spatial stability of the landscape will be used to test three
hypotheses of park origin; these hypotheses (which involve persistence,
remnants, and natural fire regimes) have been invoked to explain the existence
of parks, but have never been tested. Further study of findings might be
extended to explain the origins of other parks in the region. The timing and
sequence of vegetation change that accompanies park formation will suggest new
hypotheses related to specific mechanisms responsible for park establishment and
maintenance.
