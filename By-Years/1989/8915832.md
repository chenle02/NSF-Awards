Recent GLORIA surveys and dredging have discovered a large field of young
alkalic flood basalts across the flexural arch north of the Hawaiian island
chain. These rocks represent a significant and previously unknown part of
Hawaiian volcanic history, and promise to advance greatly our understanding of
hot-spot volcanism. Drs. Mahoney and Sinton will oversee isotopic and trace
element analyses on 20-30 dredge samples from this region in order to determine
mantle sources and gain insight into the magmatic history of this largery of
this large flow field. Previous understanding of hotspot, mid-plate volcanic
(like those of the Hawaiian islands) have identified three phases: 1) the major
shield building episode of tholeitic composition; 2) a minor (&lt;1% by volume)
alkalic cap; and 3) a small outpouring of silica-poor, " rejuvenated" lavas
after a few million years of quiesence. Initial studies by Clague (USGS, a not-
cost collaborator on this request) show the arch volcanics are closest in
character to this last, "rejuvenated" suite of MORB-like rocks. Mahoney and
Sinton hope to gain better understanding of the nature and variability of
probable mantle sources, and the respective roles of partial melting, magma
mixing and fractional crystallization.
