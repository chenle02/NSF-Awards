Architecturally Diverse Systems for Streaming Applications &lt;br/&gt;Abstract
(0905368)&lt;br/&gt;Many important scientific computing problems, called
?streaming applications,? have high input data rates derived from real-time
sensor data or directly from data streaming from disk arrays. Real-time sensor
based data (e.g., telescopic astrophysical data obtained in the search for new
planets) is frequently sourced from analog devices and requires filtering and
various data cleaning prior to performing a host of complex computations. Large
disk based data sets (e.g., genome and protein sets used in understanding
disease factors) are often passed at high data rates from disk
storage.&lt;br/&gt; Choices for dealing with such applications include a
multiplicity of computing devices (e.g., general purpose processors, chip-
multiprocessors, graphics processors, field programmable gate arrays, etc.).
While each individually is well matched to certain types of computations, often
more effective solutions are found by integrating multiple computer types into a
single system. &lt;br/&gt;The central research issue is determining how to
effectively integrate diverse computing resources for solution of complex
streaming applications. The research includes further development of the
AutoPipe design environment. AutoPipe provides tools for algorithm
specification, and for design, simulation and deployment of diverse integrated
computing architectures. Techniques for inclusion of analog devices in mixed
analog-digital systems is being undertaken so that Auto-Pipe can handle mixed
signal, analog/digital algorithmic functional and resource components in a
single system. The research activity is driven by two important applications
taken from the astro-physics and computational biology domains. There will be
heavy involvement of graduate and undergraduate students in the
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
