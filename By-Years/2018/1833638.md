This award will support student travel to attend the second edition of a
workshop focused on abusive language in online environments. The workshop, the
2018 Abusive Language Online Conference, is co-located with the 2018 Conference
on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, October 31 - November 4,
2018, in Brussels, Belgium. The Workshop will develop students' skills and
knowledge to use multidisciplinary approaches and computational methods for
research on abusive language in contexts such as social media platforms.
Students will learn about policies related to these behaviors and ways to
develop tools and processes to allow relevant parties to respond quickly to
abusive language online. Students will engage with researchers to develop ways
to categorize and classify content and ways to evaluate guidelines and
standards. Activities will include panel discussions and plenary
talks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
