The 9th Annual Maine-Quebec Conference on Number Theory and Related Topics

The 2007 Maine/Quebec conference on number theory and related topics will take
place on September 29 & 30 at the University of Maine in Orono. This conference
is held annually, at l'Universite Laval in Quebec in even years and at the
University of Maine in odd years. By providing a forum for number theorists from
New England, Quebec and beyond to present and discuss their research, the
conference promotes interaction and collaboration between Canadian and American
number theorists. This year we will emphasize two themes: (1) Automorphic forms
and representation theory, (2) Analytic number theory as applied to classical
zeta functions. Plenary lectures on these themes will be given by James Arthur
and Steve Gonek, respectively. Approximately 20 other invited speakers will
present their work. The small scale of the meeting (with 30-40 attendees) makes
this a good opportunity for graduate students and young mathematicians to
interact with leading researchers.
