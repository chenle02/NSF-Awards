Long-term Research: Theoretical Studies on the Statistical Physics of Membranes
and Polymers This award recommendation is made under the Program for Long and
Medium-Term Research at Foreign Centers of Excellence. The program is designed
to enable young U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct long-term research
abroad at research institutions of proven excellence. Awards provide
opportunities for the conduct of joint research and the utilization of unique or
complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions in foreign
countries. The award will support Dr. John Palmeri, University of Illinois,
Urbana, for a fifteen-month research visit with Drs. R. Balian and S. Leibler,
Service de Physique Theoretique CEN-Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, France. The award
recommendation provides funds to cover, as appropriate, international travel,
local travel abroad, stipend, dependents allowance, if applicable, and a flat
administrative allowance of $250.00 for the U.S. home institution.
