This award will provide half the funding required to upgrade the portable
seismometer system at Northern Arizona University. The University is located in
a seismically active area on the southern Colorado Plateau. The seismicity is
part of a 100 kilometer wide band of earthquake sources known as the Northern
Arizona Seismic Belt. The study of seismicity in northern Arizona will allow a
determination of the source of stresses leading to intraplate seismicity and has
important implications for interpreting earthquakes in other areas of the
western U.S. The portable equipment requested will be deployed in temporary
field arrays of seismometers in order to characterize the seismicity and to test
hypotheses of intraplate stress distribution.
