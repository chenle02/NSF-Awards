&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Travel funds are requested to partially support
approximately 50 graduate students to attend the 2015 Annual Meeting of the
North American Membrane Society (NAMS 2015) Conference in Boston, MA from May-
June 2015. The NAMS annual meeting is one of the preeminent global membrane
meetings. The latest developments in the membrane field from leading academic,
governmental, and industrial research labs are presented for the first time for
evaluation by the membrane community. The organizers anticipate a total of
approximately 400 membrane researchers from all over the world representing
industry, government, and academia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The requested funding
will provide partial support for student participation in the 2015 NAMS
Conference. NAMS meetings provide a unique opportunity for students to share
their accomplishments with peers and more senior members of the community. The
feedback they receive can help direct their work and provide encouragement.
