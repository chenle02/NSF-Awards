This project is being funded through the Learning & Intelligent Systems
Initiative, and is supported in part by the NSF Office of Multidisciplinary
Activities in the Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences. Learning in
many cognitive domains, including language and vision, involves recognition of
complex hierarchical structure that is hidden or only indirectly reflected in
the input data. In this project a multi-disciplinary group of applied
mathematicians, cognitive scientists, computer scientists, linguists, and
neuroscientists will study the learning of compositional structure in language,
vision, and planning, and will also probe the neural mechanisms for identifying
and exploiting such structure. The research involves three interacting lines of
work. The first refines and extends statistical learning models; the second
applies these models to language, vision, and planning; and the third develops
and applies new experimental and analysis techniques for probing the neural
mechanisms that learn and exploit compositional structure. The results of the
project should significantly increase our understanding of complex learning, and
should have implications for a wide range of topics in education (e.g., learning
of complex knowledge structures in science and math) and technology (e.g.,
automated speech recognition, computer vision, robotics).
