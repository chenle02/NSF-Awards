Madisonville Community College (MCC), in partnership with Ivy Tech Community
College of Indiana-Bloomington Region and Jackson State Community College in
Tennessee, are enhancing and extending previous and very successful projects
that will increase the rigor of an Advanced Integrated Technology (AIT) program.
The project is responding to the needs of modern manufacturers' expressed need
for employees with a deeper understanding of manufacturing and problem solving.
This project is addressing two barriers identified in previous work: (1) the
limited availability of a rigorous curriculum and, (2) the inability of
manufacturing programs to attract students. These problems are addressed by
developing a curriculum that increases the focus on problem solving skills.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The curriculum is being developed with contributions from
all the partner schools and collaborating industries. The courses developed in
the project will incorporate Siemens' internationally recognized integrated
systems approach and spiral design. These principles have been shown to help
students grasp key concepts and increase conceptual understanding. To help
sustain the project, faculty and high school teacher development activities are
being conducted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By investigating high school student
motivation, the project will identify factors that dissuade students from
selecting manufacturing as a career and then develop strategies to address
student concerns. One strategy already being implemented is the development of a
dual credit course that allows high school students to get started early in
their technical education. The project is targeting this course to females and
other groups underrepresented in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of the materials
developed by this project are publicly available and are being disseminated via
national conferences and publication.
