This award supports a new collaboration between Dr. Dianne K. Newman of the
California Institute of Technology and Dr. Paula S. Suarez of the Universidad
Simon Bolivar in Venezuela. These researchers share a long-standing interest in
metal transformations by microorganisms and have both in recent years studied
iron cycling in biofilm communities. Currently, very little is known about the
diversity, genetics, and biochemistry of phototrophic iron-oxidizers, and even
less is know about how these organisms interact with other bacteria in
biofilms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These researchers will collaborate to isolate
iron-oxidizers and iron-reducers from a biofilm forming on the surface of a
corroding steel boat in San Esteban National Park, Venezuela. It is anticipated
that this project will provide insights that will help launch a long-term
collaboration to study the biochemistry and genetics of phototrophic iron-
oxidation, and test the hypothesis that iron-oxidizing phototrophs can form
biofilms that are sustained by iron-cycling in concert with iron-
reducers.&lt;br/&gt;
