In this research the influence of an innovative processing method on the
mechanical behavior of ceramic materials will be studied. In particular, it is
proposed to control crystallographic texture by magnetically-assisted grain
alignment during the processing of paramagnetic ceramics, namely iron titanate
and yttrium barium copper high temperature superconductor material. It is
expected that controlled texture may influence the magnitude of residual
stresses within the microstructure of these ceramics, and hence, the magnitude
of grain bridging and microcracking induced toughening. The PI will collaborate
with researchers at NIST to measure residual stresses with neutron diffraction
and microcracking with neutron scattering in-situ as the material is cooled from
processing temperature. It is expected that these studies will provide a general
framework for microstructural design and mechanical property control of ceramics
by the application of a magnetic field during processing.
