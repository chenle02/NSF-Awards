A laser-based kinetics/spectroscopy laboratory is being created to service
students in physical chemistry, instrumental analysis, and polymer chemistry
laboratories and undergraduate research. With this equipment, students perform
experiments to gain insights into the chemical an physical principles discussed
in lecture courses. The laboratory houses two instrumental arrangements, each of
which can be easily adapted to perform a number of experiments. One utilizes
steady-state excitation to effect Raman scattering, emission spectroscopy,
fluorescence analysis, and light scattering. This system includes a 150 mW
Argon-ion excitation laser and a detection system consisting of a monochromator,
photomultiplier tube, and either a lock-in amplifier or electrometer. Data
collection is under computer control. The second arrangement features a pulsed-
nitrogen laser pumped dye laser excitation source that allows students to
measure luminescence lifetimes and perform pulse-probe experiments. Detection is
accomplished with a digital oscilloscope.
