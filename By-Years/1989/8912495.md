It is proposed to study the evolution of excited atomic states in dense media,
under the influence of multiple scattering and dynamical screening effects,
within the framework of classical and quantum stochastic dynamics. Present
applications and comparisons with experiment focus primarily on atom or ion
penetration through solids. The fundamental goal is to analyze noise induced
dynamics of simple atomic systems in terms of transport theory. Evolution of
atomic states strongly perturbed in dense media will be related to the theory of
stochastic processes in non-linear dynamic media. Both classical and quantum
calculations will be performed, in order to study the interplay of extrinsic
stochasticity due to random forces (noise) and intrinsic stochasticity due to
(classically) chaotic dynamics. //
