This project is to develop a PC-AT version of an existing building analysis
program "COMBAT" which was originally designed for mainframe computers. The
objective is to make this powerful computer program user-friendly so that many
of small engineering offices and design firms can benefit by using this program
without requiring access to prime computers. The expected delivery of the
product will include graphic display capability as well as a menu-driven input
phase processor. This is an effort to increase the impact of NSF-supported
research on engineering practice via expanded use of computer technology and
technology transfer.
