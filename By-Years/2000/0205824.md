&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves research on new
instructional technologies, for use in teaching astronomy to non-science majors.
The central goal is to involve students in research-level astronomy data sets,
so that they can understand the process of science by active exploration. Other
goals are to use models and simulation to convey complex or abstract concepts,
and to allow students to explore multimedia astronomy content in flexible ways.
The major areas of focus for content development are (1) interactive Java
applets that use real data to teach basic physics and astronomy concepts, (2)
virtual worlds that allow a 3D exploration of the universe on various scales,
(3) a natural language "expert system" to answer questions across the subject
matter, with associated testing materials, and (4) a data architecture to allow
the flexible delivery of this content over the Internet, via voice portals, and
to a variety of devices on the wireless web. The overall goal is a rich learning
environment that measures performance and can adapt to different student
interests and learning styles. The tools developed in this project have an
immediate application for distance learning, and the technologies and modes of
delivery can readily be applied across other science
subjects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
