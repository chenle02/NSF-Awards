9315720 Seybert This project provides partial support for travel to St.
Petersburg, Russia, to participate in Noise '93-- an International Conference on
noise and vibration control. The most common source of noise is a vibrating
boundary, such as a panel or some other component in a machine. Mechanical
vibrations can be caused by internal forces arising from functional elements of
the machine, such as forces resulting from the combustion in an internal
combustion engine or the impacts in a punch press. Controlling noise and
vibration is extremely important in order to enhance efficiency and productivity
in a manufacturing work environment. The participation in the Noise '93
International Conference provides an excellent opportunity for exchange of ideas
and learn innovative techniques from other participants for noise and vibration
control.***
