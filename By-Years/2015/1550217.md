The appropriate metrics to use evaluate R&amp;D programs is a debated and
unresolved question. There are currently no standards for the specific impacts
that should be assessed when making investment decisions. This lack of
uniformity inhibits comparisons between programs and weakens the value of these
evaluations in providing actionable information. This s project seeks to advance
knowledge within the science of science policy community by identifying a core
set of metrics that can be used to evaluate Federal R&amp;D programs.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will create a comprehensive set of potential
metrics that may be relevant when evaluating the outcomes, impacts, and
innovations that result from an R&amp;D program. The research will use RAND?s
ExpertLens, an online modified Delphi system, to elicit opinions from a diverse
set of Federal stakeholders and academic researchers on the usefulness of the
identified metrics. This process will provide information on the most valuable
metrics for evaluating a diverse set of R&amp;D programs&lt;br/&gt;
