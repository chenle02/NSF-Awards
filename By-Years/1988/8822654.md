New concepts for the utilization of computers within engineering environments
for large scale nonlinear systems will be investigated. The topics of research
include the use of symbolically-assisted numeric equation solvers, knowledge-
assisted solvers, iconic programming and virtual solvers. State of the art
techniques within sparse matrix theory will be studied. All ideas will be tested
within the context of both large power systems and complex robotic mechanisms to
determine the efficacy of all new software concepts. Both series and parallel
algorithms will be studied and tested. We expect that the state of the art of
computer utilization within engineering contexts will be advanced, and as a by-
product we expect that progress will be made on better solutions to several
important power system and robotic problems.
