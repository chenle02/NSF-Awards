Oncogenes, originally found in viruses, code for proteins which transform
healthy cells into tumor cells. In the course of this work, it was found that
normal cells contain non-mutagenic homologs of oncogenes, called proto-
oncogenes. C-fos, is a proto-oncogene, and its expression appears to be one of
the initial events resulting from stimulation of a cell. Thus, the determination
of c-fos in neuron reactivity represents a promising tool to determine with high
resolution and high sensitivity the pattern of activity at the cellular level.
Dr. Hoffman will develop and validate the use of c-fos immunocytochemistry as a
molecular tool to map hypothalamic neuronal activation. She has selected the
magnocellular neurons within the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the
hypothalamus since quantifiable physiological stimuli activate these neurons to
synthesize and release vasopressin and oxytocin. Vasopressin is involved in the
regulation of water balance and blood volume and oxytocin is necessary for
lactation and parturition. Using immunocytochemical double-labelling techniques
and appropriate physiological stimulation, Dr. Hoffman will dissect the
relationship between c-fos expression and hormone secretion and/or release.
These studies will specifically distinguish active from inactive neurons and
thus will add a new dimension to our understanding of the relationship between
structure and function in the mammalian central nervous system. These data are
likely to have a significant impact on the understanding of the functional
physiology of the hypothalamus.
