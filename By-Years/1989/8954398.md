A two week workshop for thirty experienced introductory physics faculty is being
held at the United States Air Force Academy. The faculty who attend the workshop
during the summer of 1990 will then themselves conduct workshops during the 1990
academic year for physics faculty in their local area. The project is enabling
physics professors to become skilled in the use of interactive technologies for
transforming introductory physics courses for undergraduates. The discussion and
formulation of new paradigms for general physics content is based on the
capabilities of the new interactive, information technologies, such as computer-
interfaced experiments, desk-top digitized video, symbolic algebra computer
software, HyperCard lessons, CD-ROM, and the computer-enhanced classroom. The
workshop is also including preparation for the participants to lead local
workshops on the new science content using interactive technology after they
return to their home campus.
