This proposal presents a visual approach to the representation and validation of
document structures specified in XML and transformation of one structure to
another, in a general framework of automatic language generation. The underlying
theory of this visual approach is a context-sensitive graph grammar formalism.
The proposal demonstrates the conciseness and expressiveness of the graph
grammar formalism and its suitability to visual specification and automatic
generation of visual XML languages. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI's previous
research on the graph grammar formalism and visual language generation will be
extended and adapted to suit automatic generation of visual XML design languages
with tools that assist the design of XML-like of documents and their
translations between each other. A set of tools will be developed to facilitate
the visual specification of XML-like document structures and automatic
generation of target documents. The tools would therefore enable a wide
community to use the latest computing and Internet technology in storing and
exchanging digital documents. The tools and the concepts associated with them
will also make excellent teaching and self-training vehicles for the courses on
programming languages, compilers, and visual interfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
