There are thousands of genes in the human genome. What forces have shaped the
evolution of these genes? Recent research has suggested that the most rapidly
evolving genes in many organisms may be driven by the intense competition and
conflict that surrounds sexual reproduction. For example, females in many
species will mate with more than one male in succession, which means that the
sperm of different males must compete to fertilize eggs. Sperm competition is
thought to result in an escalating, "three-way tug-of-war" as evolutionary
conflicts are played out between the genes affecting sperm offensive abilities,
sperm defensive abilities, and female control of sperm usage. This perpetual
conflict surrounding fertilization success has been hypothesized to drive rapid
and sustained evolutionary change, analogous to an escalating arms
race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research outlined in this proposal is designed to
test the relative importance of male-male versus male-female conflict for the
evolution of genes related to fertilization success in nematodes of the genus
Caenorhabditis. In these species, it is possible to compare the way genes are
evolving between lineages that have very different sperm competition regimes but
are otherwise extremely similar to each other. Using standard techniques in
molecular biology, the rates and patterns of protein evolution will be studied
for two genes involved in fertilization success in these
organisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
