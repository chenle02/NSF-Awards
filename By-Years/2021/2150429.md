The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site on Accessible Information
and Communication Technology (AICT) site engages a group of students with
diverse auditory abilities (deaf, hard of hearing or hearing) in human-centered
research experiences that investigate accessibility of information and
communications technologies (ICT). As ICT becomes more pervasive, a crucial
challenge is to provide an equal user experience to people regardless of their
auditory abilities, by training the next generation of people who have diverse
auditory abilities. This program will train a cohort of deaf, hard of hearing
and hearing student to be future ICT accessibility
leaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students will learn about accessible ICT, engage
in the research process from ideation to presentations, and join a community of
scholars and practitioners who will provide career advice and mentorship. The
REU projects will form the basis for new collaborations among the investigators
and other collaborators at the students' home institutions. The inclusion of
undergraduate and faculty/staff researchers who have diverse auditory abilities
increases recognition of the range and complexity of needs by users with diverse
auditory abilities and the range of possible ICT
solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
