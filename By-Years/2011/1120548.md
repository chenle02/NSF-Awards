Organisms keep energy reserves in the form of fats that are often stored in
specialized fat tissues. Excessive fat storage in humans that may lead to
obesity depends on an individual?s genetic background. Unfortunately, we know
little about the genes that control fat metabolism and how they interact. This
project will use the unique toolbox of fruit fly genetics to study a gene that
is a central regulator of fat metabolism. Studies of this gene in mammals (such
as humans and mice) are complicated by the presence of three closely related
gene copies, whereas flies have only one copy. The project will generate mutant
versions of the gene to study how it controls fat metabolism, and it will study
how the gene itself is regulated in response to food intake. Results will
improve our knowledge of pathways that regulate fat metabolism and storage.
Since fundamental metabolic processes are very similar in insects and mammals,
the results are likely to also lead to an improved knowledge of the genetic
control of fat metabolism in humans. This is of importance because obesity in
humans increases the risk for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. The
project will be carried out mostly by graduate and undergraduate students and,
thus, contribute to the education of our next generation of scientists and
innovators.
