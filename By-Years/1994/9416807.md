9416807 Giblin This project will compare the stoichiometric relationships among
benthic fluxes of oxygen, carbon, sulfur, nitrogen and phosphorous from
sediments in a variety of lakes. Investigators will use a comparative ecosystem
approach and a process-based diagenetic model to examine the factors which
control regeneration of nitrogen and phosphorus from sediments. They will
examine how the release of nitrogen and phosphorus changes in lakes across
gradients of organic matter deposition, water chemistry, sediment chemistry and
bottom water oxygen concentration. The data to be examined include: multi-year
data sets from Lakes in the Hubbard Brook, Northern Lakes and Arctic LTER sites;
shorter term data sets from about 50 temperate and arctic lakes; data from
several experiments where carbon inputs to the sediments and overlying water
chemistry were manipulated in intact sediment cores; and data from two whole
lake fertilization experiments. Investigators will use this data to generate
improved conceptual and numerical models of the controls of nutrient release
from freshwater sediments. These models will provide tools for the management of
water quality in lakes and estuaries.
