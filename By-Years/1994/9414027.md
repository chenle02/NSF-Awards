9414027 Tomozawa This Academic Research Infrastructure Program Award is made to
provide partial support for a Nano Test 550 Indenter System. This instrument
will be used to investigate the mechanical properties of surface and interfaces
of glasses, metals and composite materials. The equipment will be used to study
the mechanical fatigue of glass fibers and in a program of glass properties
related to microelectronic devices. ***
