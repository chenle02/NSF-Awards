This SGER proposal is to support a graduate student in exploratory research of
the social, economic, and political dimensions of the development of Arctic
fisheries. The concept surrounding the proposal is a novel one based on the
possible increase in open water available to commercial fishing fleets as a
result of decreasing thickness of sea ice in the Arctic. The PI argues that if
current climate trends continue, it is foreseeable that the Arctic could become
available to commercial fishing, increasing the potential for conflict between
an extractive industry and indigenous populations. The proposed research is to
interview policy makers, government resource managers, scientists, commercial
fishers, and indigenous stakeholders to determine the potential for the
development of an Arctic fishery, the social and economic factors surrounding
such development, and the perceptions and preparation of local people. The
proposed research is appropriate for a SGER as it is "preliminary work on
untested and novel ideas," as well as "a venture into emerging research."
