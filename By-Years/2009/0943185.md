This collaborative award provides support for the conduct of a CAREER proposal
writing workshop to be held March 25 and 26, 2010, at Georgia Institute of
Technology in Atlanta. Provision is made for 150 attendees who will be selected
from among the applicants giving priority to young faculty whose research will
likely receive support from the Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing
Innovation, and to members of underrepresented groups. The workshop will include
a lecture on the basics of proposal writing, experiences of recent CAREER
awardees, and mock panel reviews of actual recent CAREER proposals and of the
attendees' own proposal summaries.

Previous similar workshops have attracted typically twice as many applicants as
can be accommodated at the workshop. Previous attendees have enjoyed
significantly higher proposal success rates, both with their CAREER and other
proposals. Thus, it is expected that this workshop will provide information that
will enable the attendees to write more competitive proposals and subsequently
improve the quality of their research.
