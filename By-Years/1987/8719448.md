One of the important issues in paleoanthropology is the development of
bipedalism in early hominids. In order to adequately understand the adaptations
of the human foot for terrestriality, studies are needed that analyze the
adaptations in the feet of other terrestrial primate groups. In this study, the
researcher will analyze the functional foot morphology of fourteen species of
Cercopithecus and Cercocebus, monkey groups found in the Old World. The student
will identify interspecific differences in foot function associated with shifts
from an arboreal to a terrestrial mode of locomotion. This unique study will
increase our understanding of the trends in pedal adaptation to terrestrial
locomotion. It will add to our understanding of the structural modifications in
the foot associated with the transition to terrestriality in various primate
groups and in early hominids. Clearly establishing this correlation between
morphology and behavior is fundamental to establishing the theoretical framework
by which to intrepret the relationship between ecology and the positional
behavior of fossil primates and early hominids.
