This award deals with the development of synthetic techniques and a rational
strategy towards preparing transition metal oxide nanocrystals in order to
determine their properties as they scale as a function of size, and to be able
to generate self-assembled composites from the nanoscale components. The
nanocrystals are ideally monodispersed, uniform in composition, crystalline, and
can be prepared over a range of sizes from 1-100 nm. An understanding of their
mechanisms of formation and their precise character, in terms of morhopology and
surface will be conducted. The transition metal oxides studied have applications
in magnetism and ferroelectricity. The benefit of application directed research
in these nanoscale materials will ultimately lead to advances in electrical and
electronic devices. The nanocrystals studied will include the ferroelectric
titanates BaTiO3, Pb(Zr,Ti)O3, manganese oxides, MnO, Mn3O4, MnO2 and binary TMO
Oxide Nanocrystals based on the manganese system: CaMnO3 and LaMnO3. The
interdisciplinary approach and technological focus will impact science students
from levels between and postdoctoral and middle school, and will be a program to
promote the understanding of materials science and engineering as a constantly
evolving, cutting edge and fascinating discipline.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;With
the advent of nanotechnology, comes the purpose and opportunity to explore the
applications of inorganic crystals with nanometer dimensions. These tiny
crystals can exhibit properties different than at larger lengthscales, and it
becomes interesting to find out precisely what those differences are. Knowing
those differences can lead to a deeper understanding of fundamental scientific
phenomena, such as magnetism, or lead to new and exciting technological
applications.&lt;br/&gt;*** &lt;br/&gt;
