This project involves laboratory investigations of the mechanisms of selected
heterogeneous reactions on surfaces selected as surrogates for atmospheric
mineral aerosols. Studies will be performed as a function of relative humidity
to quantify the effect of water vapor on the adsorption and reaction rates and
mechanisms. A variety of analytical techniques will be employed to measure the
uptake of gaseous species and identify the absorbed intermediate compounds.
Isotopic labeling will be used as an additional tool to verify reaction
pathways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will entrain a number of
undergraduate students at this RUI (Research at an Undergraduate) Institution.
This will be the institution's first summer research program in chemistry. Since
the population of the university is predominately female, it is likely that this
project will provide a supportive research environment for a number of female
students, and thereby increase interest in the chemical sciences, where they are
underrepresented. The equipment acquisitions will lead to improved instrumental
infrastructure in the chemistry department.
