This research deals with the development of methodologies which will allow the
incorporation of uncertainty considerations into Production-Investment-Location
problems. These problems involve choices of input mix, type of production
technology, and investment strategies under various assumptions on levels of
risk and government regulation. Theincorporation of uncertainty into existing
deterministic models will make these models more realistic as instruments for
evaluating production-investment- location decisions.
