This PYI award will be used to pursue research into the novel area of ion
implantation induced amorphization and subsequent solid phase epitaxial growth
of compound semiconductors and heterocompositional compound semiconductor
interfaces. Solid state diffusion limitations account for observation of both
the larger scale growth front instabilities and the small scale (10- 15A)
discrete aggregative type growth during solid phase epitaxy of GaAs. These solid
phase growth characteristics represent a departure from the two dimensional
Frank van der Merwe type growth associated with solid phase epitaxial growth of
elemental semiconductors. With a new JEOL 4000FX high resolution the P.I. will
TEM with full image processing, study the layer by layer solid phase epitaxial
growth process in situ.
