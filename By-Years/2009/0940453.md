ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;09 July 2009&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
0940453&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute
(WHOI)&lt;br/&gt;PI: A. Suchy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under
the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law
111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal requests numerous Shipboard Scientific
Support (SSSE) items for the vessels operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institute; namely the R/V ATLANTIS, KNORR, and OCEANUS. The requests
specifically include items that have been recommended from past NSF inspections,
Navy INSURV's, or Post-Cruise Assessments (PCA's) and have been otherwise
deferred by the operator due to cost. All of the items requested will either
improve safety, enhance science support capability, or extend vessel service
life. Due to the nature and timing of these requests, the vendor quotation
standards normally required by the SSSE Program were waived out of necessity
with many of the figures provided as estimates for budgetary purposes and based
mainly on past experience of the vessel operators for similar work.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute
vessels support federally-funded scientific research throughout the world's
oceans and routinely expose graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing
oceanography. WHOI also participates in a large number of outreach programs
including web broadcasts from vessel while at sea, open house events, and other
initiatives such as Dive and Discover with the submersible ALVIN. All told, WHOI
vessels are scheduled to complete over 560 NSF sponsored days in 2009.
