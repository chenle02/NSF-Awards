Abstract

Award: DMS-0905891 Principal Investigator: Kevin E. Wortman

The principal investigator intends to study four basic problems about the large-
scale geometry of arithmetic groups: "classical arithmetic groups" such as
SL(n,Z), "S-arithmetic groups" such as SL(n,Z[1/p]), and "function-field-
arithmetic groups" such as SL(n,F[t]) where F is a finite field. The first
problem is to identify the Dehn function for SL(n,Z) if n > 3. Second, to
determine for which m a given function-field-arithmetic group is of type FPm.
Third, to develop a theory of fillings for arithmetic groups that is inclusive
of all types of arithmetic groups, and that includes the first and second
problems stated above. Fourth, to verify what is conjectured to be the first
dimension of the cohomology of a function-field-arithmetic group that is
infinitely generated. In addition, the PI intends to use the knowledge learned
from the problems above to further investigate the finiteness properties and
word metrics of "universal lattices", such as SL(n,Z[t]).

What all of the problems above include is the study of arrays of numbers, called
matrices. Being able to understand the arithmetic of matrices is a fundamental
problem in mathematics that has applications to most fields of science and
economics. As mathematicians have done in the past with great success, the PI
intends to study the arithmetic associated with matrices by bundling the
equations they represent into a single geometric theory.
