9413422 Mertzman This award provides partial funding for the acquisition and
installation of a scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy
dispersive x-ray microanalysis system. The instrument will be installed and
operated at Franklin &amp; Marshall College. F &amp; M College is committed to
providing the remaining funds necessary for the acquisition. Scholarship and
research are pursued in parallel at F &amp; M as forms of undergraduate
teaching. Science education at the college level works best in an atmosphere
saturated with opportunities for undergraduate research. The new instrument will
be used primarily in applications involving several scientific disciplines and
for a range of activities including undergraduate course work, independent
student research projects, and faculty-student research projects. ***
