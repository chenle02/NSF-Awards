This project supports three years of short courses on research methods in
cultural anthropology. A standing advisory committee will oversee the selection
of topics and teachers of courses to be held at the same time and place as the
existing NSF Summer Institute in Research Design in Cultural Anthropology, at
the Duke University Marine Laboratory. The courses should generate synergy and
excitement about learning state of the art methods, and will facilitate
networking among scientifically minded anthropologists. Potential topics include
text analysis, ethnographic decision tree modeling, consensus modeling, time
allocation, and experimental methods for ethnography. The broader impacts will
include the combination of research and teaching as course attendees expand
their abilities to conceptualize and plan their research.
