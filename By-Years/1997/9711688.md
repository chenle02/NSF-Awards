Avrum J. Shriar University of Florida The doctoral dissertation research will
examine the principal socio-economic and agronomic conditions that shape the
adoption of intensive agriculture. The project will be sited in the buffer zone
of the Maya Biosphere Reserve in Peten, Guatemala. The study will compare
farms/households within and between three study areas and will identify
influences on intensification that manifest themselves at two scales: the local
and regional. In addition, the study will investigate local farmers' knowledge
and experimentation in order to discover alternative strategies that may be
feasible in the livelihood process. Informal interviews will be obtained and
intensification measures will be developed. The work will gather information on
technology adoption, land use change and land degradation that will inform
theoretical debates.
