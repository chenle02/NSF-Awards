This objective of this award is to organize the inaugural Aspiring Principal
Investigator (PI) meeting for Computer Systems Research (CSR). The workshop will
assemble a group of aspiring CSR PIs with diverse backgrounds, fostering the
growth of the CSR community. Participants interested in computer systems
research, but who have not received funding from the program, will have a better
understanding of the CSR program and prepare them for developing competitive CSR
proposals in the future. A number of PIs will be selected from HBCU/MEI and
under-represented groups. The workshop is to be held at the National Science
Foundation (NSF) Headquarters in Alexandria, VA on Friday, May 11, 2018. The
format will include presentations of information of CSR related solicitations,
talks by recent CSR awardees, and a session to discuss the NSF panel review
process, including discussion of traits of successful CSR
proposals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
