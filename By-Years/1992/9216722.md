This project involves the dissertation research of a linguistic anthropology
student from the City University of New York, studying language socialization in
the Marquesas. The project involves a year-long ethnographic study of the
beliefs and behaviors of a community of Polynesian-speaking Marquesans. The
every-day interactions of several children, aged 2-5, will be observed and tape
recorded. The transcriptions will be analyzed for evidence of how care givers
socialize children into using Polynesian as the dominant language in the social
construction of Marquesan identity. This project is important because this case
study can help us understand the general processes involved in the maintenance
of an ethnic identity in a social situation where another language and culture
is politically dominant. Understanding how ethnic identity is maintained can
help us comprehend the sources of ethnic conflict in the modern world.
