This NSF award provides support for early career U.S. based mathematicians to
attend a summer school and two workshops to be held in the period from September
to December 2022 at the Hausdorff Research Institute for Mathematics (HIM),
Bonn, Germany. The summer school is called “Spectral Methods in Algebra,
Geometry, and Topology” (September 19-23, 2022), and the two workshops are
“Spectral Methods in Equivariant Mathematics” (October 24-28, 2022) and
“Spectra, Triangles, and Higher Structures” (December 5-9, 2022). These events
are associated with the trimester program "Spectral Methods in Algebra,
Geometry, and Topology", founded on the observation that various areas of the
mathematical fields of algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, representation
theory, and algebra that have been historically regarded as separate and
distinct are now in fact united by overlapping problems, common goals, related
foundational questions, and similar techniques. The grant would provide training
and career development for students, postdoctoral researchers, and early career
faculty. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The program will cover a diverse mixture of
topics from algebra, geometry, and algebraic topology, centered around the theme
of studying and applying spectral techniques and tensor-triangular structure.
This includes traditional topics, such as classification problems in algebra or
computations in chromatic homotopy theory, but also emerging topics in motivic
homotopy theory and the interplay between infinity categories and representation
theory. Further information about workshops and the program in general can be
found at https://www.him.uni-bonn.de/programs/future-programs/future-trimester-
programs/spectral-methods/description/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
