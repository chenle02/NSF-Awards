9417992 Engel This project will focus on nucleation and growth on silicon
substrates of ultrathin dielectric films, to include silicon dioxide, silicon
nitride, and silicon oxynitride, at moderate to low temperatures using neutral
reactants at thermal and hyperthermal energies. Ultrathin oxides, nitrides, and
oxynitrides will be structurally characterized at the atomic and molecular level
using techniques that include scanning tunneling microscopy, Auger electron
spectroscopy, and temperature programmed desorption. %%% Understanding the
fundamental chemistry issues that control reactive film growth of silicon oxide,
silicon nitride, and silicon oxynitride on silicon substrates of commercial
importance is a very high priority within the electronics industry. Requirements
for ultrathin atomically abrupt gate oxides of high uniformity demand a clear
understanding of nucleation and growth on an atomic and molecular level at low
temperatures, as well as knowledge about the thermally induced stresses at the
interface. ***
