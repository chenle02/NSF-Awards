Funds are provided to analyze seven long cores recovered from the Bermuda Rise
in the North Atlantic Ocean, a key location where the physical and geochemical
properties of exported North Atlantic Deep Waters are set by mixing between the
northern and southern abyssal water masses. The research aims to create an
abyssal type section of deepwater circulation for the last glacial-interglacial
cycle. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research plan includes detailed stratigraphic
investigations of piston cores and the initial measurement of several first
order proxies of deep water circulation and surface water conditions for the
last 160,000 years. The collaborative work plan includes a suite of analyses
that include scanning x-ray analyses, radiocarbon and stable isotopic analysis,
trace and minor element analysis, Uranium series analyses, and compiling
Neodymium records from sediments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts
involve the education and training of graduate and undergraduate students, and a
high school student. Results from this research will be adapted for coursework
and lectures. The data will be archived and available for future
paleoceanographic and paleoclimate studies.&lt;br/&gt;
