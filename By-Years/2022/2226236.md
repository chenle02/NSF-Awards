The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a product designed to enable healthcare technicians to practice
spirometry testing with children. Respiratory therapists and pulmonologists
working with pediatric patients will gain an increased understanding of patient
progress and improve the accuracy of their diagnoses. This medical device may
also be used for geriatric populations as a complete spirometry test is often
required as part of both preoperative and postoperative medical protocols in in-
patient and out-patient medical facilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps
project is seeks to develop practical and convenient tools for respiratory
therapists and pulmonologists. Assessment of lung disorders and other
respiratory ailments often includes Pulmonary Function Testing (PFT) and the
most common type of PFT is spirometry. In order to complete spirometry testing,
the patient must be able to exhale for six seconds with no backflow of air. Many
children are unable to complete the test properly, so they are sent home with a
mouthpiece and nose-clip to practice. This practice method is ineffective
because there is no way to monitor the patient’s progress. The proposed
innovation allows parents to monitor the child’s learning progress and ensure
that the children are practicing correctly. The new technology is a hand-held
airflow monitoring device designed specifically for pediatric use. The device
consists of a small cylindrical tube with a mouthpiece and internal electronic
components that deliver audio and visual cues to the
user.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
