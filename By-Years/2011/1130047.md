In the 1960s the advent of plate tectonics revolutionized our understanding of
how the Earth works ? why earthquakes and volcanoes occur where they do, and
much about metal deposits, among other things. The primary force that moves
plates is known to be gravity tugging on plates where the plunge into the
Earth?s interior, but it has long been suspected that rising columns of mantle
material (mantle plumes) in the interior also affect plate motions. The
proponents of this proposal have uncovered evidence that that the plume that
gave rise to the Reunion hotspot in the Indian Ocean also produced forces that
affected the motions of India and Africa. This project takes a novel approach to
analyzing the history plate motions, particularly Africa, to assess the
influence of the plume. The principal broader impacts of this work will be a
better understanding of the forces that shape the Earth in general and the
tectonic evolution of Africa and southern Asia in particular.
