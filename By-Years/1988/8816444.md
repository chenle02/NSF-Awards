The prime objectives of this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research
project in earthquake engineering between Miha Tomazevic at Lubljana's Institute
for Testing and Research in Materials and Structures and James L. Noland,
Atkinson-Noland Associates are to: (1) develop a standardized testing procedure
to determine wind, earthquake resistence of masonry walls; and (2) a
mathematical analytical model for purpose of predicting the behavior of masonry
buildings subjected to earthquakes. By testing different kinds of masonry walls
in different countries, the investigators expect to develop an international
model that can be used in the earthquake analysis and design of masonry
buildings in the United States and European community. This project was approved
by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on Cooperation in Science and Technology and is
funded through a joint fund consisting of matching contributions from the U.S.
and Yugoslav governments. The U.S. contribution is provided annually by the
Department of State. No NSF funds are involved. Grants are made to the principal
Yugoslav institute. Dollar funds are included for U.S. scientist travel to
Yugoslavia and for Yugoslav scientists' living expenses in the U.S.
