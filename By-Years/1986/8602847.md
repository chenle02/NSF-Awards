The goal of this research is to develop a cost-effective robotic manufacturing
hand. The hand will be equipped with local sensing and be capable of coordinated
manipulation and control. This research has three work tasks: knowledge
representation, kinematics and control of manufacturing manipulation, and
construction of manufacturing hands and application on a machining center. The
knowledge representation work task is of the activities of an expert mchinist
and will be accomplished with photographs, videotapes, and at-machine interviews
with skilled machinists.
