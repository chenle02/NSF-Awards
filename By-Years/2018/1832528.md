The Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions
Program (HSI Program) aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build
capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new
knowledge about how to achieve these aims. This project at San Diego State
University will advance the aims of the HSI Program by transforming the pathways
taken by STEM undergraduate students. The project considers student mobility and
transitions between multiple institutions in its work to transform STEM degree
pathways. Specifically, this project will identify mechanisms of support for
students' transitions between two- and four-year colleges, in addition to the
multiple movements that might occur prior to this critical transition. This
study will provide information about strategies to help students, including
underrepresented minorities, to reach their STEM potential. This knowledge is
critical, given the large numbers of students from underrepresented groups who
are enrolled in community colleges and HSIs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall
aim of the proposed project is to examine STEM pathways for students who began
their postsecondary education at community colleges, with a specific emphasis on
student mobility across multiple institutions. The project will also investigate
the specific role of HSIs in these pathways. The research approach will be an
integrated mixed methods and multilayered approach using multiple membership
random effect modeling, social network analysis, and qualitative narratives,
with both regional and national data. This research approach enables a fine-
grained and nuanced examination of the barriers and opportunities in STEM for
students who may navigate STEM pathways across multiple institutions. This
project aims to: 1) identify STEM student mobility patterns and the links
between institutions, how these patterns and links affect students, and how they
differ across groups; 2) use advanced statistical techniques that account for
student mobility across colleges to examine the student characteristics, college
experiences, and institutional contexts that contribute to STEM outcomes; and 3)
qualitatively deepen and clarify results from this large scale data analysis,
and generate insights on the opportunities and challenges for system-wide
structures and partnerships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
