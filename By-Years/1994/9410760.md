9410760 Barron The goal of the project is the development and proof of
computationally feasible algorithms for training artificial neural networks that
provide accurate approximation, estimation, and classification for general
classes of functions in high dimensions. The analysis involves Markov chain
convergence theory, based on a decomposition of the neural net likelihood
function as a mixture of log-concave functions, and an information-theoretic
analysis of Bayes estimators of neural nets. Practical computer implementation
will also be investigated.
