This grant supports the research of Professors Brian Conrey and Amit Ghosh to
work in analytic number theory. Professors Conrey and Ghosh will study a broad
class of problems involving the analytic continuation of L-functions and their
growth. In particular, they will study both general problems about classifying
Dirichlet series and particular questions involving mean-value theorems for
specific L-functions of arithmetic interest. The field of analytic number theory
applies to the discrete realm of the whole numbers the techniques of analysis,
dependent on the notions of continuity and limit, originating in calculus. The
idea of using continuous methods to investigate the discrete is two centuries
old, but with the work of the modern analytic number theorists, the field has
had a new rebirth.
