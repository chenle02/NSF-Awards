9529630 Agosta This proposal describes a research plan to perform research and
development on a force magnetometer that will be useful for measuring the
magnetization of small novel materials. The device will be used on a silicon
chip with MEMs technology. The magnetometer will be useful in studying organic
superconductors where only small single crystals are available for analysis. The
magnetization is a fundamental property of the materials which can be related to
a physical theory which describes the superconducting or magnetic phases. The
results of this program may lead to a new class of superconductor/electronic
devices. ***
