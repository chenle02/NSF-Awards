9526375 Evans This grant provides partial funding for an upgrade to the
University of Washington's electron microprobe (EMP) in the Department of
Geological Sciences. Specifically, a PC-based computer automation system and new
electronics module would replace a no longer supported and unreliable NORAN
TN5500 computer and the TN5600 electronics which drive the sample stage and
wavelength dispersive spectrometers (WDS). This EMP represents an important
regional facility for geochemical analyses in petrologic research and the
replacement of a ten-year old computer system that is beyond repair and
currently poses operational efficiency problems is a cost effective way to add
useful years of life to an expensive piece of analytical instrumentation.
Upgrading of this EMP will allow continued and increased productivity for a
number of researchers for studies in geobarometry-thermometry, major element
geochemistry and thermodynamics of igneous and metamorphic minerals. ***
