TERC and ASTC will collaborate with thirteen science and technology centers
around the country to create and implement a professional development program
for science center staff. The goal of this project is to use exhibits and
educational programs as a vehicle for building a presence for mathematics in
science centers nationwide. The participating science centers will develop
mathematics initiatives while working with TERC and ASTC to create workshops on
topics such as data, measurement, algebra, national standards and visitor
accessibility. Start-up sites will create training networks in California,
Florida, Massachusetts, Missouri, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North
Carolina, Oregon and Texas. Workshops will be offered on-line and also at local
and national conferences. The project will produce a publication entitled
"Promising Math Practices in Science Centers" that will highlight best practices
for the incorporation of mathematics into museum programs. It is anticipated
that the number of participating institutions will increase to 120 during the
life of the project.
