This project connects the College of Micronesia to the Internet four dial-up
lines and 28,800 baud per second modems. This is an unusual connection method
necessitated by the extremely high cost of telephone service in Micronesia. The
connection will be upgraded when higher bandwidth service is available at
affordable rates. Faculty and students at the school benefit from access to the
resources of the Internet. In addition, they are able to communicate and
collaborate with colleagues at other institutions in pursuit of research and
educational projects. The award provides partial support of the project for two
years.
