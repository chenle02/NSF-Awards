Exploring creole studies from a linguistic and a pedagogical perspective, this
project advances our knowledge of the subject by offering a cohesive approach to
provide new theoretical and applied insights into language contact, language
documentation and language revitalization. In particular, it uses interviews
with native speakers to document the grammar of a vernacular variety spoken in
rural villages. The traditional variety is severely endangered, since only a few
hundred people possess a good degree of fluency in it. Among the goals of this
project is the creation of a grammar of the traditional
language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A detailed analysis of the language provides a
better understanding of grammatical phenomena that are not currently well
understood. From a theoretical perspective, this work provides new insights into
the nature of contact-driven restructuring across linguistic interfaces and
language domains. In addition, this study casts new light on the ongoing debate
regarding the origin of creole languages. This award is made as part of a
funding partnership between the National Science Foundation and the National
Endowment for the Humanities for the NSF Dynamic Language Infrastructure â€“ NEH
Documenting Endangered Languages Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
