This grant is for the renewal of a highly productive research program at
Marquette University (DMR-8701160), which resulted in several scientific papers
and graduate students in the area of thermodynamic properties of compound
semiconductor materials. In addition, undergraduate students were involved with
the research thereby attracting promising students to graduate careers in
science and engineering research and teaching. The research during this grant
period emphasizes experimental determination of chemical bond energies of the
substitutional acceptors, zinc and cadmium, in germanium, silicon, and mercury-
telluride. The partial pressure of zinc and cadmium over solid solutions in
silicon or germanium-containing acceptor dopants is being determined from the
optical absorbance of the vapor phase using hollow cathode lamps. The chemical
potential and partial molar enthalpy and entropy are determined from the data.
Likewise the same thermodynamic parameters are being determined for mercury and
cadmium zinc telluride. In addition to the research, the program has a
significant impact on the infrastructure by training students at both the
graduate and undergraduate levels in this critical science.
