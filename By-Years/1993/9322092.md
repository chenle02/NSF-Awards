9322092 HENSEL This anthropological research project seeks to explain the
processes of cross-cultural communication as exemplified by the interactions of
Yup'ik Eskimos and non-natives in Bethel, Alaska. The research has applications
in both practical and theoretical ways. It can increase our practical
understanding of how people learn to communicate in cross-cultural settings, and
also contribute an analysis of the theories of practice/structuration, of
relevance to anthropology and other social science disciplines. Research will be
conducted through formal and informal interviews, participant observation and
attendance at public meetings. ***
