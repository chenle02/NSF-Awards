Seaweeds are an extremely common and widespread assemblage of algal plants in
the central and western tropical Pacific Ocean, yet our knowledge of this
important marine resource is very limited. Despite their ecological importance,
the tropical seaweeds have been largely ignored in scientific and educational
studies because of difficulties identifying them to the level of species. Drs.
William Magruder and Isabella Abbott will write and illustrate a text for a
scholarly book that will provide a taxonomic analysis and permit easy
identification of the seaweeds of the Hawaiian Islands. The text will be written
using accurate, well-defined terms, and importantly, each of the estimated 480
species will be illustrated with half-tone photographs or line drawings of an
entire plant and its distinguishing characteristics. As the first comprehensive
systematic study of the brown, green, and red seaweeds of a tropical Pacific
Ocean Island group, this work will be an important contribution to scientific
knowledge and should prove widely useful. Because systematics provides the
foundation and framework of almost all biological research, the work will be a
major step in increasing our knowledge of marine algae and should serve to
stimulate and expedite their use in a variety of ecological and evolutionary
studies. Although dealing specifically with the seaweeds of the Hawaiian
Islands, this work will have broader application because many of the species
found in Hawaii are also considered to be present in the tens of thousands of
other islands in the central and western tropical Pacific Ocean.
