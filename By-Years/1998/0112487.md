Computer Scientists have been challenged by the existence of remarkable
algorithms that work well in practice, but whose theoretical analyses suggest
that these algorithms should perform poorly or are inconclusive. The root of
this problem is that traditional theoretical analyses measure the performance of
algorithms on their worst inputs. This research analyzes the performance of
algorithms using smoothed analysis, a new measure of the performance of
algorithms that can better predict practical performance. Using smoothed
analysis, this research aims to explain the good practical performance of some
algorithms that are famous for outperforming pessimistic worst-case analyses.

In particular, algorithms that take real or complex inputs, such as those that
usually occur in scientific and engineering applications, are examined under
random perturbations of their worst-case inputs. The most famous of these, the
simplex method for linear programming, was the subject of the paper introducing
smoothed analysis. Yet, this work only investigated one rarely-used pivot rule.
This research attempts smoothed analyses of the simplex method under more
commonly used pivot rules. It also considers smoothed analyses of interior point
methods and algorithms for convex programming. An attempt is being made to
extend this analysis to algorithms that take discrete inputs.
