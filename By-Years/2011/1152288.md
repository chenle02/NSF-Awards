Speech enhancement and speaker recognition are, in principle, related tasks.
Knowledge of the speaker can allow for better speech enhancement, while speech
with less interference improves the ability to recognize the speaker.
Statistical models for these two tasks can be coupled to yield a principled
approach to performing both jointly, however the complexity of exact inference
in the resulting statistical model, which must straddle a nonlinear feature
calculation, is prohibitive. For this reason, approximate inference techniques
that sacrifice some performance of exact inference for lower complexity are of
interest. This Early Grant for Exploratory Research brings Gibbs sampling
approximate inference techniques to bear on joint speech enhancement and speaker
recognition for the sake of comparison with several variational approximate
inference techniques. The ultimate aim of the research is to partition the
attainable complexity and performance space into different regimes dictating
which techniques should be used and the performance attainable as a function of
complexity. To obtain this partitioning, a thorough empirical evaluation on
several large speech corpora will be carried out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Speech
enhancement and speaker recognition technology finds multiple uses in defense,
commercial, and medical technologies. Multiple technologies would benefit from
performance improvement in speech enhancement and speaker recognition brought
about by successfully integrating these two interdependent tasks. Potential
applications include dialogue systems for controlling e.g. television sets using
distant microphones where additive noise is a significant source of distortion.
Additionally, speech enhancement is useful for hearing aids. Speaker dependent
prior information gains the ability to improve the intelligibility of speech in
these devises.
