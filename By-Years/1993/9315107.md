9315107 Hrivnak While most phases in the evolution of low and medium mass stars
are well documented, the transition from red giants to planetary nebulae remains
poorly observed. This results from the briefness of this stage, the fact that
the stars are often obscured in dust and the difficulty of identifying such
objects. Fifty-five candidates have now been identified and will be observed to
verify their status and determine their properties.
