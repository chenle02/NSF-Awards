This grant supports development of a portable x-ray energy spectrometer
consisting of a cryogenic cooler and hyperpure Si detector. The cooling unit
weighs less than 10 kg complete with a one week supply of cryogen, is self
regulating in cryogen consumption to provide rapid cool down or response to
transient demands while maintaining minimum consumption during steady state
operation, requires no electrical power, and has no critical moving parts which
could pose reliability or maintenance problems. The liquid carbon dioxide used
for the expansion cycle can provide an operating temperature below minus 75
Celsius and should have an essentially infinite shelf life. The project will
concentrate on improving the design of the cooler, development of a hyperpure Si
detector, and development of a complete detector/cooler prototype portable x-ray
spectrometer. It is expected that this development will open the door to a large
market for a new generation of highly portable, rugged, and economical low noise
x-ray, nuclear, optical, and infrared detector systems which can be stored
indefinitely and then restarted quickly.
