The proposed project is intended to provide early research experience and other
university associations to academically qualified African American, Hispanic,
and Native American students to encourage their participation in professional
careers in the physical and mathematical sciences, especially through attainment
of advanced degrees. The research experience will be provided in faculty
laboratories where research in areas of astronomy, chemistry, geology,
mathematics (including computer science), and physics is being performed. The
program is designed to provide continuous (academic year, ten hours per week;
summer, 40 hours per week for eight weeks) research and faculty mentor exposure
through the students' junior and senior year and possibly the first year of a
graduate program. This project design permits continued contact and
reinforcement of degree and career objectives for the student. Both summer and
academic year (AY) activities will include weekly (summer) and biweekly (AY)
interactive colloquia that will include student reports of their research
activities to the group and discussions of topics of broad application, such as
career objectives, ethics in science, and computer applications to science
problem solving. Career perspectives and student social interactions will be
enhanced by including (AY colloquia) students of the "Minority Access to Energy-
Related Careers" program, in which student summer research is conducted in DOE
laboratories in the western states.
