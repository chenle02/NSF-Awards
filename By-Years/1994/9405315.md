9405315 Margaziotis A study of few nucleon systems using electron-induced
knockout reactions will be carried out at MIT-Bates and CEBAF. The work at MIT
includes new studies of the out-of-plane behavior of the reaction. The CEBAF
effort will be concentrated at the Hall A facility, and a high power cryogenic
target is being constructed by CSULA for use in the experiments there. ***
