This award will support the conduct of a workshop focused on identifying and
evaluating the scientific basis for neuroscience-based learning interventions.
The workshop will bring together leading researchers who are working at the
intersection of neuro-, cognitive, and educational sciences to address questions
pertaining to the theoretical, empirical and methodological bases of
interventions and technologies that purport to enhance learning and memory. The
workshop will take place in Washington, D.C., in January
2015.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the workshop are to (a) identify the
current state of effective learning interventions and technologies; (b) discuss
methodological and statistical challenges that have impeded scientific work in
this area and propose solutions to these challenges; and (c) discuss ways of
effectively and accurately communicating the scientific literature on
neuroscience-based interventions to the broader public. A summary report will be
produced that details the products of the discussion and that highlights
prospects identified for evidence-based learning techniques based on
neuroscientific principles.
