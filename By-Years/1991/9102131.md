We request the circular dichroism spectrometer 62DS of Aviv Associates, equipped
with a sample temperature regulator, a stopped flow sample mixing system and
light scattering correction system. The major users of this instrument are
faculty at the University of Minnesota (Twin Cities Campus) in the departments
of Biochemistry and Chemistry. The primary research interests of this group of
faculty are protein and peptide structure, ligand binding and dynamics. A
reliable CD spectrometer is essential to all of the major users. This instrument
will be important in training postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate students
in the labs of the major users. In addition, it will be used in training
minority students at the undergraduate and high school level who participate in
the various laboratory research programs of the home administrative unit of the
major users, the College of Biological Sciences.
