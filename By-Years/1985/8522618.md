The Advanced Combustion Engineering Research Center is a joint venture between
the Brigham Young University (BYU) and the University of Utah. The Center will
develop and transfer fundamental engineering knowledge and tools aimed at the
solution of critical national combustion problems, with initial emphasis on
utilizing low cost fossil energy resources and alleviating their associated
environmental problems. The research will increase the fundamental knowledge
base which can now be enhances with new types of diagnostic instrumentation
interacting with new computational resources. The educational objectives are
integrated with the research plan. Undergraduate options in fuels and energy
utilization within the Chemical Engineering Departments at both universities are
planned plus a formal graduate minor in combustion engineering offered within
the Chemical Engineering Department at BYU. New courses will be developed. A
continuing education program will be part of the education program.
Undergraduates will actively participate in the Center.
