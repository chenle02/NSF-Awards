The equipment acquired by this award will be used in the User Studies Laboratory
at Carnegie Mellon University for Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) studies. The
equipment consists of video equipment for recording actions of users, editing
equipment for annotating these actions, and a computer with large disk store for
storing video images and for processing data. The research projects using the
equipment include testing models of HCI, studies of spoken and multi-modal
computer interfaces, and computer tutoring. The use of computers is ubiquitous
both in the workplace and in schools. An important aspect of the use of
computers is the human/computer interface; the means by which computers and
humans exchange information. The design of good interfaces is more of an art
form than a science. The researchers at the User Studies Laboratory at Carnegie
Mellon University will use this Instrumentation award to purchase equipment
essential to their research. This equipment will enable them to study, in great
detail, how users interact with computers. It will enable them to test theories
of what makes a good interface and will also enable them to study students using
the computer for learning purposes.
