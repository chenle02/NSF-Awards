9422568 Tang This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project
develops a thickness monitoring and control technology for chemical mechanical
polishing (CMP) of semiconductor thin films. Phase I established a baseline
capability in this new non-contact, real-time, in-situ monitoring technique.
Phase II further develops a practical system utilizing a dedicated monitoring
region at a wafer center. The approach is one of continuous interferometric
monitoring of film thickness from back of the wafer. An industrial partner, R.
Howard Strasbaugh, Inc. of San Luis Obispo, CA, is supporting Phase II with in-
kind services and use of facilities. The technology is expected to find
commercial application in CMP operations in the semiconductor industry. It can
alleviate depth-of-focus problems and other problems encountered in multi-level
metallization designs.
