This Phase II Small Business Innovation Research project is to develop an
integrated optical and electrical packaging technique that allows for the
precision placement of high density, large arrays of VCSELs, LEDs, or
photodetectors coupled with arrays of microlenses. The project extends the
limits of integration for device to device pitch, and device counts, of VCSELs
and microlenses that have not previously been achieved.

This innovation has immediate application to existing computed radiography,
scanning and printing applications. The computed radiography market is $1B
annually, and is shared by U.S. and Japanese companies. The proposed innovation
enables smaller, more reliable and higher resolution systems. In the long run,
the application of precision optical assembly techniques may have an impact on
the revolution taking place in chemical, biological and medical analytical
instrument and sensing devices.
