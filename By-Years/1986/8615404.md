This grant provides funding to facilitate a meeting of the U.S. University
Council for Geotechnical Engineering Research. The purpose of the meeting is to
exchange research ideas and discuss a coordinated research approach on important
and complex geomechanic research issues. The past decade has seen a large growth
in the number of institutions performing geotechnical engineering research.
Significant research investigations in geotechnical engineering are now underway
in several institutions. Many common problems are being experienced by these
institutions in addressing the technical issues. The meeting will provide a
forum for a coordinated discussion of the methods of approach in geotechnical
engineering research. The investigator is one of the leaders in the council and
is a recognized expert in geotechnical engineering research. A grant is
recommended.
