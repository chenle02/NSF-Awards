With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Regen will study the
characterization of amphiphilic ion pairs, i.e., novel vesicle-forming materials
derived from single-chain cations and single-chain anions, via careful
examination of molecular structure-supramolecular structure/property
relationships. His study focuses upon examination of the following structural
variables: (i) alkyl chain length, (ii) chain length mismatch, (iii) head group
size, and (iv) double- vs. triple-chain ion-paired amphiphiles (IPAs). %%% The
primary objective of Dr. Regen's research program is to prepare new and improved
models for biological membranes. Ion-paired amphiphiles (IPAs) are of interest
in this connection due to their ability to function as vesicle-forming
surfactants. Dr. Regen's study seeks to define experimentally those structural
features of single-chain surfactants which are important in controlling vesicle
formation, monolayer packing, and bilayer permeability. As an offshoot of this
study, Dr. Regen plans to explore the feasibility of using IPA-based membranes
as chemical sensors and as actuators. Thus, several of the IPAs to be
synthesized may find application as a new class of chemical devices.
