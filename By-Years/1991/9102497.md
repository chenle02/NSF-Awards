Visualization provides an efficient and powerful means of comprehending complex
numeric data. This project investigates approaches to visualization of sampled
volumetric data, such as that produced by computational fluid dynamics,
tomography, and molecular simulations, particularly those volumes where the
samples are irregularly distributed in space. Two common methods for
visualization are: 1) to extract features of interest (such as isosurfaces); and
2) to image the while volume as a continuous semi-transparent medium. Most
present approaches to visualization are designed for regular rectilinear grids.
This project will extend and generalize these approaches to visualization of
data in the less regular formats which are found in many applications. The two
main approaches will be: 1) to extend existing algorithms to irregular volumes;
and 2) to resample the irregular volumes to hierarchical regular volumes.
Another aspect of this research is to carefully compare different approaches to
certain aspects of visualization, particularly, the "resampling" (interpolation)
of 3D data, the mapping from numeric data to visual parameters such as color and
transparency, and methods of efficient volume traversal.
