A major problem with introductory science courses is that students are often
turned off by the experience. This failure to capture the interest and stimulate
learning is partly related to the one-way communication style of lectures and
the isolation of laboratories from the content of the course. These factors
contribute to a weak development of intellectual skills and understanding of the
content. The department is addressing these problems by integrating the lecture
and laboratory portions of the introductory psychology course. Students are
actively exploring concepts, experimental procedures, and simulations using
multimedia computers. Students are also conducting experiments using computers
interfaced with physiological recording equipment. This approach is benefitting
students majoring in psychology, psychobiology, education, and a broad range of
non-science areas. The methods of this course should encourage students to
consider scientific careers. *
