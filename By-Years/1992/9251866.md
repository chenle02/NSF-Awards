As part of the transition from a quarter to a semester calendar system the
Physics Department has designed and is implementing a new course in experimental
physics for incoming students who are seriously interested in physics. The
purpose of the course is to excite students about experimental science and help
them develop an understanding of how experiments are designed, assembled and
carried out. The course may attract and retain more physics majors. The
experiments are based on a relatively limited number of topics which can be
investigated experimentally with a minimum of theoretical background. Initial
experiments include: 1) the geometrical optics of a telescope; 2) construction
and properties of vacuum systems; 3) thermal cooling in a vacuum; and 4)
production of thin metallic films and measurement of their electrical
resistivity. As the course develops new experiments will be added including
simple analogue and digital electronics and the use of analogue and digital
methods to measure the output of an electrical sensor. Wherever possible special
emphasis is being placed on how computers can be used to take, analyze and
simulate data. The laboratories are open ended with emphasis on the acquisition
of experimental skills and knowledge.
