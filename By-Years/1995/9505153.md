9505153 Martin Martin will work in set theory and descriptive set theory,
especially determinacy hypotheses, and his first goal is to complete his long-
awaited research monograph on proofs of determinacy from large cardinal axioms.
Steel will also work generally in set theory and descriptive set theory, and
more specifically on the construction and study of canonical, inner models of
ZFC that satisfy specified large cardinal or determinacy assumptions.
Moschovakis will work on fixpoint recursion and its applications to the theory
of computation, including the mathematical modeling of recursive algorithms, the
logic of recursive definitions, and the construction of canonical solutions for
recursive equations in non-deterministic and concurrent settings. The Principal
Investigators of this Grant have been among the key contributors to the
reshaping of the classical, set-theoretic foundations of mathematics during the
last twenty-five years, with the introduction and study of new hypotheses about
sets that have made it possible to solve many long-standing, open problems about
the real numbers. Martin and Steel will continue working on this fundamental
program, seeking to extend it and to delineate its limitations. Moschovakis
changed interests about ten years ago, and his current research program aims to
provide a rigorous, mathematical foundation for computer science. One of the
main, ultimate aims of his work is to construct a "logic of programs" that will
be useful in the development and verification of computing systems. ***
