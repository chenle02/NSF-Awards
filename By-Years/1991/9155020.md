The University of Chicago will initiate a four-week, commuter Young Scholars
project in Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science which will offer science
enrichment activities for 105 precollege students entering grades 7-12. This
program will emphasize research participation in mathematics. The mathematical
focus will be on number theory, with the content and sophistication varying
according to the grade level of the participants. At the high school level there
will be additional work in chaos and computers at the 9-10 grade level;
probability and statistics will be added at the 11-12 grade level. Students will
be provided with a rich and diverse experience in mathematics, physics and
computer science.
