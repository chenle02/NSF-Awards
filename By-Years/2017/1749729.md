This study seeks to quantify the impact of a changing climate on severe
thunderstorms over the eastern U.S. coastal region with emphasis on squall
lines. This study has the potential to advance our knowledge and understanding
of impactful natural hazards to society. While thunderstorms in the northeast
may not be as strong, or as damaging, as storms over the central Great Plains of
the U.S., the population density of the northeastern U.S. creates a condition
for greater societal impact from these severe storms. In addition to the
training of undergraduate and graduate students, the planned research includes a
component of public outreach and education on role of statistical probability in
weather forecasts and future climate simulations; as well as the potential
societal impacts resulting from natural hazards such as severe thunderstorms.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Global circulation models (GCMs) project an increase in
U.S. summertime severe storm activity, maximized over the coastal Northeast and
Mid-Atlantic. Presently, coastal squall lines account for roughly a third of all
severe weather over the coastal Northeast. Their structure, lifecycle, and local
hazards will respond to climatic atmospheric and oceanic changes, with
sensitivity to factors including atmospheric instability, coastal sea surface
temperature, and the coastal marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL). This
research will combine existing climate scenario data, downscaled for mesoscale
simulations, and ensemble modeling techniques to improve our understanding of
the impact of severe thunderstorms in the northeastern U.S. in a warming
climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
