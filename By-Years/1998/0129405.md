Much scientific effort has been expended in measuring CO2 exchanges between
vegetation and the atmosphere in an attempt to determine the role of terrestrial
ecosystems in the global carbon budget. Most prior efforts have focused on
mature forests. However, these may not be representative of the overall
landscape mosaic, since most forested landscapes are disturbed by humans,
dominated by stands of varying ages, and subject to multiple edge influences.
This project uses a spatial modeling approach, supplemented and evaluated with
direct field measurements of ecosystem carbon exchange, to understand landscape-
level carbon flux, taking into consideration age structure and edge influences.
Such a broad-scale endeavor must rely heavily on models and remote sensing
techniques because of the practical impossibility of obtaining enough direct
flux measurements. This project is among the first to provide strong
quantitative information concerning carbon exchange at the landscape level, yet
based on ecosystem-level process measurements.
