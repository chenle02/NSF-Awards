AST 95-29154 PI: Edmund Bertschinger Cosmological Dynamics and Gravitational
Lensing This proposal requests funding for several theoretical projects
involving dynamics in cosmology. The aims are to develop analytical methods for
describing nonlinear gravitational instability and gravitational lensing and to
investigate observational consequences of these phenomena. The evolution of
correlation functions and the matter distribution within virialized objects will
be studied analytically and with numerical models. Local Lagrangian
approximations to weakly nonlinear evolution will be further tested and applied.
Gravitational lensing theory using Hamiltonian dynamics will be further
developed and applied to multiple weak lensing by structures in the universe.
Lensing studies will focus on quadruple lenses as possible indicators of the
enhancement and modification of primary lens effects.
