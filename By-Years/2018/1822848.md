The production of computer chips has universally moved offshore in recent years,
reducing design complexity and fabrication cost. But these benefits come at the
expense of security: An attack anywhere along the supply chain can insert
malicious components into an integrated circuit, pirate its design or
counterfeit it. These attacks, which are exceedingly difficult to detect,
jeopardize the computer industry, undermine national security, and put critical
infrastructure in danger. More than a decade of research in hardware security
has resulted in a plethora of solutions for these problems, but many of these
solutions address specific attack models and, hence, are not universally
applicable. This project breaks this barrier by developing hardware design
approaches that are both provably secure and applicable across the entire
hardware industry for differing businesses and threat models. To engage and
teach the next generation of cybersecurity experts, the project uses puzzle-,
challenge-, and competition-based educational and outreach activities at the
high-school, undergraduate, and graduate levels.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The
project has three components. First, the research develops a secure synthesis
approach to prevent piracy and reverse engineering using provably-secure
camouflaging and logic encryption, where the attacker is provided with only
partial knowledge of the design to obfuscate the design intent. Second, the
research analyzes the security implications of untrusted test facilities by
demonstrating an attack to compromise secrets through test data. It develops a
provably-secure test pattern generation technique for testing chips with
secrets. Third, this project designs chips such that any (malicious) alterations
and counterfeits are provably-detected by existing techniques.
