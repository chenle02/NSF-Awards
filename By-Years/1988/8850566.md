The primary objective of this project is to produce prototypical materials which
will better enable students to link the mathematical operations of arithmetic
with their applications. The target audience for the materials tryout will be
average and below average middle school students, and in some cases adapted and
given to younger or more able students as well. A secondary objective will be to
explore means of involving natural settings, rather than the traditional "story"
problems, in the lessons. The rationale for this project is based on recent
research which suggests that many middle school students approach mathematical
story problems, the most common school form of applications of the arithmetic
operations, with strategies that are not based on possible meanings for the
operations. Although some of these strategies may give success on many one-step
story problems with whole numbers, their use with multi-step problems involving
fractions or decimals is unlikely to give correct solutions. This project will
develop and field test with middle school students, materials to give a greater
emphasis to meanings for the operations. The outcome from the materials should
provide improvement in the students' approaches to applications of the
operations, both in school and in natural settings. Teachers, supervisors,
publishers, psychologists, and subject-matter experts will be called on to help
insure that the materials have maximum usability. Dissemination plans include
distribution of the materials to text publishers, to give them prototypes and
research support for such lessons in their textbooks.
