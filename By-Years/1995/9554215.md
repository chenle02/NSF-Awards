Parl 95-54215 This program will demonstrate high speed Internet access for rural
areas using a new low-cost and flexible Over-the-Horizon (OTH) microwave radio
technology. The most remote area of Vermont, known as the North East Kingdom
(NEK), has been chosen for this demonstration. NEK schools are highly motivated
to cooperate on a joint effort to implement Vermont's state education programs.
However, with a few exceptions, they have ineffective means of computer
communications and share a common isolation due to prohibitive long distance
dialing costs. The goals of this program are: (1) to demonstrate that the
technology is cost effective for interconnecting LANs and for providing remote
access to the Internet and (2) to show that such cost effective connectivity in
a rural area can promote a sustainable increase in collaboration between the
schools and can stimulate student learning through access to the National
Information Infrastructure (NII) via high quality network and Internet
connections. The program consists of a one year planning and training phase, a
one year operational evaluation phase, and a six month continued operational and
evaluation/assessment phase. The technology proposed builds on recent advances
in low-cost OTH radio links made by Signatron and is based on the military and
commercial radio modems developed in the past. Some of the new advances were
made in SBIR contracts from the NSF and the U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA). The proposed radio network will complement local infrastructure grants
from major computer corporations and will provide some of the infrastructure
called for by current VISMT research and planning programs. Connections from
school LANs to an Internet service provider are planned using fractional Tl (256
kb/s per school) with Internet access at Tl (1,544 kb/s). These rates are high
enough for hundreds of users, can even provide images and video conferencing,
and can be expanded with increased demand. A cost comparison with leased line s
for the 8 schools shows that the radio network investment is paid in only 20
months and that it will be 775~o less expensive to sustain than a similar
network based on leased lines. Volume manufacturing can further reduce radio
network costs. The math and science education program will be planned and
executed by VISMT. The results will be evaluated by WM/CRS and the Vermont
Department of Education against SSI goals. UVM/CRS, aided by Americorps
volunteers, will also explore extending the network to libraries, municipal
offices, and local business. Upon completion, local sustainability will be
assessed by WM/CRS and the nation wide applications of this technology will be
independently assessed by a recognized expert in education networking.
