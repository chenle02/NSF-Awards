9303215 Schmid The research entails an investigation into classes of anomalies
arising in quantum field and string theory. The intended classification of the
underlying principles, employing a variety of techniques drawn from global
analysis and topology is hoped to shed new light on a number of perplexing
questions studied in modern physics.
