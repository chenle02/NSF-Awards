Dr. White will examine collections of Upper Paleolithic objects housed in
museums in Europe and Russia. In particular, he will focus on stone, bone and
ivory beads and pendants which served as body ornaments. Objects will be drawn
and photographed, and their form and method of manufacture described. Many of
these materials are undescribed, and this is the first time that such ornaments
will be treated as a discrete set of data and analyzed as such. With this
information, it will be possible to examine the question of ethnic
differentiation across this wide geographical area and determine the extent to
which discrete cultural boundaries, which characterize all modern groups,
existed at this early date. What makes these collections important is that they
are associated with the earliest anatomically modern humans to appear in Europe
and the first to engage in artistic practices. Today, art is a universal trait,
a hallmark of modern human societies. Extremely little is known about early
Upper Paleolithic cultural practices and social organization, and this project
will add significantly to our limited store of information. This research is
important because it will increase our understanding of the origins of human
culture. It is also valuable because it will make use of an underutilized
resource. The materials from many of these sites have never been properly
analyzed and published. Today these valuable data, often obtained at great cost,
are ignored. Through Dr. White's work, the potential of these materials will be
realized.
