Scalable shared-memory machines are a promising way of attaining large-scale
multiprocessing without surrendering much programmability. Achieving high
performance from these machines, however, is challenging because many complex
architecture and architecture-software implementation issues that have been only
partially studied considerably impact the performance of the machines. The
objective of this research is to contribute in three areas to help make shared-
memory multiprocessors the preferred source of computing power. The three
thrusts of this project are to: study the optimal division of responsibilities
among the hardware, compiler, and operating system to maintain cache coherence
in scalable share-memory multiprocessors; design algorithms and hardware to
effectively support multiprogramming of parallel programs in scalable shared-
memory multiprocessors; and optimize the management of memory hierarchies and
the interaction of the operating system with the architecture.
