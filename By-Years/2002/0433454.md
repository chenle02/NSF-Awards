The Kodiak Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) is an international
project of scientific radars used for studies of the high-latitude auroral
environment. The radar detects echoes from irregularities of the ionospheric
plasma, which are generated in abundance in the high-latitude regions. These
plasma irregularities also scatter the signals of other radars and interfere
with their normal operation. Auroral clutter is a major problem in high-latitude
regions. This project would lead to the installation of direct digital
synthesizers on each element of the radar transmitters. This will enable the
formation and transmission of a beam pattern that can be designed to suit either
experimental aims or environmental conditions. The experiments will determine
whether or not it is possible to mitigate the effect of the auroral plasma on
radar reception, as well as enable the discrimination of signals different from
the background ionospheric scatter. &lt;br/&gt;
