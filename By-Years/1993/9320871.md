9320871 Charlson This research project is developing a methodology for in situ
measurements of the climatically important optical concerned with properties
which can then be applied to regionally representative sites in order to provide
relevant parameters for global climate models. Our goals to characterize
measurement uncertainties and to study the sources of variation in the measured
parameters by intensive, observational campaigns. Aerosol optical properties
will be both measured directly and predicated by Mie theory form measurements of
aerosol size distribution and size-resolved chemistry. Convergence of these two
approaches is required to validate the present understanding of aerosol optics
and assess the accuracy of various simplifying assumptions required by the Mie
calculation. Four specific tasks will be to quantify and reduce the
uncertainties that presently exist in the climatically important optical
properties of tropospheric aerosols; (1) develop a measurement and data analysis
methodology, (2) demonstrate closure of an extended measurement set at a well-
characterized, minimally- polluted marine site (Cheeka Peak), (3) demonstrate
closure at different representative sites (clean and polluted marine, clean and
polluted continental), and (4) deliver aerosol optical parameters to measurement
and modelling communities.
