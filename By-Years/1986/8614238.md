This research addresses two high-priority areas in construction utomation:
monitoring equipment safety, and real-time sensing to implement analytical
methods for optimization of production operations. It will explore real-time
instrumentation and automated data collection using electronic sensor and
computer technologies, and enhance their capabilities through data analysis by
rule-based decision logic. It will focus on two experiments, then generalize to
provide guidance for the successful instrumentation of field operations in a
much broader range of applications.
