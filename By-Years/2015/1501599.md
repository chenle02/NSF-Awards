As the Internet grows, the need for skilled workers to create digital content
for different types of venues and applications also grows. This generates a
demand for educating both students and faculty about changes in programming,
interface design, and mobile application development to respond to a
demonstrated need in Illinois and Chicago and its surrounding counties for
trained professionals in the mobile design application field.

The Interface Design and Development for Mobile Devices project will develop
curriculum and educational materials for new certificates and degree programs at
McHenry County College. The goals of the project are to 1) prepare incoming
students and incumbent workers in the field of mobile development and design to
address the problem of the shortage of skilled technicians in the field; and 2)
provide professional development on mobile interface design, usability, and
marketing to the educational community. Computers and digital media faculty will
seek training and use their expertise in developing a new, innovative program
with strong intellectual merit in the emerging field of interface design and
development for mobile devices. The broader impact includes meeting business and
industry needs, resulting in a more highly trained workforce and helping to fill
the demand for trained technicians in interface design and mobile applications
development. By offering beginning programming classes as dual credit in
partnership with area high schools, McHenry County College will strengthen the
pipeline of trained individuals in an emerging field. Students completing the
program will earn certificates or a degree in interface design and development
for mobile devices, preparing them for employment. In addition to developing a
website on which newly developed teaching materials and videos can be accessed
by other colleges, this project will be disseminated through
TeachingTechnicians.org and conference presentations. Faculty will coordinate
with colleagues to evaluate and share the curriculum, increasing the broader
impact of the project.
