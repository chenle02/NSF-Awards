Geologists are using personal computers in all phases of work in both academic
and industrial applications. It is imperative that undergraduate students be
exposed to many computer-oriented applications in order to have a smooth
transition to graduate school or the work place in a more professional,
efficient, and less stressful manner. The use of portable computer equipment in
geology field camp, a required undergraduate course in an unique environment
(full time work with real problems), is an ideal educational opportunity. The
following applications are being initiated: stratigraphic analysis, structural
analysis using stereo nets, computer-generated contour maps (use and pitfalls),
geological map and cross section preparation, and graphical illustrations and
geological report writing. In addition, the portable nature of the hardware
allows use of this equipment in mineralogy, petrology, economic, structure,
hydrology, and geophysics labs during the rest of the year. This allows students
to solve geological problems without leaving the lab and the instructor in order
to go to computer cluster locations. Overall, the enhancement not only allows
for quicker and more professional products, but most importantly, old exercises
are updated to a new level of modern geology and geological analysis.
