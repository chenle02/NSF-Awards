9725080 Nightingale This senior PI is well recognized for his highly innovative
numerical work in a wide variety of problems in statistical mechanics. In this
renewal grant, he is being supported to devise sophisticated algorithms and to
calculate eigenvalues using quantum Monte Carlo methods. The specific
applications of these calculations, in statistical mechanics are in the general
area of dynamic critical phenomena, especially the universal properties. In
quantum mechanics, the applications are to a calculation of properties of ground
state and also excited states of both bosonic and fermionic van der Waals
clusters. %%% This renewal grant supports the work of a senior PI well known for
his innovative numerical work on a large number of problems in statistical
mechanics and in quantum mechanics. The work here contains solutions to specific
problems in both statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics, as well as
development of sophisticated and complex computational algorithms. ***
