This research investigates the relationship between institutions (e.g., formal
laws and community norms) and compliance in the context of organic farming in
the United States. The project focuses on how policy designs and individual and
socially derived motivations such as attitudes, social norms and habits, and
individual capacity influence decision making regarding compliance. The case
study is organic farming, the fastest growing food industry over the past decade
in the United States. The organic farming industry faces growing pains as it
seeks to provide and maintain a standardized certification process that instills
consumer confidence and protects the integrity of its processes for the benefit
of human health.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The study applies the Institutional
Analysis and Development Framework, and the Institutional Grammar Tool to
analyze organic farming policies, including organic crop and livestock/dairy
farm certifications, comparatively across six states. The investigators use data
gathered from interviews and questionnaires given to organic farmers and
regulators to compare policy designs with actual behaviors as well as to
principles of organic farming as identified by the International Federation of
Organic Agriculture Movements. The investigators compare compliance in organic
farms in six states to fish farms in three states previously studied by the
investigators. This study will contribute to understanding how to strengthen the
alignment between policy designs and actual behaviors.
