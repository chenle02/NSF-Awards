DMS-9707768 The Department of Statistics at the Carnegie Mellon University will
purchase computer equipment which will be dedicated to the support of research
in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for several research
projects in mathematics, including in particular: Exploratory analysisof massive
data sets Fault Diagnosis in VLSI Manufacture Disclosure Avoidance and Intruder
Modeling for Census-Like data Comparative Analysis of Functional Magnetic
Resonance Imaging Data Sets
