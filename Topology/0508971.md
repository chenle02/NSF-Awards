The PI seeks to understand the algorithmic structure of three-manifolds. To be
precise: the PI will work on the Heegaard genus problem and will attack the
question of computing the Hempel distance of a Heegaard diagram. Both questions
are difficult due to their connections to the Poincare Conjecture and the three-
sphere recognition problem. There are several existing tools which spring to
mind: on the one hand Haken and Rubinstein's combinatorial theory of normal and
almost normal surfaces while on the other hand there are ideas from the theory
of Kleinian groups, involving the curve complex.

To give the flavor of the algorithmic problems involved consider the following
"toy" version: your garden hose, lying on the lawn, is very tangled. You must
untangle it before putting it away. Is there a mechanical procedure (to program
into your robot butler) which will untangle the hose regardless of its starting
position? How fast is the procedure? If the neighbor's child screws the ends of
the hose together can your butler at least manage to straighten the hose into a
circle? Can the butler finish faster if the hose is shorter? How much faster?
