Hostility between supporters of the two major political parties in the United
States has increased considerably during the last decades. It is now at a level
where supporters of one political party often prefer to avoid interactions with
supporters of the other. Such hostility can have negative effects on society
when it undermines solutions to important problems that require bi-partisan
support and collaborative decision-making. This project develops a theoretical
model that focuses on moral judgments as a way to explain the origin and
dynamics of such of inter-party hostility. The model aims to better understand
the factors that contribute to hostility between supporters of the two political
parties, and how such hostility can be reduced.

Nine studies address four related questions: (1) How accurate or inaccurate are
partisans in guessing the actual moral judgments made by others? (2) What
factors make partisans think that supporters of their own political group are
morally superior to supporters of the other group? (3) What are the effects of
such presumed moral superiority? (4) Can partisan divides be overcome by
ameliorating the presumed moral superiority of oneâ€™s own political group? A
mathematical modeling approach is used to separate three distinct aspects of
actual and presumed responses in moral dilemmas. Students are also trained in
these methods, acquiring advanced skills in data analysis and the use of
multinomial processing tree modeling. The research provides insight into how
polarization in the United States could be reduced and how obstacles to
bipartisan decision-making might be mitigated.
