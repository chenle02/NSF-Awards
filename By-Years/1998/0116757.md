This award to Louisiana State University and Agricultural &amp; Mechanical
College (LSU) is from the Major Research Instrumentation program and the
NSF/EPSCoR program. The award supports the acquisition of a combination Auger
(AES) scanning Auger microscopy (SAM) and high resolution X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (ESCA) surface analysis system. This state of the art system will
enable high-resolution energy, depth and spatial characterization of a variety
of novel thin-film/surface materials at levels that are currently unavailable at
the institution. The instrument will be combined with exiting instrumentation
and will constitute the nucleus of a centralized campus-wide Materials
Characterization Facility. The facility will be accessible to scientists and
students from Southern University, and will support several federally funded
projects. It will enhance substantially the infrastructure in and impact the
visibility and competitiveness of LSU and Southern University.
