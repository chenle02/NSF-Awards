0204308&lt;br/&gt;Hislop&lt;br/&gt;This award supports graduate students from US
universities to participate in a special program on partial differential
equations and spectral theory at the Mittag-Leffler Institute in Djursholm,
Sweden. The workshop will provide a unique opportunity for young mathematicians
to develop collaborations with their counterparts from Sweden, as well as with
leaders in the field from all of Scandinavia. The theme of the program is the
interaction between partial differential equations and spectral theory, and
applications to microlocal analysis and Schrodinger operators. The Mittag-
Leffler Institute is a world-renowned mathematics research institute located
near Stockholm. The Institute has a research building with offices, conference
room, and up-to-date library, and apartments for researchers are located on
campus. As a result, the Institute is an ideal place for in-depth and
collaborative mathematical study and provides an optimal milieu for fostering
collaboration. The Fall 2002 Program is the third such program on differential
equations and spectral theory held at the Institute, two others having been held
in 1982 and 1992.&lt;br/&gt;
