A significant unresolved problem in cell biology is understanding how
cytoplasmically synthesized proteins are targeted to the various compartments of
eukaryotic cells. In plant cells, chloroplasts offer an excellent system for
studying this problem. Most chloroplastic proteins are encoded in the nucleus
and synthesized in the cytoplasm as higher molecular weight precursors. These
precursors are imported postranslationally into chloroplasts across the two
envelope membranes and are subsequently directed to the proper location within
the organelle. The long term goal of this project is to understand how the
import process occurs. At the present time, the major barrier to gaining a more
detailed understanding of protein transport into chloroplasts is a lack of
information regarding the identity of transport intermediates. The basic
strategy of the project will be to block protein transport at specific stages,
thereby generating translocation intermediates containing precursors at discrete
points in the transport process. Cross-linking reagents will be used to identify
transport components that are in close physical proximity to the trapped
intermediates. As putative components are identified, further work will be
required to confirm their involvement in transport and to determine their
function during the transport process. To accomplish these objectives, specific
antibodies directed against each putative component will be prepared and cDNA
clones encoding each component will be isolated and sequenced. These antibodies
and CDNA clones will be valuable tools for investigating the functions of the
putative components. %%% This work is significant for at least two reasons.
First, it adds to the general understanding of a basic cellular process, i.e.
intracellular protein trafficking. Second, it has practical significance for
efforts to alter the metabolic pathways of chloroplasts using genetic
engineering techniques, in which foreign proteins will need to be directed into
chloroplasts.
