9707822 JONES Oregon State University (OSU) will operate the R/V WECOMA during
1997 as a general oceanographic vessel in support of NSF- sponsored projects.
The R/V WECOMA is a 185' general research vessel constructed in 1975 and
underwent a mid-life refit in 1994. OSU operates the WECOMA under a charter
agreement with NSF. The ship is scheduled for 188 operating days in 1997, of
which 107 days are in support of NSF-sponsored programs. Of the remaining 81
days, 70 are in support of NOAA-supported programs and 11 are in support of Navy
programs. The WECOMA begins the year with cruises off the coast of northern
California, Oregon and Washington. In mid-May the ship transit to the Bering Sea
for a 70 day NOAA cruise. The remainder of the year's cruises will be in the
pacific northwest. This vessel is part of a fleet used by NSF to support
oceanographic research. Most oceanographic research requires highly specialized
equipment permanently installed on the vessel for which the ship must be
specifically designed. This equipment also requires highly trained crew members
for maintenance and operation. Oceanographic vessels do not operate in the same
manner as general cargo or fishing vessels, therefore, NSF supports the
operation of a variety of ships specifically dedicated to oceanographic research
that are operated by universities and research institutions around the country.
