9727728 Haimo Melanocytes from fish scales and frog skin have been studied
extensively as model systems for studying bi-directional transport of cell
organelles, the pigment granules, along polarized microtubule tracks. Current
evidence indicates strongly that two separate force-generating motor proteins
are involved, each responsible for movement in one of the opposing directions.
The motor kinesin is believed responsible for dispersion of granules, and dynein
is believed responsible for aggregation. These motors bind to the organelles and
then interact with the microtubules to generate the directed forces. A central
question, however, is what regulates these motors to turn them on and off in a
coordinated manner so that only one of the two opposing forces is generated at
any given time. One possibility is that directed movement is regulated by
differential binding of the motors to the organelles. A second possibility is
that both motors bind stabily to the organelle, but that only one is active at
any given time. The present studies are based on preliminary evidence that
supports the second hypothesis. To confirm this hypothesis, dynein and kinesin
will be isolated from organelles under conditions when one or the other motor is
active, and then their properties will be compared. The separate motors will be
added back to reconstituted systems in which their ability to bind to
microtubules and to generate force will be assayed. Since a likely means of
regulating the motor activity would be the reversible phosphorylation of the
motor proteins, evidence for differential phosphorylation of the motors will be
sought. Putative phosphorylation sites will be altered to determine if these
sites are directly involved in regulating the activity of either or both motors.
These experiments address the fundamental question of coordinate regulation of
multiple motors involved in organelle movement. Results will be directly
applicable to an understanding of these and similar motors in a wide v ariety of
cells.
