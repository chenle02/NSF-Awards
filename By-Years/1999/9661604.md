*** 96-61604 Marjadi This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will develop and test an innovative software tool which will merge the
tasks of design and structural analysis into one concurrent task. This
innovation has the potential for dramatic reduction of design cycle time by
reducing the iterative process of analytical validation into one single
concurrent design step. The technology of topology optimization will be combine
with the emerging h-p adaptive meshless (Clouds) method of structural analysis.
For given package space and loads and boundary conditions, this method will
compute structures which are optimum in terms of topology as well as size and
shape. The error prediction feature of the h-p adaptive method will hold the
modeling and computational errors within user prescribed bounds, thus
significantly reducing design iterations, which are the most costly and time
consuming portions of the design process. Phase I will merge the two
technologies with analysis formulation efforts focused on linear static analysis
using two-dimensional structures. Phase II would include design for more
practical three-dimensional solids and shells. Commercial applications of this
software tool are expected with mechanical designers and computer aided
engineering (CAE) experts, particularly in the automotive and aerospace
industries. ***
