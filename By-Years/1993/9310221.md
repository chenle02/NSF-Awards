9310221 Everett This project is a three-year investigation into the
morphosyntactic and phonological systems of the Arawan languages, with special
focus on Banaw . It will involve approximately ten months of field work in the
Amazon, with six months on Banaw and two months each on Zuruah and Deni. Texts
and lexica will be collected and transcribed in each of these villages and
further analyzed and processed by the PI both in Brazil and at his home
institution. Descriptive and theoretical articles on Banaw phonology and
morphosyntax will be submitted within the first two years of the project,
followed by a detailed grammar of Banaw to be produced by the end of the final
year. The work on Banaw will serve as the touchstone for further grammatical
description of Zuruah and Deni and analysis of unresolved grammatical problems
in the remaining Arawan languages, Madij , Paumari, Yarawara, and Yamamadi.
These studies will enable us to document and describe the basic features of the
entire Arawan family, representing the first major study of an entire Amazonian
family not of the Tupi or Ge phyla. Moreover, initial studies of these languages
by the PI have already shown them to be of great theoretical interest for
morphological, syntactic, and phonological theories. Also, this study will
include the reconstruction of Proto-Arawan leading, it is hoped to the eventual
genetic classification of this entire family. Finally, since Arawan languages
are all endangered, this study will also provide an irreplaceable source of
information and perhaps stimulate outside interest in the survival of the
languages and the pe ople who speak them. '| '| '| '| '| '| '| '| " # $ % &amp;
