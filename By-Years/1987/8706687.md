The ideal of empirical social science entered the consciousness of American
legal academics in the 1920's and early 1930's, yet there remains a pervasive
emphasis in American legal studies on formalism, on the one hand, and practical
problem-solving, on the other. Based on a systematic analysis of a range of
archival data, Dr. Schlegel seeks to account for why the scientific ideal
inspired by the American Legal Realism movement has largely failed to be
incorporated into the professional identity of those engaged in legal
scholarship. His study is fundamental to the field of law and social science,
providing a history of the first ambitious set of attempts to synthesize law and
social science and to institutionalize law-and-society studies both inside and
outside law schools. His work will enrich the current debate and dialogue of
social scientists and illuminate our understanding of the nature of legal
knowledge.
