Modern marketplaces, enabled by recent advances in
information&lt;br/&gt;technology, are becoming ever more complex, dynamic
and&lt;br/&gt;interconnected. Customers are increasingly more informed about
the&lt;br/&gt;choices available to them and are thus able to make better
decisions.&lt;br/&gt;For firms, this presents both opportunities and challenges.
On the&lt;br/&gt;positive side, the firm has a bigger than ever array of tools
at its&lt;br/&gt;disposal that enable it to better sell to its customers. Such
tools&lt;br/&gt;are both computational (pricing algorithms, customer targeting
data,&lt;br/&gt;social networking information) and economical (dynamic
mechanisms) in&lt;br/&gt;nature. The challenging aspect for the firm is that
modern technology&lt;br/&gt;also allows consumers to easily learn the opinions
of fellow customers&lt;br/&gt;and to be strategic in their decision-making.
Having such strategic&lt;br/&gt;and networked customers is not necessarily a net
negative for the&lt;br/&gt;firm, but it certainly makes the firm's problem of
how to sell its&lt;br/&gt;products a more complex one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project aims to develop a framework for understanding how to&lt;br/&gt;sell
goods in markets that are fundamentally dynamic and&lt;br/&gt;interconnected.
The project will research what mechanisms are revenue-optimal&lt;br/&gt;(or
near-optimal, while being simple and computationally tractable)
in&lt;br/&gt;dynamic settings where customers can learn from each other. The PIs
will&lt;br/&gt;study the effect of network learning on the firm's behavior
and&lt;br/&gt;whether it forces the firm to share some of the costs associated
with&lt;br/&gt;consumer learning. The project will also focus on how the
social&lt;br/&gt;networkstructure affects the optimal mechanism and will try
to&lt;br/&gt;understand whether such network learning effects lead to lower
(or&lt;br/&gt;higher) revenue for the firm and aggregate consumer
welfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fundamental research in the dynamics of networked
markets provides&lt;br/&gt;deeper knowledge to a broad audience that includes
firms, consumer&lt;br/&gt;groups and regulators. Curriculum development at the
interface of&lt;br/&gt;operations research, information systems and computer
science will&lt;br/&gt;benefit from this research experience.
