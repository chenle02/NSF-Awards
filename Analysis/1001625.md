The principal investigator will investigate problems in dynamics and geometry in
the framework of operator algebras. Sample topics include: 1. Study the relation
between entropy of principal algebraic actions of countable groups and Fuglede-
Kadison determinant; 2. Develop an operator algebraic approach to entropy of
actions of sofic groups; 3. Investigate combinatorial independence in measurable
and topological dynamics; 4. Develop a convex analysis approach to the study of
noncommutative Choquet boundary; 5. Study quantum isometry of compact quantum
metric spaces. In order to get a new mathematical tool to study quantum
mechanics, von Neumann introduced operator algebras. The theory of operator
algebras has grown into a huge exciting area of modern mathematics, and is
related to many other areas of physics and mathematics. Ergodic theory and
dynamics arose from studying the long-term behavior of complicated processes.
This project will deepen and broaden connections between geometry, dynamics, and
operator algebras, and has application in physics. The proposed study of entropy
of algebraic actions and actions of sofic groups will enhance our understanding
of complicated symmetries. The study of the new interrelation between
combinatorics and dynamics has application to the local theory of Banach spaces.
The development of noncommutative Choquet boundary has application in operator
theory. The study of metric geometry will provide a concrete mathematical
foundation for certain statements in the theoretical high-energy physics
literature.
