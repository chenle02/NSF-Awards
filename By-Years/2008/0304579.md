This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) program entitled, "New
Learning and Discovery Experiences in Nanoscale Engineering Undergraduate
Education," at Purdue University, under the direction of Dr. Kamyar Kaghighi, is
jointly funded by the Directorate for Engineering (ENG), Division of
Bioengineering and Environmental Systems (BES) and the Division of Engineering
Education and Centers (EEC). This project will develop a new interdisciplinary
undergraduate educational opportunity for first-year engineering students that
will engage them in learning and discovery experiences in nanotechnology. A
nanoscale engineering plan of study will be developed within the Division of
Interdisciplinary Engineering Studies (IDE) and evaluated for its potential as a
formal degree offering. This program will be a collaborative efffort among ten
engineering schools/departments at Purdue and will provide interdisciplinary
educational experiences for1700 first-year students.
