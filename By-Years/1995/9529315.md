Abstract/Garstang The objective of this research is the propagation of
infrasound in a stably stratified atmospheric boundary layer in East Africa
(Namibia). Observations of relevant meteorological variables, made during a
recent field experiment, will be used to investigate how elephants and other
mammals exploit an apparent wave guide in the boundary layer to communicate over
relatively large distances (40Km).
