In Sonora, Mexico, a diverse and prolific record of magmatism from Late
Cretaceous onward overlaps two regionally important deformational events -
Laramide compression and Tertiary extension, associated with motion along the
adjacent margin of western North America. This project will significantly expand
geochronologic and geochemical information across the complex magmatic belt by
K/Ar and U/Pb techniques. Results will provide a framework for understanding
Sonoran volcanism and its relationships to plate interactions in the
southwestern U.S., Mexico and the Caribbean.
