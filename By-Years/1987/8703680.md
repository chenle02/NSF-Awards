Regulatory Enzymes of Amino Acid Metabolism in Maize: The functional properties
and biosynthesis of two isozymes of L- homoserine dehydrogenase from corn will
be studied. One of the isozymes, located in the chloroplast, is regulated and
the other, located in the cytoplasm is apparently unregulated. DNA probes will
be developed in order to analyze enzyme regulation at the level of gene
expression. Antibodies to the chloroplast enzyme will be developed to establish
whether the two isozymes share antigenic determinants, to facilitate use of an
expression vector and to provide information on the nature of in vitro
translation products. Successful completion of these studies will contribute to
an understanding of the regulation of biosynthesis of nutritionally essential
amino acids by higher plants. This information is essential for genetically
engineering plants to produce high quality proteins. It will provide insights
into differences between eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms in the molecular
mechanisms used to regulated similar metabolic pathways.
