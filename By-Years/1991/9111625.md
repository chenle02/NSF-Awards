We propose to acquire thin film deposition and characterization equipment for
use in our ongoing and future research programs, including sample preparation
benches, a modern and flexible sputter deposition and thermal evaporation
system, and ellipsometer. The deposition system will be used to deposit a
variety of conducting (Au,Al,Zn,In,etc.) and dielectric (ZnO,SiO2,etc.) films
and will be used by a large number of faculty and students. An automated
ellipsometer will be used to characterize the films produced by the deposition
system and our existing chemical vapor deposition (CVD) reactors.
