The Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO), now being operated by the New Jersey
Institute of Technology, continues observations in solar physics. The continuing
activities focus on aspects of both high resolution observations and infrared
observations. Upgrades and installation of new instruments enable significant
advances in understanding of the Sun's magnetic structures. Investigators expect
results to also broaden understanding of the fine structure of granules, pores
and sunspots (and associated waves), the contrast of faculae and sunspots at
various wavelengths, and the evolution of magnetic structures in flare producing
regions. Quantitative synoptic observations accurately monitor the rising phase
of Cycle 23, providing tools for predicting flares and filament eruptions. In
all, the BBSO contributes to understanding flare mechanism, small-scale magneto-
convection, and the three-dimensional structure of the solar atmosphere, all
crucial causal factors in space weather.
