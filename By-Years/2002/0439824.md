(U-Th)/He dating of phosphate and silicate minerals such as apatite, zircon,
monazite, and titanite has attracted considerable interest; however, U- and Th-
bearing Fe- or Ti-oxides have not been systematically investigated and developed
as low-T thermochronometers. A common oxide mineral is rutile (TiO2), which is
present as an accessory mineral in many magmatic rocks and also occurs widely in
high-grade metamorphic rocks, especially in blueschists, eclogites, and
granulites. We propose to develop and calibrate rutile (U-Th)/He geo- and
thermochronometry by investigating its He diffusion characteristics; we will
include such factors as grain size and chemical composition. Furthermore, we
will test rutile (U-Th)/He dating on fast-cooled volcanic rocks as well as more
slowly-cooled sample arrays from the KTB ultra-deep borehole and an exhumed
extensional fault block in the Wassuk Range, western Basin and Range province.
We will also apply rutile (U-Th)/He thermochronometry to date the cooling of
high-pressure metamorphic rocks from Oman. The (U-Th)/He calibration of rutile
will provide a new geo- and thermochronometer that will be widely applicable,
but should be especially useful for studies of high-P to ultrahigh-P samples
that are notoriously difficult or impossible to date at the present. The
scientific results and methodologies developed during our study will be
disseminated to the geosciences community through publication of research papers
and presentations at international meetings. The study will significantly impact
the education of two students that will work with the PIs in the KU (U-Th)/He
and TIMS laboratories, providing them the opportunity for active learning and
exposing them to state-of-the-art analytical facilities and new research
directions. This background will be important to the intellectual growth of the
students and give them experience in working in collaborative and group/team
situations.
