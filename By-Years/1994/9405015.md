This is a proposal from two members of the faculty in the physics department at
Rutgers to continue their research in the analysis of polarized Z decays using
the SLD detector and the linear electron collider at SLAC. The accelerator has
achieved a 62% polarization of the electron beam and the stated plan is to
collect 1,000,000 Z decays over the next several years. This will allow the SLD
group to make what is expected to be the world's most accurate measurement of
the Weinberg Angle by a technique which is different from that at LEP. The
difference between the measurements at the two accelerators will be an important
measure of the radiative corrections in the standard model. The polarization of
the Z will also allow them to make significant measurements of Bs mixing. The
Rutgers group has been instrumental in the installation of the END CAP CRID
(Cerenkov Ring Imaging Detector) and they are now engaged in its calibration and
in the improvements to the tracking which are necessary to use the CRID for
particle identification.
