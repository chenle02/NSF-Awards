This effort represents the first comprehensive development of data for U.S.
immigrant and emigrant scientists and engineers (S/E's), much-needed components
of the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Scientific and Technical Personnel
Data System (STPDS). The proposed work will include a survey of immigrant S/E's,
verification of emigrant S/E estimates, development of a system to measure flows
of both immigrant and emigrant S/E's in order to derive net immigration, and a
feasibility study of non- immigrants, i.e. "visitors." Since foreign
participation has become an increasingly important part of the U.S. S/E labor
force, data on immigrant and emigrant S/E's have become vital to U.S. policy
makers in all sectors. At present, however, these data represent the most
serious data gap in the STPDS, the System which measures the numbers and
characteristics of the Nation's scientists and engineers. Major components of
the STPDS include: the Survey of Natural and Social Scientists and Engineers,
the Survey of Recent Science and Engineering Graduates, and the Survey of
Doctoral Recipients. All three surveys are conducted biennially for NSF.
