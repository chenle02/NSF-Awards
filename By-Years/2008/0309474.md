9870927&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will focus on
developing a better understanding of the seismic response of hybrid wall systems
through detailed inelastic dynamic analyses. Two types of hybrid wall systems
will be considered, a) structural systems comprised of solid or perforated
reinforced concrete shear walls and steel moment frames, and b) structural
systems comprised of steel-girder-coupled shear walls and steel moment frames.
The investigation includes three interrelated components. The first component
will focus on development of and existing finite element program to include wall
finite elements capable of simulating the complex behavior of wall panels. The
second part involves the design of a number of prototype hybrid wall systems
using currently existing provisions. The third component involves conducting a
large number of inelastic dynamic analyses using the developed analytical tools.
The analyses will concentrate on 1) identifying the optimal degree of coupling
between coupled shear walls, 2) shedding more light on the interaction between
shear walls and moment frames, 3) establishing design oriented methods for
determining the distribution of forces in the walls and frames, 3) establishing
design oriented methods for determining the distribution of forces in the walls
and frames, and 4) assessing currently recommended provisions for the design of
hybrid wall systems and their components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most
important products of this project will be the determination of performance
measures for different levels of earthquake loading and for different limit
states of structural behavior. This data will be invaluable for the future
development of performance based designed criteria for hybrid wall
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported under the 4th year
competition of initiative NSF 94-154.&lt;br/&gt;
