This group will pursue a broad program of research in gravitation and
astrophysics. Among the topics to be investigated are the following: 1) Aspects
of quantum gravity associated with noneuclidean topology will be examined. The
possible existence of stationary states with noneuclidean topology will be
considered in the context of asymptotically flat spacetimes and spacetimes with
Kaluza-Klein symmetries. Complementary approaches to quantization will be
considered. 2) In the area of quantum fields and gravitation, research includes
an investigation of the effect of quantum electrodynamic anomalies on the energy
density of fermions in the expanding universe. Also under study are quantum
corrections to the metrics of general relativistic fluid spheres, the possible
loss of information and correlations in black hole evaporation, and relativistic
Bose-Einstein condensation in the early universe. 3) Exotic processes in the
early universe, such as the formation of a network of cosmic strings, and the
amplification of quantum fluctuations by rapid expansion, leave behind a
stochastic background of gravitational waves. A detailed study will be pursued
to determine the observable properties of these waves, their effects on the
isotropy of the Cosmic Background Radiation, and their detectability by ground-
and space-based gravitational wave antennae. 4) Research in general-relativistic
astrophysics will include the construction of a code that computes the
nonaxisymmetric instability points of perfect fluids. The nonlinear dynamical
evolution of unstable stars will be examined in collaboration with workers
developing a relativistic 3+1 code. Other work will involve the determination of
an upper limit on rotation independent of the equation of state. These topics
are of high interest in exploring the fundamentals of modern gravitation theory,
and connecting it to possible astronomical observations.
