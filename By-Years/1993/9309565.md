9309565 Rood ABSTRACT The Siouan Languages Archive is a computer data base of
information in and on the approximately 16 languages of the Siouan family,
presently or formerly spoken in the North American plains and southeast. The
Archive was established in 1977-81 using keypunches for data entry and encoded
in a character set that provided only upper case roman numerals and some
mathematical symbols. All the special characters in the original documents are
coded with 2 and 3 character sequences. We will modernize the data base by (1)
converting the complex character coding to a more standard scheme such as
Unicode; (2) re-coding the numeric field labels as mnemonic abbreviations; (3)
fully standardizing field structure and characters from document to document;
(4) organizing document storage logically; and (5) to the extent that copyright
permits, making the whole data base available on line, together with some kind
of concordance(s) or concordance programs. If time permits, we will also fill in
gaps in some of the documents. Work will be done by John E. Koontz, Research
Associate at the Center for the Study of the Native Languages of the Plains and
Southwest, and supervised by Prof. David S. Rood, who originally developed the
Archive. ***
