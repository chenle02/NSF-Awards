The computational demands of modern chemical research requies the proper
computing system that would avoid wasteful bottlenecks by balancing a variety of
computational capabilities with individual workstations, networks, hardware and
software maintenance, support personnel and training in all areas of
computational chemistry. Many new insights into the kinetics of chemical
reactions can be developed through theoretical studies with use of mini-
supercomputers when theexperimental data is inaccessible. In addition, the most
cost-effective computers are the min-supercomputers. This award will allow the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Arizona acquire a mini-super class
computer system. The research studies to be performed includes the following: 1.
Development of quantum chemical methods and codes for more precise treatment of
molecules with up to one hundred electrons. 2. Theoretical modeling of physical
and spectropscopic properties of molecules, such as chemical shielding in NMR
and ionization features in PES. 3. Determination of structures and properties of
a wide range of biologically active molecules. 4. Electronic structure
principles of metals.
