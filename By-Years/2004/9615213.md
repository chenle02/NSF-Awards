INT-9615213 Gaur Description: This proposal will add a collaborative component
to a research project in Central Asia that is currently supported by the
Division of Earth Sciences, Geophysics Program. It will activate a new
collaboration between Roger Bilham of the University of Colorado and Vinod Gaur/
John Paul of the Centre for Mathematical Modeling, Indian Institute of Sciences,
Bangalore. The researchers have developed a large field program to determine:
the shift in latitude of the Indian subcontinent, the deformation in southern
India, the rate of convergence of India and Tibet, and they will conduct
measurements in Nepal that will provide a measurement interval for the Nepal
survey. Their measurements will permit characterization of future regions of
enhanced seismic potential, establish the rate of growth of the Himalaya, and
the recurrence interval for great earthquakes there. Scope: The investigators
seek funds to support travel to India and minor expenses to supplement field
research costs. This research will determine the renewal time for earthquakes in
India and Nepal and identify regions of potentially enhanced seismic risk in
Peninsular India. Since the destructive Latur earthquake of 1993, there is great
urgency to accomplish the goals of this research. ***
