This dissertation investigates how appropriate social networks help explain the
relative success of four conservation and development projects in two regions in
Brazil. The mobilization of multiple stakeholders, both local and beyond the
project region, are critical for sustainable development. These networks also
help diffuse a new identity supporting environmentally sustainable resource use.
Both mobilization and diffusion depend on overlapping ties among the various
stakeholders. Ethnographic and interview methods will be used to collect data on
network connections and the flow of resources through those networks.
