The Department of Chemistry is purchasing two gas chromatographs for use in
analytical chemistry, organic and advanced organic chemistry, and physical
chemistry laboratories. In the organic and advanced organic chemistry
laboratories, the instruments are used to determine the enantiomeric excess of
reaction products resulting from an enzymatic hydrolysis of a meso-diester, the
composition of isomeric alkenes derived from an elimination reaction, and the
ratio of products obtained from a carbocation rearrangement. Students in the
physical chemistry laboratory, students are measuring the thermodynamic
properties of solutes and collecting rate data from a cycloaddition reaction.
Students engaged in independent study are also using the instruments.
