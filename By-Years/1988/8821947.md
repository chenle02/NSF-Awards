This is a two.year collaborative research project between Dr. Hsin.I Wu, Texas A
&amp; M University and Professor Ren Jizhou, Gansu Grassland Ecological Research
Institute. This proposal plans to develop and implement mechanistic models using
integrated modeling techniques to manage economic development in a
marginally.productive region of Gansu, China. This is an important, new approach
in managing a fragile ecosystem. Much of the model development has been done
using grant support from the Division of Biotic Systems and Resources. The study
uses the data collected on Gansu grassland ecosystems by the Chinese
collaborating institute to validate the biosystem models. The success of this
study can provide a new way to integrate a large amount of data on managing a
marginal ecological >environment.
