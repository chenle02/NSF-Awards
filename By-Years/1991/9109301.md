Professor John Ross is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to perform experimental and theoretical studies
on irreversible processes which are characteristic of nonlinear systems. Ross
will pursue both theoretical and experimental research in the general area of
nonlinear chemical systems. Research will be performed in four major areas: 1)
Thermodynamic and stochastic analyses of irreversible processes; 2) Chemical
structures and chemical waves on membranes; 3) Theoretical and experimental
formulation of chemical computing elements (a chemical Turing machine); and 4)
Use of delay measurements in the classification of oscillatory chemical
reactions. %%% This research will provide important physical and chemical
insights regarding oscillating chemical reactions, chemical waves on membrance,
and irreversible transport processes such as mass diffusion, thermal conduction
and viscous flow.
