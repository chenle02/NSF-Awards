This is a SGER project to collect and to study the perishable earthquake and
structural response/damage earthquake. This project focuses on the unique
opportunity provided to collect data of building damage and to calibrate and
validate loss estimation models/buildings and a portfolio of buildings. The
study will use 400 Stanford University buildings as a portfolio which cover a
broad spectrum of structural and material types. This massive portfolio of old
and modern buildings, which collectively suffered a total loss of $160 million
offers a superb data base to improve the damage/loss evaluation and estimation
techniques. The tasks entailed in this project are: (1) collection of factual
damage data of structural and architectural mature, (2) collection of soil dnad
geological data of building sites, (3) collection of strong-motion from campus
sites, and (4) evaluation of damage and loss and calibration of models used. The
results could be representative for many buildings in California and other
states and the learning about existing models will be of significant value to
many large institutions, corporations and communities.
