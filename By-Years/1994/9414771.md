Stevenson The NSF and the New York Botanical Garden (NYBG) will jointly support
the renovation of approximately 131 square research meters for the enhancement
of laboratory facilities in systematic and economic botany. The impacted
laboratories have not been renovated since their original construction in 1957.
As a result, they are not configured, or mechanically served, for molecular
plant systematics, and they do not meet modern health and safety standards.
Faculty and graduate students have been unable to conduct on-site research and
training and have had to travel to local affiliated laboratories and, on
occasion, to laboratories located out of state. Renovations will include
replacement of two antiquated fume hoods, installation of new electrical wiring
with ground fault receptacles, upgrading of water delivery and drainage systems,
installation of thermostatic controls, replacement of traps and valves on steam
radiators, removal of unused steam lines, and refurbishment of laboratory
cabinets, floors, walls, ceilings, and lab bench tops. The renovation of
laboratories for use in molecular systematics will add new impetus to the
research and research training program at NYBG and will directly benefit five
research scientists, three post doctoral students, and fifteen graduate students
in molecular biology. The molecular research program allows researchers to track
the evolution of the same gene in species from widely different groups of
organisms, which in turn provides new insight on plant evolutionary history. The
Garden is also used by visiting scientists, many of whom travel from Latin
America for study and has cooperative programs with three local universities.
