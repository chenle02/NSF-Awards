A major challenge for future High End Computing (HEC) systems built using many-
core chips is the storage system since the available memory and bandwidth per
processor core is starting to decline at an alarming rate, with the rapid
increase in the number of cores per chip. Data-intensive applications that
require large data sets and/or high input-output bandwidth will be especially
vulnerable to these trends. Historically, the storage architecture of an HEC
system has been constrained to a large degree by the filesystem interfaces in
the underlying Operating System (OS). The specific focus of this research is on
exploring a new storage model based on write-once tree structures. This research
will explore three programming models for users of the storage system, all of
which can inter-operate through shared persistent data: 1) a declarative
programming model in which any data structure can be directly made persistent in
the storage system, with no programmer intervention, 2) a strongly-typed
imperative programming model in which a type system extension will be used to
enforce a separation between data structures that can be directly made
persistent and those that cannot, and 3) a weakly-typed runtime interface that
enables low-level C programs to access the storage system.
