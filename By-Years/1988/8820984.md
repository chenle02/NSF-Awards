There is an increasing interest in identifying and developing effective
biological controls for pest organisms such as pathogens, weeds, and insects. As
a follow.on activity of a panel of the Committee on Science, Engineering, and
Public Policy (COSEPUP) of the National Academy of Science which recommended an
increase in basic research on biological interactions that could be manipulated
for pest control purposes, a workshop was held to provide a foundation for a
specific research agenda based on needs and priorities that would be useful in
guiding the expansion or establishment of programs on plant.microbe
interactions. Support is provided to expedite the timely publication of the
workshop results.
