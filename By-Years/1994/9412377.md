9412377 ROGERSON This project will investigate intergenerational relations in
the U.S. be focusing on living arrangements of elderly persons and their
geographic proximity to their adult children. Proximity and living arrangements
are often critical in determining access to caregiving and support among members
of each generation. Increased life expectancy, the aging of the baby boom
generation, and small family sizes suggest a need to further understand these
dimensions of family behavior. Employing panel data from the 1988 and 1993
National Surveys of Families and Households, static models as well as transition
models will be analyzed to capture a fuller picture of the living arrangements
and proximity between adult children and their parents during the study period.
A rational choice perspective will be utilized to develop and test models of:
(1) the choices of living arrangements of elderly persons, (2) the structure of
hierarchical relationships among living arrangement alternatives, and (c)
changes in individual living arrangement choices. Finally models of
intergenerational accessibility will be developed, including the establishment
of a proximity/living arrangement typology and an evaluation of transitions in
family accessibility states. This project will contribute to theoretical
understanding of intergenerational relations from both a geographical and a
sociological perspective. The results of the study will also have important
implications for our understanding of the future well-being of an aging
population. The research will be conducted by an interdisciplinary team that
will construct a better synthesis of this important phenomenon.
