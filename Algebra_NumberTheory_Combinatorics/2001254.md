The research in this project explores the local geometry of algebraic varieties
at their singular (non-manifold) points. A classical way of studying
singularities it to restrict to a small neighborhood and analyze its boundary.
In an influential paper written in the sixties, John Nash proposed an
alternative approach which relies on the analysis of the space of germs of
curves through the singular locus. Twenty years later, Vladimir Berkovich
developed a general theory of non-Archimedean geometry which provides, among
other things, a yet new approach to study singularities. These three very
different points of view are in fact closely related to each other. The goals
set in this project address different open problems in each of these areas,
seeking new connections and applications. The project also provides research
training activities for graduate students.

The space of arcs of an algebraic variety provides the underlying space in
motivic integration and has been used to study invariants of singularities in
the minimal model program. The first part of the project sets two distinct
objectives regarding arc spaces. The first pertains a theorem of Drinfeld,
Grinberg, and Kazhdan of the formal neighborhood of the arc space at non-
degenerate arcs and addresses the question whether the stated decomposition
globalizes along a suitable stratification of the arc space. The second
objective concerns the Nash problem on families of arcs through the
singularities of a variety: the Nash problem has recently been settled for
surfaces in characteristic zero and there are several results in higher
dimensions, but little is known in positive characteristic, even in dimension
two, and the proposal addresses this case. A third objective sees the
continuation of ongoing work devoted to the development of a theory of motivic
integration on the Berkovich analytification of an algebraic variety and aims to
understand its connections with other existing theories of integration such as
Kontsevich's motivic integration, p-adic integration, and Hrushovski-Kazhdan?s
integration. The fourth and last objective is motivated by the Lipman?Zariski
conjecture, and aims to use ideas from prior works on links of isolated
singularities and the complex Plateau problem to set up a new approach toward
the conjecture.
