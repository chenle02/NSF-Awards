The research objective of this award is to fabricate novel nanoporous membranes
that protect kidney dialysis patients from accelerated aging, cancer, increased
susceptibility to infection, cardiovascular disease, and other conditions that
result from excessive amounts of reactive oxygen species. Recent studies
indicate that the dialysis procedure itself can promote generation of reactive
oxygen species by white blood cells. Current approaches for providing
antioxidant drugs or creating reactive oxygen species-scavenging dialyzer
membranes have been largely unsuccessful. Atomic layer deposition will be used
to modify nanoporous alumina membranes with novel reactive oxygen species
scavenging agents. Fundamental studies to determine the relationships between
processing parameters, pore dimensions, chemical properties, and reactive oxygen
species scavenging activity will be undertaken in order to develop optimized
membranes for future in vivo and clinical studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
results of the work can potentially lead to improved quality of life for
patients suffering from end-stage renal disease and other reactive oxygen
species-mediated diseases. From an educational perspective, the proposed project
will be tightly integrated with the training objectives of both the biomedical
engineering program at the University of North Carolina and the bio-
manufacturing program at North Carolina State University. Modules on
nanostructured biomaterials research activities will be placed in the PI?s
undergraduate level and graduate level courses at the University of North
Carolina and North Carolina State University. Students from underrepresented
backgrounds will be recruited to participate in the proposed research program,
with undergraduate student support coming from a currently-funded Research
Experiences for Undergraduates program.
