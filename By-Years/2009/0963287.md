This award supports travel expenses for U.S. participants in the international
workshop "Analysis on Graphs and its Applications Follow-up Meeting," to be held
at the Isaac Newton Institute in Cambridge, UK, on 26-30 July 2010. This
workshop is the planned follow-up meeting for the semester-long international
program "Analysis on Graphs and its Applications" held in the same venue in
2007.

Substantial recent progress in spectral theory of combinatorial graphs, quantum
graphs, and analysis on fractals makes a follow-on conference highly desirable.
This meeting will assemble a diverse group of experts, young researchers, and
students working in the quickly-developing interdisciplinary field of
applications of analysis on graphs to mathematical physics, nanotechnology,
microelectronics, chemistry, materials science, photonics, number theory,
discrete groups, and fractals.

The conference encourages and financially supports participation by students,
recent Ph.D. recipients, and members of groups underrepresented in mathematics.
