The University of West Florida will purchase a JASCO Model J- 710 Circular
Dichroism Spectrometer with Optical Rotatory Dispersion accessory for the rapid
determination of chiroptical spectra and optical activity. The instrument
requested will permit the study of chirality in organic, inorganic, biochemical
and polymeric materials. The equipment will be used in seven undergraduate
courses covering biochemistry, organic, inorganic and physical chemistry. It
will be utilized for undergraduate research, and is expected to be used in a new
laboratory course in polymer chemistry currently under development. Sophomores,
juniors and seniors will study the structure and stereochemical features of a
variety of compounds including materials of biochemical interest. The approach
will provide innovative means of helping students understand the important
concepts of stereochemistry.
