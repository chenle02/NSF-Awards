At Calvin College faculty from Biology, Chemistry, and Mathematics and Computer
Science are collaborating to reform the four courses of the introductory biology
sequence to align with the findings of the document "Vision and Change in
Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action." Building on problem-based
learning in the first course, they are now developing laboratory modules,
derived from faculty research, in the middle two courses, which culminate in
student research projects in the fourth course. The three-week laboratory
modules develop students' abilities to read and critique the scientific
literature, to frame scientific questions and to seek their experimental
answers, and to learn the conventions of oral and written communication of
scientific results. Like genuine research projects, the modules include
quantitative and interdisciplinary features, so students are less inclined to
see their STEM courses as isolated from one another. The lecture aspects of the
courses have also been revised to be more student-centered and interactive,
making use of the best ideas in pedagogy. Participating in the review and
testing of this strategic reform are partners from two universities, four
liberal arts colleges, and a community college, all of whom have collaborated
with Calvin College on previous projects. Grand Rapids Community College
contributes an external collaborator, a biologist, who receives a stipend for
carrying out review, testing, and evaluation of the modules, as do the other
collaborators. By following the blueprint of "Vision and Change" for reform of
classroom, laboratory, and assessment practices, Calvin College's project is
sure to have a broad impact on undergraduate biology education.
