9707555 Tedford The living members of the dog family (Canidae) consist of a
diverse group of predators (foxes, jackals, wolves, hunting dogs, and domestic
dogs) that belong to a closely knit group, the subfamily Caninae. The dog family
includes two other subfamilies (Hesperocyoninae and Borophahinae), both of which
are extinct. Tedford and Wang of the American Museum of Natural History will
undertake a comprehensive study of the phylogenetic relationships and
biostratigraphy of North American fossil canines as the final chapter of their
long-term, high-resolution study of the evolution of the family Canidae from the
late Eocene (roughly 40 million years ago) until present. They will acquire
morphological data from both fossil and extant canines and will utilize
recently-available molecular phylogenies to describe new taxa and to document
canine diversity, biochronology, and zoogeography. The material for the study
will come from several collections of fossil mammals, including the
comprehensive Childs Frick Collection at the American Museum. The project
thoroughly delineates the history of Caninae in North America and permits
analysis and documentation of their complex movements to and from other
continents. The project also will engender a database that will allow
investigation of a number of topics including geological succession, functional
morphology, and response to short and long-term environmental change.
