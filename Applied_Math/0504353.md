The overall goal of this project is to develop new methods and tools for the
analysis and synthesis of scattered data by means of radial basis functions,
spherical basis functions, and tight spherical frames. The research will provide
a foundation for the effectiveness of various radial basis function meshless
methods for solving partial differential equations by estimating the errors made
in using them; knowing these errors can then serve as a guide in creating and
implementing algorithms based on radial basis and spherical basis functions,
both for meshless methods for solving differential equations and for scattered
data surface fitting. Tight, well-localized spherical frames are a newly
discovered tool for dealing with scattered data on spheres, and are similar to
frames used in connection with wavelet analysis. Very little is known about the
specifics of these tight frames, and a second goal of this project is to develop
them, and algorithms based on them, to efficiently process scattered data on
spheres.

Problems involving analyzing and synthesizing data taken from scattered sites
arise in diverse fields -- computer-aided design graphics, data mining, medical
imaging, learning networks, geoscience, and many other areas. The methods under
development in this project for solving partial differential equations will help
in solving problems involving wave propagation, modeling fluid flow, and even
tomography. The work on spherical basis functions and tight spherical frames
will impact geoscience, especially in the case of fitting large scattered-data
sets collected over the earth via satellites or by ground stations.
