9410882 Simpson Graduate student Karen Clary, under the supervision of faculty
adviser Beryl Simpson at the University of Texas, is studying the taxonomy and
phylogeny of the desert genus Yucca, estimated to encompass ca. 35 species in
Mexico and the U.S. Morphological, anatomical, and molecular (DNA) analyses are
being conducted to provide comparative data for assessing genealogical
affinities. The internal transcribed spacer region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA
repeat will be sequenced to determine mutational differences in nucleotide
composition among species. Results from nuclear DNA analyses will be compared to
those based upon chloroplast DNA studies for the same species. Molecular and
morphological characters will be combined to achieve a reliable classification
of the plants. An understanding of patterns of diversity in molecular and
morphological features in Yucca will provide answers about the origin of the
genus and its evolution in relation to desert conditions, in general, and in
particular should prove interesting when compared with phylogenetic data on
yucca moths, the chief pollinators of these plants.
