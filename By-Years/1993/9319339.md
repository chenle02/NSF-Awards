9319339 Bielak The 1985 Mexico earthquake focused attention on the amplification
of strong ground motions when propagating from bedrock through the overlying
sedimentary deposits. Similar situations may exist with regard to major cities
in the United States, such as with the Los Angeles basin. The main objective of
this research program is to investigate, by computer simulation, the effect of
the shape of the bottom of the basin, as defined by the bedrock-sedimentary
layer boundary, on the spatial and temporal distribution of surface ground
motion during earthquakes. Practically all studies to date have considered the
bottom of a basin to be concave. A recent scientific article suggests that a
bottom surface which includes both concave and convex sections can cause ground
surface motions which are chaotic. The effect of such a chaotic motion on the
level of ground motion experienced by engineered structures is unknown, but it
is likely to be beneficial. This will be explored in the context of two-
dimensional sedimentary valleys subjected to seismic excitation in the form of
incident plane SH waves. Parametric studies will determine the difference in the
surface ground motion above a convex bottom surface as compared to that above
the usual concave shape. This study will also consider whether small changes in
valley geometry and seismic excitation, such as the angle of incidence of the
incoming wave, can produce significant changes in the spatial and temporal
distribution of the valley response. Such large variations would have important
implications for seismic hazard assessment and the seismic design of structures.
