Drs. Anderson and Biscaye propose to construct a carbon budget for an upper
slope region of the Middle Atlantic Bight. Previous studies in this region led
to the controversial hypothesis that export of Corg from continental margin
represents a major pathway for transfer of CO2 from the atmosphere to the deep
ocean. The source term for their Corg budget will be provided by a large number
of primary productivity and sediment trap flux measurements to be obtained
during a DOE-funded study of Shelf-Edge Exchange Processes. The work will
include independent approaches to evaluate the rate of Corg reimeralization at
the upper slope as well as the rate of Corg burial. One approach will include
coupling measured solid phase Corg distributions in sediments trap fluxes and
independently-determined rates of sediment accumulation and sediment mixing to
infer rates of Corg burial, consumption within the mixed layer, and rapid
remineralization at the sediment-water interface. The complemetary approach will
use benthic flux chambers to measure the flux of 02 into the sediments, which
will be stoichiometrically converted into Corg consumption rates, and flux of
C02 out of the sediments. Chamber-derived fluxes will be compared to Corg
remineralization rates inferred from solid phase studies as a test for internal
consistency and reliability of the Corg remineralization rates. Enumeration of
benthic community biomass will also provide turnover rates for live carbon in
the sediments. Carbon fluxes determined in this study will help resolve the
controversy regarding the importance to global C02 cycle of the transport of
margin-derived Corg to the deep sea and will further provide a quantitative
relationship between Corg fluxes and benthic ecosystem energy requirements.
