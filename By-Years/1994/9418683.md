9418683 Stephenson This award will partially support the travel expenses, over
a three year period, to enable Dr. Gerard J. Stephenson, of the Department of
Physics and Astronomy at the University of New Mexico, to conduct collaborative
research with Dr. Bruce H. J. McKellar, of the School of Physics at the
University of Melbourne. The focus of the research will be on the application of
Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) effective theory to low energy nuclear properties
and the study, mainly through low energy nuclear reactions, of the interactions
of neutrinos at energies where their masses, should they exist, will be
important. In this theoretical study of the physics of neutrinos and quarks in
nuclei at low energies, two issues will be investigated. The first study
concerns the behavior of quarks in the atomic nuclei and the question of whether
they remain confined to individual protons and neutrons, or whether they
transfer between them. The second study deals with neutrinos and the development
of a model in which the effective mass of a particle depends on its
surroundings, a model which could explain some features of the experiments which
have attempted to measure the mass of this elusive particle. The collaborative
work brings together the complementary expertise of the principal investigators.
The visits by Dr. McKellar to New Mexico are supported by the Australian
Department of Industry, Science and Technology (DIST) under the U.S.-Australia
Cooperative Science Program.
