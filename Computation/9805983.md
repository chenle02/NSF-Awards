Difference equations (i.e. recurrence equations) have a number of properties in
common with differential equations. The PI recently introduced the notion of
finite singularities of difference equations. With this notion, more methods for
differential equations can now be applied to difference equations, and this
leads to new algorithms. In particular, the PI intends to implement a new
efficient algorithm for computing hypergeometric solutions of recurrence
equations. These algorithms have several applications, such as finding and
proving formulas, or solving certain linear differential equations.
