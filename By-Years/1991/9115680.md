The Center for High Resolution Electron Microscopy (CHREM) provides state-of-
the-art instrumentation and techniques for use by the scientific community.
Research carried out by users of CHREM involves detailed investigations of many
types of materials. The CHREM facilities offers a variety of specialized
electron microscopes for use, in particular, two specialized ultrahigh vacuum
electron microscopes are available for tackling key problems in surface science,
thin film growth, and solid state reactions. The unique capabilities of the UHV
electron microscopes are of particular interest to those scientists who pursue
their ongoing research at higher spatial resolution, and electron microscopists
who study surfaces under cleaner vacuum conditions.//
