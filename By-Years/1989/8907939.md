A family H of Hermitian matrices is efficiently structured if it contains
members of every order n and the number of independent parameters required to
specify an arbitrary n x n member of H is O(n). Hermitian Toeplitz matrices and
real Hankel matrices, for which the element in the i-th row and j-th column
depends only on i-j or i+j, respectively, are efficiently structured. Matrices
of the form A+B, where A is a Hermitian Toeplitz matrix and B is a real Hankel
matrix, are also efficiently structured, as are Hermitian matrices of a given
displacement rank, i.e. Hermitian matrices which can be written as the sum of a
fixed number of products of upper and lower triangular Toeplitz matrices. There
are two interesting spectral problems for efficiently structured matrices: (a)
the ordinary eigenvalue problem; i.e., finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors
of a given efficiently structured matrix by methods which take specific
advantage of the simple structure, and (b) the inverse eigenvalue problem;
finding a matrix in a given efficiently structured family which has as its
eigenvalues a given set of real numbers. The objectives of the proposed research
are to consider these two problems, which are both in relatively primitive
stages of development.
