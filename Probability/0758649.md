This project will study systems from statistical mechanics and probability that
exhibit critical phenomena. The systems include self-avoiding random walks and
loops, Ising spin systems, and percolation. Our first approach is through real
space renormalization group transformations. These transformations for Ising
type models relate the critical behavior of the model to the behavior of the
renormalization group map near the critical point. This map is not well defined
mathematically, and the project will study the mathematical properties of this
map. Our second approach is restricted to two dimensional systems where
conformal invariance miraculously appears when there is critical behavior. The
research will study the relation between the Schramm-Loewner evolution and
various discrete models by studying the Loewner driving process, especially for
models which are near but not at their critical point. The relation of the bi-
infinite self-avoiding walk to the newly discovered conformally invariant
measures on self-avoiding loops in the plane will also be investigated.

The systems that will be studied contain randomness at a microscopic length
scale. For most values of the parameters, e.g., temperature, this randomness is
not seen at the macroscopic scale. But for special values of the parameters this
microscopic randomness can produce macroscopic effects. This is one
characterization of a phase transition. Physicists have developed powerful
techniques for studying phase transitions, but the mathematics of these methods
is not well understood. This research will further our understanding of critical
phenomena by developing the mathematics behind two of the most important of the
physicist's tools - the renormalization group and conformal invariance. The
research on the renormalization group will focus on the Ising model, arguably
the single most important model of the magnetic behavior of crystalline
materials. One product of the research on conformal invariance will be a much
faster algorithm for numerically computing conformal maps which are used
extensively in science and engineering.
