This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will study the
development of a modular system that will significantly lower the cost of
collecting data on oceanographic phenomena. This system consists of individual
modules designed to measure beam attenuation, beam absorption, and
backscattering at single wavelengths, fluorescence for single
excitation/detection wavelength pairs, and turbidity in the visible spectrum.
The modular system will allow for the incorporation of other low-cost devices,
such as off-the-shelf temperature or CTD sensors. In addition, a low-cost
communications module will be designed, which will facilitate communications via
cell phone technology or radio transceivers for terrestrial, estuary, and
coastal applications. &lt;br/&gt; This system will target institutions
participating in ocean color validation programs, specifically observing and
understanding the role of the oceans in global climate change. It will also
target projects with in-situ observations at organizations such as; NSF's Global
Change Research Programs, NOAA, NASA, and the National Weather Service. The
lowest cost measurement scheme for most researches is to use freely available or
low cost satellite data. However, this satellite data is useless without ground
truth data and validation of modeled data from satellite measurements. This set
of modular instruments will allow a researcher on a limited budget to accurately
and independently verify data obtained from "inversion analyses" of satellite
data to obtain inherent optical properties and turbidity. By lowering the cost
of remote sensing, this activity has the potential to open up hand-on remote
sensing to educators, and broaden the participation of all groups, including
underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;
