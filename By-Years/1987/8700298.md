The tropical spider subfamily Ischnothelinae will be studied using
morphological features of the spiders and their webs, and patterns of their
mating and prey-capture behavior. Two undergraduate students will be involved in
systematic revision, analysis of ancestor-descendant relationships, and
interpretation of a variety of data sets, including spider behavior captured on
videotape. The wider implications of the proposed research derive from 1) the
use of spiders as a model system for the study of behavior, ecology and
evolution, and 2) their possible role in pest control. Adding the proposed work
to the PI's nearly completed study of a closely related genus (Euagrus) will
make diplurid spiders useful for testing competing hypotheses of biogeography.
Finally, the project will serve as a methodological standard for the assessment
of intra-specific variation in spider systematics.
