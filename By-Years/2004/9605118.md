9605118 Wells The Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the
University of Tulsa seeks to train students in the philosophy, mechanics, and
execution of scientific research. Site activities enhance an already strong
academic- year program in undergraduate research participation by increasing the
summer opportunities for students, many from regional colleges in Oklahoma and
beyond. The goals of the program are to provide research opportunities in
ecology, physiology, and evolutionary biology for students at regional schools
which lack a research focus, enhance opportunities for participation in
scientific research for members of under-represented groups, and strengthen the
summer research opportunities for University of Tulsa students. The overall
program formally involves a research workshop, independent research projects,
weekly group meetings, invited speakers, and a research colloquium. The research
workshop introduces students to the philosophy and mechanics of doing science,
emphasizes the development of skills in data a nalysis, and provides an
interactive framework for students to design individual projects. Projects focus
on areas of active research by faculty mentors, including foraging ecology,
microbial ecology, animal reproduction, and algal physiology and evolution. The
current Site program builds upon successful activities initiated under previous
awards as well as a long- standing commitment to undergraduate education and
research opportunities by the institution. An impressive record of publications
coauthored by undergraduate researchers and of presentations at regional and
national conferences attests to the commitment and mentoring skills of the
faculty.
