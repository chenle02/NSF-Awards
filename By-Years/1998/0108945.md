Professor Matthew B. Zimmt, of the Department of Chemistry at Brown University,
is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program for his studies
of functional architectures for electron transfer in solution and at electrodes.
A molecular scaffold will hold an electron donor and acceptor at a fixed
distance and orientation without providing significant electronic coupling.
Function will be introduced into this "test bridge" by attaching materials of
interest to the scaffold, directly between the donor and acceptor. The
donor/acceptor coupling provided by these molecular "test elements" will be
determined through measurement and analysis of photoinduced electron transfer
rate constants. A variety of test elements, representing structures found in
biological and technological electron transfer systems, will be examined.
Analogous introduction of function at electrode surfaces will also be explored,
through the design, synthesis, and analysis of molecules which bind specifically
to electrode surfaces.

Electron transfer events occur in many important processes in chemistry and
biology as well as in technological applications. Beyond their ubiquity,
electron transfer reactions are of fundamental interest for their unique
structural, thermodynamic, and medium dependence. The nature of the material
lying between the electron donor and the electron acceptor exerts a considerable
influence on the dynamics of the electron transfer event. The nuclear and
electronic structures of the intervening material determine the nature of the
transfer event, which may involve a hop into bound states of the material
(conduction) or tunneling through virtual states of the material. By designing
materials whose structure is susceptible to specific external stimuli and with
the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor
Matthew B. Zimmt, of the Department of Chemistry at Brown University, is
exploring the possibility of rationally controlling the nature and dynamics of
electron transfer processes.
