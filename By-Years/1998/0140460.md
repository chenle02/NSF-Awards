Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Mukhin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;E. Mukhin studies the
representation theory of affine Lie&lt;br/&gt;algebras and their quantizations
in several directions including the&lt;br/&gt;theory of coinvariants of
integrable representations of affine&lt;br/&gt;Kac-Moody algebras (with B.
Feigin, M. Jimbo and T. Miwa), the theory&lt;br/&gt;of finite-dimensional
representations of quantum affine groups (with&lt;br/&gt;E. Frenkel) and the
functors between categories of representations of&lt;br/&gt;Lie algebras and
quantum groups defined by Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov and&lt;br/&gt;quantized
Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations (with A. Varchenko). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project is expected to result in description of many features of&lt;br/&gt;the
beautiful algebraic-combinatorial structure related to&lt;br/&gt;representation
theory of complex semi-simple Lie algebras and their affine
and&lt;br/&gt;quantum analogs. In particular, this research has connections to
many areas of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics such as theory of symmetric functions and
combinatorics of&lt;br/&gt;Young tableaux, theory of special functions, exactly
solvable lattice&lt;br/&gt;models, conformal field theory, massive field theory
in 1+1&lt;br/&gt;dimensions, etc; as all these theories have symmetries
described in&lt;br/&gt;terms of Lie algebras of different kind.&lt;br/&gt;
