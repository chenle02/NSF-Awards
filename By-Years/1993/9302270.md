9302270 Grummon This project is a theoretical and experimental study of
thermoelastically active thin film structures. The theoretical effect focuses on
predictive strategies capturing deformation- and stress-states in variant
distributions generated by the experimental protocols involving nickel-titanium
thin films fabricated to contain semicoherent precipitates. Interfacial strain-
fields associated with the precipitates will enable cyclically reversible shape-
strains, available to do useful
