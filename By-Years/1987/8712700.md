Dr. Elliott-Fisk and her research team will conduct field and laboratory work
to determine the chronology and ecological impacts of volcanic activity in the
White Mountains region of California. Chemical analysis and radiometric dating
will be used to establish chronological markers that will form the basis for
this research and for further interdisciplinary research on ecosystem history in
the area. A second phase of the work will forecast the likely effects of future
volcanic eruptions from the Mono-Inyo craters. Research will focus on effects of
airborne volcanic materials on biotic components of the natural landscape in the
area, and on local and regional variations in such effects.
