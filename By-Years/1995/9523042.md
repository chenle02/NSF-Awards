y9523042 Thomas This project is for support of travel expenses for students and
non-PSERC faculty to attend a two-day conference. The Conference is sponsored by
the newly formed Power Systems Engineering Research Consortium (PSERC), EPRI and
the USDOE and will be of value to people from industry, government, and academia
with interests in the technical elements of the electric power industry
restructuring and of the associated public policy issues. Persons with technical
backgrounds will find the conference extremely informative about technical
issues and research frontiers. Persons with non-technical background will find
opportunities in the conference to develop a better understanding of power
system technologies, and of operational and planning issues associated with
providing universal customer choice. ***
