9400668 Goodge This award is for support to convene an international scientific
conference on the Ross Orogeny in Antarctica, entitled "Ross Orogen: Crustal
Structure and Plate Tectonic Significance". This workshop will be the third in a
series of international conferences (two previous meetings were held in the
Netherlands, 1992 and Italy, 1993) convened by the Lithospheric Investigation of
the Ross Sea Area (LIRA) group of earth scientists which is endorsed by the
Geology and Geophysics Working Groups of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic
Research (SCAR). Because of the strong U.S. activity in geological research in
the Transantarctic Mountains and the Ross Sea areas, it is appropriate to host
the next meeting at a U.S. institution. The proposed budget for conference
support includes planning, logistical and travel subsidy costs for U.S.
professional and student participants on an as-needed basis, with priority given
to students and post-doctoral researchers. ***
