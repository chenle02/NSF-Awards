This is a project in the area of algebraic geometry, which is the study of
shapes defined by polynomial equations. A fundamental topic in the field is
moduli theory, which aims to construct and study spaces that parametrize all
such shapes. For low dimensional shapes such moduli spaces are well understood,
but less is known in higher dimensions. Recently, new perspectives from
differential geometry have led to the construction of moduli spaces of certain
Fano varieties, which are a class of positively curved shapes. The aim of this
project is to apply newly developed techniques from the latter construction to
the moduli theory of other classes of shapes. The project offers training
opportunities for graduate students.

K-stabilty is an algebraic notion introduced by differential geometers to
characterize the existence of certain canonical metrics on complex projective
varieties. While the notion can be defined for any projective variety, recent
research has focused on the case of Fano varieties and culminated in an
application to algebraic geometry: the construction of projective moduli spaces
parametrizing K-stable Fano varieties. The goal of this project is to use tools
from birational geometry and K-stability to construct moduli spaces of other
classes of varieties. In particular, the PI will construct certain moduli of
K-unstable Fano varieties, motivated by the study of Kahler-Ricci solitons in
differential geometry. Next, the PI will develop new approaches for studying
moduli of K-trivial varieties. Finally, the PI will apply tools from birational
geometry to the study of K-stability of polarized varieties.
