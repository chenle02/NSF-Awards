Abstract

Award: DMS-0107018 Principal Investigator: Christopher M. Judge

The Bloomington Geometry Workshop is the first of an intended series of regional
conferences on geometry. The main purpose of the Bloomington Geometry Workshop,
to be held at the University of Indiana, is to promote scientific cooperation
and communication between geometers and geometric analysts in a region including
Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee.

Modern geometry addresses problems such as understanding the ways in which
typical spaces are curved and how far from the flat Euclidean model a space
might be, the influence of curvature upon analysis in a particular geometry,
interactions of large-scale geometry with probability theory and the algebraic
properties of the fundamental group, hyperbolic geometry and the portion of low-
dimensional topology that increasingly depends upon hyperbolic structures, and
gauge field theories and other ideas from theoretical physics.
