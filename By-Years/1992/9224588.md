Large scale disasters challenge the orderly functioning of the social system and
control of deviance in a social system. Hurricane Andrew presents an immediate
situation in which to examine the breakdown, maintenance, or re-organization of
social control. This project will explore the impact of the hurriance on law and
informal social control in the Miami area. Observations and interviews with law
enforcement officials and residents will be conducted in areas of major impact
from the hurricane. The selected sites will provide variations in class and
ethnicity of the affected populations and degree of destruction in the affected
areas. Supplemental interviews will be conducted with University of Florida
students whose homes are in the hurricane-affected areas. The research is guided
by Black's theory of the behavior of law and routine activities theory of crime.
The aim is to explore the interaction for formal and informal control and the
extent to which social control breaks down or is maintained under disaster
conditions. Not only will many questions of theoretical significance to
understanding social control be explored but the research has immediate
practical implications for policy and planning in the wake of such disasters.
