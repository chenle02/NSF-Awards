The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the
synthesis of new polysiloxane-polyimide co-polymers for use as high-temperature
resistant polymeric matrix materials. Phase I will develop new highly usable
synthetic methodologies for the production of inorganic-organic hybrid materials
composed of cross-linked polysiloxane-polyimide segments. The cross-linking or
curing (hydrosilylation) reaction may be conducted at room temperature, thus
providing the opportunity to develop a non-autoclave or low-temperature curing
system, similar to the well-established room temperature vulcanization process
widely used in the silicone industry. The expected high-performance polymeric
materials would be employed in Phase II as matrix materials for low-temperature
fabrication of polymeric matrix composites (PMC). In Phase II polymer
formulation will be optimized, and distinctive PMC components will be fabricated
by employing proprietary low-cost resin transfer molding technologies.

Commercial applications are expected in low-temperature curable/high-temperature
resistant cure-in-place materials. Potential fields of application include
automotive components, aeronautics, microelectronics, composites, construction
materials, and other industries where outstanding thermal, chemical (solvents
and oxidation resistance), physical, and mechanical properties are important.
