This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project has as its main
objective the development of a solar telescope and detector capable of imaging
heat flow inhomogeneities at the sun's photosphere, with uniform photometric
response over all wavelengths between the ultraviolet and infrared. Such a Solar
Bolometric Imager (SBI) would provide an innovative new tool for identifying
mechanisms of long-term solar luminosity variation. These variations are of
great interest in studies of climate fluctuation, an issue of central importance
in Global Change studies. The opportunity for innovation arises from recent
advances in uncooled, relatively high-definition (80,000 element) thermal
arrays. The main aim in Phase I is to determine whether the spectral absorptance
of these arrays can be modified by careful deposition of gold blacks, to provide
uniform response over the wavelength range between 0.33( and about 2( containing
most of the solar radiation that reaches the Earth's surface. If this can be
achieved while retaining the detectivity and time constant of the array, an all-
reflecting telescope to complete the design of the SBI will be designed in Phase
I. The SBI will be constructed and operated for one year in Phase II, during the
period of increasing solar activity in the forthcoming sunspot cycle 23. A
successful ground-based SBI would form the basis for a space-borne SBI as an
imaging complement to absolute radiometers used for measuring fluctuations in
the total irradiance. Commercial applications of bolometric imaging with
relatively high angular definition include remote sensing and industrial
metrology (calibration of thermographic cameras, lighting design, combustion
research and monitoring). A high definition, uncooled array with good response
in the near-IR could also provide the focal plane for a convenient and
inexpensive false color spectral imaging camera with many niche applications in
biomedical imaging, process control and non-destructive testing.
