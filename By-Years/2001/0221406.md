Spiegelman&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0221406&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The distribution of melt
and solid within partially molten regions of the Earth's mantle is one of the
key parameters controlling the dynamics, properties and compositions of these
regions. Field observations, experiments and theory all suggest that melt should
be distributed in some form of channelized network at depth but the physical
mechanisms for producing these networks are still not well understood. This
project will develop new tools to investigate mechanical instabilities for flow
localization based on fluid flow in deformable permeable media with strongly
variable solid shear viscosity. These tools will complement existing models for
flow localization due to reactive melt transport. Developing accurate flow
solvers in heterogeneous media is numerically quite challenging, however, the
investigation will be guided by recent experiments from David Kohlstedt's
laboratory (U. Minnesota) on flow induced melt localization that provide clear
and diagnostic tests for the theory. The opportunity to directly combine theory
and experiment is rare and the investigators plan to work closely in
consultation with the Kohlstedt group. However, the initial objective of this
project is the development of the needed numerical tools. Once developed and
validated with the experimental results, they will be used to extrapolate the
experimental results to larger scales and investigate geologically relevant
systems such as melt transport beneath mid-ocean ridges and island
arcs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
