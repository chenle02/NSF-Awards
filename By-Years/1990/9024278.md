The selection of combinations of sites at which to locate facilities has long
been an important issue within the theoretical domain of geography and related
scientific disciplines; site selection also has an immense range of practical
applications for businesses, governmental agencies, and other organizations.
Critical limitation on the development of more sophisticated location decision-
making procedures have been capacity constraints on computational systems. With
large numbers of possible combinations to be explored, the storage and
processing capacities of even the largest computers quickly are exceeded. Other
limitations on the development of practical locational decision-support systems
have been difficulties in developing clear, effective, and accurate displays of
the results of computational procedures. Even when procedures succeed, users
frequently must wade through enormous tables in order to obtain the information
on which a decision ultimately is based. This project will try to diminish both
sets of limitations. One line of inquiry will consist of the development and
testing of new algorithms that will allow use of parallel computing systems for
the solution of locational decision problems. The second line of inquiry will
focus on the development of more effective visual displays of data and solutions
through the use of object-oriented programming techniques. This project will
test the use of parallel computing architectures for the solution of complex
locational decision problems. Although concentrating on combinatorial site-
selection problems, the results of this research will provide insights into the
utility of parallel structures for solution of a much wider range of
computational problems. The project also will significantly enhance
understandings of the efficacy of object-oriented programming methods for more
effective visualization of the results of locational decision-making processes.
In doing so, broader issues of visualization of computer- generated data and
solutions will be addressed.
