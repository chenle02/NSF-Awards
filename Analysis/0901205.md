This project will focus on a variety of topics in complex analysis and related
geometric theories, including the following interconnected subjects: i) the
study of invariant geometric properties of real hypersurfaces in complex
projective space; ii) the study of the Leray transform, a multivariate
generalization of the Cauchy transform, with special attention to the
information it provides about pairing of Hardy spaces on dual hypersurfaces in
complex projective space; iii) continuation of a project with Mike Bolt to
investigate geometric and analytic topics relating to a variety of invariant arc
lengths including that of Laguerre; iv) extension and application of the theory
of Fefferman's equi-holomorphically invariant boundary measure with particular
attention to an associated variational problem.

Functions of complex variables arise naturally and play an important role in
many parts of mathematics, physics and engineering. This project is focused on
issues of boundary geometry and analysis which are fundamental in nature. In
particular, the study of the Leray transform and related matters has substantial
connections with the Laplace transform, an important tool in the study of
partial differential equations. The project borrows from (and, it is hoped, will
contribute to) a variety of geometric theories of independent interest. Finally,
the project will involve work with younger investigators and thus will help to
ensure that expertise in this area is available in the future.
