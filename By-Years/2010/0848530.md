This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop a power
generation device capable of converting waste heat into electricity with much
lower cost/watt than existing devices. This work is accomplished by bringing
together principles of physics and materials science in practical wafer scale
semiconductor manufacturing, enabling new, low cost products.

The thermoelectric power generation devices to be developed in this work are key
to realizing the often touted but yet unrealized societal benefits of
thermoelectric power generation. Examples of benefits that can be forseen in the
initial target market, the transportation industry, are economic benefits for
the public from reduced fuel consumption and reduced environmental impact due to
more efficient operation.
