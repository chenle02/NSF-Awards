CCF-0447697&lt;br/&gt;Dan Grossman&lt;br/&gt;University of
Washington&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAREER: Clamp: Language Support for C-Level
Abstraction, Modularity, and Portability&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
involves the design, implementation, and evaluation of new programming-language
technologies (in a new language called "Clamp") for modular and portable low-
level software. The goal is to provide a&lt;br/&gt;language for programmers that
allows for machine-specific assumptions where necessary and a powerful system
for ensuring such assumptions are never made implicitly. Doing so should make it
easier to build&lt;br/&gt;robust software infrastructure and detect defects
early in the software-development process. Automated support for checking low-
level invariants should also make it easier to teach reliable-software idioms to
students and professionals. Key technical difficulties in providing a safe-but-
convenient low-level language are support for alias analysis (determining when
program expressions refer to the same memory) and compile-time arithmetic
(reasoning about the possible results of a numeric computation). Therefore, the
Clamp infrastructure is intended to make it easy to use different approaches to
these problems with minimal change to the Clamp implementation.
