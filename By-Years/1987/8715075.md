This award will support collaborative research between Prof. Herbert Carlin of
Cornell University and Prof. Pier P. Civalleri of the Istituto Politecnico di
Torino in Turin, Italy. The design of broad band analog circuits, particularly
at frequencies in the microwave spectrum and higher, has become increasingly
important in recent years. The application to very broad band microwave field
effect transistor (FET) amplifiers is of great current interest. The theoretical
basis for such applications is gain-bandwidth theory or, equivalently, broad
band matching theory. Previous work by the U.S. P.I. and others has led to the
development of a new bandwidth theory, called the real frequency method, as an
alternative to analytic gain-bandwidth theory. The latter, dependent on
analytical specifity of the appropriate function of the complex frequency
variable, has several drawbacks that make it numerically intractable for loads
of modest complexity. By contrast, the real frequency method handles loads of
arbitrary complexity and directly utilizes real frequency numerical data. The
investigators plan to extend the real frequency method they have developed for
single input-single output systems with complex terminations, to the n-port
equalizer problem. They also plan to specifically concentrate on viewing a
multi-element distributed amplifier as a multichannel problem so as to develop
simple parameter structures with optimum flat gain response. The investigators
bring to the collaboration past successful experience in working jointly on
research problems in this area. Wide band multichannel equalizers find important
applications to systems in which multiplicity of complex loads must be
simultaneously matched to one or more sources. Examples are generalized
frequency crossover networks, multiplexing applications, and broad band
amplifiers using many active elements.
