Museum collections are the main repository for past and current baseline
biodiversity information. In order to utilize that baseline information as fully
as possible for research and management decisions, the information must be
available. This project will convert separate collections in Colorado into one
distributed biodiversity database and research toolkit for the southern and
central Rockies and adjacent plains. This area features tremendous biological
diversity and has experienced and continues to experience many environmental
changes that impact biodiversity. The collection involves almost 300,000
biological specimens. The format relies upon linking data to a geographic
information system database. The system will allow for the query, analysis and
synthesis of local and network information through a web interface, for
researchers, managers and educators, as well as the public.
