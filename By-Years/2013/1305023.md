Project Description: &lt;br/&gt;This effort involves the creation and
implementation of an I-Corps Regional Node in New York (New York City Regional
Innovation Node - NYCRIN), which is being led by City University of New York
(CUNY) in partnership with New York University (NYU) and Columbia University.
The Node is leveraging the existing innovation ecosystem present in New York
City (NYC) to create a cooperative center that is connected to the national
I-Corps innovation network. NYCRIN is building upon established technology
development collaborations that are involved with the fundamental research being
conducted at the three partnering institutions. NYCRIN is providing innovators
throughout the United States with a structured portal for access to the unique
NYC-regional combination of world-class universities, venture capital investment
resources, and one of the nation's fastest growing technology start-up
environments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Significance:
&lt;br/&gt;NYCRIN is promoting diversity and outreach activities to Small
Business Development Centers throughout New York State. The Node is offering
scalable workshops, seminars and counseling sessions to disseminate best
practices and the "Lean" methods to non-academic audiences, technology
entrepreneurs, and community partners. It is further leveraging and supporting a
number of unique training activities, for example: 1) a week-long "sprint" for
developing and iterating technical product ideas in small collaborative teams
and 2) events that draw hundreds of students to NYC to build new products
collaboratively over a limited time period. The Node also includes a wide range
of other universities (public, private, and small private technology colleges)
in a four state region; providing them with open-source tools and online access
to information - to more broadly disseminate NYCRIN activities and outputs. The
Node is further networking with local community colleges that have linkages to
workforce development efforts and small businesses.
