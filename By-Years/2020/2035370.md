The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a novel solution for bone repair and replacement scaffolds. In
the United States alone, 5-10% of fracture repairs experience delayed healing or
non-union, which means close to 800,000 patients suffer from reoperation or
complications. 3D printing will make this method of creating bone scaffolds
affordable and attainable. The proposed technology provides 3D printed,
customizable, ceramic bone scaffolds that are biocompatible and mimic the
mechanical properties of native bone. Using 3D printing as an affordable
manufacturing process to make the novel scaffold will provide a way for bone
repairs to be more accessible and successful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps
project is based on the development of a powder preparation technique that
produces customizable bone scaffolds via a custom-made powder-based 3D printer.
The proposed technology addresses major issues with current methods of repairing
or replacing bone injuries. Novel features of the scaffolds produced using the
proposed technology include injury-specific geometry, strength as high as native
bone, biocompatible ceramic material, and highly tailorable
properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
