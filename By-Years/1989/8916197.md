Most Grenville-age terranes in North America are composed of granulite and
amphibolite grade metamorphic rocks, and under- standing of the structural
development is obscured by the meta- morphism. In the Van Horn Mountains of West
Texas a late Precambrian orogenic belt is preserved from shallow crustal
environments. The objective of this project is to integrate structure,
sedimentology and geochronology to characterize timing and style of deformation
along this southern boundary of the Proto-North American craton. Results will
provide an unusually clear picture of the tectonic evolution of this Grenville-
age terrane.
