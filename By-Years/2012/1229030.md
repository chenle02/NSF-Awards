With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and support from
the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Programs Professor
John Sheridan from Rutgers Universvity Newark and colleagues Frank Jordan, Elena
Galoppini, Frieder Jaekle and Darren Hansen will aquire a 500 MHz NMR
spectrometer. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education
at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) development of functional
conjugated macrocycles and polymers for optoelectronic applications and
synthesis of chiral Lewis pairs for small molecule activation; (b) investigation
of stimuli-responsive metal-containing polymers; (c) synthesis of functional
molecules for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), host-guest complexes, and
biosensors; (d) development of sustainable polymers from renewable resources;
(e) investigation of thiamin diphosphate (ThDP)-dependent enzymes as well as
synthesis of labeled coenzymes, substrate analogues and inhibitors; and (f)
mechanistic studies on quinolone quorum
sensing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the
elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out
frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in
synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry.
Many research projects associated with this application will have a direct
impact on society, as they aim to develop polymers fo optoelectronics, metal
containing polymers, materials for solar cells, and investigations of enzyme
inhibitors and bio-sensing. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching
as well as research at Rutgers University Newark.
