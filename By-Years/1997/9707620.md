9707620 Kelley Sexual reproduction among plants and animals is thought to serve
an important function which is to either reduce the incidence of disease, by
producing genetically variable offspring which escape infection, or to repair
genetic damage caused by deleterious mutations, which accumulate in organisms.
The proposed research will investigate the importance of disease and mutation
for offspring fitness, using a plant which is capable of both sexual and asexual
reproduction. The fitness effects of viral disease and mutational damage will be
measured in a field situation. Results obtained from this research will explain
the evolutionary and ecological significance of genetic diversity in natural
populations. They will provide a measure of the speed with which diseases can
evolve increased virulence in response to particular host genotypes. These
results will be directly relevant to understanding the origin of emerging
diseases. Finally, experiments will yield an estimate of the consequences of
genetic damage for natural populations. The consequences of environmental
changes affecting mutation rates can be better understood as a result.
