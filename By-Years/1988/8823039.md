In the spring of 1989 an extensive campaign will take place at the Arecibo
Observatory in Puerto Rico. This study on the dynamics of the mesosphere and
lower thermosphere will combine the largest collection of instruments ever
assembled at one location to study this important region of the atmosphere. This
award provides for the inclusion of an imaging doppler interferometer radar in
this campaign in order to maximize the participation and obtainable science in
this endeavor. The overall program will include the Arecibo incoherent scatter
radar, coherent radars, meteor radars, optical imagers and spectroscopic,
interferometric and photometric instruments distributed at a number of locations
in Puerto Rico.
