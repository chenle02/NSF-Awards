This award supports a two-year collaborative research project between Professor
James McGuire of Tulane University and Professor Michio Matsuzawa, The
University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo. Also involved in the project are
Professor C.D. Lin of Kansas State University and Dr. Mineo Kimura of Argonne
National Laboratory in the United States and several scientists from the
University of Tsukuba and Kyoto University in Japan. The goal is to continue
research underway in atomic and molecular collisions. The results of the studies
will be tested at several experimental facilities in the United States, Japan,
and Europe. The groups at Tulane and the University of Tsukuba will continue
calculations of double ionization of helium by photons to further understanding
of the dynamics of few electron atomic processes. The groups at Kansas State and
the University of Electro- Communications as well as the University of Tsukuba
and Kyoto University will work on the structures and the dynamics of few
electron atoms. The groups at Argonne and the University of Electro-
Communications will study the formation of doubly excited states. The results
are expected to resolve some conflict and clarify understanding of the nature of
few-electron effects in atomic and molecular dynamics and produce new computer
codes useful for evaluating properties of few and many electron systems.
