Supernovae are the most energetic stellar explosions known. They eject the
exploding stars' outer envelopes (in many cases having several times the mass of
the sun) into space at speeds of several 1000 km/sec to a few 10,000 km/sec. The
ejecta expand into the surrounding interstellar gas, compress it, and in many
cases induce star formation. The Principal Investigator proposes to study
computationally the interaction between supernova ejecta and the interstellar
gas. He also proposes to study certain details of the supernova explosion, such
as the matter falling onto the compact object remaining after the explosion.
Further-more, he proposes to use the same numerical techniques used in the
supernova study to investigate galaxy formation.
