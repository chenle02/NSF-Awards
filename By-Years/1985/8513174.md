The mass transfer characteristics of bubbles released from rubber sheet spargers
are investigated. Single hole studies on bubble formation confirm the original
contention that the self-regulation of elastic holes has a significant effect on
formation dynamics of bubbles released from the sparger. New experiments are
designed to show in vivid color the structure of the mixing and circulation
induced by an elastic membrane sparger (flexisparger). Initial acid base
experiments suggest that flexispargers induce swirl flow. Preliminary work shows
that flexispargers produce enormous enhancements in k;iLa, and large reductions
in axial mixing. Additional experiments are being initiated to measure the
dispersion characteristics, the interfacial areas, and the mass transfer
coefficients of bubbles generated by these spargers.
