This project will describe the spatial and temporal patterns of trophic
structure and the proportion of total biomass in primary producer, primary
consumer, and secondary consumer trophic levels in a desert stream ecosystem.
The spatial context for this description will be a hierarchical arrangement of
patches from the relatively small scale of algal or macrophyte assemblages to
large scale run-riffle-pool habitats. Temporal change will be assessed along
successional trajectories associated with flooding and drying. Losses and gains
of biomass at each trophic level will be evaluated both within and between
patches to determine how patches are linked. Experiments will identify
mechanisms shaping trophic structure and causing observed temporal changes in
trophic structure. Mesocosm experiments will manipulate resources and consumers
in 3-level systems, and a natural stream experiment will manipulate nutrients
and top predators. Descriptive and experimental results will be used to evaluate
ecosystem-level consequences of specific trophic configurations; this evaluation
will indicate whether change in community-level properties drives change in
ecosystem structure and function. This research explores questions concerned
with the relative influence of top-down (propagated from the top to the bottom
of the food chain) and bottom-up (propagated from the base) processes in
determining patterns observed in nature. These are important issues concerned
with the responses of ecological systems to disturbance. The facilities for this
research are excellent; the investigators are productive and innovative experts
in the area of stream ecology.
