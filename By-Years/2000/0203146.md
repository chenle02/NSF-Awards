Experimental Computer Science: Haptic Representation and Rendering of Complex
Contact States&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is concerned with 1)
how to simulate, with high fidelity in a virtual environment, the effect felt by
a human operator holding one or more parts during a manual assembly or
manipulation process, and 2) how to automatically render such an effect in real-
time so that a human in a virtual environment feels as though the parts are
real. The experimental and interdisciplinary nature of the proposed research
will provide opportunities for the postdoctoral associate to broaden and deepen
research skills and expertise in geometric and physical computation algorithms,
human-computer interaction, mechanics of robotic manipulation, computer
simulation, animation, teleoperation, and collaboration over the Internet.
Potential applications of the proposed research include virtual prototyping,
distance learning, e-commerce, and entertainment.&lt;br/&gt;
