This project centers around the interactions between periods of automorphic
forms, automorphic representations, and arithmetic algebraic geometry. In
particular the PIs propose to work on several problems on the general derivative
conjecture, analysis and arithmetic of Fourier coefficients on exceptional
groups, bounds on heights, computational study of nontempered periods,
averages/nonvanishing of derivatives of L-series. Recently the study of periods
has yielded new results and proofs about L-functions, breakthroughs towards
conjectures about algebraic cycles, and new perspectives on classical questions
of representation theory. Combined with other tools, periods have also enhanced
our understanding of equidistribution problems and topology on locally symmetric
spaces. The PIs are at the forefront of these developments. The proposed
framework presents an ambitious plan to work on and formulate conjectures
incorporating/connecting the recent groundbreaking works in these areas.

The research topic is central to several areas of mathematics (arithmetic
geometry, automorphic representation theory, analytic number theory). A long
range goal of the project is to establish a network of scientists working in
automorphic representations, number theory, and arithmetic geometry. The PIs
envision a group of PhD students and post-docs participating actively in the
proposed Research Retreats and Annual Workshops. This group would include the 15
PhD students presently advised by the PIs.
