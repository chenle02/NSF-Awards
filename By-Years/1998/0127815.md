The objective of this Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) project is to
establish a unifying taxonomy of features selection. Feature selection is used
in used in various applications, including pattern recognition, machine
learning, datamining or decision making, to choose the most appropriate subset
of features among the available ones for the task. It can be viewed as an
optimization problem of exponential time complexity along several dimensions.
Many feature selection algorithms have been developed and deployed in real-world
applications. However, there exists a distinct gap between what theory suggests
and what practice reveals, and the proliferation of feature selection algorithms
makes it very difficult to fully understand the various feature selection
techniques and construct a general methodology for feature selection. It is
time-critical that these issues are addressed and a unifying taxonomy is
developed, to facilitate new research, development and tools in feature
selection. This project explores the first step toward dealing with these
issues. The task of establishing a unifying taxonomy for feature selection is
accomplished in two steps: (1) defining a common platform to consider
representative algorithms on the equal footing; and (2) building a unifying
taxonomy to discover how the algorithms complement each other and what is
missing. The approach includes collection of representative data and algorithms
and conducting comparative experiments to determine the characteristics of the
feature selection algorithms, their performance on different data and tasks. The
expected results of this project include a contemporary survey, a unifying
taxonomy of feature selection algorithms, and some potential solutions to the
automatic selection problem -- being able to automatically choose the most
suitable feature selection algorithm with given the problem conditions. The
progress and updates of the project, and the resulting survey and unifying
taxonomy will be available online.
