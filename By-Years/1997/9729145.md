Abstract ATM-9729145 Markgraf, Vera University of Colorado Title: Support for
the Scientific Meeting PEP 1: Paleoclimate of the Americas; March 16-20, 1998 in
Merida, Venezuela This award supports the first scientific meeting of the Pole-
Equator-Pole Paleoclimate of the Americas (PEP 1) Project. It will be held in
Merida, Venezuela, March 16 to 20, 1998, under the auspices of the Universidad
de Los Andes (Centro de Investigaciones Ecologicas de Los Andes Tropicales,
CIELAT, and Centro InterAmericano De Desarollo e Investigacion Ambiental y
Territorial, CIDIAT). The objective of this meeting is to review the progress
achieved since the 1993 initiation of the PEP 1 Project. The PEP 1 Project is
designed to further our understanding of inter-hemispheric climate linkages,
past and present. The Merida meeting will address inter-hemispheric aspects of
character, timing, and forcing of climate variability and climate change in the
Americas and present information from the atmospheric, marine terrestrial and
polar ice caps realms. The topics are: Modern Climate Modes and Variability,
Last 2000 Years of Climate Variability, El Nino/Southern Oscillation Climate
Variability and Teleconnections, Mid-Holocene Climates, Late Glacial Climate
Variability, Climate of the Last Glacial Maximum, and Human Dimensions of
Climate Change.
