The purpose of this proposal is to support the Institute of Ethnology and
Anthropology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, in connection with planning
for The Seventh International Conference on Hunting and Gathering Societies
(August 1993). There is an extremely limited ethnographic and ethnohistoric data
base on indigenous peoples in the Russian North. This meeting will facilitate
the first meaningful worldwide communication with scholars and native peoples
within Russia, and lay the groundwork for future international research support
and collaboration in northern ethnography, anthropology, lingusitics and
archaeology.
