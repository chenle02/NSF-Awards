This project provides travel support for 10-15 students attending the 2016
Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC). ACSAC, which is
celebrating its 32nd year, is a top-tier academic security conference that
attracts averages about 250-300 highly skilled security professionals and
student attendees per year. ACSAC has carved a unique role as a security
conference equally attended by academia, industry, and government. In addition
to the technical papers, the conference program will include keynotes by
distinguished speakers, tutorials, case studies, panels, a poster session, and
works-in-progress talks. This project will help to groom the next generation of
cybersecurity professionals by facilitating interaction of students with experts
in the field.
