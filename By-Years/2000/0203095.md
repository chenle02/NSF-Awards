This two-day symposium on self-assembled photonic band gap materials will take
place at the Spring 2002 American Chemical Society Meeting in Orlando, FL. The
symposium will address a diverse array of subjects ranging from organic
synthesis to optical characterization. In order to maximize the benefit of this
symposium, it will begin with three tutorial lectures that will head from
conventional optics to a description of photonic materials. The tutorials will
give the participants the necessary background. The organizers have invited a
diverse array of speakers from industry and academia, including a number of
Assistant Professors. They will also encourage graduate students to present
their latest results at the symposium. The funds obtained from the National
Science Foundation will be used primarily to support the participation of
Assistant Professors and graduate students.
