This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project relies on a novel
and surprising physiological phenomenon recently published by the company and
its academic collaborators: That magnetic gradient fields used in MRI can be
dramatically increased without causing unpleasant nerve stimulation, if the
rise- and fall-times of the gradient pulse are kept below 10 microseconds. This
physiological principle can be used to advantage in dental MRI, where the
magnetization decay in bone is so short that conventional MRI pulse sequences
are of limited use, and where high gradients can yield improved spatial
resolution with reduced artifacts from metallic materials (e.g., orthodontics).
The small field-of-view required for dental MRI suggests that it will be
possible to develop of a low-cost system (i.e., &lt;$20,000) that will compete
effectively with conventional x-ray based technologies. Introduction of this
device will reduce the cumulative x-ray dose delivered to the American
population, which has been shown to contribute to increase the incidence of
certain cancers. Phase I of the project will consist of construction of a
prototype system, with comparable diagnostic performance to x-ray-based dental
imaging, evaluated on cadaveric human teeth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
impact/commercial potential of this project will be multi-fold: It will help
reverse the trend of constructing ever-larger diagnostic imaging devices, which
contributes to high overall health care costs in the USA. The increase in cost
of imaging systems is driven by several factors: (1) It is more profitable for
the few companies who sell capital medical equipment to sell an expensive system
than a low-cost system, and (2) radiologists, who represent the traditional
customer for the vendors of MRI systems, are trained on systems that can examine
all parts of the human body. The company proposes a contrarian approach, in
which a cost-effective device serves the needs of cost-sensitive specialists
(i.e., dentists). The company?s staff has extensive experience in marketing
organ-specific systems, having sold breast imaging devices that reduced the need
for expensive MRI studies. The significant marketing advantage of reduced
pediatric exposure ionizing radiation will accelerate penetration into the $30
billion global dental marketplace. Finally, the ultra-fast pulse sequences to be
developed in this project are likely to be helpful in other scientific
investigations of solid-state phenomena, such as electron paramagnetic resonance
imaging.
