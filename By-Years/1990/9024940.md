The Rosensteil School of Marine Science at the University of Miami will acquire
several items of oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of shared
use equipment. This equipment is maintained for use on or in association with
the two research vessels operated by the university. A substantial part of the
ships' operating schedule during 1991 is in support of NSF-sponsored research
projects. The instrumentation will also increase the capabilities of the ship
and of the University to support research and engineering activities. The
instrumentation includes: -Newly developed Rosette water sampler to improve the
collection of discrete seawater samples at specific water depths, -Water sampler
bottles for the new Rosette system, - Microcomputer system upgrade and other
peripheral equipment for increasing shared-use, sea-going computing
capabilities, -precision temperature sensors for the CTD, -Precision acoustic
altimeter for use in determining the precise position of a scientific instrument
package relative to the seafloor, and -Terminal server for enhancing scientific
data transfer and communications amongst scientific users of the ship, -Salinity
bottles for storing seawater samples, -A precision salinometer for determining
the salinity of seawater, -Electronic reversing thermometers for calibrating
deep sea temperature measurements, -Electronic analytical balance, and -Piston
corer barrels for collecting profiles of seafloor sediments. The instrumentation
described above will increase the capability of the University to support NSF-
sponsored research and engineering projects.
