The Principal Investigator (PI) will investigate the origin of white-light solar
flare emission by using observations and numerical simulations of precipitating
high energy particles and of their concomitant heating of the lower solar
atmosphere. This study will take advantage of existing adaptive-optics-equipped
facilities at the Dunn Solar Telescope in New Mexico and the German Vacuum Tower
Telescope in the Canary Islands, as well as new adaptive-optics-equipped
facilities that are expected to become available during the course of this
project, namely, the New Solar Telescope at Big Bear Solar Observatory in
California and the Gregor Telescope in the Canary islands. The high cadence and
high resolution observations of the Sun made by these instruments in near-
infrared and visible light wavelengths will be supplemented by imaging
spectroscopy of selected spectral lines and by spacecraft measurements of the
Sun's hard X-ray emissions, which is a direct diagnostic of energetic particle
acceleration. The PI will compare these observations with existing models to
better understand the heating process of the lower solar atmosphere and to
optimize the parameterizations within these models.

This effort will provide for the professional development of the PI as a young
postdoctoral investigator and it will enhance global research infrastructure by
promoting international collaboration among solar physics institutes in China,
Germany, and the USA. White-light flares fall within the class of solar flares
that are usually very strong and can cause adverse space weather effects at
Earth. Therefore, a better understanding of their behavior will help to
construct improved space weather models and operational forecasts for the
benefit of society. The results of this study will also be applicable to
research in stellar astrophysics and plasma physics.
