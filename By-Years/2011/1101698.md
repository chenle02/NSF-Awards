Harmonic Analysis is the theory of the Fourier transform operator acting on
complex valued functions on various fields, such as, finite fields, p-adic
fields, reals and the complex numbers. Interestingly, the Fourier transform is a
part of a family of operators, that satisfy relations with respect to one
another that can be described by a group symmetry structure, strongly related to
the symplectic group. This family is called the Weil representation. The Weil
representation serves as a bridge that connects classical harmonic analysis with
representation theory, it also gives a powerful fresh perspective about the very
nature of the theory. Furthermore, the Weil representation is governed by an
object from algebraic geometry, called the geometric Weil representation. The
geometric Weil representation, developed by the authors, serves as a bridge that
connects between harmonic analysis and algebraic geometry, hence enables to
solve analytic problems using modern cohomological techniques. The present
project revolves around the following themes: canonical model of the Weil
representation and its geometrization, the Weil representation in characteristic
two, the Weil representation of symplectic similitudes, and applications to
various fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will enhance our understanding
of the representation theoretic and algebraic geometric structures that underlie
harmonic analysis and their applications. It will also reveal new perspectives
about classical statements from number theory and analysis. The PI and Co-PI
have presented their work in numerous classes and seminars over the past years.
They are also collaborating with people from other scientific areas, such as
engineering and physics, on the applications of their results to questions
outside pure mathematics. They strongly believe that their methods and results
are of interest to the broader scientific community and has the potential to
have radical impact on disciplines outside of mathematics.
