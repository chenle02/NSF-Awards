This dissertation research award will support an anthropology graduate student
in the Indian Himalayas to study the socio- economic implications of male out-
migration on indigenous gender perceptions. Women in the local society often
manage domestic as well as agricultural work since their husbands are away.
Traditional views on the sexual division of labor will be analyzed. Methods used
include structured and informal interviews, censuses, cognitive analyses and
time allocation studies in a context of an extensive period of participant
observation. This research is important because male labor migration occurs in
most regions of the world, and understanding how the absence of males affects
the behavior and understanding of women's places in society can help us
understand how to stimulate economic development in the local areas.
