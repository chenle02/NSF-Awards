&lt;br/&gt;Information and Communications Technology (ICT) infrastructure
failures and cyber attacks are realities that can have catastrophic societal
effects. Information Assurance (IA) can be defined as the operations undertaken
to protect and defend ICT systems by ensuring their dependability and security.
There is a critical need for systematic IA methods that enable ICT systems to
adapt and survive any type of disruption or attack. A major hurdle in the
development of IA techniques is the lack of models and metrics which enable one
to determine the effectiveness of IA mechanisms. This exploratory project seeds
a collaborative effort between three PIs at different institutions: Duke
University, University of Missouri Kansas-City, and the University of Pittsburgh
focused on the development of metrics and models that will allow one to
quantitatively study the technical aspects of information assurance (IA) for the
network component of the ICT infrastructure. The basis of the approach is to
unify attack trees, attack graphs, privilege graphs and fault trees into a
common scalable framework with a well defined set of metrics and application
scenarios. Extensions of the basic model that include state information,
stochastic properties and rewards via Markov chains and stochastic Petri nets,
enabling a wider variety of attack and fault scenarios are being studied. The
impact of the models and metrics developed is that they provide the techniques
and tools necessary to determine the effectiveness of IA mechanisms and allow
one to detect bottlenecks and to evaluate the tradeoffs between levels of
information assurance, performance and cost.&lt;br/&gt;
