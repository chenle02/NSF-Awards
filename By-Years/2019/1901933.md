Algebraic geometry is the study of shapes that can be defined using polynomial
equations. It has immense expressive power, leading to its incorporation into
numerous applied and pure mathematical disciplines. It is an ancient subject,
experiencing several flowerings over centuries. Many recent breakthroughs in
mathematics rely on algebro-geometric techniques. In its classical form,
algebraic geometry plays an essential role in photogrammetry and computer
vision, yielding key computational techniques and algorithms that are run
billions of times per day all over the world. In its modern form, it is a
cornerstone of cryptography, internet communications, and national security. It
is a crucial technical tool in modern number theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI
will study problems in several areas of the subject. He will continue his work
on derived categories and reconstruction results, focusing on the properties of
filtered derived equivalences and on new topological reconstruction techniques,
analogous to classical results of Torelli, Gabriel, and others, that have been
developed by the PI and his collaborators. He will expand the study of the
Brauer group from varieties to rigid analytic spaces, aiming to establish
foundational results for rigid spaces that extend known results for classical
analytic spaces. He will also continue his study of the algebraic geometry of
computer vision using modern techniques, building on work done by the PI and
collaborators in recent years. This has potential uses in the development of new
algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
