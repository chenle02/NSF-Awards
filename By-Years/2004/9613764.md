Abstract ATM-9613764 Somerville, Richard C.J. University of California, San
Diego Title: Direct Validation of GCM Parameterizations Against TOGA- COARE
Observations This grant supports a program of research that uses TOGA COARE data
sets for the testing and validation of physical parameterizations used in
numerical climate models. The focus is on the parameterization of atmospheric
convection and cloud radiation interactions. The idea is to use a one
dimensional diagnostic model of the atmospheric column overlying a region of the
size of a single GCM (General Circulation Model) grid cell coupled to a mixed
layer ocean model. Horizontal flux convergences are specified by the observed
COARE data and the Single Column Model (SCM) is integrated in time. The SCM
output like temperature, humidity, clouds and their properties, diabatic heating
terms, surface energy balance terms etc. are compared with observations and
scientific inferences are drawn. This work will not only result in comparing
different parameterizations but also in improving them and in turn the climate
models are also.
