This experimental research program is aimed at using high-order generation in
molecules by interaction of radiation from tabletop lasers for producing
ultrafast, coherent x-rays. Unlike the extensive research on high harmonic
generation in atoms, the experimental study of harmonic generation in molecules
is still in its infancy. Many interesting theoretical predications are yet to be
confirmed to understand the differences between harmonic generation in molecules
and that in atoms. In particular, this work will study harmonic generation with
aligned molecules. The Kansas Light Source laser, which produces three
millijoule, 25 femtosecond or 0.5 millijoule, seven femtosecond pulses, will be
used to conduct the research. The broader impact of the program will be both the
basic atomic physics research and the applications of the ultrafast x-ray
sources in biology and other fields.
