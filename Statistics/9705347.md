McCullagh 9705347 This research will examine a number of issues, all bearing
directly or indirectly on statistical models of the generalized linear type. A
major part of the work is concerned with multivariate models, either graphical
dependence models, or marginal models constructed for epidemiological or similar
purposes. The extent to which such models are capable of a causal interpretation
will be examined. Apart from specialized models such as those arising in the
analysis of ranked data, a most pressing need has been for satisfactory methods
for dealing with non-linear models having several components of variation.
Residual likelihood is one technique used in linear models for the estimation of
variance components, by-passing the regression parameters. The intention is to
develop a similar strategy for generalized linear models in order to help focus
attention on subsets of the parameters without compromising the inferences. The
final component of the research is related to the algebra of model formulae, and
in particular, on the limitations of the algebra in common use, particularly
where homologous factors are involved. Only a minority of group-invariant
subspaces correspond to interesting statistical models: A promising alternative
to group-invariance is monoid-invariance, which corresponds closely to factorial
models. The aim is to find a succinct way of specifying suitable invariant
subspaces in a way that is unambiguous and can be understood by statistician and
computer alike. This exercise will involve a mixture of algebra and
computational work. Generalized linear models have been used in a wide variety
of applications in the social, physical and biological sciences, in addition to
commercial applications such as insurance and marketing. Despite this success,
there are a number of important areas in which further development would be
beneficial. Foremost among these are applications in which random effects accrue
from several identifiable sources. Examples incl ude longitudinal studies,
genetic models for plant and animal breeding, and agricultural field
experiments. Methods will be developed to deal with patterns of dependence
induced by such random effects. A second area on which some progress has already
been made is the connection between statistical model formulas and what are
known in algebra as monoid-invariant subspaces. The currently-used algebra for
statistical models is incapable of recognizing that two factors have the same
set of levels. An extended algebra will be developed to accommodate this
phenomenon.
