The tectonic origins of the Ninetyeast Ridge (NER) will be investigated from
geochrnonological/isotopic (Ar/Ar) measurements and from geochemical (Sr, Nd,
Hf, and Pb isotopes) analyses of basalt samples collected from 7 DSDP and ODP
drill sites, and from 23 dredged samples collected from NER in 2007. These
analyses will address the origins of hotspots as the NER and if they are sourced
beneath the ridge in the deep mantle or more shallow in the mid-upper mantle or
sublithosphere. The data generated from this project will help advance
geodynamical models of hotspots.

Broader impacts: The broader impacts were viewed as limited in scope but will
provide educational benefit and training for undergraduate and graduate
students, and a JOI-sponsored middle school teacher.
