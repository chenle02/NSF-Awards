In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organo- metallic Program of
the Chemistry Division, Klemperer will continue his studies of the synthesis and
reactivity of soluble transition metal oxides. The experimental approach shows
promise towards developing an understanding of the fundamental basis for
important heterogeneous catalysts. These catalysts are critical to the chemical
industry. Five major areas will be investigated. First, the chemistry of soluble
oxide inclusion complexes will be examined. Second, the mechanism of dioxygen
activation towards organic molecules will be studied in organoiridium complexes
bound to polyoxoanions. The third area will be concerned with performing the
same types of transformations with ruthenium complexes. The fourth and fifth
areas deal with the exploration of niobate and tantalate oxide solution
chemistry. The significance of the research lies in part in the understanding
gained about fundamental processes of industrial and biological significance
relating to the controlled autoxidation of organic materials. In addition, new
and hopefully useful materials should be discovered.
