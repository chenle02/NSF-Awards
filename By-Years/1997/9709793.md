This award form the Synthetic Organic Program will support a series of three
annual `workshops on Organic Synthesis and Natural Products Chemistry.` These
workshops have the dual purpose of (1) providing an effective forum for informal
discussion among young industrial and academic scientists on current research in
topical areas of organic synthesis and natural products, and(2) assisting the
Program staff in identifying emerging areas and researchers. This process, in
turn, will aid the Program in long-range planning.The specific goals of the
workshops include:1) Providing an environment for the dynamic exchange of ideas
in organic synthesis and natural products chemistry among a small group (about
20) of active young researchers in these fields. 2) Encouraging an attitude of
cooperation among individuals working in related areas, and thereby, avoiding
duplicative efforts.3) Stimulating participants to study new problems and
methods in synthetic and natural products chemistry.4) Creating an atmosphere in
which the scientific and social interaction among participants will be both
stimulating and pleasant.
