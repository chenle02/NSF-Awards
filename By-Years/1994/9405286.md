This is the first year of a three-year continuing award to provide an improved
human-machine audio interface. Array processing techniques and results from
research in multiple microphone hearing aids will be extended to a multiple
microphone acoustic beamformer for the human-machine interface. Further efforts
will focus on efficient frequency domain implementations of the real-time
processor, development of a robust hybrid fixed/adaptive array processor, and
the incorporation of an acoustic echo-canceller to remove machine-generated
noise. The results sought include an enhanced speech input for machines that
will allow subsequent NLP algorithms to be more effective. In addition, the
proposed implementation will not require special cables or positioning of the
user.
