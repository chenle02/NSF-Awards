This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants,
especially women, graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty, in the "From
Dynamics to Chaos" conference that will be held from May 7--11, 2012, at the
Fields Institute for Research in Mathematical Sciences in Toronto,
Canada.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will cover a variety of topics in
analysis (e.g., dynamical systems, complexity theory, mathematical physics),
with partially hyperbolic dynamics serving as a key unifying theme. All of the
conference topics are central to analysis and extremely active subjects of
current research. The format of the meeting is such that young people will have
ample opportunities to speak and be otherwise engaged in the various conference
activities.
