Lay Absract: Proposal # 0414596&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title:
"Intraspecific interactions among dampwood termite colonies nesting within a
limited resource: implications for the evolution of eusociality in
Isoptera"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;P.I.: Dr. Barbara L.
Thorne&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt; Long live the queen? Maybe not.
All 2500+ termite species live in highly social colonies in which few insects
ever reproduce and hundreds, thousands, or over a million other individuals are
helpers or defenders. How would such a system evolve? By studying primitive
termites, Thorne and her lab group demonstrated that inevitable meetings between
termite families living within the same piece of wood result in assassination of
some reproductives, merging of remaining populations of the two colonies, and
differentiation of some helpers into new reproductives. In this research, Thorne
will continue to explore whether this competitive circumstance provides a
missing link in explaining how offspring helpers would have opportunities to
inherit their parents' nest resources. The same context of battles between
neighboring colonies frequently produces reproductive soldiers, a highly unusual
termite caste that can be aggressive during intercolony fights and therefore
appears to be a precursor to modern, sterile soldier termites. Experimental
manipulations and molecular genetic tools will be used to more precisely
understand the origin of specialized termite castes and underlying dynamics that
favored the evolution of their complex societies.&lt;br/&gt;
