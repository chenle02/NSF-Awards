Molecular genetic analyses of mutations in retinal development in Drosophila
have led to the discovery of many important genes controlling neural development
and interactions. The principal investigator will use this paradigm to isolate
genes important in the development of the sensory innervation of Drosophila
wing. The research will lead to genes that control aspects of development that
are not operative during retinal development, e.g., guidance of axons over long
distances. A behavioral assay has been developed that will quickly detect
mutations in sensory innvervation. Mutant lines will be obtained primarily from
a large scale P-element insertion mutagenesis carried out in the laboratory of
Dr. Allan Spradling. The insects carry a reporter gene (bacterial
B-galactosidase) that provides an immediate picture of the distribution of
putative gene activity. These constructs greatly facilitate the subsequent
cloning of genes of major interest. A number of the wing's mechanoreceptors are
characterized at the single cell level, and much is known about their normal
development. Thus, the system is advantageous for the kind of developmental
genetic approach that has been so fruitful in the case of the Drosophila eye.
