The Research Careers for Minority Scholars Program at City College of New York
will encourage minority students to pursue careers in science and engineering
research by (1) linking each student with a faculty mentor, (2) organizing a
freshman year special topics program that will introduce beginning college
students to basic concepts underlying research, (3) providing each student with
hands-on research experience, (4) mounting a series of symposia during the
sophomore and junior years that will introduce the scholars to fundamental
issues and ideas surrounding research and research careers, (5) offering a
required senior year research project and senior seminar, (6) making available
summer research internships at other universities, and (7) establishing a
conference program as a major form of outreach to draw the larger community into
City College's RCMS efforts.
