The PIs intend to test their prediction abilities on a given day the location
and timing of ionospheric irregularities in the high latitude F region. Much of
the high latitude F-region weather is cause by small scale (irregularities) and
large scale (polar cap patches, polar cap arcs, boundary blobs, subauroral
blobs, auroral blobs, auroral ionospheric cavities) electron density structures.
There is an intimate cause and effect relationship between these small and large
scale irregularities. The PIs will use the Global Theoretical Ionospheric Model
(GTIM) to determine the requirements for accurately forecasting patches and
blobs, and, in turn, using expressions for instability growth rates, forecast
the appearance of electron density irregularities. In sum, this three-year
project will: (1) test current understanding of large scale F-region structures
and their ability to produce small scale irregularities, (2) confirm the role of
two instability processes in generating small scale irregularities, (3) test
current capability to specify and forecast conditions in the high latitudes that
impact satellite communications, (4) help establish what processes need to be
included in any physics-based ionospheric weather model, and (5) establish the
level of detail required in the high-latitude electric field in order to specify
and forecast ionospheric weather.
