The Global Integrated Drought Monitoring and Prediction System (GIDMaPS) is one
of the first global multi-index drought monitoring and seasonal prediction
systems. GIDMaPS provides near real-time drought information including
persistence-based drought prediction using (a) soil moisture accumulations-based
standardized soil moisture index (SSI); and (b) the newly developed Multivariate
Standardized Drought Index (MSDI). The seasonal forecast component of GIDMaPS
provides the probability of drought occurrence for different drought severity
levels. The monitoring component of GIDMaPS presents drought information based
on five categories of drought types: D0 (abnormally dry), D1 (moderate drought),
D2 (severe drought), D3 (extreme drought), and D4 (exceptional drought). The
seasonal drought prediction component is based on two input data sets available
from NASA (MERRA and NLDAS) and three drought indicators (SPI, SSI, and MSDI).
The outputs of the seasonal prediction component are probability of drought
occurrence. To date, most studies and models have explored droughts monitoring
using univariate indicators (e.g., SPI). As an alternative to currently
available univariate drought indices, GIDMaPS includes a novel multivariate
multi-index approach (MSDI) which provides a composite assessment of both
agricultural and meteorological droughts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
innovation could be useful to a broad list of customers including (a) commodity
investors; (b) insurance and re-insurance companies; (c) energy companies; (d)
private farmers; (e) government agencies, such as the United States Department
of Agriculture; and (f) state agencies, such as the Department of Water
Resources. Commodity investors, for example, need seasonal predictions (1-6
months) at the global scale since droughts in several countries can affect
global food prices. For this reason, GIDMaPS outputs can be used to make
investment decisions. Furthermore, the proposed methodology has the potential to
improve the current capabilities of the U.S. Drought Monitor which only provides
monitoring information without any drought prediction. Finally, in the past
decade, several drought events led to famine, resulting in loss of lives and
dire societal impacts. GIDMaPS can provide drought early warning and potentially
be used for managing drought relieve operations.
