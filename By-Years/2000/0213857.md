East Asia marks one of the key areas for understanding the origin and
prehistoric migrations of modern humans. In particular, the relative continuity
of hominid fossils found in China has challenged the well-known "Out of Africa"
hypothesis which states that the modern humans originated only once in Africa,
subsequently migrated out of Africa and replaced all the archaic forms of human
in the rest part of the world. The aforementioned observation suggests an
independent origin of modern humans in East Asia and it contradicts the results
obtained from genetic studies. Unfortunately, no systematic genetic study has
been conducted to describe the spectrum of genetic diversity in East Asian
populations. This project aims to describe the genetic profile of East Asian
populations, to trace the ancient migratory routes in East Asia, and to study
the origin of modern humans in this region by analyzing a battery of mtDNA, Y
chromosomal, and autosomal markers. This project will evaluate the genetic
diversity of a group of linguistically and geographically diverse but ethnically
defined populations in East Asia using a set of mtDNA, Y chromosomal, and
autosomal polymorphisms. It will investigate the prehistoric migrations of
modern humans in this area and study the genesis of the significant genetic
differences between northern and southern Mongoloids using both Y and mtDNA
haplotypes. Then, it will examine the competing hypotheses of origin of
anatomically modern humans in East Asia. Finally, it will characterize the
relationship between linguistically versus geographically affiliated
populations, and study the origin and dispersal of major language families in
East Asia.
