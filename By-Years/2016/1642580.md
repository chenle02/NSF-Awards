To explore how advanced network technologies address important public benefit
problems, US Ignite will gather teams working on these next-generation
applications at the 2016 Application Summit, June 14- 15, 2016, in Austin Texas.
Participants will demonstrate that advanced networking technologies such as
software-defined networking, virtualized networks, gigabit to the end-user, and
GENI racks can address societal problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of
the 2016 Application Summit are to 1) create a collaborative venue to
demonstrate applications that take advantage of next-generation network
technology, 2) provide a public forum around gigabit applications, 3) convene
current and potential future Smart Gigabit Community representatives, and 4)
demonstrate the important role that advanced networks will play in the emerging
smart city / Internet of Things ecosystem. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Summit
hosts academic, research, commercial and community leaders who are experts in
next-generation technologies that serve the public benefit. By providing
thought-leadership as well as practical expertise in successful application of
next-generation technologies, these experts help educate and engage industry
labs, federal agencies, foundations, venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, open
source developers, students and faculty. The Summit provides a collaborative
environment wherein researchers, developers, students and faculty can share
their work with and learn from one another.
