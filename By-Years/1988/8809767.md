This project provides partial support for a special research year in dynamical
programs during 1988-89 at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, New
Jersey. The program will also be supported by the Institute's endowments and by
the Department of Energy. The special year will bring together physicists and
mathematicians who will focus on important problems in dynamical systems. The
analysis and description of the chaotic behavior for uniformly hyperbolic
systems marks one of the fundamental achievements in dynamical systems. However,
there are many simple physical models of fluid flow, plasma physics, and
celestial mechanics, which are not uniformly hyperbolic. In these cases little
is known about chaotic behavior. One of the goals of the Institute's program in
dynamical systems is to establish chaotic behavior for such models.
