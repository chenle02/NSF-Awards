This award will enable 25 U.S. scientists to attend MG X (the 10th Marcel
Grossmann Meeting on Recent Developments in Theoretical and Experimental General
Relativity, Gravitation, and Relativistic Field Theories). The travel funds will
allow U.S. researchers, in particular young researchers, to present their work
at the international meeting and learn of new results.
