This action funds Carolyn Keogh of University of Georgia to conduct a research
project in Biological Sciences during the summer of 2013 at Kochi University in
Kochi, Japan. The project title is "Ecoimmunology of Invasions: Testing the
Effect of Parasite Release on Investment in Immune Defense." The host scientists
are Dr. Gyo Itani and Dr. Osamu Miura.

Invasive species are thought to experience a reprieve from regulation by natural
enemies such as parasites and predators, which may contribute to the demographic
success they often achieve in their recipient ranges. This project uses a highly
invasive marine invertebrate, the Asian shore crab, Hemigrapsus sanguineus, as a
model system for testing the effect of parasite release on energy allocation and
susceptibility to future infections. The project compares important defense and
fitness traits between individuals from the invasive and native populations
using techniques from the fast-growing field of ecoimmunology to determine
whether resource allocation to immune defenses trades off with investment in
other fitness components. The goal of this project is to contribute a new
perspective to our understanding of the short- and long-term consequences of
enemy escape for invasive species success.

Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce. Furthermore, the collaboration will increase possibilities
for sharing knowledge and resources that will help advance the science of
invasion biology in this system and others by increasing intellectual exchange
between the two labs and home institutions.
