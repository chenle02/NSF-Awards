This project proposes to explore integrated methodologies for pattern discovery
and network analysis in multi-lingual text corpora. The interdisciplinary
project team will focus on recent developments in network analysis of complex
problems associated with visual query systems, topic discovery, anomaly
detection, and rapid mining of complex time-stamped data as a means for
extending approaches to noisy data from a range of disciplinary source
materials. In order to look at the various problems and solutions to these major
issues in current scholarship, the PIs have chosen three sets of disparate data:
Buddhist Canonic texts (Chinese and Sanskrit); Irish studies journals (English
and Gaelic); and Danish folklore (English and Danish). The research exercise to
be performed is of a scale and complexity never before attempted. The project
anticipates finding deficiencies in existing network analysis algorithms dealing
with rich external data available on nodes and links and developing new network
analysis algorithms to overcome the deficiencies.
