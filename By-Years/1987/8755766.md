The University of California, Davis proposes an interdisciplinary program in
biological and environmental sciences with a focus on agricultural sciences. It
combines a six week summer program, with a school year follow-up endeavor for
11th and 12th grade students. The summer program, residential in nature,
combines instructional activities in areas selected as central to
biological/agricultural disciplines with students research in a one-to-one
relationship with university researchers. Research will be an amalgam of
students' individual interests and available institutional and personnel
resources. Students will receive close supervision and instruction on research
design, reporting and the use of university resources. The school-year follow-up
program will include a) student presentation of research in the home school; b)
a research update program on the UC Davis campus; c) student presentation of the
research paper at the Science and Humanities Symposia of Northern and Southern
California. Selection of participants will be based on factors including
demonstrated ability in science and mathematics; limited educational
opportunities in the applicant's high school; a continued record of interest and
activity in sciences; completion of the eleventh grade during the preceding
year; economic conditions which might otherwise preclude a qualified applicant's
participation. Special efforts will be made to solicit applications from
underrepresented qualified minority students.
