This project supports the dissertation research of a student of cultural
anthropology from the University of Chicago. The research will take place in Sri
Lanka where the student will study two relatively new export-oriented garment
factories which hire a predominantly female labor force. Using ethnographic
techniques of in-depth interviews and participant observation as well as studies
of local and regional archives, the student will examine how the experience of
work in these factories changes the women's notions of themselves as people and
citizens of the nation. Women are traditionally the store-house of traditional
cultural values, and the student hypothesizes that work in the factories, which
explicitly aim to change their worker's identities to relate more to the
national state and less to their local group, will produce conflict and change
in the women and their families. This research is important because the process
of global market change has brought foreign-owned or dominated work-places to
many traditional parts of the world. Understanding how the experience of work in
these trans-national sites affects the women workers, and through them their
households and families, will help us understand and deal with the stresses and
tensions that the expansion of the global market produces.
