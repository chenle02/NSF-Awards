SSC-9450284 Wentworth Institute of Tech Boston, MA Newhouse, Joyce "Camp Tech
II" Massachusetts Pre-Engineering Program, Inc. (MassPEP) in collaboration with
Wentworth Institute of Technology (WIT), the Boston Housing Authority (BHA) and
the Boston Public Elementary Schools propose the model program Camp Tech II. The
purpose of this program is to stimulate the curiosity and interest of students
(grades 7-9) in math, science and technology, Camp Tech II presents an
integrated math and science curriculum through hands-on projects in robotics,
computer applications, architecture, construction science, electronics and
environmental science. The program format includes a 6-week full day summer camp
and 5 Saturday programs during the school year. The underlying theme of the camp
curriculum is how thing break, how things work, how things are built and how
people solve problems. The curriculum is a joint effort of MassPEP, WIT faculty,
classroom teachers from the collaborating school zones and industry
professionals. The Camp Tech II program completed its pilot year (1993). The
academic components of this program are balanced by physical fitness program
that enables students to learn about the importance of good health and team
efforts as they use math and science principles to chart their scores, speeds
and distances. No country can afford to pretend that a majority of its citizens
are barely able to learn simple arithmetic, everyday science and technology
applications. Young students need to be encouraged to maintain their natural
interest in the world around them and they need to see how this world can be
measured, predicted, and changed through the application of various technologies
and systems of discovery.
