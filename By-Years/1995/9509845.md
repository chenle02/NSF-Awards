This starter grant award to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will
support the research of Professor Paula Hammond. The theme of the research is
the design, synthesis, and characterization of new optical and electro-optical
polymeric materials. The first component of the research focuses on the
synthesis of bulk liquid crystalline block copolymers with unique linear and
nonlinear optical and mechano-optical properties derived from the controlled
morphologies of the polymers. The second component involves the patterned
deposition of polymers onto surfaces to form optically functional thin film
devices utilizing micro-patterned self-assembled monolayers as a template.
Liquid crystalline polymers have great potential for use in optical switches or
valves, storage devices, and other electro-optic device applications. This
research will exploit special morphologies to produce copolymers ideal for
device applications.
