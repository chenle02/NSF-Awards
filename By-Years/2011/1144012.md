Electrophorus electricus, the strong voltage electric eel, occurs in rivers
throughout South America. These fish are capable of generating strong electrical
discharges of 600 volts or more, using specialized cells called electrocytes.
This electrical power permits the eels to stun and kill both predators and prey.
The long-term goal of this study is to create synthetic bio-batteries modeled
after these electrocytes. By identifying the proteins used in nature to create,
store and release an electrical potential, this project will lay the foundation
for the first synthetic biological battery. This project will involve the
sequencing of genomic DNA and electrocyte RNA to define the unique proteins
(especially ion pumps and membrane channels and their regulators) of the
electrocyte. These proteins will be purified and their electrical and regulatory
properties will be studied in synthetic membranes and liposomes to define their
unique and electrocyte-specific functional properties.

Broader Impacts. This project can define a framework for new ways to create and
manipulate biologically-derived electrical energy, and could thus have
substantial impacts in energy research and production. The investigator and the
University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center's outreach staff will use the
electric eels and their electrocytes to help in educating and communicating to
the public basic knowledge of how biological organisms create and use electrical
energy. A team of undergraduates at the University of Wisconsin-Madison will
develop a synthetic biology bio-energy project using genetic toolkits, including
one from the electric eel, and will compete in the iGEM (International
Genetically Engineered Machines) competition for undergraduate research.
