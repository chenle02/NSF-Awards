9708251 Davis The Global Positioning System (GPS) is used by earth scientists
for accurately recording strain in the Earth's crust in a wide range of
applications that include the study of plate motions, intraplate deformation,
pre-, syn- and post-seismic fault motions, pre-eruption volcanic activity,
glacier flow, and sea level monitoring. In such applications, the positioning
precision required is very demanding, usually on the order of a centimeter or
less in the horizontal and vertical dimensions. The GPS receiver and antenna
system is one of significant sources of error which, if better understood and
corrected, could lead to significant improvement. This award provides funding
for a team of experts at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, MIT, and the
University NAVSTAR Consortium to develop algorithms to extract multipath effects
from observed GPS signal-to-noise ratios, numerically model GPS antenna
characteristics, and develop an on-site Multipath Calibration System for the
purpose of reducing GPS errors below the centimeter level. ***
