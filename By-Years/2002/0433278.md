Civco&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Williams College&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
PIs will investigate the causes and the consequences of land and urban use
expansion in a global sample of 120 cities stratified by size, geographic
region, and level of economic development. These data cover two time periods
that correspond to the two most recent censuses. This investigation is of
central scientific and policy importance, especially for cities in developing
countries, where the urbanized population is expected to double, from 2 billion
to 4 billion in the next 30-35 years. With increasing incomes in the developing
countries, the consumption of land by their cities will likely double in the
next 25 to 30 years. The PIs will assess the consequences of different levels of
urban land consumption for human welfare in general, and for urban poverty in
particular. The PIs collect local data using local surveyors, improve and assess
the land cover classification for the sample, measure social and economic
impacts of urban expansion and model the effects of local policies on urban
expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. The analyses the PIs will
conduct is the first to use a global sample to explore the relative importance
of factors such as population growth, income, transportation costs and
infrastructure, economic structure of the urban area and local regulatory
policies on urban expansion. The analysis is also the first to evaluate, in a
global context, the impacts of urban expansion on housing affordability, access
to sanitary and transportation infrastructure, and conditions in the most
impoverished areas of cities. The broader impact of the research rests on the
foundation for global cities to understand and predict the magnitude of urban
expansion that can be expected. Such understanding allows cities to manage urban
expansion and design humane and sustainable public policies.&lt;br/&gt;
