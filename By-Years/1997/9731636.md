This continuation of the Solar-Stellar Spectrograph Program incorporates a new
paradigm to the investigators' research: observing the stars as a sun, rather
than the sun as a star. While chromospheric diagnostics continue to play an
integral part in analysis, the investigators have realized spectral lines
originating from the 'quiet' Sun and stars have potential to significantly alter
the way long-term solar and stellar variability is studied. Thus, they use the
full content of spectra to pursue a deeper understanding of several important
issues; namely, (1) relative variability of the Sun and solar-analogous stars,
(2) nature of 'Maunder Minimum' stars, (3) response of quiet and active lines to
variability on different timescales, and (4) using these data as predictors of
upcoming activity.
