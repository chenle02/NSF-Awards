9610167 Raj The focus of this SGER project is the measurement of thermal
conductivity of interfaces in metal-ceramic composites. The research
concentrates on a detailed study of particulate composites consisting of a pure
aluminum matrix dispersed with particles of magnesium aluminate spinel. This is
motivated by preliminary evidence that interfaces in aluminum-spinel composites
enhance the overall thermal conductivity of the composite, in stark contrast to
the conventional finding that composite interfaces reduce thermal conductivity.
The effort includes preparation of several specimens with different volume
fractions and different particle sizes of spinel. The thermal diffusivities of
these specimens are measured and the microstructure carefully characterized to
confirm or refute the existence of an anomalous thermal conduction along the
aluminum-spinel interface. The research is a collaboration between the
University of Colorado at Boulder and Virginia Polytechnic Institute in
Blacksburg, VA. If this exploratory research produces a positive result then a
regular proposal to investigate the phenomenon at an atomistic level will be
submitted to the Foundation. %%% This enhanced thermal conduction effect could
be applied to many commercially important materials systems, such as electronic
packaging and multilayer devices. ***
