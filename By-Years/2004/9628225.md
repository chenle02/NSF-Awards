9628225 Burchfiel Study of active and young deformation in central and southern
Bulgaria is of particular interest in that this deformation represents the
northernmost extent of the Aegean extensional domain and thus represents an
active example of back arc type extension adjacent to a zone of coeval
subduction and convergence along the Hellenic subduction and convergence along
the Hellenic subduction boundary. Studies suggest that extensions is controlled
by motion of the subducting plate, but the dynamic and detailed kinematic
processes that characterize such systems remain poorly understood. This project,
collaborative with the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, will study the detailed
kinematics of how northward termination of active subduction along the Hellenic
subduction system is related to northward termination of coeval extension in the
back-arc region and ultimately, to gain additional insight into the dynamic
processes that drive these systems.
