This research will develop representations and algorithms for generating
assembly sequences of products. The problem is theoretically of combinatorial
complexity. A method has been developed to describe axially symmatic developed
to describe assemblies based upon high-level engineering features and mating
conditions. A rule-based algorithm derives a graph-structure corresponding to an
exploded-view of the assembly. Interpreting this information as precedences
among components, another program generates selected assembly sequences. This
research will extend the methodology to general, three- dimensional cases. The
importance of this research is twofold; automatically providing the designer
with information regarding the assembly process can significantly enhance the
simultaneous engineering process; and by showing that computerized spatial
reasoning is possible with high-level input descriptions, powerful design
assistants can be developed for computer aided design systems.
