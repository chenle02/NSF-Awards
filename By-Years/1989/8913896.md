This grant will support research in the processing of new high temperature
ceramic superconductors. New techniques for processing these brittle ceramic
materials are needed in order to optimize the superconducting properties in
forms and shapes that are useful. This grant was selected from more than 260
proposals in High Temperature Superconductivity in April, 1989. The research is
supported through the Ceramics and Electronic Materials Program with a
significant contribution from the university.
