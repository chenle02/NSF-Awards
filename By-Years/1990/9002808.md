The evaluation of climate models is a very important research goal for the
atmospheric sciences. One approach to evaluate climate models is to check their
sensitivity to altered boundary conditions and their ability to reproduce past
environments on the earth. This proposal requests support to continue research
on modeling and analysis of past climate by focussing on the sensitivity of the
climate system to variations in the seasonal cycle, primarily for intervals in
earth history when a supercontinent dominated the surface of the earth. The
research will utilize a hierarchy of simple and complex models (EBM and GCM).
This research is important because it will help to evaluate the past
environmental conditions on earth and to understand the dynamics of the climate
system.
