This project lies in the general area of discrete and continuous dynamical
systems and the associated invariant sets. In particular, the goal is to develop
a framework for the analysis of error and convergence for the calculation of the
dimension of invariant sets. These sets are often fractal in nature and more
general definitions of dimension must be used. The dynamics will usually be
associated with a Markov partition and the sets will support a Bernoulli
probability measure. Another aspect of the project will be a study into the
onset of chaos and intermittency in dynamical systems. The theoretical study
described above has relevance to the behavior of various biological, chemical
and physical systems involving dynamics.
