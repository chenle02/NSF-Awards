This project will investigate numerical methods for solving nonlinear
programming problems. The problems involve minimizing a nonlinear function
subject to a set of nonlinear equality and inequality constraints. Sequential
quadratic programming (SQP) methods are particularly effective for solving
problems of this nature. It is assumed that first derivatives of the objective
and constraint functions are available, but that second derivatives may be too
expensive to compute. Instead the methods typically update a suitable matrix
which approximates second derivative information each iteration. We are
interested in developing SQP methods which maintain an approximation to second
derivative information projected onto the tangent space of the constraints. The
main motivation for the work is that only the projected matrix enters into the
optimality conditions for the nonlinear problem. We will investigate issues
relating to both the global and local convergence properties of algorithms.
These include the choice of quasi-Newton update, active set strategy and merit
function. The main goal is two-fold: to produce efficient and reliable software
and to provide a theoretical framework for these methods.
