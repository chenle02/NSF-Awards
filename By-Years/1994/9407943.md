9407948 Abstract A circadian system was described which controls sperm release
and maturation in the make reproductive tract of the gypsy moth. The system was
characterized at both the chrono-biological and physiological level, including a
time-table for its development during adult metamorphosis. Study of this system
at the molecular level was initiated and resulted in the isolation of three
clock related(cr) genes whose transcript abundance appear to fluctuate in a
circadian fashion. A determination will be made as to whether and how CR genes
are involved in the clock mechanism. Changes in the abundance of the three CR
genes will be examined during the course of development of circadian system
after resetting of the circadian mechanism by light or temperature, and in
conditions which disrupt rhythmicity using an RNAse protection assay and reverse
transcription-PCR. In addition, cellular localization of mRNAs corresponding to
CR probes will be studied by in situ hybridizations. %%% Circadian rhythms are
ubiquitous in living organisms at every level or organization, from gene
transcription to behavior. Despite the fundamental importance of circadian
rhythms, the molecular identity of the clock that drives them remains one of the
significant unanswered questions of modern biology. In this study, a simple
circadian system of an insect, sperm release and maturation in the male
reproductive tract of the gypsy moth, is used to explore the molecular basis of
the biological clock. ***
