The structure, function, and cellular interactions of intermediate filaments
(IFs) are being investigated. The project focusses on two specific areas:
neurofilament assembly, which involves three different neurofilament proteins,
and IF interactions with mitochondria. IF assembly will be addressed by
examining soluble assembly intermediates in vitro, using electrophoresis,
analytical ultracentrifugation, and electron microscopy. Interactions with
mitochondria will assessed in vitro using purified IFs and mitochondria.
Intermediate filaments are arguably the most complex, and least understood, of
the cytoskeletal elements of living cells. These experiments will pursue
important aspects of the biochemistry of IFs, and will shed light on a
plausible, though admittedly highly speculative, hypothesis concerning
biological function.
