This project will develop a new introductory course in textile science. It will
introduce students to the innovative technological aspects of this discipline
through a discovery- oriented approach to product development and manufacturing
processes. Besides applying the principles of science and engineering to
successful business products, legal, marketing and environmental aspects
necessary to the realization of a successful product will be covered. Through
the use of hands-on investigative techniques, a research and design team
approach, field trips to manufacturing facilities, lectures by industry experts,
and discussions of patents and other legal issues, students will be introduced
to an industry that needs graduates in science and engineering.
