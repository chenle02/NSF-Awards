A number of experiments using the wave properties of neutrons will be carried
out. In many ways these properties are analogous to those of electromagnetic
waves, and this correspondence will be explored in several ways. The results
will provide a further basis for our theoretical understanding of the most
fundamental aspects of matter and energy.
