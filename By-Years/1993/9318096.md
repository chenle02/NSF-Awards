9318096 Brown This study will investigate spatial variation in the abundance of
a species over its geographic range. Most of the research will involve analysis
of data from the Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), standardized censuses of hundreds
of species of breeding birds at approximately 2000 local sites in North America,
some of which have been conducted annually for 25 years. Statistical analysis of
these data using a Geographic Information System (GIS) and other methods will
quantify: 1) the frequency distribution of abundace among sites where a species
occurs, 2) spatial patterns of variation in abundance, especially with respect
with distance from the center and boundaries of the range, and 3) temporal
variation in the spatial distribution of abundance, including shifts in range
boundaries. These analyses will enable the investigators to distinguish among
hypotheses to explain the observed patterns, including both null hypotheses of
random variation and alternative hypotheses based on the mechanistic ecological
processes that affect local abundance. The empirical patterns will also be
compared to patterns predicted by computer simulation models of multidimensional
niches. %%% Results of this research will contribute to the unification of
ecology and biogeography by addressing basic questions about the relationship
between local abundance and geographic distribution. The results will also
enhance our ability to understand, and therefore ultimately predict, changes in
the geographic distributions and local abundances of species that are occurring
in response to human activities. ***
