0429092&lt;br/&gt;Flower&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides support for
U.S. geoscientists to attend a continental dynamics planning workshop in Kunming
(Yunnan Province), China. The purpose of the workshop is to coordinate research
in southeast Asia and eastern margins of the Tibetan orogen testing India-
Eurasia plate collision models. Scientists from China, Vietnam and Thailand are
presently working with U.S. colleagues on fundamental problems of continental
accretion, which have not, as yet, been effectively addressed in terms of
asthenosphere-lithosphere interactions. The workshop is planned as an
opportunity to review and finalize scientific goals and establish a coherent
collaborative strategy.&lt;br/&gt;
