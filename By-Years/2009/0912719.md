Phase I research project seeks to develop a new technique for enhancing
fluorescence-based detection of explosives in order to help counter the threat
posed by improvised explosive devices (IED). The proposed approach will develop
a highly enhanced multi-spectral band fluorescence reader and a tape-based
sensing surface supply system that is generally applicable to any fluorescence-
based transducer. The proposed Surface Plasmon-Coupled Emission (SPCE) can
enhance fluorescence-based detection sensitivity without sacrificing utility at
the cost of higher positive alarm rates. The proposed innovation imparts greater
probability of detection and, at the same time, maintains or even reduces the
false alarm rate. This is accomplished through significant increases in the
amount of signal collected from the fluorescent transducer with the simultaneous
extraction of fluorescence spectral feature information. The envisioned optical
reader head takes advantage of unique plasmon-resonance effects that focus
fluorescence signals in one dimension while at the same time imparting an
angular dispersion of the fluorescence spectrum such that the angles of emitted
light must simultaneously satisfy the boundary conditions constraints of the
surface plasmon. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the initial application will be to
support the fight against IEDs, the technology is generally applicable to any
optically enabled detection scheme and is, thus, applicable to numerous types of
analytes other than explosives. Additionally, the SPCE technique lends itself to
more diverse deployment strategies than most sensitive chemical detection
instruments. These include a simple array-based sensing format with multiple
reporters and an automatic sensor renewal process for autonomous
operation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
