This REU site award will provide support for eight undergraduate researchers.
Each student will work with a single faculty member for a period of eight weeks.
Research topics include: Root systems and Weyl groups, modeling uncertainty in
economics, topology of planar linkages, logic with diagrams and speech
recognition by computers. Students will meet privately with faculty advisors two
or three times each week. Students will be expected to give lectures on their
work and to prepare final written reports. Student interaction will be
encouraged through theses presentations, by the proximity of their working
arrangements and through common living facilities on campus. This project
continues a long tradition of undergraduate research participation at Indiana
University reaching back to the original URPP program sponsored by NSF and
continuing via individual grant support when the URPP was discontinued.
