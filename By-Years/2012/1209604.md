This action funds Elaine Lee of the University of Pennsylvania to conduct a
research project, entitled "Patterned polymeric materials for cell studies,"
during the summer of 2012 at Seoul National University in Seoul, Korea. The host
scientist is Dr. Kahp-Yang Suh.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to understand cell behavior on
man-made materials which can respond to the environment. Using novel fabrication
techniques, micro- and nano-scale features can be patterned on soft, polymeric
materials to mimic the natural environment of the cells. This project aims to
understand how changing the physical properties of the materials will affect
cell size, shape, function and behavior.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
