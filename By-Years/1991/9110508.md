Image compression is the process of reducing the amount of data required to
store or transmit an image. It has traditionally been done with little regard
for image processing operations that may precede or follow the compression step.
It is proposed to investigate areas in which image compression and image
processing may be combined into a single operation, and also areas in which
image compression may lead to improved or simpler image processing operations.
Vector quantization algorithms for the compression of halftoned binary images
will be developed and images will be compared that are first compressed and then
halftoned with images that are halftoned and then compressed. Vector quantizers
that can simultaneously perform both compression and image processing tasks such
as halftoning, inverse Fourier transforming, and contract enhancement will also
be investigated. This will lead to a reduction in computational complexity if
the complexity of the compression step is less than that of the image processing
operation. Finally, examinations will be done to see if image compression will
lead to simpler or improved image processing operations such as image
segmentation, target detection, and pre- screening for suspect regions in
medical images.
