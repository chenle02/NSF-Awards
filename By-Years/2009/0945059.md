This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
new class of commercial bio-pesticides synthesized from readily renewable
materials at a lower cost and increased safety with avoidance of the
environmental problems associated with petroleum based pesticides. The proposed
innovation, science, and applications are multifactorial based on the
identification and manipulations in sophorolipid structure that result in
enhanced bio-pesticidal properties.

The broader/commercial impact of the project will be the development of
effective and safer bio-pesticides, and a decrease in the use of chemical
pesticides (currently exceeding 30 billion dollars a year). The project includes
scientific development and innovations as well as providing broad educational
programs for high school as well as graduate students.
