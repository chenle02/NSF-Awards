This project will involve the study of two sympatric prosimian primates that
are morphologically very similar, yet each exhibits a different social structure
--one species is monogamous and the other is found in multi-male multi-female
groups. The student will test whether hypotheses concerning paternal care of
infants, size of home range, defense of territorial borders, and exploitation of
resources are as predicted according to current theories of primate social
structure. These animals are seriously endangered, and they are currently
targeted for conservation. Little is known about one species and virtually
nothing about the second. Research on closely related species in their natural
environment will ultimately lead to a better understanding of the relationship
between morphology and behavior and the development of these relationships.
Specifically, this study will consider whether monogamy, generally considered an
inflexible social structure in the non- human primates, is actually more
flexible than generally acknowledged.
