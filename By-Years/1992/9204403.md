This Science in Developing Countries (SDC) award will partially support the
Fifth Pan American Symposium on Perspectives for Pan American Collaboration in
Experimental Physics to be held in Cartagena, Colombia. The Symposium, which is
jointly organized by Professor Leon Lederman of the University of Chicago, Dr.
Roy Rubinstein of Universities Research Associates, Inc., and Professor Eduardo
Posada of the Universidad Nacional de Colombia, proposes to review the status of
high energy particle physics and other fields of physics with an emphasis on
increasing Latin-American participation in science and the associated
technology. The Symposium will help to stimulate and assist in the formation of
research groups in Latin America and explore mechanisms for U.S.-Latin American
collaboration in various fields of physics. The meeting will bring together
outstanding researchers from the U.S. and Latin America and should help to
improve communications among them.
