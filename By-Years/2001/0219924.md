The ARCHway Project (Architecture for Research in Computing for the Humanities
through collaborative research, teaching, and learning) will institute a
technological infrastructure, an Edition Production Technology (EPT), for
collaborative work at all levels between computer science and humanities
disciplines to identify and solve problems of mutual importance in building
image-based electronic editions of significant cultural materials. We will
develop the EPT to implement and integrate both new and already available
software applications, to construct a digital library of previously unedited Old
English manuscripts as a testbed for our solutions, and to distribute the
digital library to the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will design formal
methodologies for collaborative teaching and research, based on our practical
goals. We will maintain an open-standards architecture with modular, extensible,
interoperable components to coordinate research and development of novel
methods, tools, and associated technologies. The EPT will guide the definition
and coordination of well-encapsulated collaborative student projects using our
testbed from semester to semester, student to student, year to year. The PIs
will lead teams of students in both disciplines in focussed research projects
related to documenting, editing, storing, accessing, searching, and
disseminating digital libraries of image-based electronic
editions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ARCHway will produce a system for building
digital libraries of image-based scholarly editions for the humanities. This
system will be used to produce electronic editions of a number of previously
unedited Old English manuscripts. The research results of this project will lay
the groundwork for sophisticated technical tools to interpret, assemble,
disseminate, and maintain image-based scholarly editions on a continuing
basis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
