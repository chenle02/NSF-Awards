Fault slip within zones of oblique convergence or divergence may be partitioned
on separate but coexisting and coplanar strike-slip and dip- slip faults. This
work has major implications for earthquake hazards in terms of predicting the
kinds of shaking may be expected along a given fault zone, i.e., vertical vs.
horizontal ground accelerations. This project will also test the notion that the
coexistence of coplanar and coexisting dip- and strike-slip faults require that
rapid changes occur in the local stress field. This proposal will document the
location and character of slip partitioning along faults of the Walker Lane belt
and western Basin and Range Province.
