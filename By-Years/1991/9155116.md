Carnegie Mellon University will initiate a six-week, residential Young Scholars
project in Engineering, Biology and Biotechnology which will offer science
enrichment activities for 50 precollege students entering grades 10-12. The
Young Scholars project will be an extension of an ongoing, successful course in
Carnegie Mellon's Summer precollege program called Careers in Applied Science
and Technology (CAST). The current CAST program includes a variety of laboratory
visits and presentations, a Science/Technology/Society workshop, and a science
writing workshop, leading up to the production of a magazine for use in middle
school classrooms. The expanded program will add research tracks in three major
NSF Centers on campus and replace most of the science-writing activity with
group laboratory projects.
