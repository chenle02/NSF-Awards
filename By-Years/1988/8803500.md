The principal investigator plans to work on problems in mathematical analysis
concerning the representation theory of Lie groups. A suitable example of the
latter is the group of rotations of a sphere. Groups like this are important
because they occur in many areas of mathematics ( e.g. geometry, differential
equations,algebraic number theory, mathematical physics ) as groups of
symmetries. Representation theory allows one to take advantage of symmetries in
solving problems. The building blocks for representation theory are the
irreducible representations, particularly the irreducible unitary
representations. The principal investigator will work toward classifying these
representations for certain classes of Lie groups. More specifically, he will
continue work on determining the character theory and unitarity of the unipotent
representations of reductive groups. This will provide significant insight into
the unitary dual and certain problems in the theory of automorphic forms.
