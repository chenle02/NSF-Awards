The capabilities of the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) for the observation of solar
transient events such as coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and for mapping of
density and velocity structures in the inner heliosphere will be ascertained.
The necessary requirements for LOFAR to contribute to space weather studies will
subsequently be determined. An exploration of the feasibility of determining the
magnetic field within a CME, by Faraday rotation of the polarization of cosmic
sources, will be conducted. This would provide a novel and extremely important
input to the determination of the geo-effectiveness of CMEs impacting the
magnetosphere. These activities will contribute to the development of advanced
remote sensing instrumentation for improved detection and understanding of key
space weather phenomena.
