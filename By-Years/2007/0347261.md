&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will focus on the
Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta in Bangladesh. Previous work by the PI investigated
sediment dispersal across the subaerial delta plain and found the 1/3 of the
sediment load was sequestered there and that the inner shelf represents an
important gateway of &gt;700 Mt of sediment annually. The PI will investigate
sediment dynamics of the inner shelf, including seasonal dispersal of large
sediment load, and transport pathways that link the river mouth with shoreline,
shelf and canyon depocenters. Four cruises are planned, with CHIRP and side-scan
acoustic surveys, coring and lab analysis of the collected data and Be/Th and
Pb/Cs dating. The proposed study will provide important insights on the longer
term sequence development along this high-yield and high-energy margin. The
educational component includes strong collaboration with Bangladeshi scientists,
establishing a scholastic program between SUNY and Dhaka University, co-
mentoring of students, web-based short courses and recruitment of Bangladeshi
students to SUNY.&lt;br/&gt;
