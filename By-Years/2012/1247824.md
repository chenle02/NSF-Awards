This study will examine how animals have been depicted in the popular science
magazine, National Geographic between 1888-2008. The evolving visual depiction
of animals will be interpreted, taking into account scientific changes, natural
history, environmental history, and the new aesthetic sensibilities provided by
the history of landscape and environmental photography and by situating the
magazine and its photographers, editors and photographic conventions in their
broader historical, cultural and political contexts.

The research will result in two end products: 1) a digital archive and
discussion forum on animal meaning and conservation using a sample of National
Geographic images and the Personal Meaning Map methodology which will be made
available on the web with teaching and learning exercises through Michigan State
University?s MATRIX/KORA Digital Repository and Publishing Platform (to
establish a pedagogical tool in animal conservation for a broad audience,
including students and scholars) and 2) an illustrated monograph on animal
imagery in National Geographic (to advance interdisciplinary scholarship by
connecting National Geographic representations of animals to broad historical
shifts in science, culture, politics and media conventions).
