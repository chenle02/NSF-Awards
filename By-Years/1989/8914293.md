Studies of CP violation, photoproduction of the 3-3 resonance, and the muon
anomalous magnetic moment (g-2) will be carried out. The CP violation work will
be carried out at CERN/LEAR using tagged, neutral kaon and anti-kaon beams to
help determine the source of known CP violation. BU will provide the time-of-
flight system for that experiment. Photoproduction of the 3-3 resonance will be
studied in hydrogen and in nuclear systems through photon scattering, neutral
pion photoproduction, and pion capture reactions. The emphasis will be on
measurement of coherent production and scattering, for which there is a well
developed isobar-hole theory. The muon anomalous magnetic moment will be
determined to 0.3 parts-per-million accuracy. At this level of sensitivity, a
20-fold improvement over existing data, it is possible to test the unified
electroweak theory. Deviation from the predictions of the standard model will
indicate the existence of new physics.
