This project consists of a program of research into logical and complexity
theoretic aspects of programming languages. It continues an ongoing commitment
to the study of type inference for functional programming languages, together
with a variety of associated topics spanning research questions in deductive
database theory, program transformation methodology, unification, and type
systems for records, objects and linear programs. The research program is
founded on the belief that this study of type inference will give deeper
understanding of the computational costs of embedding such mechanisms in a
compiler, thus providing some guidance to language designers as to what is
computationally feasible. The program is motivated as well by the belief that
the complexity of type inference provides a precise computational measure of the
expressiveness of programming languages.
