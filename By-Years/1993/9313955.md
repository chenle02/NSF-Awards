9313955 Nicolet Three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in
electronic materials between Marc A.-Nicolet of the California Institute of
Technology and Roland Madar of the Ecole Normale Superieure de Genie Physique in
Grenoble, France. The objective of their research is to study the reactions and
reaction prodects between silicon carbide (SiC) and metals. They will focus on
reactions between a selection of thin transition metal films and SiC. The U.S.
investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in the development of stable
metal/semiconductor contacts emphasizing silicon and gallium arsenide. This is
complemented by French expertise in the synthesis of mono-and polycrystalline
refractory materials, especially metal silicides. Silicon carbide is an
attractive material for high temperature, high power and high frequency
electronic devices. It is also used in fiber-reinforced metal-matrix composites.
It is the most promising material for high-power and high-temperature diodes and
transistors. This project will advance understanding of these materials and
provide the basis for design of silicon carbide devices. ***
