Studies of many body physics and quantum field theory will be performed, with a
special emphasis on non-linear phenomena. Within strong interaction physics,
numerical and analytical tools will be combined in the study of quantum
chromodynamics. Issues include the structure of the vacuum, hadrons and hadronic
matter, the mechanism of confinement and its effects on the chiral properties of
the vacuum. These insights and techniques will be used in an investigation of
the effect of a strong external field on the infrared properties of quantum
electrodynamics. In many body physics it is planned to study the transmutation
of statistics for Kinys, including the construction of a system of Kinys which
appear as changed fermions with minimal coupling to the photon field.
