The goal of this research project is to use disaggregated data and theoretical
models to study the behavior of bank balance sheet variables like loans and
equity and their importance for real activity. The motivating factor is that the
additional variation observed across the disaggregated elements of the data
provides an enormously rich source of new empirical information that can be used
not only to learn about the behavior of the disaggregated variables but also to
understand the behavior of aggregate variables. The contribution of this project
consists of constructing and disseminating consistently defined disaggregated
data sets of bank loans. Bank loans are disaggregated into three bank loan
components: Commercial and industrial (C&amp;I) loans, real estate, and consumer
loans. Empirical as well as theoretical studies typically focus on total bank
loans, even though the observed time series behavior of the three components
clearly differs. Bank loans are also disaggregated by region. The advantage of
disaggregating bank loans by region is that one can match regional financial
measures like bank loans with corresponding regional real activity measures.
Several studies have documented that this link is quite strong for business
loans. This is because these loans are not standardized products and the
relationship between firms and banks is clearly an important element in the
market for business loans. The data are also disaggregated by bank size. This is
important because the balance sheets of small banks are quite different than
those of large banks and because of, for example, informational asymmetries,
small banks are more likely to suffer from financial frictions in obtaining time
deposits. The data are posted on the investigator's website.
