Under the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Jean Chmielewski of Purdue
University conducts research to gain a clear understanding of the assembly
mechanisms of collagen-peptides into microstructures and the features necessary
for inclusion of functionality within these microstructures. The ultimate goal
of this research is to develop novel approaches to the rational control of
hierarchical assembly of collagen peptides into microstructures with desired
functionality. The size and shape of the supramolecular assemblies will be
manipulated with assembly signals appropriately positioned within collagen
triple helices and through ligand control to generate novel materials with
improved properties for biotechnology applications. The residual ligands and
interior cavities within the supramolecular assemblies will be harnessed to add
imaging functionality to the microstructures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of
collagen triple helical peptides as building blocks for microscale materials is
highly evocative and has broad implications for society and many areas of
science. In the long term the materials developed may be useful for in vivo drug
delivery and imaging, or have applications in tissue engineering. These studies
will also have a broad impact on graduate student and undergraduate training,
and the proposed K-4 interactions will help to inspire the next generation of
students in their appreciation of science and math. The emphasis on discovery
and education in this work is essential to reap the full benefits of research in
this field.
