9704373 Sutherland Following the recent discovery of several exact solutions of
important low dimensional models, for example models with long range
interactions in a lattice, calculations of ground state correlations including
time-dependent behavior and the use of conformal symmetry to calculate the
correlations, the PI is planning to study the application of these ideas to real
systems and develop formalism for the calculation of experimental observables
and compare them to the experiments. The specific experiments to be considered
in light of specific theoretical models are: (1) the optical properties of
conducting polymers and the sinh-cosh model (2) The Hubbard-Peierls model of
dimerized chains and hyperbolic exchange models and finally (3) the Coulomb gap,
its effect on the transport properties of electrons and its possible origins in
the calculation of ground state correlations. %%% The PI is well known for
several exact solutions to model problems in low dimensional systems. Here he is
planning to apply the insight he has gained form these exact solutions by
calculating experimental observables in some charge transfer compounds and
conducting polymers. He is planning to do this by a careful reconsideration of
the missing details in the models which he has already solved. He is hoping for
a close collaboration with several experimentalists and also theorists to
indicate the possible opportunities and areas of improvement. ***
