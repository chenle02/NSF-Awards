Evergreen State College will offer a two-week workshop during the summer of 1988
focusing on computer-based laboratory curricula for introductory college physics
and chemistry courses. The audience for the workshop is physics and chemistry
faculty from colleges around the country. The purpose of this workshop is to: *
demonstrate new ways of teaching introductory students to use personal computers
as a laboratory tool to log, manipulate, analyze, interpret, and present
experimental data, * explore the novel and unique laboratory experiments
developed as part of the science program at the Evergreen State College. *
demonstrate Evergreen's method of using laboratory explorations as a means of
integrating the teaching of introductory calculus, chemistry and physics at the
college level. The twenty participants selected for this interdisciplinary
workshop will engage in hands-on exploration of laboratory computer equipment,
software, and experiments. In addition to NSF funds, the college will provide
about 15% in personnel time and participants will contribute about 15% in travel
costs to the actual cost of the project.
