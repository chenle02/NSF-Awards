This award supports Professor Leiba Rodman of the College of William and Mary to
continue a highly productive collaboration in mathematics with Professors A. C.
M. Ran, M. A. Kaashoek, and I. Gohberg, of the Vrije University, Amsterdam, The
Netherlands. They are working together on several interrelated research topics
in the general area of systems and control. The common theme is a study of
invariant subspaces of matrices, rational matrix valued functions and the
interrelations between them. More specifically, the proposed research problems
include perturbation analysis of invariant spaces, symmetric factorization and
interpolation of symmetric rational matrix functions, and minimal factorizations
of real skew-symmetric rational matrix functions. The proposed work is in a
highly active area of mathematics involving linear algebra and classical
operator theory. Results will lead to a better understanding of invariant
subspaces of matrices (both general and special classes) and of several
interpolation and factorization problems for self-adjoint and skew-symmetric
matrix functions. These two topics are interrelated, and comprise an important
part of the ongoing research of a developing field of mathematics inspired by
and applied to modern electrical engineering.
