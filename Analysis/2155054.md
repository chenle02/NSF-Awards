This project focuses on several problems at the crossroads of analysis and
geometry that are united by a central theme: the use of functional and geometric
inequalities as a tool to explore the geometry of a manifold or domain. These
kinds of inequalities are used to describe ground states for physical systems,
for instance, in acoustics and materials science; a classical example is the
isoperimetric inequality, which mathematically describes why soap bubbles take a
spherical shape. The project provides research training opportunities for
graduate students. The results obtained as part of the project will be broadly
disseminated to the scientific community.

The project centers on stability and regularity estimates in different settings,
including regularity of Riemannian manifolds with scalar curvature bounds and
stability properties of their Laplace spectra; rectifiability results using the
Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman monotonicity formula; and quantitative estimates for the
Yamabe problem in conformal geometry. The research will bring together ideas
from geometric analysis, partial differential equations and the calculus of
variations, in terms of both techniques and applications.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
