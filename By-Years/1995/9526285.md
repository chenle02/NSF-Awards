The PIs propose to continue their theoretical study of the observed
magnetospheric effects of the comet SL-9/Jupiter impacts. Recently, they have
developed a qualitative interpretation of the mid-latitude aurora in terms of an
electrodynamic interaction between the southern-hemisphere ionosphere and the
conjugate ionosphere. Hill will develop a quantitative numerical model of this
dynamo interaction in order to test its ability to reproduce the observed
auroral arc morphology and dynamics. By perturbing existing models of the
electron radiation belt and comparing with observed frequency-dependent recovery
of the decimetric emissions, they will refine information about the otherwise
unobserved inner radiation belt of Jupiter. Finally, they will continue
investigating the charging of cometary dust by magnetospheric electrons.***
