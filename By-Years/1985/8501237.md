Cost over-runs are commonplace today, e.g. in construction of nuclear power
plants and mass transit systems, and in the generation of large, complex
software programs. Experiments are being made on a trial and error basis to
ascertain cost-effectiveness of computer-based factory automation. These and
other examples show that there is still much to be learned in the field of
engineering economy. Unfortunately, the research community is small and
practitioners in industry often have to learn by experience. The purpose of the
conference proposed here is to follow-up a conference held at Mountain Lake,
Virginia on August 28-29, 1984. A list of research topics was identified at that
conference, and placed in priority. It was found that the present scope of the
field is too narrow for modern industry and that the topics in the fields should
be better organized. The goal of this conference is to remedy these deficiencies
through the interchange of a working group of experts from industry and
academia.
