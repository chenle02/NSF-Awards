This grant is for support of the 36th International Symposium on Electron, Ion
and Photon Beams, Orlando, FL, May 26-29, 1992. This long-standing annual
symposium is considered the premier conference for the fields of nano- and
micro- fabrication, x-ray, electron and ion lithoqraphies and particle beam
optics. This request and previous years support by NSF has been intended to
enable graduate students who are working in these fields to attend the meeting
and present their work. Because this is an important enabling technology for the
microelectronics and other high-tech industries, and the requested use of NSF
funds for graduate student support will be very effective in enhancing the base
of trained researchers in these fields.
