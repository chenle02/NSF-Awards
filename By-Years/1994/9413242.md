9413242 Prasad Dr. Prasad will elucidate the observed molecular composition of
interstellar clouds through evolutionary chemical-dynamical models. In contrast
to most previous equilibrium chemical models which assume fixed physical
conditions, the proposed models will account for the fundamental interaction
between the chemistry and dynamics. It is expected that the new models can
better clarify: (1) The processes by which a given cloud can attain its present
state; (2) how it will further evolve with time, and (3) the growing
difficulties that are confronting current static pseudo-time-dependent gas phase
chemical models. This award is under the Small Grants for Exploratory Research
program at NSF.
