This is an award to support research on a membrane process of for oxygenation of
water. The research involves evaluation of the mass transfer characteristics of
vertically oriented hollow fibers, arranged in packets, and within which an
atmosphere of pure oxygen is maintained. The oxygen is transferred to the
horizontally-flowing fluid through the fiber walls without the formation of
bubbles as is characteristic of conventional oxygenation processes. This concept
has a potential for providing the required amount of respiratory oxygen at a
rate that is consistent with the biochemical oxygen demand of the bioprocess
without the loss of efficiency that is characteristic of oxygenation processes
that depend on oxygen-transfer from a rising or circulating pattern of bubbles.
Submerged-culture, biological processes for treatment of wastewaters depend upon
an adequate movement of oxygen into the reaction vessel to maintain a high rate
of aerobic, biological activity. Applications of the concept expected to emerge
from this research also include bringing effluents from wastewater treatment
processes up to levels consistent with maintenance of good levels of oxygen in
receiving streams, in maintaining desired levels of oxygen in ice-covered lakes,
and in compensating for loss of oxygen during use of hydropower in the
generation of electricity.
