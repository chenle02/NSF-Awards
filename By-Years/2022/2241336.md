This project will examine the conditions under which violence is perpetrated
against members of the press. The media is generally seen as an institution
playing a crucial role in good governance by holding powerful actors to account.
Yet it is precisely this position that can sometimes make journalists and other
media workers vulnerable to pressure by both state and non-state actors, from
threats to detention to outright killings. This project will produce a new data
set of media deaths worldwide, alongside a series of data sets on other forms of
media violence within specific countries. The project will provide systematic
evidence of the causes and consequences of both lethal and non-lethal violence
committed by different sorts of perpetrators against the media. Results from
this project will improve the understanding of scholars and practitioners of
when, where, and how the media are targeted, which has substantial security,
legal, and human rights implications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
develop a theoretical framework examining the contexts under which various forms
of violence against the media by state and non-state perpetrators takes place.
To test these theoretical propositions, a new and comprehensive data set
covering all killings and non-natural deaths of members of the media worldwide
will be collected for the period 1992-2020. These cross-national data will be
complemented by a series of sub-national databases within several countries
measuring other forms violence against the media, including threats, arrests,
and attacks. Results from this project will contribute to existing scholarly
research on media freedoms, political violence, and the rule of law. The data
sets generated will be made publicly available to the wider scholarly community
so that experts can employ these data for their own research
purposes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
