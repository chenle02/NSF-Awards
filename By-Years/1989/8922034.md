This project is an investigation of the transport of chemical trace elements and
species from source regions through the atmosphere to the Greenland ice sheet.
Its goal is to provide information for the interpretation of the trace element
distribution in a long ice core to be obtained through the Greenland Ice Sheet
Program (GISP-II) drilling effort. The ice core is expected to provide a
detailed record spanning 200,000 years. The project has three specific
objectives: (1) the identification of source regions and atmospheric pathways
for the chemical constituents reaching the drill site, including the possible
changes in air mass characteristics during transit, (2) the study of mechanisms
and rates of incorporation of chemical species into precipitating snow, and (3)
the investigation of post-depositional changes in snow chemistry and of the
redistribution of species within the snowpack. Field work consists of the
collecting of air, aerosol, precipitation, and deposited snow samples, which
will be analyzed for various anions and cations, trace elements, carbon
compounds, and trace gases. A special atmospheric camp, to ensure that samples
will be uncontaminated by the drilling, has been planned as part of the GISP-II
program.
