The 16th Texas Symposium on Relative Astrophysics will be combined with the 3rd
Symposium on Particles, Strings and Cosmology (PASCOS) in Berkeley, California
from 13 - 18 December 1992. The Texas meeting is known as the major
international meeting on topics of relativistic astrophysics, including the
physics of compact objects, cosmic rays, active galactic nuclei and cosmology
and is held in alternate years. The PASCOS meeting is international in scope and
unique in its interdisciplinary coverage of topics in cosmology, string theory
and particle physics. Combining the two meetings allows us to provide a thorough
exploration of the interface between astrophysics and particle physics,
involving a large audience of theorists and experimenters who work in
interdisciplinary areas. Research in these fields is sponsored by NSF, NASA and
DOE. Funding is requested to support this interdisciplinary conference.
