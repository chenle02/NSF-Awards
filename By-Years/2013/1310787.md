This action funds Julia M. Moriarty of Virginia Institute of Marine Science, the
College of William & Mary to conduct a research project in the Geosciences area
during the summer of 2013 at Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan. The project
title is "The Influence of Typhoons on Along-River Sediment Fluxes." The host
scientist is Dr. Shuh-Ji Kao.

Understanding changes in the transport of riverine material is crucial for
estimating sediment budgets, but particulate fluxes vary widely in response to
storms and other disturbances. Taiwan offers a unique opportunity to study these
fluxes because of the exceptional historical and ongoing records of river
discharge (water and sediment) along its small mountainous rivers, and because
the island's sediment yields (riverine sediment discharge divided by watershed
area) rank among the world's highest. Analysis of the historical record of daily
and hourly river gauge data enables analysis of along-river fluxes during both
low-energy periods and typhoons (e.g. 1996: Typhoon Herb; 2004: Typhoons
Mindulle and Aere). This project will make measurements along the Jhuoshuei
River (previously named the Choshui River) in 2013, including sediment
concentration and grain size, in order to supplement the historical data.

Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce. Furthermore, the research is being incorporated into an
interactive activity to engage visitors at Marine Science Day, an annual open
house at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) where attendance
annually exceeds 1,500 people. This activity is also being developed into a
grade-school lesson plan in collaboration with VIMS Marine Advisory Program
educators.
