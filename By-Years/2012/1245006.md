This project will produce challenge based workshops that are designed to improve
student conceptual understanding of heat transfer. Student misconceptions will
be measured using the thermal science concept inventory that was developed in
prior NSF work. The basic hypothesis is that students will be able to address
and correct misconceptions by performing experiments that utilize an innovative
sensor measuring heat flux. The assessment plan includes measures that will
identify whether or not student misunderstandings have been clarified. The
assessment will include data taken immediately after the lesson and data taken
at a later date thereby enabling researchers to better understand the longevity
of the changes made in student understanding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If
successful, the work could be very transformative. The inexpensive nature of the
equipment and the large number of students who study heat transfer are good
indications that there will be a large demand for and a small cost of
implementing similar programs nationally.
