The PIs will address the non-modal growth of forecast errors in numerical
weather prediction. Errors after day one into the forecast have large vertical
and horizontal scales, but their incipient cause has been found to be due to
errors in much smaller spatial scales and to have different structures such as
being tilted and dynamically unbalanced as opposed to barotropic and
geostrophic. Such error behavior is called non-modal. Based on singular vector
analysis, the implications of non-modal forecast error growth for potential
improvement of both weather forecasting and analysis of observational data will
be determined, and forecast sensitivity with respect to observational data
errors will be examined in order to better understand the impacts of the
observing system imperfections on forecast and data assimilation systems. These
questions will be addressed by applying the adjoint version of the data
assimilation and weather modeling system recently developed at NASA's Global
Modeling and Assimilation Office.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has the
potential to improve weather forecasts which are important for societal
activities.
