9314120 Martin In this study the investigators will study filament channels on
the sun. The behavior of filaments and filament channels is intimately tied to
solar activity on the sun, particularly coronal mass ejections. Filament
channels mark th eboundaries between large- scale bipolar magnetic regions whose
patterns of emergence, migration, and polarity reveal important aspects of the
solar cycle. The research includes the analysis of existing data, the
acquisition and analysis of new observations, and theoretical studies. Data from
several U. S. solar observatories will be used in the study. The observations
will be interpreted using models of filament formation and several workshops
will be held to discuss the results. The primary goal is to increase our
understanding of the physical processes related to the development of filament
channels on the sun. ***
