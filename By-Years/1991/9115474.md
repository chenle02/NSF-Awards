Equilibria, kinetics, and optical and infrared photochemistry of ions in the
gas-phase will be explored. The studies will be accomplished primarily with ion
cyclotron resonance (ICR) spectroscopy combined with conventional and laser
light sources. An underlying theme of this study will be to develop an
understanding of the intrinsic chemistry of highly reactive ions in relationship
to their structure when they are removed from the stabilizing forces of solvent
or crystals. Reactions that will be studied in the gas-phase are the SN2
reaction, acyl transfer reactions, reactions at unsaturated carbon, proton
transfer processes, electron transfer reactions, energy transfer processes, and
reactions of complex ions. %%% This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program
supports the continuing research of Professor John I. Brauman at Stanford
University. Most of the current knowledge of reactions involving ions (charged
species ) is in solution where the solvent greatly influences the reactions and
properties of ions. Professor Brauman will continue his studies of the reactions
of ions in the gas-phase, where the stabilizing effect of the solvent is no
longer present. Under the conditions afforded by the gas-phase, the intrinsic
chemistry of highly reactive ions will be studied in relationship to their
structure.
