9616748 Wittig This research examines the massive phase transformations in
binary and ternary Ti-Al alloys to determine the parent to product
crystallographic relationships and the effects of ternary elements on the
nucleation and growth of the massive transformation product. The base alloy has
a composition of Ti-48at%Al. To this stoichiometry, additions of the ternary
elements V, Nb, Cr, Mo, Mn, and Fe are added. Initially the work concentrates on
the V, Cr, and Mn series from row four of the periodic table. By utilizing the
University of Vanderbilt's undercooling, rapid quench technology, unique
nonequilibrium microstructures are formed that should help clarify present
confusion regarding the site preferences of ternary additions to gamma TiAl. The
rapidly cooled, splat- quenched samples are analyzed using optical microscopy,
X- ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and analytical electron
microscopy. By employing ALCHEMI to compare the non-equilibrium microstructures
of undercooled and rapidly quenched TiAl ternary alloys with equilibrium
conditions, the site occupation of the ternary elements can be characterized as
a function of Ti/Al stoichiometry. %%% Knowledge of the influence of ternary
atom additions on the unit cell structure is critical to the understanding of
the atomic mechanisms responsible for improved mechanical properties observed in
the Ti-Al 48at% ternary alloys. The high cooling rate, solid-state
transformations explored in this research give some insights onto other
nonequilibrium processes such as those found in the heat-affected zones of
welded alloys. ***
