This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program and the
Office of Special Projects is made to Dr. Keith H. Pannell of the Chemistry
Department, University of Texas at El Paso for collaborative work in the area of
silicon and germanium chemistry. The collaboration will involve members of Dr.
Pannell's research group and members of the research group of Dr. Laszlo
Parkanyi of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in Budapest. Because the presence
of dicarbonyl(cyclopenta- dienyl)iron as a substituent has been shown to promote
photochemically-induced rearrangements, isomerizations, and deoligomerizations
of oligosilanes and polysilanes, the details of bonding in such systems will be
studied. The method of mapping the locations of the silicon atoms will be an
X-ray technique jointly developed by Drs. Pannell and Parkanyi. The
investigation will be extended to include systems containing germanium as well
as silicon. %%% A method for examining the bonding in polymeric materials of
silicon and germanium containing metals will be developed. Such materials have
potentially useful electronic and optical properties. In addition, the project
promotes scientific collaboration between the United States and Hungary.
