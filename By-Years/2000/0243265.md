The project team is fast becoming a primary learning environment for engineering
students. From the perspective of education, positive team project experiences
can motivate students to perform at higher levels. The definition of what
factors specifically contribute to a successful team experience in engineering
education requires further definition and empirical study. One of the most
consistent aspects of the literature on teams is the importance of team roles to
successful team functioning. The notion behind the importance of team roles is
that certain predictable processes and behaviors must occur if a team is to
thrive. Increasing the awareness and training of team members to these roles
improves the chances that the appropriate behaviors will occur and the team will
meet its goals. This project is an exploratory study seeking to better
understand and empirically demonstrate the significance of functional roles on
engineering project teams. This study uses a focus group based investigation of
a variety of engineering team classes from freshman to seniors. In addition,
focus groups of major engineering disciplines, women, minorities, professional
engineers, and students who do not persist in an engineering program are being
conducted to become aware of individual differences in the team experience and
role taking by these diverse constituencies. Additionally, the instructors of
the capstone courses are being individually interviewed by the Principle
Investigators. If the presence and importance to team functioning and student
learning of functional roles is empirically supported, then the pilot study will
be followed by a larger scale proposal to create a psychometrically appropriate
assessment measure for evaluating student performance in functional roles.
