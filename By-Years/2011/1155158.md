This Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program is located at the Duke
University Marine Laboratory (DUML), Piver's Island, NC. The award supports a
three-year program that will provide eight student internships each summer for a
10-week research experience at DUML. The PI will recruit students nationally and
at Elizabeth City State, Savannah State University (SSU) and the 34 schools
(mainly non-PhD granting institutions) that are affiliated with the Marine
Laboratory in the Marine Sciences Educational Consortium. Students will live in
Marine Laboratory dormitories and take their meals in the dining hall. Students
will have a choice of ten advisors in the general research areas of (1) sensory
physiology and behavior, (2) environmental toxicology, (3) molecular biology and
genetics, and (4) coastal and estuarine processes. Co-curricular activities
include a Marine Laboratory-sponsored seminar program, participation in selected
field trips and water related recreational activities. At the end of the summer,
REU students present their results during a student research symposium, and they
prepare a scientific manuscript on their research. Support provided by NSF
includes funding for student stipends, student travel to and from the site,
student housing and meals and some administrative costs.
