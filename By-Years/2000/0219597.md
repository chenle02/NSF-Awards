Game consoles, with price points below $300, performance rivaling or exceeding
that of PCs, and graphics capabilities recently found only on high-end
visualization supercomputers, are the vanguard of yet another computing
generation . computing on toys. Moreover, market forces and fierce vendor
competition (e.g., among Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony) continue to fuel
technical innovation and performance improvements on these game platforms,
creating research and development incentives and deployment opportunities in new
domains. This proposal outlines a research plan to assess the utility and
performance of game systems for both scientific computing and high-resolution
visualization. This assessment of game systems will be based on development of a
suite of adaptive performance analysis tools that support both offline and
online performance optimization and their application to a suite of scientific
and visualization codes. This effort leverages proposed Red Hat and NCSA
software enhancements to PlayStation2 Linux software. In addition we currently
are negotiating with Sony to acquire and deploy a large PlayStation2 cluster at
NCSA for experimental assessment and scientific visualization. Our computing on
toys software research plan focuses on three areas: (a) offline, multilevel
performance instrumentation of applications and system software, (b) online,
adaptive selection of multi-version code execution, and (c) experimental
assessment using large-scale scientific applications and visualization software.
New hardware performance measurements, instrumented scientific and graphics
libraries, and performance derivatives, all integrated with our SvPablo
performance analysis infrastructure, will provide the requisite data to move
iterative performance tuning from an ad hoc style to one based on intelligent
feedback and suggestions. The offline version of this SvPablo extension will
accept performance metrics from hardware, software, and library instrumentation
and generates suggestions for tuning locations and options using a fuzzy logic
rule base that embodies performance tuning suggestions for the Sony
PlayStation2.
