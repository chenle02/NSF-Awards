This project will enable computational scientists to temporally and spatially
manage, navigate, and document large, multi-dimensional datasets using advanced
virtual reality (VR) technologies.

The primary objectives are to:

Research and develop a spatially and temporally-based VR software Application
Manager, coupled with a generalized navigation and interactive recording
applications programming interface (API), for use with CAVE, ImmersaDesk, and
Infinity Wall applications

Enable scientists to mange, navigate, and document interactive VR explorations
in realtime and then re-render the simulation data at higher resolution in non-
real time; this will provide researchers with a better understanding of their
science, as well as provide video-based educational materials

Disseminate information to the national scientific community using educational
materials developed with these advanced VR technologies

Science and engineering researchers attempt to solve complex problems by first
probing the data to discover underlying principles, and then documenting the
results so they can be reproduced by the research community. Three-dimensional
VR displays provide a far more powerful interface for data exploration that the
two-dimensional workstation screen. The importance of real-time VR navigational
recording and playback is twofold: (1) it provides and efficient mechanism to
store navigational data for subsequent renderings of full-resolution
simulations; and (2) it supports asynchronous collaboration among networked VR
remote sites.

This project software will also link to network communication libraries to
enable CAVE-to-CAVE recording mechanisms-the key to supporting asynchronous
collaboration. Funds are sought to support graduate students and summer faculty
research.
