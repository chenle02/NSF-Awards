The primary goals of the project are to validate the concept of newly developed
co-ex blown film processes and to develop new materials for the filament of 3-D
printing technology which may help in reducing the amount of persistent non-
biodegradable plastics waste. This project has the potential to be a leader in
producing multilayer co-ex films made of biodegradable cornstarch thermoplastic
(TPS) hybrid materials and biodegradable filaments for 3-D printing through
green innovation. At the end of the project, researchers plan to demonstrate the
following capabilities: biodegradable multi-layer films produced by novel
processes, new biodegradable filaments for 3-D printing, and 3-D prototype
products made of the new biodegradable materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There
has been a recent global interest in replacing petroleum-based synthetic
polymers with biodegradable hybrid materials to use renewable resources and
potentially reduce the amount of persistent non-biodegradable plastics waste. If
successful, the outcomes of this project would result in a new biodegradable
multi-layer film. Additionally through this project researchers plan to develop
an educational model focused on green innovation to promote undergraduate
research in the STEM fields.
