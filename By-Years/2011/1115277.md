This project will investigate the precise analytic form of the complex
singularities of&lt;br/&gt;the Lorenz system, the figure-eight solution of the
three-body problem, and signals obtained&lt;br/&gt;from the Navier-Stokes
boundary layer. Both analytic and numerical techniques&lt;br/&gt;will be used.
Research on the Lorenz system has the aim of understanding the
analytic&lt;br/&gt;continuation of the Lorenz solutions to the entire complex
plane. With regard to the&lt;br/&gt;figure-eight solution, the project will show
that the complex singularities of this system&lt;br/&gt;have an appealingly
simple structure. The Navier-Stokes boundary layer has been&lt;br/&gt;studied
primarily using techniques from spectral analysis. We will locate and
elucidate&lt;br/&gt;singularities of the analytic continuation of the signal in
the complex plane, and and&lt;br/&gt;obtain a measurement as well as an
understanding of the time scales imposed by the&lt;br/&gt;outer
flow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project endeavors to benefit the public in two
respects. Firstly, we aim to obtain&lt;br/&gt;new insights into the Navier-
Stokes boundary layer which is of immense importance in&lt;br/&gt;engineering
and meteorology. As an example of its importance, we mention that
a&lt;br/&gt;major part of the energy intake of automobiles is dissipated in the
boundary layer.&lt;br/&gt;Secondly, we will write a new book that puts computer
architecture at the heart of&lt;br/&gt;scientific computing. This book will
introduce a style of scientific computing that is&lt;br/&gt;deeply informed by
recent progress in computer architecture to a wider audience.
