Repetitive movements such as chewing, walking, and swimming, which are done
relatively unconsciously, are controlled by groups of connected nerve cells
known as central pattern generators (CPG). The subject of this award to Dr.
Peter Rowat will be modeling of a CPG which controls buccal movements in an
invertebrate; this system has been studied extensively over the past two decades
and a large amount of experimental data are available that can be used for
modeling the underlying mechanisms of this CPG. To investigate these mechanisms,
simplified, but biologically relevant, mathematical models will be developed;
the output of these models will then be compared with the experimentally
observed CPG output. The influence of neuromodulatory substances on the model
will be tested. Prediction of the most important biological components of this
CPG can be made by varying the strengths of components of the model in computer
simulations and by mathematical analysis. This research will contribute to
understanding the way in which repetitive movements are controlled by the
central nervous system.
