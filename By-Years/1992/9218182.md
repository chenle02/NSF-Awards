In recent years, cold-formed steel structures have been widely used in building
construction and other applications. A large number of research projects have
been performed in the United States and Australia to study the strengths of
individual cold-formed steel members, connections and structural systems. In
order to provide a forum for American and Australian experts to discuss the
recent research findings and the latest developments in this particular field
and to identify future research needs, an International Workshop is to be held
at the University of Sydney, Australia, on February 15-17, 1993. The discussion
will be concentrated on numerous specific subjects relative to (1) behavior of
the thin-walled elements, (2) flexural members, (3) compression members, (4)
purlin-sheeting systems, (5) composite decks, (6) tubular members (7) sandwich
panels, (8) connections, (9) test methods, (10) automotive components, (11)
specification developments, and (12) structural systems. These topics are
directly related to the transfer of technology and have economic significance
for the development of new design recommendations and construction methods.
