Computer programming has gained great popularity in elementary and secondary
education because it has been as a powerful tool by which children can develop
general problem solving skills and learn fundamental concepts in mathematics,
physics, and logistics, as well acquiring foundational understanding of computer
science. Unfortunately, research assessing these claims has found that students
fail to attain sufficient programming competence to serve as a basis for the
development of general problem solving skills. In addition, both research and
the practical experiences of expert software designers have suggested that the
analysis of the problem domain and the design of an overall plan of the software
are more central to the development of software than is learning to code.
Students in programming courses that emphasize design learn more than students
in other courses, but they still show little progress toward general problem
solving. Recently developed technology has simplified the relation between the
analysis and design phase, making it feasible to teach students software design
without first teaching them how to code. This project proposes to teach design
without coding and to evaluate critically the efficacy of such an approach. If
successful, this project will serve as a model that can be developed both for
introductory computer science courses and for computer literacy courses.
