The first careful experimental studies of gas-liquid phase separation (capillary
condensation) in well characterized materials, giving the full gas-liquid phase
diagram and critical point for a range of confined systems, were recently
reported by Thommes and Findenegg. In this project, the PIs will use Grand
Canonical Monte Carlo simulation to study these phase changes in controlled pore
glasses (CPGs), with a view to understanding and interpreting the confinement
effects involved. The simulations will employ an efficient parallelized Monte
Carlo program, based on histogram methods, and using the SemiGrand Ensemble.
Models of CPG will be prepared by two different methods involving the use of
Quench Molecular Dynamics to quench supercritical silica. These methods will be
tested and the best will be used in the future work. The absorption, and phase
transitions for sulfur hexafluoride in CPGs of various pore diameters will be
calculated and compared with the experimental data. This work will be followed
by studies of melting and freezing of simple fluids in CPGs, and again
comparisons with experiment will be an important part of the project.
