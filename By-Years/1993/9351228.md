9351228 Longshore An X-ray fluorescence spectrometer is being used as a state of
the art analytical instrument in the undergraduate geology curriculum. Operating
principles are being introduced in sophomore-level classes, and students are
having hands on experience with the equipment in several upper-division
laboratories, including petrography, igneous petrology, X-ray powder methods,
geochemistry, and economic geology. Students are using the apparatus to perform
high precision major and trace element analyses on a variety of geological
materials in these classes, elucidating course subject matter and gaining
practical experience with modern instrumentation. The analytical power of the
requested equipment is finding significant applications in senior undergraduate
research projects. The ability of the students to obtain accurate chemical data
is greatly enhancing their abilities to achieve their research objectives, to
solve important problems, and to contribute meaningfully to the knowledge of
northern California geology. Many of these undergraduate projects are leading to
publications and presentations at professional meetings. ***
