Hope College will renovate former library space housed in the Peale Science
Center into a modern facility for research and research training in molecular
biology-biochemistry. Specifically, they will develop a molecular
biology/biochemistry laboratory with an adjoining computer laboratory facility.
While the new laboratories will enhance the research productive of all faculty,
they will have a direct effect on the research programs of four faculty members
and their students. Since the time of their initial appointments at Hope
College, these members of the Hope College faculty have collectively worked with
135 undergraduate research students, 56 of whom have either obtained the Ph.D.
degree or are currently in graduate school. The renovated laboratories will
allow for integration of all aspects of their program. They will: 1) provide a
center for crucial and delicate research equipment; 2) provide extended bench
space for upper class student researchers; 3) enhance the ability of students
and faculty to conduct collaborative studies; 4) facilitate the integration of
bench-level research and research training with computer-based data acquisition
and analysis; and 5) provide a suitable setting and encouraging atmosphere for
students interested in conducting research in the expanding molecular sciences.
