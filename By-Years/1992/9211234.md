This study brings together different facets of capital management policies.
Specifically, it investigates structural estimation of investment, capital
retirement, and exit decision rules of plants using data from the U.S. cement
industry. The data available covers 1973-80 and spans the oil-shock period.
Because cement is a very fuel intensive product, a marked increase in
investment, capital retirement and plant closings in the cement industry were
observed during this period. Compared to the existing empirical models of
investment, the salient features of this project are that it allows for a more
flexible adjustment cost function, endogenous capital retirement and endogenous
exit of plants. Methodologically, a stochastic dynamic programming model within
an iterative estimation procedure will be solved numerically. A sensitivity
analysis will be conducted using the estimates obtained to quantify the
responses of investment, capital retirement and plant closings to changes in
demand and cost parameters as well as to policies such as the investment tax
credit and depreciation allowances.
