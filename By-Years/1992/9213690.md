The proposed research will result in an efficient and defensible landfill siting
model. A conceptual model of the landfill site evaluation and ranking process
will be developed utilizing expert opinions. Elements of uncertainty in the
model will be examined and appropriate techniques to more accurately manipulate
ambiguous data and reduce the uncertainty will be investigated. These techniques
include the fuzzy eigenvector method, the fuzzy entropy method, and the Monte
Carlo method for processing fuzzy data. A computer program will be created for
illustrating the developed model.
