The Supercomputing Teacher Enhancement Project (STEP) trains forty-six teachers
in the San Diego area over a period of 42 months. Six of the teachers are lead
teachers who receive extensive training at the Lawrence Livermore Labs prior to
the start of the project and at university expense. They serve as teaching
assistants working with the forty participating teachers over the following
three years. The participating teachers learn the basics of computational
science, programming, and high performance computing then are expected to share
and work with approximately ten other teachers in their schools. They learn to
use computing at many levels, to incorporate computational science into their
curriculum, and to develop activities or projects for students. The teacher
training consists of three week summer workshops, academic year meetings, and
visits to local facilities. Through the combined efforts of the universities,
the local school districts, the super computing center, and the community, the
project will directly impact students in urban and similar schools in the San
Diego area with a high number of minority students. The project targets
underrepresented teacher and teachers of students who are traditionally
underrepresented.
