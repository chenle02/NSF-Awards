The phenotype of immature neurons is influenced by cues from the local
environment in which they develop. One well-characterized environment cue is a
glycoprotein produced by various types of cultured cells, known as cholinergic
neuronal differentiation factor (CDF), or leukemia inhibitory factor. CDF, a
member of a group of growth/differentiation factors called cytokines, acts on a
wide range of cell types and exerts a variety of effects. This is in contrast to
the nerve growth factor family that mainly acts on neurons and supports their
survival. Despite our knowledge of a number of effects in vitro, the
physiological role of CDF in the developing nervous system is unknown, and it is
the goal of this research to understand this role. To elucidate the
physiological role of CDF, it is critical to know which neural cells respond to
CDF and which produce CDF in vivo. At present, the full spectrum of CDF-
responsive neural cells is unknown, and little is known about CDF-producing
cells in the nervous system. Using pure native CDF and its function-blocking
antibodies, two approaches are proposed for systematic investigation of
potential CDF-responsive and CDF-producing cells in the developing nervous
system: 1) examination of CDF receptor distribution by radioautography using
iodinated native CDF as a probe; 2) determination of the tissue content of CDF
protein by two-site immunoassay. These studies will provide essential
information necessary for formulating specific hypotheses for the role of CDF in
the developing nervous system.
