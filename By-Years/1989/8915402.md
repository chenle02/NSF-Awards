This is a project to continue the sampling and geochemical analysis of
Galapagos lavas to the off-shore regions of the platform in order to define the
nature of the Galapagos hotspot. Sampling, analysis and dating, combined with
the analysis of gravity data, will permit the testing of the thermal entrainment
of Mid-ocean Ridge basalt material into the center of the Galapagos plume. %%%
One of the most interesting problems in understanding the geochemistry of rocks
emplaced on the sea floor is the determine the nature of the interaction between
processes that generate basaltic rocks that are found in a normal ocean ridge
axis environment and process associated with deep seated hot spot plumes in the
mantle. Preliminary study of rocks from the Galapagos platform show that rocks
from the interior of the platform look like normal mid ocean ridge basalts,
whereas those on the margins of the platform have compositions resembling
plumes-type rocks. This rock sampling and analytical program will help test an
interesting hypothesis developed by geophysicists regarding the dynamics of
plumes that can give rise to the unusual geochemical signature. The personnel
for this project are most appropriate because Dr. Christie has considerable
experience at sea, Dr. McBirney has done considerable work on the Galapagos
Islands, Dr. Richard has developed the hypothesis that is being tested. Drs.
Duncan and White provide the necessary analytical expertise.
