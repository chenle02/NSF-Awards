This is a SBIR Phase I project in the topic area of biological instrumentation.
Princeton X-Ray Laser, Inc. will develop a technology that allows a 3D display
of 2D images. Such technology will be useful as an attachment to high power
microscopes used in cell biology research. Medical imaging is a long-term
application potential, as well.
