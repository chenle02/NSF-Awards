STEM-Trek, a Nonprofit organization, has facilitated events prior to the annual
Supercomputing Conference since 2015. In collaboration with Dan Stanzione
(Director, Texas Advanced Computing Center and National Science Foundation’s
(NSF) Ranger project), the first workshop was for high-performance computing
(HPC) systems administrators at TACC prior to SC15 in Austin, Texas. The second:
“HPC On Common Ground@SC16,” focused on food security science in collaboration
with principal investigators from the University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State.
URISC@SC17 (Understanding Risk in Shared Cyberecosystems) was led by NSF
Trusted-CI Director Von Welch (Indiana University). In 2018-20, the organization
held smaller events that took on a more multidisciplinary scope – attendees
either support or are actively engaged with basic research – many with
industrial partners - in a wide range of domains. The organizers plan to return
to the pre-conference format for EarthSci@SC22 in Dallas Texas, Nov. 13-18 which
facilitates meaningful relationships before delegates enter the main event
which, due to its size (&gt;10k), can be overwhelming. The event will broaden
participation to include demographics that are underrepresented in research
computing and data science careers and academics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
