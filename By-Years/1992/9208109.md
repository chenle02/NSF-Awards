The research will examine patterns of herbivory in host hybrid zones. Three
related projects are proposed that will elucidate for a gall wasp-leaf miner-oak
system: 1) the genetic structure of oak hybrid zones, 2) patterns of herbivore
density and species diversity in a variety of hybrid combinations, and 3)
mechanisms responsible for variation in herbivore loads between host taxa within
oak hybrid zones. A combination of correlative, experimental, and molecular
genetic approaches are proposed. The correlative and experimental analyses are
designed to test three mutually exclusive hypotheses regarding patterns of
herbivory in host hybrid zones. The genetic analysis will introduce a new
technique to plant-insect ecology, RAPD (for Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA),
that will distinguish among three competing models of introgressive
hybridization and host susceptibility to parasites. The work has important
implications for the introduction of hybrid and genetically engineered
agricultural crops, and for the conservation of endangered species threatened by
interspecific hybridization.
