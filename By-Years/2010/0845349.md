an opportunity for on-the-go Internet connectivity, deploying, monitoring, and
maintaining distributed mobile applications introduces new challenges for
software developers. Seemingly trivial tasks--such as configuring devices,
starting executions, and tracking errors--are complicated by the unique
characteristics of mobile environments. Historically, application management
frameworks have helped developers cope with the complexities of managing
applications; however, no existing frameworks address the challenges presented
by mobile networks. To this end, this proposal has the following goals: 1)
investigate mechanisms for the delay tolerant control of mobile applications
that enable distributed application management despite network disruptions; 2)
develop and evaluate algorithms for partially predictable resource scheduling
that leverage the predictable patterns of human interaction to fairly arbitrate
access to mobile devices in shared testbeds; 3) develop a software toolkit for
mobile application management that simplifies application deployment and
visualization. The framework will implement a set of unified abstractions that
shield developers from the complexities of managing applications on mobile
computing devices. The results of the work will benefit a range of students,
researchers, and developers by advancing the state-of-the-art for mobile
application management and enabling easier access to experimentation on mobile
testbeds. By integrating the framework with shared mobile testbeds,
undergraduates at small colleges with little prior exposure to systems
development, including women and underrepresented groups, will experience the
technological richness of large research institutions and gain hands-on
experience with developing real distributed systems.
