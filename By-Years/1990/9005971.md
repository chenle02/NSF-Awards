With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Jackson will develop new methods for investigating the ways
in which gas molecules behave on, and interact with, solid surfaces at finite
temperatures. The PI will extend time dependent scattering theory to finite
surface temperatures, thereby allowing for a better connection to be made
between theory and experiment. The gas molecule and the surface and bulk
vibrations are evolved self consistently and in a fully quantum manner, so that
both one-phonon and multiphonon interactions can be described. The dependence of
atom- and diatom-metal sticking probabilities on the properties of the gas
particle, the solid, and the gas-surface interaction will be studied.
