A common mistake people have about the nature of scientific discovery is that it
is often mere chance that a particular person or laboratory or nation or even an
entire culture makes a scientific advance. Penicillin was discovered, in this
theory, by a chance examination of a particular mold. Kekule discovered the
structure of the benzene ring because he dreamt of a snake biting its own tail.
Yet none of these discoveries would have been made if the scientists did not
already have a "prepared" mind that was ready to recognize possible solutions to
problems when they see them. This "prepared" mind is what Dr. Eastwood is
studying. In his case, though, he is examining not the preparation of a single
scientist like Kekule but an entire culture. He is looking at nothing less than
the critical issue of why science rose in the West rather than in other
cultures. After all, in the Middle Ages, China, India, and the Muslim countries
of the Middle East were far, far more advanced than the cultures of Europe.
Indeed, it was only because the Middle Eastern and Northern African countries
passed on to Europe the science that they had received and developed from the
Greeks that Western Europe was even set on the track to develop modern science.
Yet as Dr. Eastwood points out, just like Kekule, the Western world had to be
prepared to receive and work with the materials they were given from the Middle
East and Africa. What about Western culture led the scholars to accept this
science and transform it to make what is modern science? Clearly it was not the
materials alone that caused this. If the knowledge the West received from Arab
scholars automatically led to modern science, then why didn't the Arabs make the
transformation? Dr. Eastwood is examining in the context of mathematical
astronomy how Europe was both well-prepared and had internally developed motives
to pursue Arabic mathematical astronomy. This motivation led the West not only
to take what the Arabs gave them but transform it into, fir st, the Newtonian
and, ultimately, the Einsteinian world views. Thus, this study promises to
address the central question in the culture of science: what is it about Western
Civilization that leads to the rise of science and technology. Dr. Eastwood will
not provide the definitive answer, but he will surely provide a part of it.
