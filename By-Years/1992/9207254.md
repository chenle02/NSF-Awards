The Pacific to Arizona Crustal Experiment (PACE) is a multidisciplinary
transect which crosses an old magmatic arc, a continental rift, a transform
plate boundary, and an extensional terrane located in southern California. This
award supports a magnetotelluric survey along this transect. MT soundings, to
date, have revealed a strong correlation with detachment fault geometry east of
the Salton Trough in the Chocolate Mountains extensional terrane. Also, a
regional detachment surface postulated by seismologists has probably been
detected beneath the Peninsular Ranges.
