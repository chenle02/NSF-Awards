This project will study the fundamental behavior of manufacturing processes,
including the gas-metal-arc welding process, the production of metal powders
using applied magnetic fields, the radiation-induced curing of composite
materials and the production of fiber and ply waviness in composites. The
resulting physical understanding will be applied to the sensor-based control of
these processes, to improve the consistency and reliability of the processes. It
is expected that the resulting work will have significant application to
improving the quality and productivity of the manufacturing industry.
