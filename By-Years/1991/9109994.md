In response to discussions with the Assistant to the President for Science and
Technology, a request from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), interest
in both Houses of Congress, and interest in the research community, the
Commission on Life Sciences (CLS) proposes to organize and lead a multi-
commission National Research Council (NRC) assessment of the status of
environmental research in the United States, including current research
activities, needs, funding and trends. The study would examine ways to improve
federal programs and funding for environmental research and training, including
various proposals to establish National Institutes for the Environment and other
ways to improve the science base in environmental protection and resource
management. Total estimated costs for this 15-month study are $650,000, of which
the National Science Foundation is asked to contribute $50,000. Remaining funds
are being requested from the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of
the Interior, the Department of Energy, the Department of Defense, and the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. An award for this important
planning study is recommended.
