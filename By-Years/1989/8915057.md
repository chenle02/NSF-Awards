This two-year project will extend Dr. Kokar's concept-learning system, COPER, to
the domain of dynamic-system identification and control. It will focus on model
identification in domains where processes change their goals and characteristics
at random intervals, necessitating continuous validation and adaptation of the
plant model. COPER will infer a set of local models, each adequate to maintain
the process in a safe operating region during its appropriate control regime.
This should contribute to the theory of intelligent control within switching
environments.
