Spectral methods are a class of techniques used in applied mathematics and
scientific computing to numerically solve certain differential equations.
Solutions for many problems of interest exhibit local singular behaviors which
contaminate the accuracy of usual spectral/spectral-element methods. Many
complex systems exhibiting anomalous diffusion can be better modeled with
fractional partial differential equations, which are numerically challenging due
to their nonlocal nature. Spectral/spectral-element methods usually lead to
dense or block dense and ill-conditioned matrices that are difficult and
expensive to solve. The focus of this project is to design, analyze, and
implement fast and robust spectral methods for a class of numerically
challenging problems. The numerical simulations will enable us to handle
challenging problems having stringent accuracy and/or memory requirements with a
reasonable cost in CPU and turn-around time, and will contribute to a better
understanding of some fundamental issues in materials science and fluid dynamics
through fast and accurate numerical simulations. Another important goal of this
project is to engage graduate students in learning necessary skills of
computational and applied mathematics so that they can pursue a successful
career in sciences and engineering.

The PI will address these issues with the following tasks: (i) develop effective
Muntz Galerkin method to deal with problems with singular solutions; (ii)
develop efficient and accurate spectral methods for solving a class of
fractional differential equations by constructing special basis functions with
generalized Jacobi and Laguerre functions, and derive corresponding error
estimates; (iii) develop direct structured solvers with optimal computational
complexity for dense or block dense linear systems arising from
spectral/spectral-element discretization; and (iv) develop efficient spectral
algorithms for solving the phase-field model of electro-magnetic couplings in
ferroelectric and multiferroic nanostructures. The research will result in fast
and stable direct spectral/spectral-element solvers for a class of partial
differential equations as well as fast Jacobi/spherical harmonic transforms.
This project will also result in a set of computational modules to efficiently
and accurately solve the coupled nonlinear system for the phase-field model of
electro-magnetic couplings in ferroelectric and multiferroic nanostructures.
