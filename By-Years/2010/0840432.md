With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
Multiuser Program (CRIF:MU), Professor Azzedine Bensalem and colleagues Jonathan
Gough and Wayne F. Schatter from Long Island University will acquire a gas
chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) equipped with an auto-sampler. This
instrument will support research in studies of the reaction progress and
products of a cycloaddition reaction of vinylketene complexes with alkynes; the
synthesis of putative single molecule diodes; the analysis of solid phase
synthesis of biologically active peptides; identification of target proteins;
analysis during the synthesis of pyrroloxanthone derivatives and inhibitors of
ornithine decarboxylase; preparation of ethylene naphthalate monomers;
separation and identification of decomposition products from the biological
treatment of organic waste and analysis of sugar degradation species.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection
(GC/MS) is an extremely powerful technique used for the separation and analysis
of complex mixtures. The results from studies using the requested spectrometer
will have an impact on organic/organometallic chemistry, chemical biology,
natural product chemistry, catalysis, and waste treatment. This instrument will
also be an integral part of teaching as well as research.
