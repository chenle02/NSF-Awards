This project supports the dissertation research of a cultural anthropologist
studying the enculturation of children as consumers in an eastern city (New
Haven). Ten-year old children from a middle class and a poor neighborhood will
be studied through focus groups, observations of individual play sessions,
structured interviews with children and parents, and participant observation.
This study's contribution to the understanding of consumption will be in
documenting the process of children's enculturation as consumers, by studying
children as active participants in the process of learning consumer-related
skills. As a study of one case in the world's largest consumer society, this
project will help us understand the ways people become consumption-oriented,
which can help us design programs and policies to moderate the excesses of
consumption.
