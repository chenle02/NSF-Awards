The Boston University Conference on Language Development (BUCLD)is an
internationally recognized meeting of researchers in language acquisition and
development, including first and second language acquisition, language
disorders, bilingualism, and literacy development. BUCLD promotes the progress
of science by providing a major venue for dissemination of scholarly findings,
for initiation and development of collaborations, and for professional
networking. The conference consists of approximately 190 presentations selected
through peer review, as well as invited keynote and plenary speakers, a
symposium on a topic of current interest, a research funding workshop, a
professional development workshop for students and early-career scholars,
mentoring opportunities, and a publisher exhibit. Attendees number over 500
researchers from around the world, from undergraduates through senior faculty.
Full ASL interpreting coverage is provided throughout the conference, and
conference proceedings are published soon after the conference.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports accessibility, diversity, and
inclusion at BUCLD by subsidizing travel expenses for students, including
students from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds, students with disabilities, and
first-generation college students. In addition, funding supports the effort of
the student conference organizers, who are graduate students in Linguistics and
allied fields. Support for student travel enables student
contributions—regularly among the highest-rated abstract submissions—to be
presented at the conference without undue hardship. Attendance at BUCLD
increases the exposure of students to the top research and researchers in the
field in a friendly and interactive environment. Furthermore, support for
student organizers allows BUCLD to play an important role in training students
as future professionals. Finally, funding supports development of a sustainable
and flexible model for BUCLD that enables continuity of the conference in future
years and navigates the challenges and opportunities of scientific conferences
in a post-COVID world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
