9407975 Christy The research entails the study of low dimensional dynamical
systems and relevant topological structures. The techniques are drawn from
combinatorial topology and hyperbolic systems. The aim is a classification of
low dimensional systems which can be implemented via algorithmic design to
computational methods. This would then lead to applications in other areas of
mathematics, such as the topological structures on 3-manifolds and and quantum
field theory. ***
