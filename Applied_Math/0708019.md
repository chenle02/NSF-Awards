The main objective of the project is the development of new mathematical tools
for analysis and design of discontinuous feedback control for finite- and
infinite-dimensional dynamical systems. The major directions for research are
(i) development of a geometric control theory for nonlinear dynamical systems
described by partial differential equations to obtain, in particular, conditions
for global controllability in generalized Lie-brackets terms; (ii) design of
stabilizing discontinuous feedbacks for such infinite-dimensional control
systems and analysis of their robustness properties; (iii) study of dynamical
control systems under persistent disturbances and problems of their robust
feedback stabilization; (iv) applications of these result to design of nonlinear
dynamical observers; (v) development of new optimality conditions for optimal
feedback controls in differential games; (vi) application of such conditions to
problems of optimal group pursuit; (vii) development of nonsmooth analysis
methods for design of nonsmooth control Lyapunov functions and robust
discontinuous feedback satisfying required specifications.

It has been recognized during last two decades that high performance of numerous
nonlinear control systems arising in engineering applications can be achieved
only by using discontinuous feedback controllers. One example of such a
controller is given by sliding mode controllers which are used in important
electrical-mechanical systems for stabilization and control. This research
project will develop a unified mathematical approach to the design of
discontinuous feedback controllers and analysis of their robustness and
performance characteristics. Other examples of the need for discontinuous
feedback controllers are provided by numerous control and stabilization problems
for infinite-dimensional systems such as stabilization problems for fluid flows
or quantum-mechanical systems arising in new technological developments. This
project will develop geometric control theory for such infinite-dimensional
systems to address problems of their feedback control and stabilization by using
nonsmooth analysis tools. Such new tools can be used to design feedback
controllers in numerous cases when traditional engineering linearization
techniques don't work. Currently problems of coordinated control for groups of
autonomous vehicles are the subject of significant interest for control
engineers. New tools of nonsmooth analysis will be used to obtain new algorithms
for optimal coordinated control of group of autonomous vehicles, in particular,
in optimal group pursuit.
