The Design and Development of a Network Process Migration System

Intensive research has been done in process migration and mobility. However,
most present successes are based on safe-languages such as Java. While this
safe-language approach provides a satisfactory solution for many applications,
it has inherent limitations, especially for technical computing applications.
During the last few years, the Principle Investigator (PI) and his research
group have developed a set of methodologies to support heterogeneous process
migration for high performance computing. This has included a practical data-
collection-restoration methodology applicable to codes written in legacy
languages such as C or Fortran, an effective data representation and transfer
scheme for heterogeneous network environments, and a feasible communication
protocol for process coordination in a migration-supported dynamic environment.
In this research, the PI proposes to further test these existing methodologies,
develop a methodology for I/O state transfer, and explore the design of an
integrated network process migration system to support process migration of
legacy codes written in stack-based languages such as C, Fortran, or C++ in a
heterogeneous network environment.
