9521470 Collier This program is a hydrothermal plume sampling program that will
take place during ALVIN dive program on the southern East Pacific Rise at 17
degrees south. The dive program is led by M. Lilley and K Von Damm. The research
will address the evolution of reactive species in the young plumes and will tie
the individual vent-classes sampled by ALVIN to the integrated plume
compositions leaving the vent fields. A series of CTD-transmissometer-rosette
tows will provide continuous sections of hydrothermal tracers and will be
combined with a series of vertical hydrocasts concentrating water samples at
specific portions of the plumes associated with ALVIN vents samples. Real time
and shipboard data will be combined to locate or verify the vent sources by
gradient analysis within the framework of bathymetric and supporting survey
data.
