The project will focus on the specification, programming, and implementation of
different kinds of distributed shared memories. Proof techniques and programming
methodologies will be developed for dealing with the complexities in these
definitions. Conditions will be developed under which programming with these
weak memories has the same net effect as programming in the more familiar
sequential domain. The developed methodologies will support both a posteriori as
well as a priori approaches towards program design and verification. A testbed
for distributed shared memories will be implemented. This testbed will function
in a heterogeneous environment of a parallel machine and a high- performance
local area network, and will be used for experimenting with protocols and
applications from the scientific, database, and digital libraries domain. The
testbed will also support distributed simulation of shared memories and
architectures.
