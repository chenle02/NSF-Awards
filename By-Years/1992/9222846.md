The Keystone Conference on "Evolution and Plant Development" will be held at
Taos, New Mexico, January 26 through February 1, 1993. %%% This is the first
such conference specifically organized around the evolution of plant development
and thus brings together plant biologist who would not normally be present at
the same meeting. Particularly, younger scientists who will be encouraged to
attend, should benefit greatly from such interaction.
