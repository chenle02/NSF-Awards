Viruses have shells made of repeated protein subunits surrounding their genetic
information. Many viruses, including polio, herpes, and influenza, have
icosahedraloshaped shells. It is not understood how these shells self-assemble
from hundreds of similar protein subunits. A resolution to this question is
important because it allows us to better understand biological phenomena in
general and provides a paradigm for nano- and meso-scale self- assembling
systems which will become increasingly important in materials and manufacturing.
It might also eventually result in mechanisms for interrupting shell formation
and interfering with the infection process. Drs. Berger (MIT) and Prevelige
(Univ. of Alabama at Birmingham) are using cutting edge high performance
computing and biotechnology to design a realistic computer "toolkit" that will
allow biologists to study virus shell assembly on a computer screen more easily
and less expensively than comparable laboratory work. The synergy of
computational and biochemical approaches promises rapid advances in our
understanding of virus assembly and self-assembling systems in general. This

Mathematics Program (MPS), and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (MPS).
