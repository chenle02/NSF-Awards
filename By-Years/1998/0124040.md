This award will provide support for graduate students and junior investigators
to attend the International Nuclear Physics Conference in Berkeley, California.
The conference will cover all aspects of nuclear physics research, with special
emphasis on new directions, new opportunities, and the impact of nuclear science
on society. Held every three years, this marks the first time that the
conference venue has been in the United States since 1980.
