This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is aimed at developing
carbon nanotube electromechanical pressure sensors. The characteristics of
nanotube pressure sensors will include superior sensitivity, higher thermal
stability and wider sensing ranges than conventional silicon-based pressure
sensors. The project could lead to the first nanotechnology-based physical
sensor products and enable a new generation of nano- electromechanical systems
(NEMS) that convert mechanical effects into electrical signals. The research
will combine chemistry for synthesis of materials and microfabrication. The main
task of this Phase I research is to demonstrate the feasibility of nanotube
pressure sensor by determining the device's gauge factor, linearity, and the
temperature dependence of nanotubes. Phase II will focus on device stability,
repeatability, reproducibility and scalability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
development of a new generation of sensing devices with wide industrial
applications will provide benefit in many areas. Products with improved
performance characteristics and the spread of emerging nanotechnology into other
industrial applications and improved pressure sensors at a lower price will
directly provide increased public and industrial (automotive, healthcare, etc.)
safety. The success of the program will benefit the nanotechnology area in
general, making nanotechnology one-step closer to important real-world
applications. &lt;br/&gt;
