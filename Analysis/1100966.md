This project concentrates on the study of special Lagrangian equations,
symmetric Hessian equations, Isaacs equations, complex Monge-Ampere equations,
and their parabolic versions (e.g., Lagrangian mean curvature flows). The theory
of regularity and solvability for fully nonlinear uniformly elliptic and
parabolic equations (with the convexity condition in general dimensions and
without the convexity hypothesis in dimension two) is well developed. The
concrete equations just listed either do not satisfy the convexity condition or
do not exhibit uniform ellipticity or parabolicity. Only preliminary attempts
have been made in the general saddle cases. Substantial advances have been
achieved for the symmetric Hessian equations and the complex Monge-Ampere
equations, yet there is still no Schauder or Calderon-Zygmund theory for these
equations; and surprisingly the regularity problem for the quadratic symmetric
Hessian equations in general dimension still remains open. This project seeks to
address these fundamental issues.

Investigations into the aforementioned equations will further our knowledge of
two closely related mathematical fields, partial differential equations and
differential geometry. Moreover, the project will also have impact on the areas
where these equations arise. Special Lagrangian equations and complex Monge-
Ampere equations provide the mathematical foundation for mirror symmetry in the
string theory of modern physics, which is a unified way to describe our physical
universe. Solutions to Isaacs equations lead to the optimal strategy for certain
random processes, for example, in engineering and finance. Hessian equations are
also related to nonlinear elasticity theory in mechanics, which studies the
mechanisms whereby a material that is stretched returns to its original size and
shape. Part of the research also involves participation of graduate students.
