This award supports several theoretical astrophysical investigations: 1) The
solid-state physics appropriate for brown dwarf stars and their evolution; 2)
the fate and longevity of magnetic fields within neutron stars; 3) oscillations
of neutron stars that may explain features of pulsar radiation; and 4) forces
controlling rotating magnetic astrophysical gas jets. Astronomers are
discovering ever more exotic kinds of stars, including "brown dwarfs" and
"neutron stars." The materials within these stars are more similar to materials
and plasmas on Earth than to the gases of ordinary stars. This grant supports
theoretical investigations concerning the structure of these stars. The
astrophysical application of solid-state and plasma physics should provide
observational tests for all three sciences.
