This is a six day conference on algebraic geometry with an emphasis on the
theory of complex projective curves and related varieties. The conference will
be held at Sundance, just east of Provo, Utah, from July 18 to July 23, 1988.
Some funds are available for participant support. The conference is under the
direction of Professor Robert Speiser of Brigham Young University. Progress on
the foundatons of the theory of complex algebraic curves has led to the solution
of several classical problems, and has interactions with string theory. A
special series of lectures at the conference on this interaction aims to
facilitate the growing communication with physics.
