The focus of this research project is to measure molecular geometries as well as
ion-ion, ion-electron and electron-electron collective motion in three-atom
systems. The measurements will provide insight into the partnership between
electronic and atomic motion within the system and how energy is transferred
from the laser field to the molecule. On the broader impact, the ability to
control chemical reactions by breaking (or forming) specific bonds with a laser
would have tremendous industrial benefits, ranging from chemical processing to
enhancing deposition processes. On the educational side, a special effort will
be made to involve investigators from underrepresented groups in this program,
and a special recruiting effort will be undertaken.
