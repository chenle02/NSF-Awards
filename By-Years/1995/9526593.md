9526593 Hoffman The Institute for Computer and Telecommunications System Policy
(ICTSP), a research center at the George Washington University serves as a
unique, interdisciplinary policy institute for both the University and the
Washington region. The ICTSP wants to focus on new telecommunications issues
that make their way onto the public agenda. A number of public policy issues
have been identified which ICTSP will be researching and facilitating
discussions for. This proposal requests stable funding to provide a base from
which to build ongoing work and so that technological building of the network
infrastructure can have a solid underpinning of well- reasoned policy decisions
and can support any reasonable set of policy assumptions. Funding provided by
this grant will help put in place mechanisms for supporting reports, videotapes
and other works produced by affiliated scholars.
