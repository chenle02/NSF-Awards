Numerical calculations on a supercomputer are to be carried out to predict
three-dimensional flow in a viscous mixing layer containing vorticity and shear
arranged in a geometrically complex arrangement compared to that in two-
dimensional flow. A multi-domain spectral code developed for other purposes is
to be applied to this flow.
