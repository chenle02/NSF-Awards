A dynamic mechanical spectroscopy equipment will be purchased to study
characterization of fluid, semi-solid, bulk materials, including polymer melts,
liquid crystals, latex polymers, elastomers, plastics and other polymer
combinations. The work will study sound and vibration damping in polymeric
materials.//
