The addition of an SEM and ancillary equipment allows modern morphological
instruction to be incorporated into the curriculum at all levels. The SEM most
significantly enhances the curriculum by providing a three-dimensional
perspective of tissue, cell, and intracellular structure, and thereby
complements the more traditional two-dimensional data. The SEM provides a unique
component in that it is directly used by undergraduates enrolled in the Cell
Biology, Microtechnique, and Electron Microscopy courses. Moreover, students who
have successfully completed the three courses noted above, are encouraged to
utilize the SEM in their research projects, also an integral element of the
Biology program.
