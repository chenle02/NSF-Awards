This proposal will address issues of sessile droplet coalescence, such as what
role does asymmetries in bulk fluid properties, contact angle, and drop size
have on mixing in two drops coalescing on a surface, and what different effects
could occur when the surfaces are either homogeneous or heterogeneous. The work
will use a testing platform, in which specimen drop and satellite drops of
reagent are allowed to mix. The research plan is organized into three
Objectives. In the first the PIs aim to investigate the effects of properties,
contact angle and size on coalescence in homogeneous surfaces. The second
objective will consider interfacial tension asymmetry, and the third will
examine coalescence in more interesting surfaces, including superhydrophobic
substrates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal has a strong, clearly developed
research plan that, if successful, can have a technologically broad impact since
many applications such as spray coating and inkjet printing rely on the
coalescence of drops on surfaces. Control over these mixing patterns during
coalescence can lead to new applications that take advantage of this control
including medical diagnostic platform based on the merging of a central target
specimen drop with several satellite drops containing reagents. The proposal
also includes educational broad impact through developing and teaching new
graduate-level courses, supervising students, and outreach programs.
