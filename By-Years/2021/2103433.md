This workshop will advance scientific community readiness to share dataset
metadata and create evidence-based practices to maximize the impact of that
sharing. The workshop will do this by addressing the need for focused
collaboration between scientists and information and technology professionals to
understand, support, and promote the growth of “data communities,” formal or
informal networks of scientists who voluntarily share and reuse a particular
type of data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
