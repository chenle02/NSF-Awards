This project will use an array of 18 200MHz Pentium Pro processors with an
aggregate memory of 1216 MB to reconstruct phylogenetic trees from molecular
data sets that are too large for analysis by present methods, and to conduct
large-scale comparative performance analyses of competing phylogenetic
reconstruction algorithms. Large-scale phylogenetic reconstructions using
parallel heuristic methods designed by the grantees are expected to lead to new
results in seed plant evolution, and in the most- parsimonious reconstruction of
the tree of life. Large-scale comparative performance analyses will explore a
five-dimensional parameter space for data sets of 50 to 1000 sequences. These
analyses are expected to lead to new observations of the relative strengths and
weaknesses of competing methods and to new classes of adversarial examples.
