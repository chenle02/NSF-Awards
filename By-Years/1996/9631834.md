9631834 Marchand The PI proposes to hold a workshop on the topic of wavelength
division multiplexing (WDM) in free space optical systems, particularly
processing systems that use smart pixel as the processing element and optics for
the interconnection. The goal of the workshop is to bring together members of
the scientific and engineering community that work in systems and device related
areas such as free space optical systems, smart pixels, optoelectronic devices,
and wavelength division multiplexing to discuss and access the potential impact
of WDM on free space optical architecture and related applications. ***
