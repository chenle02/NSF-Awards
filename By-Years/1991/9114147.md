This award supports Professor Herbert Moskowitz of Purdue University to
collaborate in Social Science research with several international scholars from
the UK, Turkey and Finland who bring a variety of useful and complementary
expertise in applied mathematics, statistics, management science, decision
theory and economics to this interdisciplinary research project. The
participating experts are Professor Derek Bunn, Chairman of Decision Sciences,
London Business School; Professor Murat Koksalan, Department of Industrial
Engineering, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey; and Professors
Pekka Korhonen and Jyrki Wallenius of the Helsinki School of Economics. They
plan to investigate promising theoretical, methodological and applied research
in multiple criteria decision making and decision analysis. Among other topics
in these fields, they will pursue research on human choice behavior, fuzzy
modeling and analysis of Quality Function Deployment, and extensions of robust
interactive decision analysis. This research should provide new insights into
several important issues associated with human decision making and problem
solving. Potential applications include the development of improved decision
making software for business and industrial management.
