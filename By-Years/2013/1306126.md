The National Science Foundation grant to the Rutgers University Intermediate
Energy Nuclear Physics group will enable studies of the structure of the
nucleon. We will study neutrino scattering from nuclei at the Fermilab National
Accelerator Facility (FNAL). We will also investigate quark distributions within
the nucleon with the SEAQUEST experiment at FNAL. We will participate in several
upcoming experiments at Jefferson Lab with the upgraded 12 GeV electron beam.
Finally we are preparing for an experiment to scatter muons and electrons from
the proton (MUSE experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland) in
order to investigate the proton radius, which has puzzled scientists in recent
years because of inconsistent results with different
techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the scientific impact, this work will
serve to train both undergraduate and graduate students, as well as post-
doctoral researchers, in the methods of scientific research. This training in
fundamental research provides a strong basis for careers in and outside of
physics. Our students and post-docs have successfully moved to varied careers in
medical physics, homeland security, and finance, as well as continuing in
fundamental research.
