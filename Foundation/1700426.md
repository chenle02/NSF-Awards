The project will develop new mathematical methods and establish new connections
between diverse areas of mathematics. The project will focus on connections
between Logic, on the one hand, and Topology and Combinatorics, on the other. It
will aim at connecting Fraisse theory, an amalgamation theory from Logic, with
deep questions on homogeneity of the generic continuum and with possible
development of a homology theory. Further, it will aim at establishing
connections between Ramsey theory, a branch of Combinatorics, with Topological
Dynamics, Algebraic Topology, and certain orders playing an important role in
parts of Set Theory.

The project will develop a presentation of Ramsey theory in terms of algebraic
topological notions - simplicial complexes and simplicial maps. This
presentation should incorporate both finite and infinite Ramsey theory, and it
should capture Ramsey theoretic statements associated with amenability of
subgroups of the permutation group of the set of natural numbers. The project
will also uncover implications of the dynamics of monoid actions to Ramsey
theory. The project will also explore an approach to certain problems in
topological dynamics and topology that uses purely combinatorial/model theoretic
methods. Some important compact topological spaces are obtained as canonical
quotients of generic inverse limits of families of finite structures -
projective Fraisse limits. Topological homogeneity questions will be
investigated using such presentations. Another aim will be to develop the right
notion of the simplex and the boundary operation for homology theory of
projective Fraisse limits. The test case here is the development of universal
Menger compacta through projective Fraisse limits. Another goal of the project
is to explore connections between a fixed point property of group actions,
concentration of measure phenomenon, and geometry of submeasures.
