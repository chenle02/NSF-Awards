9416338 Bock This project will investigate the time series of positions from the
Permanent Global Positioning System (GPS) Geodetic Array prior to and after the
Northridge earthquake of January 17, 1994 focussing on the anomalous strain
events detected at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Ranchos Palos Verdes sites
several months before the earthquake. The signals will be analyzed by data
stacking procedures to see if they are real indicators of anomalous strain
variations or artifacts of the initial analysis. If real, these signals may be
preseismic indicators and this will be tested by comparison with other available
data and earthquake models. In addition, improved techniques will be developed
for densification and rapid response of GPS measurements in the San Fernando
Valley and Los Angeles Basin. The results of this study will have major
implications for earthquake hazards mitigation using space geodetic techniques
in blind thrust environments such as the San Fernando Valley and Los Angeles
Basin.
