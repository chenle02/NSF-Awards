This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports research by Professor James K. McCusker at Michigan State University
geared toward understanding the first step, which is important for future
photovoltaic cell design, in the photoconversion process of optically sensitized
materials, i.e. does reactivity require excited-state thermalization, or can
injection proceed from the Franck-Condon state of the sensitizer. The research
involves three phases: I) detailed femtosecond dynamics studies, in solution, of
sensitizer candidates for solar cell development; II) studies of the complexes
examined in Phase I attached to zirconium oxide nanoparticles; and III) studies
of the complexes examined in Phase I attached to titanium oxide nanoparticles as
components of functional regenerative solar cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Success
in this research would contribute greatly toward reducing the cost of a
promising solar cell system. This research also provides interdisciplinary
training in chemistry, physics and solar cell devices for a graduate or
postdoctoral student.&lt;br/&gt;
