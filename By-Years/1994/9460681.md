III-V nitride semiconductor materials technology is important to the United
States in the next generation of power semiconductor and short wavelength
optoelectronics. However, the quality and availability of substrates -- the
basis of any semiconductor technology - has not kept pace with either technical
or commercial requirements. This SBIR Phase I project, explores the growth of
single crystal aluminum nitride (AIN) using modified sublimation techniques. In
Phase II, the design and process parameters for the production of AIN single
crystals are expected to be optimized, and high quality AIN single crystal
substrates will be used for the fabrication of prototype blue LED devices. A
fundamental III-V nitride technology advance is expected by correlating growth
conditions with the occurrence and subsequent elimination of specific defect
structures. In Phase III, the grantee expects to scale the crystal growth
process to enable the manufacture of specific devices and to supply substrates
in order to accelerate the growth of a III-V nitride based semiconductor
industry.
