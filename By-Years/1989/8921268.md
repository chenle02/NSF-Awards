Recently there has been considerable interest and activity in crystallizing
high value (e.g., pharmaceutical) and/or difficult to crystallize compounds from
supercritical fluids (SF). Possible advantages might be extreme size reduction
without thermal degradation or chemical contamination. Rapid depressurization
results in high supersaturation and causes high nucleation rates, making small
crystals. Such processes are termed SF nucleation as there usually is no attempt
to grow the crystals. The primary goal of this proposal, which is a continuation
of earlier funded work, is to explore and exploit a novel isothermal isobaric
method of supersaturation generation (and hence crystallization) in solute-laden
SF, namely "salting- out" with high pressure N2 or other non-dissolving, non-
interacting inert gases. With CO2 as the main SF solvent, it has been shown that
solute precipitation of 0 to ~ 100 percent (benzoic acid as a model system) can
be obtained using different N2/CO2 ratios in the final SF mixture. Actual
crystallization occurs under isobaric isothermal conditions. Pressure would be
reduced ultimately to remove product. SF separation processes involving only CO2
and N2 gases might ultimately prove to be the most cost-effective way of
separation and purification of a thermally labile solute mixture.
