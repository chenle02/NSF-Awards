The chosen research topics for this PYI program will integrate the classical
areas of mechanics and applied mathematics with materials processing concepts.
The approach will be interdisciplinary. Several problems will be
addressed,including the processing of new materials, and optimization of
existing methods. Examples include Czochralski crystal growth and processing of
composite materials. ***//
