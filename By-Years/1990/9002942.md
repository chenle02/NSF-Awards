This research involves the investigation of amorphous hydrogenated silicon-
carbon alloys by a combination of junction capacitance techniques. The intention
is to study the detailed energy map of amorphous hydrogenated silicon-carbon
films deep defect density-of-states (DOS) over a significant portion of the
mobility gap. Photocapacitance spectrocopy will provide an accurate energy map
of deep defects to a depth of 1.1 eV below the mobility edge. A series of high
quality samples will be prepared by Shing of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
employing a Glasstech PECVD system. The research will involve undergraduates in
every aspect of the proposed study. Initial measurements will involve
capacitance-temperature measurements. This work will aid in the development of
optoelectronic devices such as photovoltaic cells.
