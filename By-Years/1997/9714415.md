Abstract Geer ATM-9714415 The American Meteorological Society (AMS), in
cooperation with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),
proposes another offering of an intensive summer workshop for master Precollege
teachers of atmospheric science topics to be held at the National Weather
Service Training Center (NWSTC) in Kansas City, Missouri. The purposes of the
program are to: (a) provide renewal and updating learning experiences that focus
on dramatic advances in observing, analyzing, and forecasting weather, (b)
explore and suggest ways in which the products of these technologies and
techniques can be employed in school studies of the atmospheric environment, and
(c) prepare workshop attendees to conduct training sessions on selected
atmospheric science topics for teachers in their home areas during the next
school year.
