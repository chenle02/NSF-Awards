Several fundamental issues in gravitational physics will be investigated. These
are related to the physics of the very early universe, unification of Einstein's
general relativity and quantum physics, and the final stages of black hole
formation and mergers. Although cosmology has witnessed spectacular progress
over the past decade, fundamental problems remain. Through a judicious
unification of general relativity with quantum physics, over the last five
years, our team has provided a detailed theoretical paradigm as to what "really"
occurred near the big bang. Detailed consequences of this "physics beyond
Einstein", including potentially observable effects, will be analyzed in detail
using a combination of analytical and numerical techniques. Black hole formation
and collisions are violent events where the full non-linearity general
relativity is important. State of the art mathematical tools will be used to
describe how these black holes settle down to their final equilibrium.

This research will continue to have an impact on a number of disciplines in
fundamental science (general relativity, cosmology, and quantum physics), areas
of pure and applied mathematics (functional analysis, geometry and computational
science) and philosophy of science. As in the past, Ph.D. students and post-
doctoral scholars will trained in these broad areas of knowledge. Because the
public is fascinated by the fundamental questions that will be addressed, there
will also be a significant contribution to outreach through public lectures,
articles and reports in semi-popular magazines, electronic media including
scientific videos and YouTube clips and an active collaboration with artists
interested in representations of the cutting edge scientific ideas.
