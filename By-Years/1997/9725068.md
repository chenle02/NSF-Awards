9725068 Christensen This is an award to support research on methods for relating
organic pollutants in the aquatic environment to their sources considering the
effects of fractionation between sources and their receptors. Emphasis in this
project will be on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons principally derived from
incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and on polychlorinated biphenyls that are
derived from many industrial applications in sediments from lakes and streams.
Sources of sediment cores for polychlorinated biphenyls will be the lower Fox
River of Wisconsin and for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, the Black River of
Ohio. Reference cores will be obtained from Lake Michigan and Lake Erie. The
investigator's objectives are to fully develop a source-receptor chemical mass
balance model for the target aquatic contaminants, apply an iterative factor
analysis model to analytical profiles of these contaminants and develop an
optimal factor analytical model incorporating uncertainties for apportionment of
the contaminants to their sources. Results of this project are expected to
provide knowledge that is needed for effective abatement of pollution.
Understanding the transport characteristics and fate of environmental
contaminants are important steps in changing the way pollutants of air, land and
water are controlled. Emergence of nonpoint sources of pollutants from urban and
agricultural land and atmospheric deposition has made knowledge to be gained
from this project potentially useful in addressing engineering approaches to
abatement of pollution by identification of sources as a step toward coping with
emissions by either prevention of their production or treatment at the source.
