This project is devoted to the study of relatively hyperbolic groups and their
applications in low--dimensional topology. It consists of three main parts.
First part deals with small cancellation theory over relatively hyperbolic
groups. Namely we intend to use methods elaborated by the PI to construct new
groups with 'exotic' properties that solve some long--standing problems in the
classical theory of groups. The second part is motivated by the Virtual Haken
Conjecture and is based on a generalization of Thurston's hyperbolic Dehn
surgery theory in the context of relatively hyperbolic groups. The third part
concerns new results about group embeddings. The ultimate goal here is to obtain
a relatively hyperbolic version of the Higman embedding theorem. Our approach to
these problems is based on a new methods related to asymptotic and combinatorial
analysis of van Kampen diagrams.

The notion of a relatively hyperbolic group was first proposed by Gromov in 1987
to generalize many examples of algebraic and geometric nature. Since then the
theory has been elaborated from different points of views and now it is one of
the most prominent parts of the group theory. The class of relatively hyperbolic
groups encompasses many examples of interest such as fundamental groups of
finite volume hyperbolic manifolds, geometrically finite convergence groups,
mapping class groups, fully residually free groups, etc. Rather than just
generalizing the theory of hyperbolic groups to the relative case, this project
is aimed at the study of new and sometimes unexpected phenomena which are
invisible in the context of ordinary hyperbolicity. The close interaction
between the theory of relatively hyperbolic groups and geometry, low-dimensional
topology, the theory of dynamical systems, provides a rich source of problems
and motivations for our project.
