9302265 Kerr This project provides a broad-band Fabry-Perot Spectrometer (FPS)
for use at the Millstone Hill Incoherent Scatter Radar Optical Facility. The FPS
is used for experiments by investigators at remote sites. The instrument is
transportable, and is also available for campaign-based use at other CEDAR
facilities. This proposal requests funding to support a full-time graduate
student to fuse collaborative cooperation between the Boston University optical
complement and the MIT radar and optical complement at Millstone Hill, and for
travel of that student between these sites. ***
