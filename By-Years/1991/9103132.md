This project is a study of the dynamics and spectra of optically driven atoms
in the case that they are exposed to a perturbed electromagnetic mode density.
It involves the design and construction of cavities whose perturbation of the
electromagnetic mode density is particularly strong. Optical trapping techniques
will be employed to eliminate transit-time limitations on the size of optical
cavities or their active regions. Owing to the fundamental changes in driven
atom dynamics that can occur in the presence of a perturbed electromagnetic mode
density, the present studies may lead to the operation of optical devices in
hitherto unaccessible regimes. A secondary objective of this work will be to
investigate the response of free-space atoms to complex, for example
bichromatic, excitation fields.
