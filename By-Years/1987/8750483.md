The Biology Department is unusually fortunate in owning a 300-acre field station
located within 20 miles of the main campus. The field station contains a number
of different terrestrial and aquatic habitats: prairies and forest, ponds and
river. Located at the field station is a laboratory building staffed by a
resident naturalist. The field and laboratory equipment provided through this
award are making this field station self-sufficient and more fully functional.
The new field equipment includes soil and water test kits; the laboratory
equipment includes microscopes, balances, drying ovens, and a microcomputer for
data storage and analysis. Since the station already has adequate dormitory
space, the addition of a fully equipped laboratory allows students to live and
conduct meaningful research on site. The equipped station laboratory is
particularly valuable during the January interim term when students may study a
single topic in depth. With guidance from the resident staff and from the two
Ph.D. ecologists on the Biology faculty, the field station now is able to
introduce substantial numbers of undergraduates to a high degree of
sophistication in studying ecological research methods.
