The aim of the proposed research is to answer several questions regarding
adequately formalizing common sense reasoning. There will be three steps. First,
to evaluate and classify some of the knowledge representation languages, in
particular, to compare various semantics of logic programs and develop benchmark
programs that distinguish them. Second, to consider features that are not
handled by the traditional nonmonotonic formalisms and suggest methods to handle
them. The particular features considered are: defining the consistency of a set
of default and strict rules, and being able to infer new defaults from a set of
default and strict rules. Third, to develop a prototype system to answer queries
with respect to more general knowledge representation language than can be
handled by the systems developed so far, in particular, to follow the lead of
systems based on the well founded semantics of normal logic programs to develop
a prototype system to answer queries with respect to the well founded semantics
of a default theory. The significance of the proposed research is that if
successful it makes both theoretical advances in formalizing common sense
reasoning and provides a prototype implementation of query answering system for
a more general formalism. //
