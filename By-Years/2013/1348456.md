The Early Cretaceous of Mongolia is well known for its fossil dinosaurs and
other vertebrates, but fossil plants from Mongolia are very poorly studied. This
project will examine diverse assemblages of fossil plants from multiple Early
Cretaceous age localities that are yielding new, abundant, and exceptionally
well-preserved seed plant fossils. The goal of the research is to discover,
characterize, document and understand the implications of these newly discovered
fossil plants that date to a critical interval for changes in the flora of the
Earth. The fossil material will be studied primarily using scanning electron
microscopy and high-resolution X-ray microtomography. The excellent preservation
provides a rare opportunity to reconstruct ?whole plants? from multiple co-
occurring fossils of extinct Cretaceous species. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This
study is important in several respects. The overarching objective for the study
is to inform a deeper understanding of seed plant evolution. The research will
add significantly to knowledge about extinct seed plants during the Early
Cretaceous, an interval of major and rapid evolutionary and vegetational change.
The project will strengthen international collaboration among US, Japanese and
Mongolian scientists and students. Student involvement and communicating science
to the public are institutional priorities and will be accomplished through on
hands training for students, feature articles, website presentations, and
exhibition outreach at the Chicago Botanic Garden and the Field Museum.
