The focus of this research involves the use of tert-butanesulfinamide chemistry
for the efficient, stereoselective synthesis of complex amines. The goals of the
project will include using metal-catalyzed additions of boron species to amines;
exploring additions to alpha, beta-unsaturated N-sulfinyl imines; developing
reactions of N-sulfinyl metalloenamines with Michael acceptors with subsequent
transformations upon the Michael addition products; characterizing and studying
applications of N-sulfinyl aldemine self-condensation; using N-sulfinyl amidines
in the synthesis of densely functionalized amines, including the asymmetric
synthesis of natural products and; developing an enhanced understanding of the
dynamic kinetic resolution of sulfinyl halides for the preparation of a broad
range of sulfinate esters, sulfoxides and sulfinamides.

With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is
supporting the research and educational activities of Dr. Jonathan A. Ellman in
the Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley. Professor
Ellman will focus his work on developing methods for preparation of highly
functionalized chiral amines using tert-butanesulfinamide chemistry. The new
methodology will be integrated into the asymmetric synthesis of relevant natural
products. Since over 75% of all drugs and drug candidates contain amine
functionality, this project has important broader impacts for the pharmaceutical
and biotechnology industries. Also, the project will offer excellent training to
both undergraduate and graduate students.
