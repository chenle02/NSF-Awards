A joint analytical and experimental investigation is to be conducted of the
viscous decay, evolution and interaction of vortex couples at large Reynolds
number. Analytically, boundary layer ideas are used to derive their behavior
from known inviscid solutions. The interaction of vortex couples with weak
background vorticity or shear is studied using singular perturbation theory. By
studying mixing in the large Peclet number limit, estimates on the efficiency of
vortex couples in transport are derived. The experiments employ a novel use of
stratification to create two-dimensional flows. Mixing is studied quantitatively
by the optical tracking of tracer particles and dye. Data processing determines
the velocity and vorticity fields as they evolve. Vortex couples, localised
dipolar regions of vorticity, possess nearly closed streamlines, are self-
propagating, and persist for long times. Consequently, they efficiently
transport vorticity, momentum, heat and contaminants. Vortex couples arise in
the shear layers and plumes observed in atmospheric chemistry, ocean mixing,
convective cooling, and turbulent transport and mixing.
