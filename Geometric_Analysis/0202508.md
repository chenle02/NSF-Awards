ABSTRACT DMS - 0202508.

The first proposed project is to understand the topology of complete manifolds
whose Ricci curvature is bounded from below by a negative multiple of the bottom
of the spectrum of the Laplace operator. In this case, the bottom of the
spectrum is assumed to be positive. The second project of the Principal
Investigator is to investigate the size of the space of harmonic functions with
polynomial growth on complete manifolds with non-negative sectional curvature.
In particular, the primary goal is to prove that the dimension of the space of
harmonic functions of polynomial growth with degree at most d is bounded by the
dimension of an analogous space in Euclidean space of the same dimension. The
third project is to understand the geometry of stable minimal hypersurfaces of
Euclidean space. More generally, he would like to study minimal hypersurfaces
with have finite index. The PI also proposes to support a postdoc, Dr. Xiaofeng
Sun, in his research projects. Dr. Sun proposes to study the regularity theory
of harmonic maps into a metric space.

These proposed projects have the unified theme of using analytical techniques
in studying the underlining geometric spaces. In many instances, topological and
geometrical conclusions can be drawn by detail analysis of solutions of some
appropriate partial differential equations defined on the space.
