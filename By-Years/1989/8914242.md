This is a fundamental engineering study to provide the basis for a new technique
to determine incipient failure in hip joint implants. Transducers on the skin
will provide non-invasive and non-destructive ultrasound to the
tissue/bone/implant. A neural net will be involved in the analysis of the sound
wave interaction with these biomaterials in order to characterize the state of
the health of the bone/tissue surrounding the hip implant. This research could
establish new diagnostic techniques and methods for analyzing for healthy or
pathological tissue.
