Proposal No.: 9732215 PI: LaFave University: U of Massachusetts-Amherst ABSTRACT
The proposed project provides stipends and associated support for seven
undergraduate students to be involved in ongoing research projects in the
Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of
Massachusetts/Amherst. The intent is to recruit students who: (1) are
underrepresented in the field (women and minorities), (2) are undergraduates at
other institutions, and (3) may not have the opportunity to conduct research at
their undergraduate institutions. The students will participate in the summer
between their junior and senior years, and the intent is to instill in the
students the desire to pursue a graduate education. The program will include:
(1) a self contained research project for each student that is aligned with a
larger funded project, (2) individual direction by graduate students and faculty
members, (3) regular research project meetings, (4) a final oral presentation
and written report by the undergraduate researchers, (5) weekly meeting/seminars
with other undergraduate researchers, including a series of outside speakers.
Research will be in the areas of Environmental, Geotechnical, Structural, and
Transportation Engineering. Faculty and students will be matched according to
applicability of projects, desires of faculty and students, the needs of
faculty, and the abilities of students.
