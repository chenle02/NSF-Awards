9311319 FERNANDEZ Two of the most prominent explanations given for relatively
low rates of achievement by members of minority groups in U.S. labor markets
have been called the "spatial mismatch" and the "skills mismatch" hypotheses.
Proponents of the spatial mismatch hypothesis argue that many minority workers
experience difficulties in finding and holding jobs because many employers have
relocated from central-city locales near the homes of most minority workers to
more remote suburban locations. Advocates of the skills mismatch hypothesis
maintain that technological changes in the economy as a whole have changed the
character of employment, leaving many workers, especially members of more poorly
educated minority groups, without requisite skills to assume new jobs. This
project examines both of these hypotheses through continuation of a case study
of a plant that retooled (creating new forms of jobs) when it relocated from
central Milwaukee to a suburban site in 1992. Lengthy interviews will be
conducted with many employees who were surveyed in 1991, creating a longitudinal
database that will help determine the degree to which locational and employment-
skill changes impeded the adjustment of minority workers to the new plant.
Special attention will focus on analyses of decisions by workers to relocate
their homes closer to the new plant (as opposed to commuting over longer
distances) as a response to geographical changes and to examination of the
processes by which workers were assigned to jobs in the new plant. This research
will provide valuable new insights into two important dimensions of change in
modern metropolitan economies. In addition to generating a detailed longitudinal
database about this specific case, the research will provide simultaneous tests
of two controversial hypotheses using methods that can be replicated in other
contexts. ***
