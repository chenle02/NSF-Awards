This award provides additional support for research on continuous measurements
of crustal deformation in southern California. Previous work has emphasized
analysis of measurements made with instruments at Pinon Flat Observatory (PFO),
along with the development of the anchoring techniques needed for high-quality
measurements. The PIs will continue to study PFO data from events such as the
November 1987 Superstition Hills earthquake, for which the PFO strainmeters
showed no short- term preseismic deformation (at &lt;1% of the coseismic slip),
but do show about 15% short-term postseismic slip.
