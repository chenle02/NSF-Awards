Abstract - Pfefferle This is a study of hydrocarbon growth mechanisms that lead
to the formation of soot and soot precursors under diffusion flame conditions;
such conditions are relevant to most practical combustion conditions. The
objective is to determine the effects of combustion conditions and fuel
structure on the formation pathways of aromatic ring compounds and soot. Both
single-fuel flames and methane diffusion flames doped with low concentrations of
various hydrocarbons are studied. Soot volume fraction to 0.1 ppm, morphology
and composition of soot, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), and stable
intermediate species present at levels above 1 ppm and measured. Particular
reaction pathways important in the diffusion flames are studies also in a
molecular-beam-sampled well-mixed reactor to obtain detailed reaction
parameters. This methodology allows fast, quantitative species sampling in
diffusion flames with significant soot loadings. Reaction products are detected
using vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photoionization. The soot measurement technique
allows detection of sub-ppm soot volume fractions and includes measurement of
the translucent particles that may be the direct precursors of mature soot. With
this technique, precursor particles can be discriminated from mature soot, their
composition analyzed, and the process of graphitization followed. Soot and PAH
associated with incomplete combustion are recognized as major health hazards.
Detailed studies of the formation and character of these materials can identify
which systems pose the greater threats and also suggest control strategies.
