This research supported by this award focuses on optimization problems which
combine uncertainty with intertemporal objectives. These issues are central to
Asset Pricing applications, such as dynamic portfolio choice and derivatives
pricing with several assets and state variables, for preference structures which
include expected utility, recursive utility, and multiple priors. In their
mathematical formulation, these models lead to complex control problems,
involving multidimensional diffusions and stochastic differential equations of
forward and backward type. A satisfactory analysis of these models requires
explicit solutions, either exact or asymptotic, which disentangle the impact of
price dynamics from those of the different aspects of preferences. The reserach
will (i) develop a theory for long-run asymptotics, combining martingale
methods, duality theory, Markov processes, and stochastic control; (ii)
investigate the expansion of exact solutions around their long-run asymptotics,
exploiting ideas of spectral theory; (iii) explore the connections to turnpike
theorems, risk-sensitive control, and large deviations; and (iv) develop
solutions to models of interest.

This problem-driven research will seek new insights for Asset Pricing
applications, which in turn suggest new directions for advancing mathematical
theories. The involvement of graduate students in this effort will enhance their
cross-training in Mathematical Finance and Applied Probability, and will bridge
the traditional language gaps with related fields. This research has a twofold
external relevance: first, a thorough understanding of portfolio choice is
fundamental to devise efficient pension schemes, and to evaluate their welfare
properties. Second, the equilibrium implications of long run investments are key
to understanding the link between macroeconomic variables and asset price
dynamics, and the interplay between risk aversion, ambiguity aversion and
intertemporal substitution.
