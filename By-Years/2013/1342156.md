This project focuses on the development of a complier that automatically
performs correct and efficient memory management. The compiler automatically
manages the data of the application on a multi-core architecture that does not
provide any memory management in hardware. Such architectures are scalable
(i.e., processors with hundreds and thousands of cores can be designed), and are
more power-efficient.&lt;br/&gt;This compiler does this through application
analysis. It analyzes each kind of code/data (i.e., code, stack data, heap data
and global variables) and inserts data management instructions in the
application, so that the application can execute correctly and efficiently on
many-core processors that will not have any support for memory management in
hardware. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This compiler may be needed by system
development companies that are developing relatively high-performance computing
systems, for example, 3D scanner, high capacity 3D printers, TVs, audio video
processing in cars etc. All these companies may want to use the processor with
best performance and lowest power. However, top of the line processors will soon
not have support for memory management in hardware, and the existing
applications will not compile them. This compiler may have the ability to enable
them to utilize the power and performance of the latest many-core processor for
their systems. To the end user, they receive a power-efficient product with
higher performance. Hand-held devices thus developed, while providing improved
performance, will be lighter and will require fewer recharges.
