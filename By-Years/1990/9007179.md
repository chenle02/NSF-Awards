With this grant from the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Professor Goodman will continue his benchmark work on
elucidating the detailed motions of the atoms in the benzene molecule, when this
molecule is subjected to ultraviolet light. The thrust of this research is to
generate accurate potential surfaces for the fundamental region of the ground
and lowest excited singlet states of benzene. These benzene experimental force
fields will provide badly needed benchmarks for calibrating theoretical harmonic
and anharmonic potential surface models for both closed shell ground and open
shell excited states. Two-laser experiments on isotopically labelled benzene,
combined with conventional jet experiments, should allow a complete harmonic
force field to be constructed for the benzene excited state.
