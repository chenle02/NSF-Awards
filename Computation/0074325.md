Tin-Lead (Sn-Pb) solders are widely used as soldering materials in
semiconductor devices. The as-solidified structure can naturally change over
time; however, the evolution can also be driven by thermal or mechanical loads.
Changes in microstructure, in particular, locally coarsened regions, have been
observed as precursors to the formation of cracks, and ultimately of failure.
Time-dependent, microstructural changes, coupled to mechanical straining and
damage evolution, must be considered for realistic mathematical models and
numerical simulations. The investigator and her colleague study, through
mathematical modeling and numerical simulation, the fundamentals of
microstructure evolution and its influence on material failure in Sn-Pb solder
joints. In the process, they develop the mathematical model and numerical
capability more generally to treat the many coupled processes that influence the
overall strength and integrity of a binary alloy. Microelectronic components are
generally attached to printed circuit boards using solder. The solder joint can
serve as the mechanical as well as the electrical connection. It has been
estimated that on the order of 10,000,000,000,000 solder joints are produced
each year. Damage to solder joints is a primary failure mechanism in electronic
components. Even on the shelf, daily or yearly temperature cycles, physical
handling, occasional bumps, chemical reactions or radiation can cause damage.
Under operating conditions, thermal fluctuations or mechanical vibration can be
even more severe. For expensive devices, in critical applications, improved
joint integrity can have enormously beneficial consequences, both economically
and in terms of reliability of components. The modeling undertaken here can play
a crucial role in providing guidance for maintenance of critical components
because it is practically impossible to examine microscopically individual, in-
service joints for potential failure. The theoretical framework developed here
will also be readily applicable to analyzing self-assembling behavior and
degradation in some nano-scale materials and devices.
