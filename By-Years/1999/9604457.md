9604457 Singh These studies are aimed at understanding the molecular mechanisms
underlying the function and regulation of potassium currents, which are
important for many cellular functions. Larval muscles of Drosophila have two
voltage activated and two calcium activated potassium currents. Two of these
channels have been investigated with mutations that selectively disrupt them.
This investigator has identified 6 mutations in the other channels: the Z66
mutant which disrupts IK, and P40 which affects IA. This project will clone and
sequence these genes. This information will indicate the nature of the gene
products and whether they are structural subunits of the channels or regulators
of them. Electrophysiological studies will also be done with the P40 mutant to
confirm the mapping of this gene, and provide information on the functioning of
IA channels. These studies will provide important information to aid our
understanding of these potassium channels. %%% K+ channels play a key role in a
wide variety of cellular processes. With an excellent repertoire of available
genetic tools, Drosophila is useful in the study of many biological phenomena
including ion channel function. The result of this research will aid in the
understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the function and
regulation of potassium channels. ***
