The acquisition of a radiation counting system will be utilized to further
research in several areas including: steroid metabolism and its effects upon
reproduction; the role of biogenic monoamines in metamorphosis regulation of
glucose metabolism in premuscle of fasted and fed animals; regulation of the
quiescent, resting states during the life cycles of invertebrates; and metabolic
pathways involved in C3-C4 intermediate photosynthesis.
