A comprehensive internal program review and the resulting curriculum review
suggested that undergraduate majors in this Department needed more practical
exposure to light microscopy and its attendant techniques. Through this project,
the Department is purchasing sixteen student phase-constrast microscopes and
three fluorescence microscopes for use primarily in the Cell Biology,
Microbiology, Immunology and Invertebrate Biology laboratories. A TV camera,
video recorder and TV monitor also are being used with one of the phase-contrast
microscopes to enhance the study of living cells in introductory courses for
majors and non-majors. The use of living cells in portions of these courses, the
new phase- contrast capability, and the means for showing preparations to the
whole class, are adding significantly to the interest of students in these
courses.
