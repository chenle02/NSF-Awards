This award will support the Workshop/Conference on Geometric Rigidity to be
held May 15-20, 1989 at the University of Colorado, Boulder under the direction
of Professors Steven Hurder and Arlan Ramsay. The conference will bring together
researchers in the subfields of rigidity theory for geometric structures where
the use of geometric techniques is emphasized and will focus on new areas of
this subject. Rigidity theory has a long history and is one of the main themes
in Riemannian geometry.
