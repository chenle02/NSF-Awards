In recent years there has been a great expansion of knowledge of the large scale
structure of the universe. The acquisition of large sets of high quality
astronomical data, coupled with the availability of increasingly powerful
supercomputers, has transformed the subject of the origin and evolution of
structure in the universe profoundly. Models for the growth of structure
incorporating Particle Physics candidates for the dark matter in the universe
can now be confronted with detailed observational data. To study the critical
non-linear evolutionary epochs in the universe requires three-dimensional many
particle simulations with large dynamic range. The PI has developed a
hierarchical N-body code with much improved dynamic range in both length and
mass, and which is also much faster than previously available codes. This will
be used to investigate the evolution of structure in an expanding universe
containing cold dark matter.
