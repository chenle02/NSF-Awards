A debate has raged for decades over the extent to which labor market outcomes--
labor force participation, unemployment, and personal earnings--are constrained
by the particular composition of industrial structures and labor market
institutions in individual cities and regions. Most economists agree that short-
term unemployment rates vary from one region to another depending on how the
business cycle affects short-term industry demand and therefore industry
employment levels. There is widespread disagreement, however, as to whether
persistent differentials in labor force participation rates, group unemployment
rates, and group wage rates strictly reflect differences in human capital or
whether they are mediated by the industrial environment of various regions. This
project will test hypotheses concerning the origins of the "underclass" in urban
areas, and it will assess the extent to which the differential decline in
manufacturing industries across metropolitan areas has contributed to the growth
of the "underclass." The project also will examine the extent to which public
policy should focus on "demand side" (economic development) versus "supply side"
(human capital) interventions. The investigators will conduct an empirical
investigation of changing labor market opportunities facing out-of-school youth.
Using both descriptive statistics and multiple regression analysis, they will
integrate Current Population Survey data and SMSA-specific data to produce a
data base for comparing a cohort of young workers in the mid-1960s with one in
the mid-1980s. This project addresses an issue of national importance, and it
will also contribute to the resolution of demand- vs. supply-side theoretical
issues. It will fill in some important gaps in our understanding of what has
been happening in the labor market during the past 25 years. The analysis will
contribute to the solution of societal problems related to the unemployment and
underemployment of less-educated urban residents, and it will serve as a guide
to developing policies to meet human capital and employment needs.
