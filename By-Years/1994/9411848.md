9411848 Ranker Graduate student Chrissen Gemmill, under the supervision of
faculty adviser Thomas Ranker at the University of Colorado, is studying the
taxonomy, phylogeny, and population genetics of Hawaiian species of the palm
genus Pritchardia. There are an estimated 25 species in the genus, 19 in Hawaii
and the rest in the South Pacific. Eight or so species occur in isolated, small
populations and may prove to be genetically depauperate and endangered.
Morphological and molecular studies are being conducted, the latter including
electrophoresis of proteins to assess levels of genetic variability and
sequencing of nuclear DNA regions (ITS regions) to measure mutational
differences among species. Combined morphological and molecular evidence will
improve taxonomic discrimination of the Hawaiian species and provide characters
for reliable identification and for inferring a hypothesis of evolutionary
history. Because conservation and management decisions must be based on reliable
taxonomic treatments, an improved classification of Pritchardia palms, based on
combined morphological and molecular data, will answer the needs for accurate
identification and measurement of genetic variability in wild populations.
