Funds are requested for acquisition of a storage phosphor imaging device. The
research areas of the primary users are: analysis of recombination and
chromosome organization, developmental regulation of gene expression, control of
mRNA stability, transcriptional regulation, and the molecular basis of
photosynthesis. Secondary users are working on regulation of gene expression in
prokaryotic viruses, developmental regulation of antibiotic production, mapping
mammalian genes, and the control elements of eukaryotic genes. The biological
systems used cover a wide range; Drosophila, mammals, cyanobacteria, eubacteria
and higher plants.
