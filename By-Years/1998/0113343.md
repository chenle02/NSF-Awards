This proposal requests support for the development of grid telemetry acquisition
techniques for grid-enabled applications and instrumental middleware and fabric
level devices. Such telemetry data can be used for monitoring a wide area
distributed IT infrastructure, for providing information to resource decision
making services operating in the grid environment, and importantly for providing
feedback to distributed application developers and middleware toolkit designers.
The grid telemetry infrastructure will be developed within the context of the
distributed IT infrastructure being deployed for the ATLAS experiment currently
under construction for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN Laboratory in
Geneva Switzerland, the GriPhyN project, and the Particle Physics Data Grid. The
NSF/ITR GriPhyN project is developing the basic technologies required to realize
a "virtual" data grid in which researchers from four experiments in particle and
astrophysics will gain efficient and transparent access to distributed data and
computational resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
