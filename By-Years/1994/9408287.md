9408287 Mabee The central goal of the proposed research is to understand the
development of the cranial skeleton in fishes. Toward this goal, the PI will
acquire data using experimental developmental techniques and synthesize these
data using the methods of phylogenetic systematics. The PI will use modern
lineage tracing methods, with digital imaging techniques and video microscopy to
assess the relative embryological contribution of placode and neural crest to
dermal cranial bones. This is significant because no hypotheses on the history
of skeletal development in vertebrates can be made without information on
fishes, and so far no experimental data on fishes are available. This study will
provide these data.
