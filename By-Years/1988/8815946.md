Several fundamental problems in the theory of elementary particles will be
considered. These include the unification of fundamental forces and the types of
matter, the replication of generations, the hierarchy of quark and lepton masses
and mixings, the dynamics of possible preonic constituents of quarks, leptons
and other particles of the standard model, the role of local supersymmetry in
shaping such dynamics, quantum field theory methods of calculation of dynamical
symmetry breaking, the theory of strings and superstrings, and possible small
violations of Fermi and Bose statistics and TCP in the context of preonic local
relativistic quantum field theory. Other studies will include models of CP
violation, predictions of the electric dipole moment of the neutron,
consequences of a preonic identification of four dimensional fields for
superstring theories, the impact of elementary particle physics on the cosmology
of the early universe, and ideas of compositeness.
