This award supports a research and education project at the University of
Massachusetts (Amherst) under the direction of Julian Tyson. He will investigate
procedures to determine the arsenic content in soils and water with the goal of
devising one that middle and high school students can use to investigate arsenic
leaching from pressure treated wood into the environment. The first phase of the
project will involve research towards developing a low cost field test using
spectrophotometric detection techniques. This will result in an analysis
procedure and apparatus suitable for use by K-12 students. In the second phase,
the test procedure will be field tested in middle and high school classrooms in
Springfield MA. It will also be incorporated into the UMass undergraduate
analytical chemistry laboratory classes. The research team aims to create
curricular materials for use both at the middle school-high school level and the
undergraduate level.
