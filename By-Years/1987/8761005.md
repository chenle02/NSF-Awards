Thin films of organic nonlinear optical materials are deposited by vapor
deposition from sublimation sources in vacuum. Chemical bonding and
polymerization of these materials is studied during deposition to try to improve
the physical properties of these materials relative to those of the molecular
crystals. Excitation of the growing film by chemical adsorption and ion or
photon excitation is used. The nonlinear organic materials that are studied are
urea, POM and MAP. Amino acids are additionally studied.
