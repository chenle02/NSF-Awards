The daily radio series EARTH AND SKY began airing nationally on September 30,
1991. It consists of 2-minute programs about Earth science and astronomy.
Produced in association with the American Geophysical Union, it is designed for
people of all ages. Its aim is to make science accessible and interesting to
millions whose common bond is that they happen to be listening to the radio. On
February 1, 1992, the series was airing on 63 commercial and public radio
stations, which had paid for it, and the number of stations was growing.
Producers and hosts Deborah Byrd and Joel Block were responsible for 5,000 daily
programs in the award- winning STAR DATE radio series. Partial support is
requested for the production, distribution and promotion of 780 programs in the
EARTH AND SKY series. The goal for the grant period is to acquire a large
listening audience via heavy promotion. After three years, EARTH AND SKY will be
self-supporting on 371 stations, more stations than for any previous series of
this king.
