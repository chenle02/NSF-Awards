The goals of this project are to provide definitive answers to a range of
structural and mechanistic questions in enzymology. By using multiple
experimental approaches, Dr. Villafranca hopes to reach a deeper level of
understanding of enzyme catalysis, especially in the relationship of structure
to function. Dr. Villafranca will focus on the study of enzymes that involve
different types of group transfer reactions with ATP. Primarily, the enzyme CTP
synthetase will be studied with some additional work on GMP synthetase and
pyruvate phosphate dikinase. By using several structural and kinetic approaches
he will investigate the nature and relative free energies of the central enzyme
complexes for the reactions catalyzed by these enzymes. Exploration of the
identity of enzymic groups and the rate of formation and breakdown of
intermediates in this enzymatic reaction will provide a set of data with which
to make mechanistic deductions about the catalytic efficiency of group transfer
reactions.
