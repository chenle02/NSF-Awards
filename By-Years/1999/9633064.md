9633064 Ramaley This award provides support for a small workshop to consider the
implications for NSF of changes underway in institutions of higher learning of
all types, especially as they have implications for research and education in
the biological sciences. These changes reflect changes in the relationship of
the government and academic institutions and, in turn, changes in the
perceptions of the institutions and their faculty as they view of their own
roles in society. Although such change is normal and healthy, increasingly the
impetus for change comes from lack of growth in support for faculty research by
Federal agencies, increased emphasis on teaching by the largest institutions,
and changing patterns of employment among graduates. The effects of these
changes on institutional policy and practice, and their implications for Federal
agencies that fund research ald education in the biological sciences will be
explored. ***
