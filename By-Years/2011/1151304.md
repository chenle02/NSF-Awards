The Chemical Synthesis Program supports the research of Prof. Frank E. McDonald
at Emory University, in a project exploring the stereo- and regioselective exo-
mode cyclizations of acyclic polyene precursors bearing allylic oxygen
substituents as stereoinduction elements. This project is the basis for a novel
cascade polycyclization approach to brevenal, a non-toxic inhibitor of
brevetoxin binding. Major objectives for the granting period include uncovering
the diastereoselectivities of metal-catalyzed cycloisomerization and halonium-
ion mediated cyclization processes, and demonstrating the feasibility and
generality of bicyclization and multiple ring-forming polycyclization processes.
In addressing the broader impact of meaningful inclusion of less-experienced
researchers such as undergraduate researchers and K-12 science teachers, the
McDonald laboratory also develops new synthetic routes for the acyclic
precursors required for cascade cyclization processes, based on efficient and
scalable preparations of multiply-functionalized building blocks of general
interest to the synthetic community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses
on discovering new strategies for the chemical synthesis of structurally complex
compounds of marine origin. A critical barrier to progress in this field has
been the dozens of steps required for preparing compounds of potential medicinal
and commercial importance. The McDonald laboratory is addressing this challenge
by developing a novel synthetic strategy, to form structurally complex compounds
in a single operation, from relatively simple and easily prepared linear
precursors. The potential impact of this research includes the efficient
preparation of relatively complex compounds such as brevenal, which is a non-
toxic inhibitor of airborne toxins naturally produced by red tide events in
tropical and subtropical marine regions, including the Gulf of Mexico. Broader
impacts of this research feature inclusion of undergraduate students and K-12
science teachers through several summer research programs at Emory.
