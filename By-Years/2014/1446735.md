As self-driving cars are introduced into road networks, the overall safety and
efficiency of the resulting traffic system must be established and guaranteed.
Numerous critical software-related recalls of existing automotive systems
indicate that current design practices are not yet up to this challenge. This
project seeks to address this problem, by developing methods to analyze and
coordinate networks of fully and partially self-driving vehicles that interact
with conventional human-driven vehicles on roads. The outcomes of the research
are expected to also contribute to the safety of other cyber-physical systems
with scalable configurable hierarchical structures, by developing a mathematical
framework and corresponding software tools that analyze the safety and
reliability of a class of systems that combine physical, mechanical and
biological components with purely computational ones.

The project research spans four technical areas: autonomous and human-controlled
collaborative driving; scheduling computations over heterogeneous distributed
computing systems; security and trust in V2X (Vehicle-to-Vehicle and Vehicle-to-
Infrastructure) networks; and Verification & Validation of V2X systems through
semi-virtual environments and scenarios. The integrating aspect of this research
is the development of a distributed system calculus for Cyber-Physical Systems
(CPS) that enables modeling, simulation and analysis of collaborative vehicular
systems. The development of a comprehensive framework to model, analyze and test
reconfiguration, hierarchical control, security and trust differentiates this
research from previous attempts to address the same problem. Educational and
outreach activities include integration of project research in undergraduate and
graduate courses, and a summer camp at Ohio State University for high-school
students through the Women in Engineering program.
