This research is concerned with developing methodologies for solving practical
issues of reconfigurable control systems. The original motivation comes from the
need for analytical redundant management of control elements (e.g.actuators) in
the event of hardware failures in high reliability systems. One such example is
modern combat aircraft subjected to actuator/surface impairments. A major task
is to achieve reconfigurable control designs balancing impairment detectability
and sufficient robustness. This involves careful selection of types and
parameters of the controllers and the impairment detecting filters used.
Algorithms are proposed to make such selection systematic. A further
investigation is focused on enhancing the speed and accuracy of the failure
detection and isolation FDI unit. It is suggested that a more deterministic
approach be taken to better utilize all available information. A rule based
strategy for FDI is described. Developments made through the proposed research
are expected to result in significant improvement in terms of the overall
system's reliability and maintainability.
