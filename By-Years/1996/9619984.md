9619984 Covert This project focuqes on the hygroscopic properties of marine
aerosol particles in order to understand and to determine the physical, optical
and cloud nucleating properties of marine boundary layer aerosol particles. The
hygroscopic properties of aerosol are related to atmospheric relative humidity
f(RH) . These properties are key factors that influence the spatial and temporal
variability of the aerosol physical and optical properties during transport. The
project is part of the North Atlantic Regional Aerosol Characterization
Experiment (ACE-2) which will be conducted in June and July, 1997, over the
subtropical Northeastern Atlantic Ocean as an international collaborative
effort. The main objectives of ACE-2 are to study the properties of atmospheric
aerosols that are relevant to radiative forcing and climate change using
aircraft, ship-board, and ground-based measurements. The measurements will
involve use of a tandem differential mobility analyzer (RH-TDMA) that is capable
of measuring the hygroscopic growth properties of marine boundary layer aerosol
particles. The PI will compare the hygroscopic behavior of ambient particles
with those of synthetic aerosol prepared in the laboratory and having chemical
compositions of artificial seawater, aerosol derived from sea water solutions,
internal mixtures of acid sulfate and seasalt and internal mixtures of acid
sulfate, nitrate and organic acids. The laboratory studies will be used to
interpret the growth of marine boundary layer aerosols and anthropogenic
aerosols measured during the large-scale ACE-2 field experiment. The project
will develop information needed to evaluate with what certainty light scattering
and numbers of cloud condensation nuclei can be predicted from measurements of
particle size distributions and hygroscopicity in the marine boundary layer.
Improving the linkage between aerosol physical and optical properties is a
necessary step for quantifying the direct and indirect radiative effects of a
erosol particles within the atmosphere. ATM-9619984
