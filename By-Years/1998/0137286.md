The study will focus on an important problem concerning the oceanic crustal
structure, i.e., the extent to which seismic boundaries within the crust
correlate with geological boundaries. It aims to link the seismic structure of
upper oceanic crust with the known geology of the crust exposed at Hess Deep and
the Blanco Transform areas. The PIs hope that the experiment will clarify the
relationship between the seismic boundaries and the geologic units of oceanic
crust. Two separate cruises will be undertaken to conduct refraction profiling
with wide-angle MCS lines allowing high-resolution imgaging of the uppermost
crust.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
