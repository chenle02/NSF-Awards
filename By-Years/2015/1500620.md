Scottish Gaelic, a Celtic language closely related to Irish and Welsh and more
distantly to English, was once spoken across Scotland by most of the country's
population. Today, however, Gaelic remains a community language only in the most
remote regions of western Scotland. Gaelic speakers comprise about 1% of the
Scottish population; the 2011 census found only 57,375 native speakers, compared
to 250,000 a century earlier. This sharp decline makes the language's continued
survival uncertain.

Scottish Gaelic is of immense interest because it possesses many rare linguistic
features, including initial consonant mutation where a word-initial consonant
can be changed depending on the function of that word in a clause. Scottish
Gaelic also exhibits pre-aspirated consonants, and verb-initial sentence
structure. In addition, the language offers remarkable examples of how knowledge
systems particular to local geography and climate (land management, fishing
techniques) are imbedded in the language. Should Scottish Gaelic become extinct,
the global community -- not just Scotland -- will lose an irreplaceable cultural
and scientific resource.

Through this two-year project, Professors Ian Clayton from the University of
Nevada, Reno along with Andrew Carnie and Mike Hammond from the University of
Arizona will create a corpus of linguistic interviews with 30 native Gaelic
speakers. They will be assisted by native speaker Muriel Fisher, the recipient
of the Linguistic Society of America's 2015 Excellence in Community Linguistics
Award. The collection will contain more than twenty hours of high-quality audio-
visual material, transcribed and translated and will include speech samples from
speakers over range of ages, geographic origins, and professional backgrounds.

The collection will offer an invaluable tool to help linguists expand their
scientific study of this language's rare features. In addition, the interviews
will focus on traditional occupations, folklore, and oral history-- the kinds of
knowledge and terminology most at risk as Gaelic declines.

When complete, the corpus will be publically available through the Max Planck
Institute's Language Archive, and the University of Arizona's Open Repository.
