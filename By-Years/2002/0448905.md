This research will advance our understanding of how the dynamic properties of
proteins play a critical role in the enzymes involved with the integration of
protein, carbohydrate, and fat metabolism. The project will investigate the
linkage between dynamic protein structure and both catalysis and the regulation
of activity in three enzymes that play central roles in metabolism: glutamate
dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, and 3 phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase.
Communication between subunits affecting catalysis and substrate binding
regulate each of these enzymes. The roles of individual side chains in catalysis
or in communication between subunits will be probed using site-specific
mutations. The effects of mutations will be studied by functional assays,
structural analysis using X ray crystallography and mass spectrometry, and
computational approaches. The hypothesis that both catalytic activity and
biological regulation involve changes in the dynamic properties of the protein
will be directly tested by engineering flexibility changes in various regions of
the protein and correlating the effects with alterations in both activity and
subunit communication. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The research is
integrated fully into the education of undergraduates. Students will work on
individual research projects, take laboratory courses with the research embedded
into the course, or may take a research-based course for non-science majors.
Students are integrally involved in the design of experiments, conduct of the
research, and data analysis and presentation. Students become involved in their
first year and often follow the research for 2-3 years. The research brings both
a quantitative and physical understanding of biological processes to the
participating students. They also participate in outreach to area elementary
schools to bring the excitement of science to local children and their teachers.
Students engaged in the project are drawn from the University of Richmond and
Virginia State University.
