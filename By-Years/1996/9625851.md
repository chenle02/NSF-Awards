9625851 Donahue With this award, we will carry out a comprehensive research
program to develop x-ray microbeam diffraction and direct imaging techniques
based on Bragg-Fresnel optics. The two main objectives of our development effort
are: 1.) to develop high quality Bragg-Fresnel optics by employing the state of
the art nanofabrication technologies and thorough theoretical investigation of
the optical properties of Bragg- Fresnel lenses (BFL) by computer simulation,
with an ultimate goal of producing BFLs with - 50 nm resolution; and 2.) to
develop experimental methods for effectively utilizing BFLs in a broad array of
x-ray analytical methods widely used in advanced materials and biological
research, including x-ray diffraction (e.g., small and macro-molecular
crystallography), small angle scattering, nanometer resolution hard x-ray
imaging (tomography and microscopy), and nanostructure characterization of
electronic materials. By the first year, we will fabricate linear and circular
BFLs; during the second year we will design and begin construction of a BFL
based x-ray transmission microscope. In the third year we will develop a BFL-
based microfluoresence microscope for elemental characterization. %%% We are in
a strong position to undertake the development of Bragg-Fresnel optics at the
University of California, Santa Barbara. We have access to the unique
combination of resources essential to a BFO development program: state of the
art x-ray facilities (including access to synchrotron beamlines) for
characterizing BFLs and submicron to nanometer microelectronics fabrication
facilities (particularly Electron Beam Lithography and reactive ion etching
capabilities) for producing the BFLs. These resources are available to us on
campus through two NSF supported research centers: the Materials Research
Laboratory (MRL) x-ray facility and the Nanotech, the UCSB branch of the
National Nanofabrication Users Network (NNUN). ***
