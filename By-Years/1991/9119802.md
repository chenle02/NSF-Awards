With the aim of understanding the process and mechanisms of molecular
evolution, two related research projects are proposed. The first project is for
studying the rates of nucleotide substitution among the four nucleotide A, T, C,
and G for several different sets of genes and for developing mathematical models
of nucleotide substitution that are more realistic than the ones currently
available. The actual substitution rates will be estimated by the maximum
parsimony method for closely related DNA sequences after the accuracy of the
method is studied by computer simulation. The second project is concerned with
the evolution of immune system genes in vertebrates and antigenic and
nonantigenic genes in the influenza A virus. Since the DNA sequences for the
genes for the major histocompatibility complex, immunoglobulins, and T-cell
receptors (three major gene families of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily) are
now available for many vertebrate species, including sharks and teleosts, the PI
plans to study the origin and evolution of these gene families. We also plan to
study the evolutionary history of various strains of the influenza A virus and
the evolution of its pathogenicity.
