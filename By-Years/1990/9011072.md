This work aims to continue a variety of studies all related to magnetism,
superconductivity, and electron spin resonance. Proposed research topics include
critical exponents for quasi-two dimensional systems and ordered state resonance
for layered magnetic materials; stacked linear oligomers; bound magnon
contributions to the thermodynamics of S=1/2 Heisenberg-Ising Ferromagnets;
superconductivity; and proton glasses.
