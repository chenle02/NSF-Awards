Theoretical research will be done on surface processes for systems out of
equilibrium, such as surface reaction with fresh feed (catalysis), irreversible
adsorption on surfaces, and irreversible growth processes. The goal of the
research is to develop a fundamental understanding of the nature of these
irreversible systems, to elucidate the relation of the steady-state behavior
with equilibrium states, and to explore the unusual kinetic phase transitions
that these systems display. This understanding will lead to improved modeling
and design of actual catalytic systems. %%% This research involves a studies of
a number of irreversible systems. Included are models to help understand
catalytic reactions of importance to the automotive and chemical industries and
to help understand growth phenomena which occur as thin films, for instance, are
deposited during molecular beam epitaxy.
