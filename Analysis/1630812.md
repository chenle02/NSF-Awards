On September 23-24, 2016, the Department of Mathematics of Miami University at
Oxford, Ohio, will hold its Forty-fourth Annual Mathematics Conference on the
topic of Differential Equations and Dynamical Systems and their applications. An
important feature of this conference is that in conjunction with it, on Friday,
September 23, 2016, there will be a meeting devoted to research presentations by
graduate and undergraduate students, celebrating the Ohio Delta Chapter of Pi Mu
Epsilon (national mathematics student honor society). A new goal of this
conference series is to introduce students to research in Applied Mathematics.
The solicitation for contributed talks and the detailed information about the
venue and the program will be posted at http://www.miamioh.edu/cas/academics/dep
artments/mathematics/about/events/annual-mathematics-conference.

The conference will expose attendees to a broad range of topics through invited
plenary talks on Climate Modeling, Game Theory, Fluid Dynamics and Applications
of Control Theory to Aerial Robotics. A series of parallel contributed talks
will provide the participants with the opportunity to present their results. The
main goals of the conference are to expose students to cutting-edge research in
the area of Differential Equations and Dynamical Systems, foster collaborations
between researchers in Tri-state area (Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana), and encourage
involvement of underrepresented minorities in mathematical research on this
topic.
