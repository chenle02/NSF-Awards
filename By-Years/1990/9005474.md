This project will develop petrogenetic constraints for the origin and evolution
of basalts from the Albertine rift. It will involve field relations, major and
trace elements and phenocryst compositions in collab with radiometric (K-Ar) age
dates, Sr and He isotope data, and gravity and seismic studies. The goal is to
determine thermal and geochemical characteristics of the mantle beneath this
part of central Africa. What is the petrogenesis of alkalic (ultra-Potassic)
basalts?
