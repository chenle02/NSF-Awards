The department of chemistry was without an adequately functioning U. V.-visible
spectrophotometer and so basic but fundamentally important laboratory
experiments could not be performed. The acquisition of a spectrophotometer with
a computer work station increased the teaching effectiveness of the department's
inorganic and biochemistry laboratory courses and at the same time, modernized
the labs. The instrument is used to teach the relationship between U. V.-visible
spectra and chemical processes. The computer is used in the acquisition and
storage of data, and in fitting the data to various models. The instrument is
extensively used in the biochemistry course where it is a powerful tool in the
study of macromolecule. In fact, the instrument allowed development of a two
semester biochemistry laboratory that emphasizes isolation and characterization
of proteins and nucleic acids. The spectrophotometer also is used in
undergraduate research projects. Student research is an important part of the
chemistry curriculum at the institution and several research problems are being
undertaken which could not be carried out previously. The institution is
contributing to the project in an amount equal to the NSF funds.
