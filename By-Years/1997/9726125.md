9726125 Hirth Understanding the deformation history and deformation mechanisms
of rocks is a major goal of structural geology and tectonics. Some studies have
focused on experimentally determined conditions under which rocks deform, and
others have made observations in naturally deformed rocks. This collaborative
proposal is unique without it brings together scientists who have worked in the
laboratory with those who have strong reputations for their work in the field.
This collaboration will so far to solve the problem of extrapolating from high
strain rates of experiments to the slower strain-rates of natural samples. The
results of this study will bear directly on understanding the natural conditions
of deformation, especially those of dislocation creep, in quartz and in olivine.
Because these minerals are major components of the crust and upper mantle,
respectively, we will understand much better the processes by which the crust
and lithosphere deform.
