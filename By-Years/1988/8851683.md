This project improves on this institution's already existing wind tunnel
laboratory setup. Undergraduate students using this enhanced lab gain experience
with leading-edge aerodynamic measurement techniques. The enhanced wind tunnel
laboratory includes a sting balance, a two- dimensional traversing mechanism, a
Scanivalve pressure scanner and synchro transmitter-slipring unit. This
equipment is interfaced to computers permitting students to study external flow
phenomena associated with stationary or rotating objects. This award is being
matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
