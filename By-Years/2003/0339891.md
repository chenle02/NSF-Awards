This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research project will develop
an automated framework for knowledge acquisition. This automated framework will
be based on the Principal Investigator's Rhem Knowledge Acquisition Framework
and the Unified Modeling Language (UML). This automated framework will provide
an environment for developing high-quality, reliable knowledge-based software
systems for solving complex tasks that typically require a human expert. This
research will advance the state-of-the-art in development of knowledge-based
systems. &lt;br/&gt; Knowledge acquisition is one of the most difficult and
error-prone tasks in building knowledge-based systems. It is a phase in the
building of expert systems involving the identification of relevant technical
knowledge, recording it, and getting it into computable form so the problem-
solving engine of the expert system can apply it. The acquisition of knowledge
and data is the most expensive part of building and maintaining expert systems.
If this research is successful this commercial tool will significantly reduce
the cost of developing knowledge-based systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
