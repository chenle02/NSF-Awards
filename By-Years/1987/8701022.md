The structure of a shrub community in the understory of a tropical rainforest
will be studied by determining the site- specific demography of several species
of Piper with overlapping, but not identical, distributions relative to site
disturbance history. Measurements of survival and growth rates of plant life
stages in different habitats will indicate to what extent the distributions and
abundances of Piper species are due to the differential mortality, if any, of
life stages in various each habitats. These data will also help elucidate the
ecological roles and relative importance of vegetative propagation versus seed
production. Dispersal and differential reproduction will also be examined. The
distributions of all of the Piper species in the locality will be quantified
with respect to a series of environmental parameters. The morphological and
reproductive charateristics of all of these species in this locality will be
compared to those from another location to ascertain if there are suites of
characters in this genus that are consistently correlated with species
distributions. The project will contribute to our understanding of the ways in
which plant distributions and population sizes are regulated, and hence to our
understanding of plant community structure.
