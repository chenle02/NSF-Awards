Based on information available in the literature about the frequency of
computer-game use, the effects of computer games on learning and the possibility
of existing differences in cognitive abilities or brain structure in today's
students, research is being carried out on elements of game design that promote
content learning, elements of game design that lead to motivation for continued
play, and the use of these elements to develop instructional software, video and
simulations targeted specifically at teaching chemistry concepts. A test game
environment that includes the critical game elements is being developed. The
chemistry content of this game is chemical equilibrium, which is among the most
challenging topics for students to master in first-year chemistry courses. The
performance of students is assessed by analyzing their actions during game
playing, and by mapping their behaviors as they master measurable learning
objectives. This research is designed to help chemistry instructors communicate
more effectively with their students, and to provide supplemental materials for
these students to increase meaningful learning. The ultimate goal of this
research is to determine a data-driven design model for the effective use of
game elements in computer instructional environments, resulting in high levels
of content mastery, learning efficiency, and positive affective responses.
