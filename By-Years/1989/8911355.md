The School of Oceanography and the Electrical & Computer Engineering Department
at Oregon State University will undertake a collaborative project to design and
construct a reflective-tube chlorophyll absorption meter using quantum well
technology light emitting diodes (LEDs). The instrument will make in-situ
measurements of chlorophyll absorption at 675 and 750 nm. The key to this
instrument is the applica- tion of newly developed LED technology. A new dual
wave- length light source at 675nm and 750nm will be designed and fabricated.
They will then be placed in a prototype instru- ment and validated. The
absorption meter will measure the ratio of light source output to received
signal at a fixed distance within the submerged tube. The ratio of light emitted
to that received at the wavelengths of maximum chlorophyll absorption will then
indicate the abundance of chlorophyll and phaeophytin pigments in the water.
Such information is important in a variety of ecological, environ- mental, and
remote sensing studies. The absorption meter will provide an unobtrusive measure
of chlorophyll abundance and represents a major improvement over present methods
of making these measurements using fluorometers. Furthermore, the LEDs require
very little power so profiling and long-term mooring applications are more
feasible.
