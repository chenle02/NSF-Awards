9415072 Keer This research is to understand the failure mechanisms in diamond-
like carbon coatings from the dislocation and fracture mechanics points of view
and from morphological investigations and contact fatigue tests. This research
will provide further insight into the causes of the failure of coatings in
general and will assist in the determination of optimum coating thickness. This
information will help improve the fatigue life of gear and bearing components.
