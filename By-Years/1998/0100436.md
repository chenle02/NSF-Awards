Aggregate computation is expensive, especially when time-varying attributes are
involved in it. The task of computing aggregates becomes more challenging for
spatial and spatio-temporal databases, as the spatial and temporal extent over
which the aggregate value holds must be computed. For example, multi-attribute
images are often the result of a query in the Earth Observing System (EOS)
environments, which retrieves all of the measurements incident on the pixels
that satisfy the spatio-temporal bounds of the query. Each pixel of multi-
attribute images has several values associated with it. This project develops a
suite of techniques for computing spatio-temporal aggregates. While there has
been significant work done in temporal aggregation, little is known about how to
evaluate spatial aggregates. The existing temporal aggregation and spatial join
algorithms are generalized to create efficient algorithms for computing spatial
aggregates, and then further generalized these algorithms to accommodate spatio-
temporal aggregates. In addition, scalable techniques will be developed by
parallelizing the aggregation algorithms on a shared-nothing architecture. The
project team includes a hydrologists at the United States Geological Survey on
the USGS Death Valley Regional Flow System (DVRFS) Project, which is
investigating ground-water flow in the Nevada Test Site, proposed as a
repository for high-level nuclear waste. The results from this research has a
direct impact on many large-scale spatio-temporal database applications such as
EOS, cadastral databases, atmospheric databases and hydrologic databases.
