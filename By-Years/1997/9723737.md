Ronald Olson This proposal supports a cooperative experimental-theoretical
effort between the University of Missouri-Rolla and the University of Groningen,
The Netherlands. The effort will be headed by Robert DuBois and Ronald Olson on
the US side, and by Reinhard Morgenstern and Ronnie Hoekstra from The
Netherlands. The project will investigate, both theoretically and experimentally
molecular fragmentation induced by strongly non-perturbative interactions
involving slow to intermediate energy projectiles. The experimental techniques
and expertise associated with molecular fragmentation available in Groningen
will be combined with electron spectroscopic studies at the University of
Missouri-Rolla to develop methods of measuring the differential electron spectra
associated with specific molecular dissociation channels. The proposed
approaches offer real prospects for making significant headway in understanding
the dynamics of molecular fragmentation induced by slow-to intermediate-energy
ionic projectiles.
