The development of high-speed optical systems to transmit and process
information is a major technological achievement of the late twentieth century.
The goal of this project is to develop new hybrid analytical/computational
techniques capable of identifying the errors that limit the performance of such
systems, and the probabilities with which they occur. The first component of the
project is the application of the singular value decomposition to the equations
governing the combination of optical pulse propagation and signal detection at
the end of transmission that converts light into electrical energy, which will
determine the perturbations that produce the largest changes at the output. The
second component is the application of the cross-entropy method, an adaptive
variance reduction technique which assesses the relative importance, in terms of
probability, of each type of perturbation.

Experimental testing and laboratory or field measurements of optical systems can
be quite costly and require months of time. A goal of this project is to produce
simulation methods that can provide, in an efficent manner, detailed information
about system performance, thus reducing the need for testing. The methods will
be used to model both high-speed optical communication systems and new classes
of extremely stable short-pulse lasers. These lasers provide ultra-precise
frequency references for communication, radar, and remote chemical sensing, and
are an essential component in optical atomic clocks, next generation timekeeping
devices that are predicted to have accuracies several orders of magnitude better
than current atomic clocks. Improved accuracies in global position systems and
other technologies are expected to result from these devices.
