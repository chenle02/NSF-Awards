Investigation of ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) Networks The ARC is a Southern
California consortium investigating ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) for
suitability as a high speed networking technology for advanced applications such
as medicine, teleconferencing, and metacomputing. ATM service is being provided
by Pacific Bell and GTE, while the local premise equipment, switches and
workstations, is being provided by each ARC member. Using the ATM equipment
provided by the CISE grant, experiments in the areas of remote learning, network
management, and performance evaluation will be performed by HMC and CGS. In the
area of remote learning the ARC network will be used to support real-time
interactive courses and seminars between HMC and CGS and other ARC members.
During such sessions ARC network performance and management will be investigated
by HMC and CGS researchers. Because of the high speed nature of ATM, new
paradigms for performance and management will be developed by ARC researchers. A
primary goal of the research conducted by HMC and CGS will investigate through
experiments the suitability of ATM for supporting advanced network applications.
Without NSF support for an ATM switch and workstation, Harvey Mudd College and
the Claremont Graduate School would be unable to participate actively in ARC
activities.
