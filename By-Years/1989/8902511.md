The Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) scheme of languages provides a framework
for reasoning with symbolic and numerical constraints and for linking these
methods of computation. It also provides a method for tailoring constraint logic
programming languages for specific applications. The research plan includes: (1)
to implement sequential and parallel versions of a canonical for algorithm
developed by Lassez and McAloon for solving and maintaining systems of
constraints and rules, (2) to work on constraint solving techniques for use in
implementations of CLP(R) and other constraint logic programming languages, (3)
to embed this work in the inference and constraint solving engines of a CLP
language called 2LP specifically intended for application to constraint based
reasoning and to mixed integer linear optimization problems, (4) to work on a
sequent calculus approach to reasoning with constraints, on canonical forms in a
general setting and on computational complexity issues. This research can lead
to new intelligent systems for dealing with applications classically handled by
mixed integer linear programming in the areas of financial applications or
resource management and to development of user friendly general purpose
applications software for constraints and optimization.
