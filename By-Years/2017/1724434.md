This proposal will support US-based Ph.D. students working in artificial
intelligence the opportunity to share their knowledge and interact with each
other and more senior researchers, to learn about different sub-fields within
AI, and to be mentored in research, publication, and career opportunities. This
goal will be accomplished by partially supporting the travel costs for US-based
Ph.D. students to attend the International Joint Conference on Artificial
Intelligence (IJCAI), which is one of the premier international conferences on
research in artificial intelligence. The conference, which in 2017 will be held
in Melbourne, Australia attracts an international crowd that includes academics,
industry workers, entrepreneurs, and funding agency leaders.
