A new Materials Research Group will investigate microstructure in
polycrystalline materials. The objective is to study, in real time, the
evolution of thermo-mechanical processing events, and their impact on the
mechanical, electrical, and elastic properties of engineering materials. The
work will exploit recent advances in electron diffraction techniques
(backscatter Kikuchi diffraction) which will enable automated measurements of a
new class of microstructural measures of texture in polycrystalline materials.
These microtextures are believed to affect a wide range of material properties
and performance. The scope of activity will involve an inter-disciplinary,
multi- collaborator group, centered at Yale University, with additional group
members at Drexel University, The University of Bristol (England), and NIST
(Boulder). The research involves both theoretical and experimental aspects of
texture analysis. The project should result in development of a timely and
necessary new generation of tools required to address fundamental topics which
have great potential for application in materials processing occurring in both
the primary and advanced metals industries.
