This award will support the participation of ten talented undergraduate
students each year in the Research Experiences for Undergraduates program
offered by the Microbiology Department at the University of Texas, Austin. This
program, which encompasses 10 weeks each summer will allow the students to work
in well- funded and equipped laboratories in which the research being conducted
covers both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems and deals with membrane
localization, DNA replication and recombination, control of gene expression,
immunological mechanisms, pathogenic mechanisms and viral transformation.
Participants will work individually with faculty mentors but have access to all
faculty through seminars and informal discussions in a format which is similar
to that of previously supported successful programs. This new award will
emphasize acquainting students with the variety of post-graduate opportunities
for students interested in molecular biology. Activities are geared to promote
interest in research careers and encourage students to apply to graduate schools
in molecular biology. This award will foster the continued education and
training of individuals who will be part of the next generation of basic
researchers in the biological sciences.
