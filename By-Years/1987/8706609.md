The Computer Science Network (CSNET) believes that it can best serve the
research community by joining the NSFNET effort at building a National Research
Network. It will add 185 academic and industrial sites to the overall NSFNET. In
addition it will offer some of the services of the CSNET Coordination and
Information Center (CIC) to the NSFNET effort. These services include gatewaying
to international networks and access to the CSNET Nameserver and CSNET Info
Server.
