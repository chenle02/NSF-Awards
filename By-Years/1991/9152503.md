A major expansion of an Undergraduate Scientific and Engineering Visualization
Laboratory (USEVL) to be directed by Professor Norman I. Badler. Based on the
Director's existing nationally and internationally recognized Computer Graphics
effort, the USEVL brings modern high-performance workstations for visualization
into the Undergraduate curriculum and experience. Visualization provides the
most direct and exciting pathway into modern high-performance computing. Not
only does the Computer Science student learn the principles and use of high-
speed workstations, but the experience carries over into many other aspects of
scientific and technological education. Conversely, non-Computer Science majors
(that is, other Engineering and Science majors), discover that the power of
visualization can be applied to the fundamental concepts and applications of
their own disciplines. The development expands the existing educational graphics
nucleus of four Silicon Graphics Iris 4D workstations by adding five
workstations plus a fast fileserver. Existing in-house and no-cost commercial
software will be used to provide instant usability for the USEVL facility.
