The principal investigator will study the structure of the convective boundary
layer over the tropical oceans as predicted by the National Meteorological
Center's (NMC) medium range (7-10 day) forecast model. The model's climatology
will be compared with thermodynamic date produced with a radiative-convective
equilibrium model. Energy budget calculations will be done to assess the
deficiencies in the physics of the model and to evaluate the feedback between
the boundary layer and the larger-scale model environment. Sensitivity
experiments will be designed to explore how representation of atmospheric
physical processes in the NMC model can be improved. An important task is to
attempt to improve the shallow cloud parameterization by explictly calculating
the cumulus momentum transport. The research will be done in collaboration with
scientists at NMC as part of the NSF-NMC Joint Program in Numerical Weather
Prediction. This research will be an important contribution to the improvement
of operational medium weather forecasts and better understanding of the tropical
convection boundary layer.
