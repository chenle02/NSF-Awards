This project examines, through field observations, the hypothesis that sea-salt
aerosol has alkalinity amounts enhanced over that in sea water, which then leads
to increased importance of processes that are more important at higher pH (lower
acidity), such as oxidation of sulfur dioxide by ozone. These processes compete
with the aqueous phase oxidation of sulfur dioxide by hydrogen peroxide, and the
gas phase oxidation by hydroxyl radicals. The investigations will be
accomplished by making size resolved measurements of aerosol ionic composition
under a variety of conditions of biological primary productivity, cloudiness,
and season. Composition measurements as a function of aerosol size are important
because the alkalinity enhancements appear to be more significant for larger
sizes. These data will be used to derive estimates of the contribution of this
mechanism to the global sulfur cycle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will
help define mechanisms that can be incorporated into chemical transport models
that should lead to improved simulation of sulfur transformations in the marine
boundary layer. Students will be supported and involved in this project.
