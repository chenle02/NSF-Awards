The principal investigator plans to investigate detailed connections
among&lt;br/&gt;representation theories of finite groups of Lie types, algebraic
groups, Lie&lt;br/&gt;algebras, and quivers. The research will concentrate on
relating the&lt;br/&gt;cohomology theory of finite groups of Lie type and that
of restricted Lie&lt;br/&gt;algebras and infinitesimal group schemes. The goal
is to describe, for a&lt;br/&gt;given rational module for an algebraic group,
its support varieties over&lt;br/&gt;finite groups of rational points over
finite fields in terms of its support&lt;br/&gt;varieties over the higher
Frobenius kernels. The principal investigator&lt;br/&gt;will also study the
connections between representations of quivers and&lt;br/&gt;representations of
Kac-Moody Lie algebras and quantum groups (and their&lt;br/&gt;generalizations).
This will involve the study of subalgebras of Hall&lt;br/&gt;algebras using
perverse sheaves, construct canonical basis of generic&lt;br/&gt;subalgebras,
realize affine Lie algebras in terms of representations of&lt;br/&gt;quivers,
and relate them to Fock spaces. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The beauty of
mathematical research lies in linking many different subject&lt;br/&gt;areas
together to apply available theory in many different fields. This project is in
the area of mathematics known as representation theory. At its core,
representation theory derives from the study of symmetries, i.e., the symmetries
that natural objects, from subatomic particles to planetary orbits, have.
Nowadays there are many different kinds of representation theory, each having
evolved as the best way to deal with different kinds of problems. The purpose of
this project is to find and explore some of the links between some of the
different kinds of representation theory. Such links will benefit not only the
study of representation theory, but also physics and other sciences that use
representation theory as a standard tool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
