With the support of the Instrumentation and Instrument Development Program, the
Departments of Biological Sciences and Chemistry and the Plant Molecular Biology
Center of Northern Illinois University will purchase a graphics and molecular
modeling network. The instrumentation will be used to perform molecular graphics
and molecular mechanics calculations to aid the following research projects:
Studies on Structure-Function Relationships in Proteins Encoded by Bromoviruses;
An RNA Catalysis Model; Electron Density Analysis of Organic Reactions; Study of
Structure/Function Relationships in Macrocyclic Complexes of Toxic Heavy Metals
and the Development of New Extraction Technologies Based on Polymer-Supported
Macrocyclic Complexing Agents.
