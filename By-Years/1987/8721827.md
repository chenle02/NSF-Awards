The problem of voltage collapse or voltage instabilities in large scale power
networks is emerging as the most significant barrier to reliable operation for
the next decade. This workshop will assemble world-wide authorities to discuss
concerns, suggestions for short term problem solution and guidelines and
direction for future long-term research. This workshop is being co-sponsored and
co-funded (50/50) with the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI).//
