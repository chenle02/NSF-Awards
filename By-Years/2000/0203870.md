TITLE: Towards Community Services: Putting Parallel Network Services On-
line&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate a community service
system architecture and run-time infrastructure needed to support such high-end
services. We will focus on two key run-time issues for performance: dynamic
resource management and scaling. Dynamic resource management allows: (i)
resources to be {de-} allocated to service requests on-the-fly, (ii) resources
to be acquired via negotiation, and (iii) resources to be shared across inter-
service domains. Resource management will be based on a performance estimation
technique that learns service execution time as function of dependent inputs and
resources allocated. We will produce a set of next generation tools and
libraries that can be leveraged by community services running in single-site
clusters and in multi-site Grids. The toolset will be evaluated by applying it
to several high-end network services in the area of visualization, astronomy,
and bioinformatics.&lt;br/&gt;
