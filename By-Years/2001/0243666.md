This award is to continue a Research Experience for Undergraduates program at
the Space Physics Research Laboratory of the University of Michigan. Ten to
thirteen undergraduate students are competitively selected to spend three summer
months working with one of about 30 faculty members. Research areas include
Airglow and Atmospheric Science, Space Plasma Physics, Planetary Atmospheres,
Ionospheres and Magnetospheres, Air Pollution Transport, and Lidars. The
students have opportunities to interact with their mentors, other undergraduate
students in the program, graduate students at the university and other faculty
members and research staff. They are able to have hands on experience working
with instrumentation which has or will fly in space, making remote sensing
measurements of the atmosphere, and fabricating and calibrating components of
these state of the art systems. They are also able to choose to construct and
work with software packages which solve analytical expressions, present space
flight data in image forms, and manipulate large data bases. A portion of their
experience involves attending weekly seminars given by the faculty staff,
writing up their work in a report for their mentor (which may be publishable),
and presenting their report orally to the students and staff.
