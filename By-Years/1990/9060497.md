Radiation processing, particularly techniques for radiation enhanced shelf life
of foods, are important possible applications of electron accelerators. In order
for this to become economically attractive, an electron accelerator of 5 MeV
maximum energy with an average beam power of 500 kW must be developed. Low
frequency RF linacs (less than 300 Mhz.) are very attractive candidates for this
application. In this work, we propose to build a 100 kV module of such an
accelerator with realistic beam loading and an inexpensive 200 Mhz. power triode
amplifier in order to test the capabilities this class of machine. Techniques
are proposed which will allow the majority of the 1 meter cavities to be
insulated with atmospheric pressure gas (Sulphur Hexafluoride), resulting in
significant simplifications to the design and cooling of such accelerators. The
module which will be developed will also be tested in vacuum for comparison, and
to estimate the heating of the structure in vacuum. The modular approach which
we are using significantly increases the fault tolerance and overall reliability
of the accelerator. If successful, the costs of high power RF accelerators will
be significantly reduced, and the power levels of these accelerators will be
significantly increased.
