This project will support a four-day workshop focused on issues in high-fidelity
simulation in support of robotics research and education. Approximately 20 of
the world?s foremost experts in the development and use of simulation tools for
the analysis, design, and control of robotic manipulation systems will be
invited. The main goals will be to assess the state of the art in robot
simulation tools and to produce a plan of action for the deployment of a broadly
accessible simulation tool. The workshop will culminate in the development of a
CRI:ADDO proposal to NSF to support the deployment and initial development of
the tool, after which, support and development would continue in a self-
sustaining mode.&lt;br/&gt;
