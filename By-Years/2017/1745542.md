This project is to support the Space Environment Effects and Science Workshop
September 5-8, 2017 at the Department of Commerce facility in Boulder, CO. This
workshop brings together two groups for whom increased collaboration is
important - the engineers from IEEE radiation and plasma effects community and
space environment research scientists. This workshop will focus on the effects
of space weather on space and launch systems. The goal is to establish effective
communication between the research community and the end-users with a goal of
developing further requirements for space environment climate and forecasting
models. This workshop addresses the goals of the National Space Weather Action
plan to further develop the research to operations and operations to research
linkages.
