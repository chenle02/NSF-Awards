The FAIR principles (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) when
applied to scientific research data have the potential to both ease the burden
of readying data created from NSF funded research for sharing and enhance the
use and reuse of the data. The FAIR Hackathon Workshop for Mathematics and the
Physical Sciences (MPS) research communities will bring together innovative data
scientists and developers from across physical sciences projects funded by NSF
to solve real-world data challenges using the principles of FAIR: Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable Data. Designed to address issues of
public access to data and to provide tools and relevant hands-on experience for
researchers, the workshop will lay out the FAIR principles and metrics in the
context of a hackathon using the successful model of The Bio-IT World FAIR Data
Hackathon organized by the European Union's GOFAIR initiative of the European
Open Science Cloud. The hackathon will unite MPS and research data management
teams to tackle actual datasets with maximum impact
potential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
