A new synthesis technique for production of intermetallic alloys and amorphous
alloys is proposed that combines magnetron sputtering and vapor condensation.
The nano-sized particles are collected, and compacted and sintered.
Intermetallic alloys of the transition metal/aluminide type are synthesized, and
the structure analyzed by several techniques to characterize the chemical
homogeneity, crystal structure, and grain size. Effects of processing,
consolidation, and sintering behavior are examined with respect to their effects
on structure and mechanical properties of the intermetallic phases. The ability
to produce amorphous phases by these techniques is also under examination.
Deformation behavior of the nanophase materials is studied by hot microhardness
analysis and a few selected compression experiments.
