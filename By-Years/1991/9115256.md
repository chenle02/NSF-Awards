Dr. Ronald Benner is a research scientist at the Texas Marine Science Institute
at Port Aransas, on the Gulf of Mexico coast. The Institute is the oldest
continuously operating marine research lab on the Texas Gulf Coast, and it hosts
active research by investigators from the University of Texas and many other
organizations. Dr. Benner proposes acquisition of an elemental analyzer (carbon,
hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur) for general use at the Institute. This
instrument would be used by resident and visiting scientists in biogeochemical
research in a variety of coastal environments. This instrument would replace an
obsolete instrument and would greatly expand the lab's research capacity. The
proposed instrument acquisition will have immediate and beneficial impacts on
many active research programs. The number and accuracy of chemical analyses will
increase at the Institute, and graduate students and advanced undergraduates
will be exposed to the most modern research equipment currently available.
