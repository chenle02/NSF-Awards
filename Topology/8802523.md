Various problems in algebraic topology will be attacked by the three faculty
investigators and their graduate students. E. H. Brown will continue his effort
to extend homotopy theory to include continuous cohomology and real homotopy
types, with a view to studying the homotopy type of the classifying spaces and
secondary characteristic classes of foliations. J. Levine is working on a
homotopy classification of classical links and related questions concerning the
mu-bar- invariants. He also plans to study homotopy of higher dimensional links
and a minimal model, Lie algebra approach to link groups. K. Igusa is studying
the relation between algebraic K-theory and pseudoisotopies. He intends to
develop a complexified pseudoisotopy theory from a geometric point of view. The
object is to illuminate the relation between the rational parts of the homotopy
groups of G/O, K(Z), P(*) and Waldhausen's A(X).
