0117346 Orsi&lt;br/&gt;Inverse modeling techniques will be used to resolve the
transports in the Southern Ocean as port of the synthesis phase of the World
Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE). The box inverse model, applied to
circumpolar hydrographic sections following the Subantarctic Front and southern
ACC front of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, along with multiple WOCE and
other high-quality hydrographic data. The model will explicitly include air-sea
transformations to solve for a set of reference velocities and property-
dependent effective diapycnal velocities, and corrections to these fluxes
consistent with property conservation in neutral density layers. Previous
studies of the global thermohaline circulation by means of inverse box models
have been severely restricted by their lack of controlling sections within the
Southern Ocean, and therefore were not able to distinguish meridional exchanges
among the different circulation regimes in the regions south of about 32
