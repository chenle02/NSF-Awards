&lt;br/&gt;Jackson State Community College (JSCC) is partnering with Austin Peay
State University, the University of Tennessee at Martin, and Arkansas State
University to develop three comprehensive articulation programs in Precision
Agriculture: a 2+2 program, a 4+1 program, and a 3+1 program. These partnership
programs ultimately lead to a Bachelor of Science degree in Precision
Agriculture. The unique feature of these articulation agreements is that
students not only transfer from the community college to the university, but
also from the university to the community college. This inverted degree program
with a "reverse transfer" format allows students to graduate from both JSCC and
a four-year institution, with the fourth year spent at JSCC. JSCC holds
technologically sophisticated equipment not available at the partnering
universities, and it has developed a number of innovative courses to provide
experiential learning opportunities to students in this field. The Precision
Agriculture program provides students with theoretical background and hands-on
experience in agronomy, GIS, GPS, and computer science. A unique combinations of
courses and experiences train students to work in the precision agriculture
industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
