The objective of this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project in
theoretical organic chemistry between Nenad Trinajstic of the Rudjer Boskovic
Institute and Douglas J. Klein of Texas A&M University at Galveston is to
investigate the electronic structure and properties of novel molecular systems
by applying quantum chemical models. The investigators will extend their
conceptual models in graph theory to elemental carbon clusters, high spin
hydrocarbons, polymers and high temperature superconductors (inorganic
perovskites). The collaborative effort combines the complementary expertise of
Dr. Trinajstic in chemical graph theory and theoretical organic chemistry and
Dr. Klein's expertise in quantum and computational chemistry. This project was
approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on Cooperation in Science and
Technology and is supported through a joint fund consisting of matching
contributions from the U.S. and Yugoslav governments. The U.S. contribution is
provided annually by the Department of State. No NSF funds are involved. The
award, except for funds for U.S. scientist travel, is made to the Yugoslav
institution. NSF's goal of advancing scientific knowledge is promoted through
the joint efforts of the Yugoslav and U.S. scientists.
