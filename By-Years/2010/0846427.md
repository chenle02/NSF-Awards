Among the most demanding challenges in organic chemistry is the introduction of
chirality via catalytic methods. This project examines new concepts towards this
goal in four disparate areas. The first involves the rational design of ligands
for formation of dinuclear and heterodinuclear metal complexes as catalysts for
addition reactions. The second area involves asymmetric trimethylenemethane
(TMM) cycloadditions. The fact that the addition of the acceptor occurs on the
face of the TMM unit distal to where the metal and its attendant ligands reside
makes asymmetric induction highly challenging. With the aid of molecular
modeling, new ligand families have been designed for [3+2], [3+4], and [3+6]
cycloadditions. The third section examines Pd and Mo catalyzed asymmetric
allylic alkylation. Using ligand design, contrasteric nucleophilic addition to
the more substituted allyl terminus as well as contrathermodynamic addition to
the C-2 position of the allyl unit will be attempted. Novel Ru-Pd sequential
reactions for asymmetric synthesis will also be studied. The fourth area is the
asymmetric induction in Ru catalyzed reactions for their exploration in alkene-
alkyne coupling and allylic alkylations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award,
the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the research program
of Professor Barry M. Trost of the Department of Chemistry at Stanford
University. Professor Trost's program revolves around the theme of enhancing
synthetic efficiency by inventing new catalytic processes that exercise enhanced
chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-selectivity. Particular attention
focuses on processes that enhance atom economy, a key aspect of "green
chemistry". Success has impacts on areas ranging from materials science to
biology, especially with respect to the pharmaceutical and agrichemical
industries.
