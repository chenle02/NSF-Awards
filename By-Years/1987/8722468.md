Cestode worms of the family Onchobothriidae are parasites in the intestines of
sharks. Dr. Janine Caira proposes to study the evolutionary relationships among
the species of the family, and in the process identify those morphological
features that are discordant with evolutionary relationships, in that they
evolve independently in different lineages. Dr. Caira then proposes to analyze
the degree to which these characters are adaptations to the mechanical
attachment of worms to the shark. The proposed study has broad implications on
several levels. The evolutionary study will lead to a more accurate
understanding of the species of the family, an improved classification, and more
reliable identification criteria. The study of attachment adaptation has
potential for illuminating the process of coevolution, a subject of interest
throughout biology.
