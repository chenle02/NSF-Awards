Multicommodity flows, or multiflows in short, are central topics in all types of
communication networks, whether wired or wireless. Computing a maximum
(concurrent) multiflow in multihop wireless networks is particularly challenging
because the capacities of the communication links, rather than being fixed, vary
with the underlying link schedule. A unique challenge is thus how to compute a
link schedule subject to the wireless interference constraint which induces a
link capacity function supporting a maximum (concurrent) multiflow. This project
establishes both the computational hardness and approximation hardness of
computing maximum (concurrent) multiflows in multihop wireless networks, and
develops practical approximation algorithms with provably good performance. A
polyhedral approach is taken by the project to construct various polynomial
approximate capacity subregions of multihop wireless networks. These approximate
capacity subregions not only are the algorithmic foundation of the computing
maximum (concurrent) multiflows, but also serve as a basis for interesting
future projects on network capacity and cross-layer design and optimizations in
multihop wireless networks. They are also of independent interest to the
theoretical computer science community at large. This project provides
scholarships to graduate students and offers research topics for strong
dissertation works on multihop wireless networks. The outcome of this project
will not only be disseminated to the professional researchers through journals
and conference proceedings, but also be integrated into the lecture notes
targeted for senior undergraduate students and graduate students.
