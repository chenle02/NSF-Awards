9414184 WILSON This project centers on the differences in the perception of
environmental risk factors among Native and non-Native populations in Alaska.
Among the factors which contribute to different perceptions are culture,
language, economic structure as well as measures of environmental risk factors.
Through various observational techniques--surveys, archived data and ethnography
--a triangulation of methodologies is intended to provide a rich contextual
analysis. The present proposal will support a working conference of experts to
explore substantive and methodological issues raised by parallel projects in
Oklahoma and Alaska, both of which examine risk perceptions by Native Americans.
There presently exists no clearly defined methodology for asssessing cross-
cultural risk perception. This project will thus break new ground of great
significance for the field of decision science and contribute to the development
of the policy sciences in the U.S. Arctic, nationally and internationally. ***
