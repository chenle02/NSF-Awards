Hales This award supports the work of Professor Thomas Hales in the Langland's
Program. The Langland's Program is central to modern number theory by providing
structure to the idea that discrete geometric information can be studied
analytically. Prof. Hales works on establishing special cases of the trace
formula. He is also interested in studying some unsolved problems in real
groups. These problems are of interest in a number of different areas of
mathematics. This research falls under the general heading of Number Theory.
Number Theory is the study of the properties of the whole numbers and is the
oldest branch of mathematics. From the beginning problems in number theory have
furnished the driving force to creation of new mathematics in almost all parts
of the discipline. The Langland's program is a general philosophy that connects
number theory with calculus. Modern number theory is very technical and deep,
but it has had astonishing applications in areas like theoretical computer
science and coding theory. ***
