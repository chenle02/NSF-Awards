9407569 Montelione The objectives of this work are to develop pulse sequences
and computer software which will automate the process of protein structure
determination by multidimensional NMR. Pulsed-field gradient (PFG) technology
will be optimized to provide improved sensitivity and better H2O solvent
suppression by using two-and three-gradient pulse sequences. A family of PFG
triple resonance NMR pulse sequences will be designed which provide optimal
input for automated analysis software. Artificial intelligence will be applied
in developing user-friendly software for analyzing these data, including
automation of the processes of resonance assignment, compilation of experimental
distance constraints, and structure generation. This software will accelerate
the structure determination process for small (&lt;10 KDa) proteins. This
technology development will be carried out on samples of isotope- enriched
protein growth factors, transcription factors, IgG binding domains, and protease
inhibitors for which prokaryotic production expression systems are already
available in the laboratory. %%% The technology will greatly enhance the
applicability and accessibility of NMR spectroscopy as a tool for protein
engineering and structural biology, and improve the competitiveness of the
United States in these important biotechnology areas. It will make amenable to
NMR studies many proteins which are presently inaccessible for various technical
reasons, and accelorate the process of molecular structure analysis. The
techniques and the data which result from this work will provide important
infrastructure for determining the three-dimensional structures of many
different proteins by NMR, and will have important implications in several
related fields including protein engineering, protein chemistry, protein folding
and agricultural biotechnology. The work will have a significant impact on the
infrastructure of biophysical chemistry by enhancing the effectiveness, informat
ion content, and interpretability of NMR technology. ***
