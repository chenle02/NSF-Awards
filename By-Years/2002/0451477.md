Peter Armentrout of the University of Utah is supported by the Experimental
Physical Chemistry Program to continue his experimental research in gas-phase
organometallic ion chemistry and chemical dynamics. This effort will utilize
guided ion beam tandem mass spectrometry, coupled with ion production using a DC
discharge/flow tube ion source and a newly developed electrospray/ion
funnel/hexapole ion guided ion source. Four related areas of chemical
interactions will be studied. First, studies of the chemistry of third row
transition metal ions designed to measure bond energies between metals and
various hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon ligands will be pursued. An ion mobility
source will be developed to enable new state-specific chemistry studies on
heavier transition metal elements with an emphasis on a quantitative evaluation
of spin-orbit effects on reactivity. Second, solvation energies of multiply
charged metal ions will be quantitatively assessed starting with the hydration
of doubly-charged alkaline earth metal ions. Next, bond dissociation energies
between metal ions and biologically relevant molecules will be explored.
Finally, additional studies of the energy transfer function will be performed
and statistical methods for analysis of reaction dynamics will continue to be
developed, including those for sequential dissociation pathways, multiply-
charged metal-ligand complexes, and increasingly large systems.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The thermodynamic information that is acquired and
disseminated in this research is relevant to applications in surface science,
organometallic chemistry, catalysis, biological systems, and plasma chemistry.
The data analysis program CRUNCH, which continues to evolve, is made freely
available and used by groups around the world. The undergraduate and graduate
students, and postdoctoral associates involved in this interdisciplinary science
are exposed to a broad range of topics, working with state-of-the-art physical
and analytical methods.&lt;br/&gt;
