9404113 Yao This award gives partial support for a postdoctoral researcher to
work in the theory group at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). Postdoctoral
researchers would collaborate closely with the principal investigators, freely
choosing and mixing topics from current theory group projects and their own
areas of interest. The two largest projects are mesh generation and approximate
searching. Mesh generation requires the partitioning of a complicated geometric
domain into a complex of small simple cells. Approximate searching requires the
efficient retrieval of data objects close to a given query point in a high-
dimensional space (either combinatorial or geometric). Each of these major
projects covers a number of specific algorithmic questions. ***
