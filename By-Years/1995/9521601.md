This award is made in the Organic Dynamics Program in the support of the
research of Prof. Daniel Falvey at the University of Maryland. The research
deals with chemical and spectroscopic studies of nitrenium ions, photochemically
generated from N-aminopyridinium salts. Two specific areas will be addressed:
(1) the solution reactivity of nitrenium ions, particularly with nucleophiles,
and (2) defining the structural features of nitrenium ions which control their
singlet-triplet energy gaps. The former will be probed by laser flash photolysis
and photothermal beam deflection calorimetry and the latter by low temperature
electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Experimental studies will be
complemented by semi-empirical and ab initio calculations. Nitrenium ions, as
reactive intermediates in organic reactions, have not been well explored. This
study of the structural features which control their singlet-triplet energy
gaps, will provide fundamental information which will aid in the design of new
magnetic materials. Additionally, the study of the reactivity of nitrenium ions
towards nucleophiles will shed light on their role in DNA damage and
carcinogenesis.
