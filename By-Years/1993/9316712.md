This award supports a collaborative marine geological and geophysical project
between the University of California, Santa Barbara, and the University of
Alabama to study the glacial and tectonic history of the eastern Ross Sea and
the Marie Byrd Land margin of West Antarctica. The goals of the project are (1)
to conduct seismic imaging and piston coring to begin unraveling the history of
the West Antarctic ice Sheet as recorded in the recent sediments of the
continental shelf of the region, and (2) to acquire seismic images of the
acoustic basement beneath the Cenozoic glacial deposits toward an understanding
of the relationship between rift structure of the continental crust and Cenozoic
glacial deposits of the region. This research will result in bathymetric,
structural, sediment isopach, gravity and magnetic maps of the eastern Ross Sea
and the Marie Byrd Land margin. This information will be integrated into an
interpretation of the major glacial and structural features of the region. This
project will result in a better understanding of the glacio-marine stratigraphy
and glacial history of the eastern Ross Sea and Marie Byrd Land margin and,
consequently, it will represent a significant contribution to the goals of the
West Antarctic Ice Sheet initiative.
