9405994 Stone The goal of this study is to establish the physical volcanology,
geochemistry, and petrogenesis of selected komatiitic successions in the
Abitibi-Pontiac region of the Superior Province. The project will involve: 1)
the delineation of volcanic facies in outcrop and diamond drill core in key
localities; 2) analysis of whole-rock major and trace elements (including rare-
earth, high field-strength, and platinum-group elements) in selected samples; 3)
analysis of relict igneous minerals (silicates, oxides, sulfides, and platinum-
group minerals) by X-ray emission spectrometry; 4) analysis of Os isotopes by
negative thermal ionization mass spectrometry at the Australian National
University; and 5) analysis of Nd and Hf isotopes. This study will provide
important constraints on the geodynamic settings of the Abitibi and Pontiac
greenstone belts, and contribute greatly to our understanding of the
petrogenesis of komatiites and the development of Archean greenstone belts.
