This project addresses problems of fundamental interest in pure mathematics, and
especially in the field of algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry is one of the
oldest branches of mathematics, as people have attempted for a very long time to
use algebra in order to understand problems in geometry, and at the same time
one that has seen some of the most outstanding modern developments and
connections with areas of pure and applied science. The main aim of the project
is to connect parts of algebraic and complex geometry that have previously been
quite disjoint; in particular, it uses new tools (called Hodge modules), relying
heavily on topology and analysis as well, in order to classify geometric shapes
and singularities. This approach is generating numerous projects for Ph.D.
students and the project provides research training opportunities for graduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, the PI will continue applying the
theory of mixed Hodge modules to concrete problems in complex and birational
geometry. He will also continue developing the theory of Hodge ideals, in
collaboration with M. Mustata. This has been completed for Q-divisors, providing
an extension of the theory of multiplier ideas in this setting, but new ideas
need to be brought into play in order to obtain a similar picture for ideal
sheaves, or for local cohomology. One hopes that this will lead to further
interesting applications. In their work the PI and Mustata have already obtained
applications regarding the singularities of theta divisors, hypersurfaces in
projective space, or minimal exponents. In addition to further consequences
along these lines, they will use the proposed extensions in order to study, for
instance, effective bounds for linear series, or roots of the Bernstein-Sato
polynomial. The PI has also been involved in applying the theory of Hodge
modules towards the study of the variation of families smooth projective
varieties of varieties, e.g. Brody hyperbolicity or Viehweg-type questions for
parameter spaces. He will extend this study to families of singular varieties,
especially those that appear in the theory of moduli of higher dimensional
varieties according to Koll√°r and others, perhaps using those Hodge modules that
extend variations of mixed Hodge structure. The PI will also continue working
towards the classification of subvarieties with minimal cohomology class on
principally polarized abelian varieties, and its link with generic vanishing
subschemes and with the singularities of theta
divisors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
