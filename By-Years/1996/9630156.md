The purpose of this project is to determine how the properties of atomic nuclei
depend upon their temperature T and rotational spin I. Neutrons and protons move
in nuclear orbitals, which vary with T and I. Each nucleus has a shape, which
changes as T and I are altered. Increasing T or I generates transitions from one
nuclear shape to another, for example, prolate (football), oblate (discus),
spherical, etc. There are also transitions in how the shape is oriented relative
to the rotation axis. The rotation axis might be parallel to or perpendicular to
the symmetry axis of the shape, or at any intermediate angle. A single nucleus
may also have transitions between a normal fluid phase and various kinds of
superfluid phases. The superfluid phase may contain correlated pairs of two
neutrons, two protons, or one neutron and one proton. The internal spins of the
two particles in a pair might be parallel or anti-parallel. Because atomic
nuclei are small systems, they have large fluctuations in their shape, the
orientation of the shape relative to the rotation axis, and the amount of
superfluidity.
