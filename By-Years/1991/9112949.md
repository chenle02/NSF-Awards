Professor Yau will study several fundamental problems in complex geometry
including solutions to the complex Plateau problem and the embedding problem for
three dimensional CR manifolds. He will also try to extend previous work on
finite dimensional Lie algebras and isolated hypersurface singularities to
higher codimension singularities. This award will support research in three
basic areas of complex differential geometry. The complex Plateau problem is a
geometric minimization problem. The goal of the proposed research is to classify
those real odd-dimensional real submanifolds which are boundaries of complex
manifolds. This work is closely connected to research on CR manifolds - spaces
which usually occur as subspaces of complex space. Although most of the work
which will be supported by this proposal falls into the area of what has been
called "pure mathematics", much of Professor Yau's work in this field has found
application in control theory and filtering. The work thus serves as a reminder
of the link between basic research and application.
