Modern methods of analysis in chemistry and biology involve molecular
separations of complicated mixtures. Often separations on large numbers of
samples are necessary in order to reveal important trends. This problem is
particularly evident in behavioral and ecological studies where the need to
determine kinship among large numbers of individual plants and insects using DNA
fingerprinting methods is critical. The final step in these analyses is a
separation of pieces of DNA. However, the traditional electrophoresis methods of
separation are labor intensive and slow. Capillary electrophoresis represents a
powerful technique that provides rapid separation of charged molecules such as
proteins and DNA. This project incorporates the use of a capillary
electrophoresis instrument into several biology and chemistry courses. The
instrument can be used by undergraduate students in biology courses to separate
fragments of DNA as a means of fingerprinting individual plants and insects in
behavioral and ecological studies. It can also be used by chemistry
undergraduates to study the ionic speciation of acids and bases and mechanisms
of separation. Environmental chemistry students look at ionic pollutants in rain
and run-off waters, and biochemistry students use the instrument to separate
proteins, DNA, and small molecules in projects of their own design. The
efficiency of the instrument permits the analysis of large numbers of samples,
which increases the probability of observing statistically significant trends.
Since the experimental preparations are simpler than older methods, the use of
capillary electrophoresis also frees up laboratory time for additional focus on
the scientific principles of the study. Innovative applications, advantages, and
limitations of using capillary electrophoresis in student labs will be
disseminated through two workshops, publications, and the World Wide Web.
