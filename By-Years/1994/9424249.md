9424249 Ongley A group of four faculty from Bates College, Dartmouth College,
Castleton State (Vermont) in the U.S., and the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de
Mexico propose a series of research projects involving 12 students. All projects
focus on water contamination associated with mining activity near Hidalgo,
Mexico. With a primary emphasis on arsenic contamination, students will track
sources and possible flow paths in order to predict the most probable location
of unpolluted groundwater in a populated valley southeast of the mines. The
students will receive preliminary training at Bates, travel to Mexico for a
month of field work, then return to Bates for analytical work and data
interpretation. The all-female group of site leaders have introduced flexibility
to accommodate non- traditional students, and will encourage participation by
Hispanic/Latino students. Immersion in the Mexican culture is an additional
benefit of this scientifically valuable project.
