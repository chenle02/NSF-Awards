Horia Metiu is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to continue his research in quantum dynamics. Three areas of
research are being studied: 1) wave packet interferometry is being extended to
nonlinear spectroscopy as a sensitive method for studying highly excited states;
2) a technique is being developed for calculating photon absorption and Raman
scattering cross sections for systems with few quantum degrees embedded in a
bath of classical ones, e.g. an electron solvated in a zeolite; and 3) a time
dependent theory is being developed for treating exciton formation and tunneling
in confined semiconductor structures, e.g. quantum wells, wires, dots and
clusters. There are many interesting biochemical, chemical and solid state
systems in which an electron interacts with a complex environment. The
spectroscopy of the electron connects this interaction to observable quantities
and gives us a chance to understand the underlying dynamical mechanisms.
Furthermore the properties of electrons and holes in confined semiconductor
structures are being extensively studied in the hope of using them in opto-
electronic and tunneling devices. Metiu will employ the techniques of time
dependent quantum mechanics to study the behavior of electrons, holes and
excitons in these systems. This work will help to provide useful intuitive
models for the behavior of these complex systems.
