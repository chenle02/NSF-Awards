9403698 Jones This project involves the dissertation research of a student in
cultural anthropology from City University of New York. The student, a Puerto
Rican native, will study how local "cultural centers" in Puerto Rico define what
it means to be Puerto Rican in light of contesting claims for support and
influence by diverse groups. Using participant observation, in-depth interviews
and a survey of a sample of Centers, the student will study how "cultural
nationalism" is influenced by these public institutions. This project is
important because it will help explain how local ethnic communities develop
feelings of "cultural nationalism" in contrast to a larger, dominant group.
Understanding how claims for legitimacy and resources arise among ethnic groups
is important to help society react to such claims fairly. In addition,
dissertation research projects increase the scientific capacity of the nation,
and this particular project will help train a minority scientist and so will add
to the base of minority scientists in the U.S. ***
