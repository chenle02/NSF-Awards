Planning, Execution, and Learning in Autonomous Robotic Agents Autonomous
robotic agents need the ability to plan for and achieve high-level tasks.
Current agents can achieve low-level execution goals such as object avoidance,
but lack the ability to reason about and to carry out multiple interacting
tasks. Integrating planning and execution by a robot is a complex task,
requiring learning from prior experience to improve significantly the overall
capabilities of the intelligent agent. We will explore the integration of
planning, execution, and learning, where the robot's successes and failures are
incorporated into a knowledge base to improve future goal-achievement
performance. This project entails the investigation of a variety of system and
knowledge engineering issues, including: communication between the planner and
the executor; interaction between the robotic agent, the planning system, and
the human user who may, at any time, request that certain tasks be performed;
and gathering and interpretation of information to learn from experience. The
scientific goal underlying this research is to understand the use of past
experience to solve problems in complex situations affected by multiple factors
with different degrees of controllability and interdependency. Even partial
achievement of this goal could be of great significance to both the robotics and
cognitive science or artificial intelligence research communities, bridging the
representation and reasoning gap between high level planner-learner and
autonomous agent executing tasks in the real world
