In this project supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic
Chemistry Program, Joseph M. O'Connor of the University of Nevada at Reno will
continue studies in the area of organometallic research at the interface of
metallacycle and carbene chemistry. The goal of the research is development of
new carbene coupling reactions which produce ring-expanded metallacycles of
iridum, rhodium, or cobalt and ultimately four- and five-membered carbocycles.
Free carbene-carbene products may also be generated. In addition to the
synthetic work, structural and mechanistic studies will be carried out in order
to clarify the effect of coordination geometry, ancillary ligands, and ring
substituents on the insertion process. %%% This research directly impinges on
the role of metal carbenes in alkene metathesis, alkene and alkyne
polymerization, cyclopropanation chemistry and an impressive array of synthetic
organic methodology.
