While much significant work has taken place in safe monitoring of non-real-
time, conventional programs, very little has in fact been done for real-time
programs, and especially for real-time programs that implement complex safety-
critical functions and operate in distributed and parallel environments. In this
project standard compiler static analyses and prior analysis and transformation
results for reducing complexity in real-time programs are combined to support
safe and non-intrusive monitoring of complex real-time programs. Existing
transformations frequently result in idling and delaying non-functional code
that is introduced to provide time- preserving balance across alternate branches
of a conditional or alternate combinations of resource requests. These segments
of nonfunctional code can be used to insert non-intrusive software hooks to
monitor real-time execution. The project seeks new ideas and prototyped
techniques in the areas of verification, simulation, monitoring and debugging -
both static and dynamic. The primary focus is techniques for safe and non-
intrusive monitoring of complex real-time programs. Collaborative research
involving industrial partners is pursued to validate and transfer these results.
