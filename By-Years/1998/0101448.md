This award will support preparing, carrying out, and analyzing a series of
measurements of electromagnetic structure of matter by the University of
Massachusetts Group, primarily at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC)
and for conducting a program of graduate and undergraduate education in
experimental high energy nuclear physics. This work has as a common thread the
use of high energy (sometimes polarized) electrons and gamma rays to probe
matter. A major area of work will be the data runs, analysis, and publications
for SLAC Experiment E158 that will use the SLAC high intensity polarized
electron beam and a new dedicated spectrometer and detector system to measure
parity violating asymmetry in electron-electron scattering. This high precision
data will provide important tests of the Standard Model of matter at low
momentum transfer in the electromagnetic coupling via the interference between
exchange of virtual photons and Z bosons. The UMass Group has contributed to the
design of the spectrometer and beamline instrumentation, to the calibration
systems, and to implementation of the data acquisition system. The UMass Group
is taking a leading role in developing a new high intensity, high energy quasi-
monoenergic polarized photon beam facility to be build at SLAC for a program of
experiments: 1) to measure the high energy contribution to the Gerasimov-Drell-
Hearn sum rule 2) to measure the nuclear dependence of the photoproduction of
charmed mesons and 3) to measure the gluon spin distribution using polarized
photoproduction of charmed mesons.
