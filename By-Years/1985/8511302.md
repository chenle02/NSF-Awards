A three-day symposium on Factory Automation and Robotics will be conducted at
New York University in September 1985. The invited spokesmen represent research
interests connected with parts handling, computer vision, assembly, locomotion,
and robotic software. The aim of the symposium is twofold: familiarize the
theoretical and experimental computer science communities with robotics as an
important area for future computer science research and provide a forum in which
industrial and academic engineers and scientists in robotics interact with
scientists in computer and related sciences. Problems posed by industrial
applications will provide fertilization across disciplinary boundaries. An
audience of 200-300 applied mathematicians, engineers, and computer scientists
is sought.
