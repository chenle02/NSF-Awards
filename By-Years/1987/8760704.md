This SBIR Phase I Award emphasizes research on the melting behavior of fused
cristobalite using high-temperature differential thermal analysis and Raman
spectroscopy. The purpose of the research program is to enhance understanding of
processing of fused cristobalite and to improve production processes for this
material. This new material has a higher melting temperature,higher hardness,
higher index of refraction, and extended range of transparency in the infrared
region of the spectrum than commercially available fused silica. The material
can be used for optical windows, mirror substrates, ultraviolet flashlamp
envelopes, optical waveguide in the infrared. Its resistance to radiation damage
makes it a candidate for optical applications in outer space and nuclear
reactors.
