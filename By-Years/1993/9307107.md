9307107 Frost The focus of this research will be the synthesis of indigo and
adipic acid using Escerichia coli as catalysts and D-glucose as starting
material. The steps proposed for the biocatalytic syntheses are carried out in
water at temperatures not to exceed 37 degrees Centigrade. No greenhouse or
ozone-depleting gases will be generated in contrast to currently used
methodology. %%% With this Environmentally Benign Chemical Synthesis and
Processing award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of
Dr. John W. Frost of the Department of Chemistry at Purdue University. Professor
Frost will focus his work on the synthesis of indigo and adipic acid by using
biocatalysts to eliminate materials derived from fossil fuels, toxins and
elevated reaction temperatures from the synthetic scheme. ***
