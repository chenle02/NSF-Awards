Criminal investigations by law enforcement provide a critical aspect of the
criminal justice process. Some investigations occur under the media spotlight,
as high profile cases have the potential to exert public pressure on law
enforcement as they conduct those investigations. While some high profile cases
result in wrongful convictions, there is little scientific confirmation that
wrongful convictions are more, or less, prevalent in high profile cases. This
project will examine criminal investigations in the context of high profile
cases, to determine whether a relationship exists between high profile crimes
and wrongful convictions.

The project employs an experimental approach to examine how the psychological
theory of confirmation bias comes into play in criminal investigations that take
place under high media attention. It does so by analyzing whether confirmation
bias is exacerbated in high profile criminal cases. Confirmation bias occurs
when individuals subjectively interpret information in order to confirm their
preexisting beliefs, often while ignoring, discrediting, or reinterpreting
inconsistent information. High profile cases, where the media and the public
exert pressure on the police to make an arrest, could have an effect on
investigators' confirmation bias, which may further influence the possibility of
a wrongful conviction when an innocent person is identified as the suspect. The
experiments in this study will evaluate relations between confirmation bias,
high profile cases, and wrongful convictions; as well, the project will
investigate the influence of potential debiasing strategies. In this way, the
project will examine confirmation bias in an investigative context, focusing on
the role of high profile cases and innocence, as well as strategies to
ameliorate confirmation bias.
