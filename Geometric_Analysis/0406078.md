Abstract

Award: DMS-0406078 Principal Investigator: Bennett Chow, Peter Li, Zhiqin Lu,
Lei Ni

This award provides partial support for three years of meetings of the Southern
California Geometric Analysis Seminar, a series that is organized by UC San
Diego and UC Irvine and brings together researchers in geometric analysis and
related topics from those campuses, Caltech, UCLA, UC Riverside, UC Santa
Barbara, USC, and other schools in the region. The organizers place a priority
on the participation of graduate students and recent PhDs, especially members of
underrepresented groups. The Seminar meetings are the unique annual meeting of
their kind in the Southern California area, and this conference series has a
valuable history of building connections between mathematicians in the region.
