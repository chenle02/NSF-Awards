Exploratory drilling for oil, gas, mineral, or geothermal energy resources, as
well as drilling for purely scientific purposes, often involves bore hole
temperatures in excess of150C. High temperature conditions prevent current
nuclear measurement tools from being used for bore hole logging of important
variables such as density (via gamma ray backscattering measurements) or
chemical composition (via neutron activation techniques). Nuclear detectors in
use today for these applications must be cooled, but the bore hole dimensions do
not allow for the bulky cooling apparatus that would be needed to maintain the
system at working temperatures for a practical period of time. This project is
an investigation of the properties of zinc telluride (ZnTe), a high atomic
number, high density candidate solid state nuclear detector theoretically
capable of operating efficiently at 200C or higher. The initial investigation of
ZnTe properties is a Phase I project under the program for Small Business
Innovation Research. Successful completion of this phase is expected to lead to
the development of a high.temperature sensor system for drill hole logging that
would have important scientific as well as commercial benefits.
