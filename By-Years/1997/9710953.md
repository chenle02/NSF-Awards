ABSTRACT: CMS-9710953, Ronald Harichandran, Michigan State U. Observations from
closely-spaced seismograph arrays since the late 1970's have shown that
earthquake ground accelerograms measured at different locations within the
dimensions of typical large engineered structures are significantly different.
This has resulted in considerable attention being given to the modeling of
spatially varying earthquake ground motions, and on determining its effect on
the seismic response of large structures such as bridges, pipelines, and dams.
Studies on various structural systems have shown that including the effect of
spatially varying earthquake ground motions often increases critical responses,
and hence large structures designed without consideration for this phenomenon
may be unsafe. A key component in the characterization of spatially varying
earthquake ground motions is the coherency function, which describes the
incoherence between accelerations recorded at different spatial locations.
Different functional forms have been proposed by different investigators for
coherency functions, but studies on how these different forms affect the
computed responses have been few. Also, since the low- frequency variation of
coherency is significantly different among some of the commonly used models, it
is critical to resolve contradictions and provide guidance to engineers. The
objective of this research program is to use the high- resolution maximum
entropy spectral estimation method and long-duration accelerogram records to
resolve these contradictions, using records from the Valley of Mexico, the
SMART-1 array in Taiwan, the Chiba array in Japan, and the Northridge earthquake
in the U. S. This project is a cooperative research program with the Universidad
Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), involving a joint collaboration between a U.
S. engineer, a Mexican engineer, and a Mexican seismologist.
