The project focuses on further development of new and constructive techniques
for proving existence of solutions to nonlinear partial differential equations,
with special emphasis on the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes system, and
determining their global and asymptotic properties. The methods are based on
recent advances in Borel-Laplace regularization and summability.

Nonlinear partial differential equations are essential modeling tools in a wide
range of problems in physics, chemistry, biology and other sciences.
Understanding their solutions is a key tool in interpreting and predicting
physical phenomena. The project develops a new approach and methods for this
scientific enterprise.
