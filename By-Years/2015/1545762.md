This award uses funds, under the auspices of the EArly-concept Grants for
Exploratory Research (EAGER) program, for a project aimed at making paleoclimate
data more accessible to the wider science community and the interested public.

The project will help the NSF coordinate and cooperate with the NOAA World Data
Center for Paleoclimatology (WDC-Paleo) in Boulder Colorado in an effort to
create standards for describing variables in paleoclimate datasets and to use
these standards to normalize variables in the WDC-Paleo archive. Such variables
include depth, age, and proxy measurements used to infer past climate.

To accomplish these goals, the researcher will draw upon the expertise of data
generators and data scientists and will generate the first set of extensible
controlled vocabularies that are consistent across multiple proxy types and that
have the level of detail necessary to support data intensive science.

The planned activities fit well into the potentially transformative, high risk,
and exploratory nature of the EAGER programs because it is an untested path
forward for the paleoclimatology community. Past related efforts were limited to
sub-disciplines within paleoclimatology and, more importantly, not focused on
creating vocabularies that are complete enough and precise enough to facilitate
the sorts of data compilations that are now beginning to drive the field of
paleoclimatology forward. This project is also inherently interdisciplinary, as
it relies heavily on input from both the paleoclimate and the informatics
communities.

If successful, this project will have a large impact on the field of
paleoclimatology by facilitating data-intensive analyses using large numbers of
proxy datasets in new and transformative ways within the discipline and through
collaboration with other disciplines.

Furthermore, such an activity aids the NSF in complying with its federal
requirements to aid access of scientific data from publicly-funded research by
the wider science community and the interested public.
