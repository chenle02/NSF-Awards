This project continues a systematic analysis of the role of real, financial and
monetary markets in a decentralized economy. The object is to analyze the
intertemporal allocation of resources achieved by a system of spot markets,
financial markets and a banking system and to model the activities of the
government in the private sector of the economy. The long-run objective is to
provide a rigorous foundation for modern macroeconomics and hence to provide a
solid basis for understanding government monetary and fiscal policy. This is an
exciting project because it tackles fundamental and extremely difficult problems
in economic theory. General equilibrium analysis uses the classic Arrow-Debreu
framework with complete contingent markets. The contribution of this project
comes from developing a more general model with real and financial markets in
which the structure of markets is incomplete. The degree of incompleteness is
not assumed, as it has been in past work, but determined as part of the
equilibrium.
