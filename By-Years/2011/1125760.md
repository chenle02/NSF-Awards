This Broadening Participation Research Initiation Grants in Engineering (BRIGE)
grant provides funding to understand the mechanism of DNA motors dictating their
moving polarity. DNA motors are molecular machines that move DNA in living cells
to accomplish numerous essential tasks. Despite their enormous significance, our
understanding of their mechanics that drives the motion of DNA is limited.
Specifically, it remains largely elusive how a DNA motor maintains specific
polarity with high fidelity when moving DNA strands, either from the 3' to the
5' end of a DNA strand for a 3'-5' motor, or the opposite for a 5'-3' motor.
Surprisingly, the structures of a 3'-5' motor and a 5'-3' motor are similar,
further challenging the mechanical studies of these motors to explain their
distinct polarities. This project aims to study the mechanics of both 3'-5' and
5'-3' DNA motors to achieve the following two research goals: (1) Determine the
force transduction of 3'-5' and 5'-3' DNA motors, and (2) Determine structural
effects on the deformation of 3'-5' and 5'-3' DNA motors.

The mechanical studies of DNA motors will enable us to better understand the
design principles of DNA motors, facilitating the future design of DNA motors
with specified polarity. The results of the study will open doors to new
applications such as motor-guided DNA sequencing, motor-delivered gene drugs,
and motor-folded 3D DNA scaffolds for nanobiotechnology applications. In terms
of education goals, this research will be highly interdisciplinary that requires
knowledge in multiple areas, so it will advance the next-generation engineers in
integrating knowledge learned from engineering and biological disciplines. This
project will specifically emphasize the broadening of participation of
underrepresented groups by providing research and lecture opportunities for
minority high-school students.
