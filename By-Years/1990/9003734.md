In previous research it was established that non-living algal biomass
immobilized in polymer beads effectively absorbs or binds a number of toxic
metal ions from polluted process effluents. It is proposed to continue this
investigation by: 1) continuing, the screening of algal genera or species for
metal ion removal and recovery potential; 2) secondarily, extending the
screening for metal ion binding to other cells, particularly, higher plant
cells; and 3) extending primary efforts to identify the specific functional
groups on the algal cell walls that permit metal ion binding. New investigation
results will provide valuable insight into the application of algal polymers to
the removal and the recovery of particular toxic, precious, and strategic metal
ions from polluted-, geothermal-, and mining-water, and from industrial process
streams.
