A major purpose for the philosophy of science is to explain, and hence to
justify, what science is and why its theories should be accepted as true.
Another aim of philosophy of science was to prescribe what "good" science is.
Contemporary philosophy of science, however, has largely abandoned this
prescriptive task and has instead concentrated on a descriptive mode of
operation. This role is not an unimportant one. In an age of skepticism about
science and acceptance of mystical and occult sources of knowledge it is
important that the basis of scientific truth be fully understood. Dr. Oberdan is
examining one of the founders of modern philosophy of science, Moritz Schlick,
the leader of the Vienna Circle of Logical Positivists. Dr. Oberdan aims to
provide a biographical as well as intellectual background to Schlick's work.
Under this grant, he is examining Schlick's early life and career, especially
the development of his philosophical views of relativity theory and the initial
stage of his Positivist thought. The importance of this study is directly
related to two central issues in the philosophy of science: the nature of
causality and the positivism- realism dispute. Given the rise of quantum theory
with its probabilistic foundations, uncertainty principle, and wave/particle
duality, the questions of causality and the "real" existence of theoretical
entities have become even more contentious in contemporary physics. The
positions that Schlick offered are important for our understanding of how
philosophy and science have addressed these questions. Dr. Oberdan's study
promises to make significant contributions to our understanding of the
foundations of these debates.
