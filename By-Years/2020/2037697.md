This project will focus on the creation of an integrated gas- and particle-phase
chemical mechanism that incorporates the latest knowledge of gas-phase
reactions, secondary organic aerosol (SOA) precursors, and the influence of
gas/particle phase state on acid-catalyzed multiphase chemistry. The mechanism
will be implemented in both regional and global scale models and is expected to
improve the predictions of SOA from isoprene. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
objectives of this project are to: (1) develop and evaluate a semi-explicit gas-
phase chemical mechanism that includes isoprene oxidation and SOA precursor
formation; (2) develop a multiphase chemical mechanism for isoprene-derived SOA,
integrated with the gas-phase chemical mechanism; and (3) implement the new
integrated mechanism in an air quality model for evaluation and sensitivity
analysis relative to commonly used mechanisms. The project includes plans for
undergraduate first-generation college students from the Lookout Scholars
Program at the University of North Carolina to participate in air quality
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
