A computer laboratory for experimental psychology is being developed in which
students enrolled in Experimental Psychology engage in the following sequential
steps: 1. the student serves as a subject in several classical studies in
psychophysics, learning and cognition; 2. the student develops and programs
variations of these studies; 3. the student reviews the literature in an area of
interest and develops and programs an original experiment; 4. the student
collects and analyzes data and interprets findings in journal-style papers; and
5. the student is encouraged to report his or her findings at regional or
national conferences in experimental psychology. The impact of this laboratory
will be felt by all students who take psychology courses, especially those in
Experimental Psychology, Cognitive Psychology, and Research Methods in the
Behavioral Sciences. The college will contribute an amount equal to the award.
