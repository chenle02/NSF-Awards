This is a project to determine the chemical and morphological characteristics
of individual particles from tropospheric aerosols of remote areas in the Artic,
North Atlantic, and Equatorial Pacific. Such particles in the planetary boundary
layer and mid-troposphere are important because of their impact on the solar
radiation balance, climate stability, and the global dispersion of natural and
pollutant material. Analyses will be performed with automated electron- beam
instruments. Methods developed over the past decade allow one to study large
numbers of particles and to determine particle types, concentrations, and size
distributions. The resulting data will be used to address current issues in
atmospheric aerosol research. To be investigated are: (a) generation,
fractionation, and reactions of marine aerosol particles; (b) production of
natural, non-sea-salt sulfate particles; and (c) sources, transport, and fates
of other particle types, both natural and anthropogenic. Automated particle
analysis will be performed using a scanning electron microscope and an electron
microprobe. As a secondary task, the structure and composition of complex
submicron particles will be investigated at high spatial resolutions using
transmission electron microscopy, both by imaging and by chemical analysis. The
proposed studies, taken together, will provide fine-scale data about the
chemical compositions, morphologies, and internal structures of a wide variety
of individual particles. These data, in turn, will provide important insights
into aerosol particle origins, chemical reactions, dispersion, and ultimate
fates. //
