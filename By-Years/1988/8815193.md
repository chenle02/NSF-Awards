The study of El Nino climate changes is hampered by our short historical record
of their occurrence. Fortunately the changes in ocean chemistry and temperature
that are produced by El Nino are recorded in the chemistry of living corals. And
since corals secrete annual growth bands, the record of their changing chemistry
can provide us with the means to reconstruct the history of El Nino occurrence
back through the life span of coral (up to about 300 years). The goal of this
research program is to reconstruct this paleoclimate history from banded corals
in the western Pacific (Tarawa Is.) and eastern Pacific (Galapagos Is.). The
project involves field programs to each island to sample the coral, followed by
laboratory analyses of the trace element and stable isotopic chemistry of the
coral growth bands. This study will contribute to our understanding of the
history, frequency of occurrence, and climatic significance of El Nino
phenomena.
