9722790 Price The goal of this project is to develop a vertebrate cell culture
system for making targeted disruptions of telomere protein genes. This culture
system will allow researchers to explore the role different telomere proteins
play in telomere function. Vertebrate telomeres are large nucleoprotein
complexes and these complexes are expected to be comprised of many different
proteins. Targeted disruptions of the TRF1 gene, the gene encoding the first
vertebrate telomere protein identified, will be made and the null phenotype
analyzed. A chicken B-cell line that has an unusually high frequency of
homologous recombination will be used. Mutant versions of the TRF1 gene will be
used to complement the null phenotype in order to dissect and understand the
function of the protein. This Career Advancement Award to Dr. Carolyn Price will
allow her to gain the technical expertise and the in-depth knowledge necessary
for a study of vertebrate telomere function. This sabbatical experience will
allow her to switch her research program in her own laboratory from
investigations into the function of telomeres in ciliated protozoa to similar
studies in vertebrates.
