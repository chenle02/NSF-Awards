9523044 Bigio This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry project
will provide the analysis and modeling support to design an innovative new
injection molding machine. Conceptual design and theoretical analysis indicate
that it is possible to eliminate a step in going from several virgin homopolymer
stock to a final molded product made from a blended polymer. The current
practice is to use extrusion to blend several polymers in an intermediate step,
and the extruded blend is used for feed stock for an injection molding machine.
There is often waste at this intermediate step. The proposed approach will do
the blending and mixing on the injection molding machine, using a single stage
non-intermeshing twin screw injection molding machine. The twin screw is the
innovation, because while one of the screws rotates, it moves axially relative
to the other. This makes it possible to close the control loop to maintain both
blend and molding outputs. A prototype machine will be designed and built by
Engel Injection Molding Machine Company, the University of Maryland's industrial
partner. Modeling and experimentation will be used to determine the operating
protocol for the multivariate problem of controlling blending and molding with
the new twin screw design. A factorial designed experiment using this novel
machine concept will be used to evaluate the functional performance of glass
fiber blended with polypropylene and nylon. The impact of this project is
elimination of a processing step and the attendant recycle stream, and the real
time control of the blended stock and the molded product at the molding machine.
With better local blend control, more recycled stock can be used in molded
products.
