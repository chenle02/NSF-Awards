0123281 Marinas The objective of the proposed research is to develop a
fundamental understanding of the pore blockage and solute displacement
mechanisms of competitive adsorption of trace organic compounds on powdered
activated carbon (PAC). This information will be used to develop equations for
these effects that will be incorporated into mathematical models of hybrid
sorption-membrane processes. Adsorption studies will be conducted using model
compounds or probes, as well as with natural organic matter (NOM). The
competitive effects in porous adsorbents will be modeled for the PAC/membrane
system using the probe data first. After the model has been verified using
probes, the general form of the model will be tested for applicability to
NOM/trace compound competitive adsorption. The results of this research could be
used to develop recommendations for the optimum design and operation of full-
scale hybrid sorption-membrane processes for the removal of trace organic
compounds from water. ***
