Winslett&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Automated trust negotiation (ATN) is a new
approach to access control and authentication for the open, flexible systems
formed by sets of organizations that must dynamically form coalitions and work
together to respond to unforeseen needs and opportunities. ATN enables open
computing by assigning an access control policy to each resource that is to be
made accessible to "outsiders"; an attempt to access the resource triggers a
trust negotiation, consisting of the iterative, bilateral disclosure of digital
credentials and related information. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
show that ATN is a practical solution to the access control and authentication
problems of open computing systems, by resolving the most critical remaining
theoretical and systems issues for the deployment of trust negotiation
facilities. Specific areas that the project will address include access control
policy languages for ATN, light-weight policy evaluation engines, improved ATN
protocols and strategies compatible with the new languages, provable privacy and
autonomy guarantees for negotiating parties, and a next-generation version of
the TrustBuilder ATN prototype, demonstrating the deployment of ATN in a
modular, reusable, and highly scalable implementation. These enhancements will
be explored in the context of health care applications and additional scenarios
supplied by the project partners.&lt;br/&gt;
