Three one-month time series of detailed profiles of temperature, salinity and
currents will be collected in the upper 300 m of the Western Pacific Warm Pool
as part of the Intensive Observation Period (IOP) of the Tropical Ocean Global
Atmosphere Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE) taking
place in late 1992- early 1993. Supporting measurements of rainfall, solar
radiation, surface wind, air temperature, as well as light attenuation and in-
situ fluorescence will be conducted to estimate the heat and momentum fluxes
through the mixed layer in response to westerly wind bursts and rain squalls.
