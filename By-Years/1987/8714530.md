This proposal defines a program of research, experimentation, technology
development, and demonstrations leading to the creation of a national scale data
communications network with transmission speeds in excess of a gigabit per
second (1 Gb/s). Specific products of the overall project are the development
and demonstration of long-haul networking at speeds greater than 100 megabits
per second, and specification of the additional architectural development
including protocols, switching fabrics, and fiber-optic transmission facilities
for the gigabit network. This proposal may be thought of as the first phase of a
multi-phase plan extending over several years. During this first phase the
Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI) will issue a call for white
papers, evaluate the responses, hold numerous working group meetings, and
working with the subcontractors develop/select an architectural approach for a
very high speed network. The approach involves CNRI coordinating the efforts of
industrial and academic participants, with very substantial cost-sharing by the
private sector. At the end of this phase a detailed proposal will be produced
along with a set of specific subcontrator tasks to be accomplished.
