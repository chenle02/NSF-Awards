Healthcare resources can be described either in terms of money, or in terms of
health outcomes. Yet, past research suggests that people tend to use principles
consistent with market norms (e.g., efficiency) to allocate money, but are
reluctant to do so for "sacred values" such as health and lives. This research
examines how people's allocation preference for healthcare resources can shift,
depending on whether allocation policies are framed in terms of financial cost
or health outcomes. It also explores whether people apply different allocation
strategies to different types of healthcare resources based on how scarce they
perceive the particular resource to be. The United States faces an eminent need
to curb healthcare spending. However, there is no obvious consensus among
members of the public on how to allocate the limited healthcare resources, nor
is there agreement about how to balance efficiency versus equality in such
allocations. The proposed research untangles public opinions on healthcare
allocation by examining the influence of policy framing and perceived scarcity.
This research studies large scale national probaility samples of American adults
and will provide rich data on public opinions for a critical health policy
issue; the distribution of limited healthcare resources. It will also provide
guidance to policymakers for how to design different allocation policies for
different healthcare resources, as well as how to frame allocation policies to
gain the most public support for proposed policies.
