This project will deploy the upgraded Aerospace CCD camera at the University of
Illinois to make measurements of the temperature and intensity of the OH Meinel
(6,2) band and O2 Atmospheric (0,1) emissions. Concurrently, the University of
Western Ontario Fourier Tranform spectrometer will make the same measurements.
This data will then be used to cross-calibrate the various measurement
techniques. Further, the Aerospace CCD camera will explore the effects of
gravity waves on the upper mesosphere over Maui, Hawaii, and make more
measurements during the ALOHA-93 campaign in the fall of 1993.
