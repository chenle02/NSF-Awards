This project aims at completing a biological inventory of the nearly 10,000
species of plants that inhabit the Amazonian forests and Guayana Highlands in
Southern Venezuela. The results will be published in an 8-volume illustrated
Flora, the first ever produced for this region. Records of the species and their
distributions will be kept in an expandable computer database. Volume 1, the
introduction to the series, will provide interpretative and supporting data for
the succeeding taxonomic volumes, including large scale vegetation and
topographic maps, geographical details of the flora region, and analyses of the
vegetation types and species found int he area. This volume will be produced in
both English and Spanish editions, while the others will appear in English. The
information obtained from the Flora will be used as the foundation to produce a
catalog of all of Venezuela's plants, now estimated at 15,000 species and
representing one of the world's richest areas of biodiversity.
