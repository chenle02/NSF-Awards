9419323 Mahoney This is an integrated bathymetric, geophysical, and
petrological/geochemical study of the Southeast Indian Ridge. The project will
focus on evaluating the effects of mantle temperature variations on mid-ocean
ridge processes, at constant spreading rate and on furthering understanding of
the nature and origin of the complex Indian Ocean mantle. ***
