SBR-9508433 Carl S. Zimmerer Christian Brannstrom University of Wisconsin -
Madison Dissertation Improvement Research: Environmental Degradation and
Agricultural Change in Western Sao Paulo, Brazil,1900-1980 The objective of this
dissertation improvement research is to understand changes in human -environment
interactions from local and regional spatial scales. This will be accomplished
throughthe study of recent changes in specific watersheds to explain how
settlers and small-holders created, perceived, and reacted to changing soil
resources. Local processes will be related to broader changes in Sao Paulo and
Brazil s political economy. Environmental analysis and empirical historical
research will be conducted to determine the social consequences of soil
degradation. Soil and fluvial sediment samples will be taken from different
landscape positions to determine post-settlement soil loss and sediment
accumulation. Historical documents will be used to reconstruct patterns of land
use and land tenure in the area, and collected oral narratives will help to
understand human perceptions of enviro nmental and social changes. The research
will contribute to understanding the social implications of human-induced
environmental degradation
