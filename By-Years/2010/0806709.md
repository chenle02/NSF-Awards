To address the under-representation of minorities, women, and first-generation
college students in the computing disciplines, an existing partnership with
Focus: HOPE currently offers a coordinated program which supports disadvantaged
students at critical junctures from a GED through the completion of a post-
secondary degree. This S-STEM project provides scholarships to financially needy
students in the partnership. Seven students receive scholarships during the
first year, increasing to 20 students during the fourth year. The existing
support program begins with multiple proven bridge activities. These activities
include a remedial math and writing program, programming using Alice,
professional development workshops, participation in a community food bank, and
an on-site child-care program. The second phase of the program combines a
Bachelor of Arts in Information Systems and Technology with tutoring programs,
culturally sensitive advising, emerging scholars sections of introductory
programming courses, social networking, and participation in industry
internships and academic research. The third component of the program is a
coordinated, scoped and sequenced experiential learning program in which the
students participate in paid co-op positions with local industries.
