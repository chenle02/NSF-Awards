This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will assist the
Department of Chemistry at Northwestern University in the purchase of an upgrade
for a 400 MHz, multinuclear, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. This
upgrade will enhance greatly research in a number of areas including the
following: 1) Early transition and f-element based homogeneous catalysis, 2)
Silicon and tin chemistry, 3) High field NMR in cluster chemistry and solid
electrolytes, 4) Transition metal complexes with redox-active hemilabile
ligands, 5) Chemistry of soluble metal selenides and tellurides, 6) Bioinorganic
chemistry, 7) group IV reagents in organic synthesis. Tin-119 NMR studies. 8)
Mechanism studies of enzymes and enzyme inactivators, 9) Donor-spacer-acceptor
complexes and functionalized quantum-confined semiconducting particles. %%% A
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer is used to obtain information
about molecular structure (what types of carbon and/or hydrogen atoms and/or
hetero-atoms are present, what are the relative number of each type of atoms and
how are they connected to one another in the molecule) and molecular dynamics
(how rapidly are the various parts of the molecule moving). This instrument is
essential for any meaningful, modern synthetic chemistry research program.
