It is widely acknowledged that the physical universe is unpredictable. In
computer science this unpredictability, modeled as access to randomness, turns
out to be an enabling feature in algorithm design, cryptography and distributed
computing. For example, known methods of encrypting sensitive information for
transmission over the internet rely crucially on the ability of computers to
generate random sequences, and many fast algorithms are randomized algorithms.
So it is worthwhile to investigate exactly what can be done with and without
randomness, and to identify the minimal assumptions on the randomness under
which we can still get the benefits of randomized methods. This is the central
question of the area of derandomization: To what extent can we do without the
use of randomness in computation?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, PI will
investigate basic questions related to the theme of derandomization towards the
goals of showing that (1) every randomized polynomial time algorithm can be
simulated by a deterministic algorithm, that (2) every randomized algorithm with
small memory can be simulated by a deterministic algorithm using small memory,
and that (3) cryptography can be achieved even with defective sources of
randomness. Besides being involved in graduate and undergraduate teaching around
the subject of the proposal, the PI will organize reading groups, participate in
efforts to recruit from underrepresented groups, and be involved in projects to
increase graduate recruiting at education at the high school level.
