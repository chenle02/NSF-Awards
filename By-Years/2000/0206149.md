AST-0206149&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Elitzur&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
will continue a broad, ongoing program of theoretical studies of astronomical
masers. Recent maser interferometric observations reveal in unprecedented detail
the structure of various astronomical environments. Seizing the opportunities
created by this progress, the topics targeted for research include (1)
protostellar disks and outflows in high-mass star formation, as probed by water,
SiO and methanol masers; (2) the circumstellar shells of evolved stars, traced
by a variety of maser and thermal&lt;br/&gt;species; (3) the x-ray and shock
impact of supernova remnants on their environment,&lt;br/&gt;deduced from OH
masers; and (4) structure at the parsec and sub-parsec scales at the centers of
starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei as revealed by their OH and H2O
mega-maser emission. In each case, a major ingredient of the theoretical
research is the close collaboration with the teams conducting pertinent
observations.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
