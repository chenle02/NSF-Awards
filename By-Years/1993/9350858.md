This updated course emphasizes tissue culture methods, in situ hybridization and
use of antibodies and fluorescent markers for the identification and
quantitation of ions, cytoskeletal components (microtubules, intermediate
filaments and microfilaments) and quantitative methods using computers for
morphometric measurements. In laboratory exercises the students develop computer
microanalysis strategies using enzyme markers to study various tissues (kidney
and liver) in normal and drug- treated mice. The same studies are duplicated in
vitro using isolated kidney tubule cells for comparison. Each student writes a
report and present it to the class for discussion. Extensive use of micrographs
from the latest research papers are made with the help of ScanJet IIc and the
computer interface.
