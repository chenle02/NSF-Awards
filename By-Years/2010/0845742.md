This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). The research objective of this Faculty Early Career
Development (CAREER) project is to establish a rigorous theoretical and
experimental foundation for tracking single nanometer-scale particles and for
tracking multiple particles simultaneously. Measurement of nanometer-scale
particles often relies on a point-like sensor such as the focal point of a
confocal microscope, the tip of a magnetic force microscope, or the probe of a
near-field scanning optical microscope. The research approach centers on a
nonlinear tracking control law and proceeds from analysis and design of the law
to implementation on a scanning confocal microscope and experimental study of
the approach using freely diffusing fluorescent
nanoparticles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research
will enable the study of a wealth of dynamic phenomena in nanometer-scale
systems, thereby facilitating advances in a wide variety of fields, including
molecular biology, medicine, and neurobiology. An example application is the
study of the dynamics of ribonucleic acid (RNA) during the transcription process
in bacterial cells. A deeper understanding of this process has important
practical applications for the development of diagnostic and treatment options
for diseases caused by bacterial infections such as dysentery, cholera, and
tuberculosis. The project will involve undergraduate and graduate students in
interdisciplinary research, ranging from the rigorous mathematics of systems and
control theory to imaging and detection methods in molecular biology. Pre-
university students in grades 10-12 will be engaged through nanotechnology-based
science modules motivated by the project research and developed in collaboration
with high school teachers.
