The proposed work will continue a long-term project studying a number of aspects
of reproductive life histories of long-lived birds. Nineteen years of leg
banding and (under LTREB support) 10 years of intensive monitoring have produced
a substantial scientific resource in terms of a database of individual histories
of known birds, and an extensive age structure. Funding is requested capitalize
on this resource by conducting studies of newly discovered connections between
breeding ecology in our focal population and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation; an
integrative and comprehensive study of the causes and consequences of bias
hatching rates, including investigation of causation of unexpectedly high rates
of unusual behavior; and a longitudinal study of aging and immune function in
our population of several thousand known-age birds. The project has a record of
demonstrated scientific productivity, conservation impacts, and extensive
training of new scientists, and this record will be continued under further
LTREB support.
