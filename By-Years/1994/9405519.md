9405519 Thurber This research involves the analysis, by means of tomographic
inversion methods, active-source seismic data collected in 1994 by the
separately-funded Los Angeles Region Seismic Experiment (LARSE). The goal of
LARSE is to improve the understanding of velocity heterogeneities and geologic
structure associated with faulting in the Los Angeles region. The goals of this
analysis are 1) the determination of P and S velocity structure to a depth of 15
km or deeper beneath the high-resolution segment of LARSE, 2) location of faults
as identified by velocity discontinuities, low velocity zones and delineation of
fault geometry to typical hypocentral depths. This research is a component of
the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
