This award provides support for construction of housing and docks at two remote
field stations that are part of a group of stations operated by the Fisheries
Research Institute of the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences, University of
Washington. The stations are located on two nearly pristine lake systems within
or adjacent to parks and preserves; their use has helped provide information on
the carrying capacities of salmon spawning and rearing environments and
interactions between salmon and other aquatic species. Research at these field
stations has expanded in the last decade beyond the historical focus on sockeye
salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) to include a range of new topics including cycling
of marine-derived nutrients from salmon carcasses into aquatic and terrestrial
ecosystems, behavioral and evolutionary ecology, and effects of climate change
on aquatic ecosystems. As part of the research, long-term datasets have been
maintained for juvenile and adult fishes, zooplankton, phytoplankton,
temperature and other biological and environmental variables, some for over 50
years. An intensive field course for undergraduate students that covers the
methods and principles of aquatic ecology is taught each summer.&lt;br/&gt;The
support is intended to improve the infrastructure of these field stations so
that their teaching and research missions can be expanded. In conjunction with
funds from the University of Washington, the funds will support construction of
a multipurpose laboratory/classroom/dormitory facility at the Porcupine Island
station as well as new docks at both Porcupine Island and the Aleknagik station.
These improvements will permit the stations to accommodate a larger number of
visiting scientists and students, provide space specifically designed for
teaching, and improve safety by separating laboratories from sleeping quarters.
