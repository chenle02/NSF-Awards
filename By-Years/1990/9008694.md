In the context of a very large knowledge base which consists of rules and the
extensional database of facts, the major problem is how to process the
relational operations on the extensional database in the minimum amount of time
to satisfy the user queries. To speed up the relational operations on very large
knowledge bases, parallel processing is essential. But most of the previous
index schemes and file structures were designed for sequential processing
environment, so they can not be easily mapped to parallel processing systems.
One reasonable indexing scheme for parallel processing systems is the
concatenated code word (CCW) surrogate file which has small size and simple
maintenance requirement. The CCW surrogate file can be used to index the rules
as well as facts, and relational operations can be directly performed on the CCW
surrogate files. CCW surrogate files can be mapped well into the parallel
architectures because their structure is quite compact and regular. The main
goal of this research work is to develop optimal clustered CCW surrogate file
and data file structures suitable for parallel processing systems. Parallel
relational operation algorithms based on the clustered file structures that are
designed in this project will be evaluated and their performance compared with
other knowledge base management systems. The efficient index and file structures
developed for very large knowledge bases support parallel relational operations
used in logical inference mechanisms, thus making these systems more effective.
