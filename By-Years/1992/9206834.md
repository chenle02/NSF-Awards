Deposit feeding is important in gating the transfer or burial of all particles
that arrive at the seafloor, with implications ranging from flow through trophic
webs to resolution of the stratigraphic record. The resources that fuel deposit
feeding, however, remain poorly identified-with a few notable exceptions. By
chemical examination and biological experimentation that isolate the processes
of food detection and digestion this project will attempt to generalize the
approach used to create a pair of those exceptions. This project will be guided
by theory that predicts maximization of net absorption rate as material transits
the gut of an organism. The focus of the project is on three specific processes
that modulate processes leading to this maximization, namely smell, taste and
absorption across the gut wall. Smell and taste will be determined with
chemical, operational definitions based on response to diffused or contacted
compounds. The efficacy of compounds that elicit feeding responses in the
laboratory will be tested for their roles as attractants in the field. While the
correlation between sensing ability and nutritional value will not be perfect,
the imperfection affects the ability of these animals to sense the presence of
food and so itself is of interest. The concept of optimal gut retention times of
ingested food focuses attention on a kinetic definition of food quality, whose
determination will also likely result in identification of usable food
resources. Measurements of absorption of digested foods into the gut wall will
allow explicit tests of these models of absorption maximization on a series of
animals from Puget Sound and the Gulf of Maine.
