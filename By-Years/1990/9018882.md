This award provides 50% funding for the acquisition of a modest computer system
that will be used to control and automate the operation of a stable isotope
ratio mass spectrometer installed in the Division of Marine Geology and
Geophysics at the University of Miami. The University is committed to providing
the remaining funds needed. The stable isotope laboratory at Miami is actively
engaged in a number of projects involving isotopic analyses of large numbers of
samples, and the lab's current, non-automated system is causing a serious
bottleneck. A modest investment in a PC based automation system will provide a
much-needed improvement.
