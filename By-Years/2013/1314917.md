Intellectual Merit: An NSF Workshop on US-Czech Frontiers in Photonics is to be
organized. It will be held in Prague, the Czech Republic on April 18-19, 2013.
The specific goal of the Workshop is to bring together leading American, Czech
and European academic researchers to explore the next frontiers in photonics
research and development. Leading experts from the US and the Czech Republic
academia will present the current state of the art in photonics, identify
emerging areas, and establish new international collaborations. The workshop
topics will include non-linear optics, EUV - soft x-rays, microstructured and
specialty fibers, optical sensors, optical manipulators, metamaterials, and THz
and Mid IR photonics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This workshop will
provide a forum for academic experts to review recent and exciting breakthroughs
in photonics, to establish collaborations, and to determine future research
needs. The cross-pollination of scientific ideas will impact science and society
in both the US and the Czech Republic. Selected US doctoral students will be
given the opportunity to share their research work with European counterparts
and to gain international perspectives. The Workshop is expected to establish
future exchange programs for a diverse group of graduate or undergraduate
students and their advisors. A summary report that contains the presentation
files as well as the discussion outcomes will be disseminated via the Workshop
website hosted at Stevens Institute of Technology and will be made available to
the broader photonics research community and the general public.&lt;br/&gt;
