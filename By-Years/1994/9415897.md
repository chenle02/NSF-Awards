9415897 Bray In this project, the PI will deploy shallow pressure gauges in
three straits of the Indonesian Archipelago, Lombok, Alor, and Timor, in order
to measure the throughflow transport, its temporal variability, and surface
temperature, and salinity. Work will be carried out on an Indonesian research
vessel in collaboration with Indonesian scientists. In addition to the pressure
gauges, a survey will be carried out using a towed ADCP (Acoustic Doppler
Current Profiler) to level the pressure gauges and measure ocean currents along
the ship track. The work will be done in collaboration with that to be proposed
under ARLINDO (Indonesian acronym for "Throughflow"), a joint US/Indonesian
study of the Indonesian Throughflow. ***
