An REU Site will be continued in the Physics Department of Kansas State
University. Approximately twelve undergraduates will be selected each summer,
and involved in the research of the Department - principally in atomic physics,
but also in particle physics and condensed matter physics. The experience of
active participation in research will complement the physics studies of these
undergraduates, and help them make more effective career decisions.
