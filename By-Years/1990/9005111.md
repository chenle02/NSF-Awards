Professor Sahi will apply algebraic and analytic techniques to study the
spectrum of certain invariant differential operators on Hermitian symmetric
spaces. Among the intended applications are (i) invariant theory: to establish
identities generalizing the classical Capelli identity, (ii) representation
theory: to study certain reducibility and unitarizability questions, (iii)
analysis: to describe the homogeneous distributions on a formally real Jordan
algebra and to extend Maxwell's theory of poles of spherical harmonics to this
setting, (iv) number theory: to extend results of Shimura on the arithmeticity
of certain non- holomorphic vector-valued Eisenstein series. The work described
above involves the theory of representations of groups. Group theory is
basically the theory of symmetry. To take a simple example, when the system in
question is invariant under a change in the position of the origin of space, the
group of translations naturally arises. While groups are abstract objects,
particular situations demand concrete realizations or "representations" of the
symmetry group.
