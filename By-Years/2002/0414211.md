Prof. Larry Viehland of Chatham College is supported by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry program via a RUI award to study the kinetic theory of
ion traps. The research is developing a detailed kinetic theory of ion traps
that will make explicit connection with molecular level events. The theory is
based on the Boltzmann equation and takes into account gaseous mixtures,
molecular gases and complex trapping fields and is being carried out in
collaboration with an experimental group led by Dr. Douglas Goeringer of Oak
Ridge National Laboratory. The work is having a broader impact through the
expected applications to quantum computing, trace organic analysis and the
design of ion traps as well as through the positive impact on female
undergraduates who are participating in the research at Chatham, one of the few
remaining women's colleges in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;
