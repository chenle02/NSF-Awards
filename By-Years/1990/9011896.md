Study of the genetics of our non-human primate relatives has been hampered by
the invasive nature of obtaining samples for analysis from living tissue. Now it
is possible to obtain sufficient DNA from hair which can easily be obtained non-
invasively, even from the nests of wild animals in their native habitat. In this
study hair will be used as the prime source of DNA for determining genetic
relationships in two species of chimpanzees. Segments of selected nuclear and
mitochondrial genes will be amplified enzymatically by the polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) and sequenced directly or analyzed for size polymorphism. In most
individuals studied, sequences at six or more loci will be compared
cladistically to address questions of pedigree and phylogenetic relationships,
gene flow, and mating systems. In collaboration with Dr. Oliver Ryder, the PI
will study intrapopulation variation and develop formal genetic pedigrees for
two well known breeding colonies: Pan pansicus at the San Diego Zoo, and Pan
troglodytes at the North Carolina Zoological Park. In collaboration with Dr.
Jane Goodall, the PI will study genetic variation in members of the Kasakela
community of Pan troglodytes at Gombe National Park, Tanzania. A 30-year
retrospective genetic pedigree for this community of chimpanzees will be
attempted. By using the PCR method of analysis on samples of chimpanzee hair, it
will be possible to obtain genetic information not previously obtainable.
