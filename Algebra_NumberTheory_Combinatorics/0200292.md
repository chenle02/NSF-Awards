This project involves the connections between generating functions for height
pairings of arithmetic cycles on certain Shimura varieties, on the one hand, and
second terms in the Laurent expansions of elliptic modular and Siegel modular
Eisenstein series at certain critical points, on the other. The generating
functions can be viewed as arithmetic analogues of theta functions and can be
use to define arithmetic analogues of the classical theta correspondence, now
taking certain types of modular forms to elements of arithmetic Chow groups. A
main goal is to prove analogues of Rallis's inner product formula for these
arithmetic theta lifts, which will now involve derivatives of L-functions. Thus,
it is hoped that one may ultimately obtain information about higher dimensional
analogues of the Gross-Zagier formula and the Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.

In the later part of the 20th century significant advances were made in
developing a `number theoretic' geometry, in which an additional dimension is
added to carry information involving the interaction between the geometry and
prime numbers. To a point on such a space, one can attach a number call its
height, which is a measure of its `arithmetic complexity'. More generally,
heights can be defined for higher dimensional objects, curves on surfaces, for
example. The present project studies combinatorial relations among such heights,
which reflect hidden structure carried by the spaces of `number theoretic'
geometry.
