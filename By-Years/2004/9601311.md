The goal of the proposed research is to increase understanding of the social
psychological underpinnings of language production and comprehension. A major
focus of this research will be on conversational indirectness. People frequently
convey their meaning indirectly, and the phenomenon has important implications
for both cognitive psychology and social psychology. Most previous research on
indirectness has examined requests, a relatively unique type of remark. The
present proposal will extend this research by examining the production and
comprehension of utterances that function as replies. Several experiments will
be conducted to examine six general issues. First, how can speakers respond
indirectly to questions and requests? Second, how are indirect replies
interpreted, and what role does the interpersonal context play in this process?
Third, does the comprehension of indirect replies involve an inference process,
or are these remarks recognized in a relatively automatic fashion? Fourth, what
is the role played by paralinguistic cues such as response hesitation in the
comprehension of indirect replies? Fifth, do hearers make any other inferences
as a function of a speaker's remarks, and if so how do they do so? Sixth, do
people differ in terms of how they comprehend the meaning of others' remarks?
The research will shed new light on interpersonal relationships, and the unique
role of language in how people understand and interact with one another.
