The objective of the research is to determine the effects of suspension
formulation and rheology on the microstructural uniformity of tape-cast ceramic
sheets. The two-dimensional component geometry and simple forming technique will
facilitate modeling of the tape-casting process. Alumina-based suspensions will
be formulated that contain a bimodal molecular weight (MW) distribution of
polymethyl methacrylate, with either broad or narrow polydispersity. The effects
of polymer MW and distribution on suspension rheology, particle packing, and the
relative ratio of free to adsorbed polymer in the tapes will be investigated.
The microscopic distribution of ceramic particles and polymeric constituents as
a function of direction will be probed by themogravimetric analysis and scanning
electron microscopy as well as by measuring the macroscopic dimensional changes
these layers experience during storage, lamination, and densification.
Ultimately, processes will be designed which lead to improvements in the
microstructural uniformity of tape-cast layers. This knowledge will afford
greater dimensional control during multilayer ceramic fabrication which impacts
a critical technology--multichip electronic packaging. Tape-casting is a
critical process for forming the ceramic substrates for ceramic printed wiring
boards and the uniformity of the sheet determines the attainable wiring density.
