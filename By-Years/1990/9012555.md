An investigation is proposed for the fabrication of novel surface superlattices
which will combine with multiple quantum wells to form quantum wires along a
semiconductor surface. Quantum wires are generally expected to have enormous
potential for improving th performance of serveral optical devices, but
currently the experimental realization of these structures has been limited
because quantum wires are extremely difficult to fabricate. GaAlAs multiple
quantum well samples will be investigated, first using several novel approaches
to forming quantum wires, namely (1) electric field-induced quantum wires, (2)
strain-induced quantum wires, and (3) quantum wires formed with a focussed ion
beam process. Theoretical modeling will be used to determine the extent to which
the experimentally fabricated structures can provide two-dimensional quantum
confinement. Quantum wire samples will be fabricated and a number of optical
techniques will be used to characterize the material including
photolumineescence to experimentally verify the presence of two dimensional
quantum confinement.
