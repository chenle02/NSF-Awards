This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop
an innovative process which can transform conventional cemented tungsten carbide
(WC-Co), the most widely used industrial tool material, into functionally graded
cemented tungsten carbide (FG WC-Co). Compared to the homogeneous structure of
conventional WC-Co, FG WC-Co has a harder surface and tougher core due to a
gradual increase of cobalt content from the surface to the core, which offers
considerably higher wear resistance without sacrificing fracture toughness. This
combination of mechanical properties leads to the superior engineering
performance of FG WC-Co which translates to significantly improved tool life,
reliability, and productivity.

The broader/commercial impacts of this project will be the potential to replace
conventional WC-Co used in numerous manufacturing industries including auto and
aerospace manufacturing, oil and gas drilling, geothermal energy exploration,
mining, construction, and applications where extreme wear resistance is
required. The replacement of conventional WC-Co tool materials with FG WC-Co is
expected to lead to significant productivity improvements in these manufacturing
industries. The annual addressable market is estimated to be over $5 billion.
