Gilmour 9723537 A new approach for investigating the function of transcriptional
activators in living cells will be developed. A collection of 6 factors and RNA
polymerase II compose the general machinery that is required for initiation of
transcription but the activity of the general machinery is regulated by DNA
sequence-specific binding proteins called activators. Genomic fingerprinting
provides a way to monitor protein-DNA interactions in living cells and recently
a new method using permanganate has been developed in this laboratory to monitor
the interactions of TFIID and RNA polymerase II on promoters that have been
transformed into Drosophila. Permanganate footprinting of a transformed promoter
can be done in intact salivary glands that have been dissected from larvae,
providing a true picture of an in vivo situation. The specific aims of this
project are: 1) to use available fly stocks to determine if a GAL4 based
approach can be used to investigate how an activator affects the promoter
interactions of TFIID and RNA polymerase II in living cells 2)to determine how
Gal4-VP16 and Gal4(10147) affect target promoters carrying various numbers of
Gal4-binding sites 3) determine what changes occur in promoter interactions when
the activator is switched on or off by using derivatives of the Tet-repressor.
New insights into determining mechanisms for the regulation of transcription in
living cells will result from this work. Although tremendous progress has been
made in the identification and biochemical characterization of factors involved
in transcriptional regulation of gene expression, much of the work has been done
using artificially contrived systems or by indirect analysis. The ability to
analyze such interactions in living cells should be useful in obtaining a more
complete understanding of how gene expression is regulated.
