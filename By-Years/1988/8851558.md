The equipment dedicated to this project supports the integration of Statistical
Process Control (SPC) into the undergraduate industrial engineering
manufacturing laboratory at this institution. Students perform hands-on
experiments in SPC techniques in a real-time data collection environment to gain
expertise in both manufacturing and the automation of SPC. The equipment that
supports this project includes: digital measuring instruments to measure
dimensions of parts as quality characteristics; data collection and transmission
devices to collect or transmit data from gages to the microcomputers;
microcomputers to process the real-time data; peripheral devices to produce
control charts and reports; and, SPC software that analyzes quality information
in real time. This award is being matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
