This proposal addresses the critical necessity of introduction of Concurrent and
Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) into the manufacturing engineering technology
curriculum. A need for engineering workstations arose to teach these topics. The
computer equipment presently on hand is limited to IBM Compatible and Apple
microcomputers. The following will be accomplished as a result of the proposed
project: i) Teach Finite Element Analysis (FE A), which is a fundamental CAE
concept that is vitally important to accomplish rigorous and thorough
engineering analysis and design. ii) Run Mechanical Design Automation (MDA)
software which is essential to implement Concurrent Engineering in a Computer
Integrated enterprise. MDA software, on account of their size and processing
requirements, are run on UNIX based engineering workstation platforms. iii)
Model true 3D solids and complex surfaces which is required for mass property
evaluation, generation of sculpted surfaces for tool and mold design, rapid
prototype generation, and simulation of cutter paths in NC. iv) Issue projects
in plant simulation that are so essential to achieving productivity enhancements
in a dynamic manufacturing environment.
