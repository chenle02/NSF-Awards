*** 9760443 Shultz This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
attempt to develop a fiber optic sensor system for automated collection of data
needed in monitoring infrastructure health. It incorporates two advances in
wavelength sensing technology. Distributed arrays of In-Fiber Bragg Grating
sensors have demonstrated high-sensitivity, long-term monitoring capabilities at
affordable costs. By translating induced displacement into frequency shift,
Bragg-sensors provide an optical alternative to electronic devices. They are
used for precise measurements of displacements due to mechanical or other
processes. The firm's proprietary technology for precision optical-wavelength
(frequency) measurement is well suited for use in precision estimation of
wavelength shifts of arrays of Bragg sensors. Integration of the firm's receiver
with Bragg sensors provides simultaneous measurements on 10 sensors per fiber,
with a dynamic range of 3 orders-of-magnitude. Accuracies equivalent to a few
micro-strain at sampling rates of 10 KHz appear to be achievable. The proposed
architecture provides a low-cost monitoring system using a programmable
switching element. This allows one set of the more costly system elements to be
used sequentially to sample large arrays of hundreds of sensors. Bcause
wavelength is the basic measurement parameter, these sensors can be variably
spaced and different measurement types can be intermixed along the same Fiber-
Optic cable. Successful development of the proposed system will provide the
basis for a high-performance, affordable, fiber-optic sensor system with broad
commercial application in the areas of. environmental monitoring; nondestructive
evaluation and monitoring of civil structures; and for use in "smart" composite
structures. ***
