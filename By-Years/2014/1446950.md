Message passing has long been known as a powerful tool for structuring parallel
and distributed computation. Systems dating back more than 30 years have been
built around message passing as the fundamental interprocess communications
primitive. However, the use of message passing has been restricted to relatively
coarse-grained application architectures due to message passing overhead. This
project provides hardware to support an initial demonstration of coupling
programmable network interfaces (10 Gbps NetFPGAs) into process scheduling in
support of fine-grained message passing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
explores novel hardware and software support for message-driven computation
based on the concept of futures, a nearly 40 year old concept from programming
languages. It also builds on both the NetFPGA platform and the memory models
made available by the PCI-E bus and processors such as the latest Intel Xeon E5
series processors. Using the hardware support for locks and transactional memory
as well as Data-Direct I/O into the cache in combination with a process
execution model based on futures, this new approach to futures and message-
driven scheduling revisits powerful historical approaches like dataflow in a
realistic framework that stands to have impact in high-performance parallel
computing and scalable network service architectures.
