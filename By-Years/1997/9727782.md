9727782 Dutta The critical CAD representation issue where existing CAD systems
fail is that it is necessary to capture the interior
heterogeneity/density/gradation information in addition to the outer geometry of
the component being described. The project integrates concepts from conventional
r-sets used currently in solid modeling, fiber fundles from differential
geometry, and approaches from continuum mechanics to address this problem. The
developments directly influence the `layered-manufacturing' approaches and have
a significant impact on medical imaging and satellite image processing
processes. ***
