The purpose of this research is to quantify a mechanism for lateral melt
migration beneath mid.ocean ridges; namely freezing induced melt channeling.
Preliminary results suggest that rapid freezing near the sloping base of the
lithosphere may lead to the fromation of high permeability m lt channels that
allow melt to migrate to the ridge axis. The questions remaining are: (1) What
are the fundamental parameters that control the process? (2) Are channels
expected in the earth? (3) What is the efficiency of this process? (4) What are
the observable consequences for volume timing and chemistry of mid.ocean ridge
volcanism? By combining high resolution 2.D magma migration code with large
scale thermal and mantle flow models, a systematic series of problems will be
investigated to address these questions.
