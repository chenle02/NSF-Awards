Maps of permafrost distribution at small geographical scales commonly employ a
classification in which high-latitude regions are subdivided on the basis of the
areal continuity or dominance of permafrost. The utility of such maps is
questionable because classificatory criteria vary radically between different
countries and investigators. A physically-based technique for delineating
latitudinal permafrost zones using explicit definitions and several variables
known to influence permafrost development has had considerable success in
replicating empirical results in areas of North America where the distribution
of permafrost is well known. This investigation will extend this computational
method into the Soviet Union, the richest source of geocryological data, will
make a compilation of a standardized world permafrost map feasible and will
facilitate comparison of past, present, and future permafrost geographies.
