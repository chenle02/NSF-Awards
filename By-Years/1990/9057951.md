This first-year Presidential Young Investigator Award will support Dr. Boult's
investigations in 3-D computer vision. His planned research includes stereo
algorithms, surface estimation, segmentation, material identification, error
modeling, and information fusion. Dr. Boult is also interested in complexity
theory and in the psychology of vision.
