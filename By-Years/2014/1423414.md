Low-cost and disposable paper microfluidic devices are poised to make radical
changes in applications such as point-of-care diagnostics, biothreat detection,
and food/water supply and environmental monitoring. Scientists presently must
design new devices for each application by hand, which is time-consuming,
tedious, and error-prone. This proposal will adapt the semiconductor industry
design methodologies to paper microfluidic technologies, while leveraging
standard equipment such as inkjet printers and paper cutters for fabrication.
This project will lower the barrier-to-entry for users of paper microfluidic
devices, and will promote their widespread use among scientists.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of existing paper microfluidic devices include
products such as pregnancy tests, HIV tests, drug tests, and others, each of
which is a one-off device designed by hand. The productivity enhancements
attained through this project will reduce the design cost of paper microfluidic
devices, and these savings can be passed directly to the consumer. At the
University of California, Riverside, the PI and Co-PI will introduce an
interdisciplinary undergraduate course on paper microfluidics targeting students
from departments such as Bioengineering, Biology, Biomedical sciences, Computer
Science/Engineering, Chemical and Environmental Engineering, Environmental
Sciences, Neuroscience, and the School of Medicine. The PI and co-PI will
continue their ongoing successful efforts to include women and underrepresented
minority students in this project, and will disseminate tutorials, open source
software, and educational materials developed in the course of this project to
the wider scientific/academic community.
