Insider attacks are a critical issue for companies and governments in scenarios
involving trade secrets, sensitive information, intellectual property,
personally identifiable information, classified documents, and more. Too many
existing approaches for responding to these attacks rely on mechanisms that
assume the recovery of locally stored, unencrypted data. These techniques fail
on the growing number of devices that employ file system encryption and cloud
storage. This project advances novel methods of offering to an attacker's system
covert evidence of their attack that may remain after primary data and documents
are encrypted or securely wiped. The data has precise meaning to investigators
that is demonstrable in court and to other third parties. The data is obfuscated
from interpretation by third parties without investigator assistance, and thus
is privacy preserving. The long-range outcome of this project will be the
enabling of research including:  generalized methods of attack response when the
computers involved are outside or partially outside the administrator's
control, automated methods of discovering channels for offering evidence, and
defenses against these techniques. Our research is an important stepping stone
towards the broader topic of privacy-preserving, proactive investigation of
attacks committed using networked computer systems.
