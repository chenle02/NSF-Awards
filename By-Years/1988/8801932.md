Previous work on shape extraction and description by slice-to- slice contour
matching will be extended to multiple objects with branching structures. Both
surface fitting and volumetric modeling will be explored, with emphasis on high-
level operations and recognition of "obvious" correspondences. Both spatial (or
temporal) position and 2-D shape understanding will thus be used to attack the
3-D correspondence problem in a biological domain (retinal microscopy) where
shapes are complex and neither size nor orientation is constant from one slice
to the next.
