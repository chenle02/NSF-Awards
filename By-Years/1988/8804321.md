Stratigraphic correlation of marine sediments is the cornerstone of marine
geology. Magnetostratigraphy provides a unique method of global correlation that
is independent of depositional environment. The need to provide a time-frame for
investigating rapid paleoenvironmental changes, the need to correlate diverse
biozonations and to investigate the synchroneity of biostratigraphic events, has
enhanced the importance of magnetostratigraphy. The Late Miocene to Pliocene
interval is still problematic for biomagnetostratigraphic correlations. These
correlations have not been well established either in the open ocean or in the
Mediterranean region, where the Mio-Pliocene stratotype sections are located.
The PI will derive magnetostratigraphies from specific land sections in Italy,
and in so doing correlate Mio-Pliocene stratotype sections to the geomagnetic
reversal time scale and provide a first link between Mediterranean and open
ocean biozonations. This will also allow the correlation of paleoclimatic events
between the Mediterranean and the open ocean, and shed light on the cause of the
Mediterranean salinity crisis. The acquisition of magnetostratigraphies in the
Mediterranean Neogene has been an elusive goal, and the lithologies are not
ideal for magnetostratigraphy. However, initial studies demonstrate that the
sections which will be sampled will provide biomagnetostratigraphic correlations
from the Serravallian (Middle Miocene) to the Plio-Pleistocene boundary.
