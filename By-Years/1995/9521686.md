9521686 Pyrak-Nolte The Department of Civil Engineering and Geological Sciences
at the University of Notre Dame is ideally suited for developing a unique
program to investigate the geomechanical and structural components for the
nation's infrastructure because of its interdisciplinary nature. The acquisition
of a state-of-the art test facility will amplify the thrust of our effort in an
integrated manner. The objective of this proposal is to acquire a servo-
controlled bi-axial hydraulic test system with both static and dynamic loading
capabilities to create a system that can be used to test: () structural
components subjected to cyclic and dynamic loads; and (2) the response of rocks
and soils subjected simulated shallow crustal stresses, i.e. stresses
encountered at engineering sites or at mining or waste isolation depths.
Earthquake conditions on engineering structural components will be simulated
with dynamic actuators that can apply horizontal displacements while the
components are subjected to normal loads from the vertical actuator. ***
