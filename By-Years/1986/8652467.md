This project addresses the NSF's concern about low levels of science and
mathematics participation and achievement among minorities, the poor, women, and
students not college bound. RAND will analyze data from the 1985 National Survey
of Science and Mathematics Education a survey previously supported by NSF at the
Research Triangle Institute, which covered a sample of 1200 elementary and
secondary schools and 6000 mathematics and science teachers. This present
project will be designed to improve understanding of: 1) how resources, teacher
quality, curriculum, and instructional practices are distributed among various
student groups, and 2) whether this distribution may shape the opportunities to
learn of groups that typically exhibit low participation and achievement levels.
Because distributional questions will be addressed at both the school and
classroom levels, the study will provide clues as to whether learning
opportunities of students in various groups relate to: 1) the particular school
a student happens to attend; 2) how opportunities are provided to different
students in the same school; 3) combined school and classroom factors. These
analyses will provide the first detailed national picture of the conditions
under which patterns of unequal outcomes have occurred and point to specific
targets for policies and programs addressed at remedying participation and
achievement discrepancies.
