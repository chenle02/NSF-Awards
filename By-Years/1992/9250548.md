At Passaic County Community College, Anatomy and Physiology is the most heavily
enrolled science course. It is required for most Biology programs and all Allied
Health programs. The proposal requests funds to upgrade the laboratory component
of the course by acquiring computer-based physiological equipment. Five complete
workstations will be established, each equipped with a personal computer,
printer and Intelitool sensors and interfaces. The equipment will permit
students to perform hands-on experiments in electrocardiography, spirometry,
muscle physiology and reflex physiology. The project is designed to increase
scientific interest within the general student population and improve the
scientific competencies of those students intending to pursue a career in
science.
