This research is to provide analysis support for a part of the PACE seismic
reflection/refraction study carried out by several research groups across the
tectonically active boundary between the Colorado Plateau and the transition to
the Basin and Range province. The goal in analyzing this data set is to set
constraints on the uplift process of the Colorado Plateau and, hopefully of
plateaus in general. The addition of reflection to refraction data will give
tighter control on the velocities to enable the study of rock properties, and
more detail of the important structural transition across the Colorado Plateau.
