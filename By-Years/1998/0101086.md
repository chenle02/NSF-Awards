The field-aligned current (FAC) and the auroral acceleration are related to each
other and are most important in the magnetosphere-ionosphere (M-I) coupling. The
recent studies have found that on the nightside, auroral emission and electron
precipitation tend to be more intense in the winter (dark) hemisphere than in
the summer (sunlit) hemisphere.

The observed asymmetry of auroral emission, suggests that the field-aligned
current is more intense in the winter hemisphere, even though auroral regions in
two hemispheres are connected by the magnetic field line, and the background
ionospheric conductance is lower in the winter hemisphere. The proposed project
seeks to study this paradoxical problem by observationally testing three
possible explanations. Those explanations are (1) The upward FAC is more
confined or structured in latitude in the winter hemisphere creating locally
more dense currents; (2) The enhanced electron precipitation in the winter
hemisphere overcompensates for the asymmetry of ionospheric conductance due to
solar illumination; and (3) The region 1 currents in the summer and winter
hemispheres have different sources in the magnetotail, and the M-I coupling
takes place separately in each hemisphere.

Magnetometer data from the DMSP-F7, F12, and F13 satellites and Geotail data
will be used to examine FACs above the ionosphere. An automatic procedure to
identify FAC structures will be applied to those data sets, and the
characteristics of FACs such as current intensity, current density, latitudinal
thickness of FAC sheets, and spatial irregularity will be quantitatively
determined. The project will compare those characteristics between the summer
(sunlit) and winter (dark) hemispheres.

The proposed project will be the first comprehensive study of the summer-winter
asymmetry of nightside FACs and will shed new light on the role of the
ionospheric conductance in the M-I coupling.
