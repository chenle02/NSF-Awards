A symposium under the auspices of the Society of General Physiologists is
planned for September 9.12, 1987 at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods
Hole, Massachusetts. The general topic of the symposium will be the cellular
physiology of blood cells: erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets. Five broad
areas will be covered: (1) hematopoesis, the regulation of differentiation and
development of the three main cell types from stem cells; (2) membrane skeleton
and contraction, including the structure and functions of contractile proteins
in red cells and leukocytes and the relationships between surface antigens and
proteins of the cytoskeleton in platelets; (3) anion transport in red cells and
neutrophils; (4) ion channels and activation of blood cells, including
patch.clamp measurements of K and Ca channels in lymphocytes, macrophages, and
platelets, and (5) the phosphoinositide cycle and protein kinase C activation in
the mediation of receptor signals from extracellular factors. Poster sessions, a
major keynote address, and a symposium summary are also planned. This symposium
will offer a unique opportunity for physiologists, cell biologists, biochemists,
and hematologists to meet together at a single series of presentations and will
allow cross.fertilization of ideas and critical comparisons of results from a
variety of experimental approaches in a variety of cell systems. The published
proceedings from this symposium are expected to make a timely and important
contribution to this rapidly growing interdisciplinary area.
