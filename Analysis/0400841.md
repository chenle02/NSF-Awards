The theory of operator algebras originated in the 1930s with the efforts of J.
von Neumann and others to develop rigorous mathematical models of quantum
mechanical systems. A fundamental precept of this theory is that the time
evolution of such a mathematical model is prescribed by a one-parameter group of
automorphisms. A more general picture is obtained if one considers evolutions of
systems that can move forward but not necessarily backward in time. This notion
leads to the study of one-parameter semigroups of endomorphisms, as opposed to
(time reversible) one-parameter groups of automorphisms. Price hopes to continue
his work with two leaders in the field, Alexis Alevras and Robert T. Powers, on
classifying families of semigroups of endomorphisms that act on the operator
algebras of all bounded operator on a Hilbert space. Price also plans to
continue his study of endomorphisms on the operator algebra called the
hyperfinite II_1 factor. The hyperfinite II_1 algebra R is of fundamental
importance in the study of operator algebras and is itself related to certain
mathematical models of spin systems. Previously he has used number-theoretic
ideas to arrive at a complete classification of the family of endomorphisms on
this algebra known as binary shifts. His current work in this area is focused on
obtaining a complete classification of all endomorphisms on R whose image is
maximal in R. This work uses ideas from combinatorics and linear algebra as well
as number theory. The linear algebraic and combinatoric aspects of this study
are expected to lead to some research problems that are accessible to gifted
undergraduate students. Price proposes to continue working with mathematics
majors who are interested in honors projects related to this work.
