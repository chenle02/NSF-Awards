This research project combines survey and ethnographic approaches to provide
data on a stratified sample of African-American and Euro- American women who
head households. It will explore the problems faced by households headed by
women and the solutions devised for addressing them; and, examine the extent to
which socioeconomic status and race bear on similarities and differences among
such households, with respect to such factors as formation and stability, access
to income, household composition and network strategies. Both qualitative and
quantitative approaches will be utilized. A small sample of households headed by
women will be selected for ethnographic study. The sample will be selected
through a school, a day care center, and an after - school center, allowing for
variation by race and socioeconomic status, but for control of the age range of
the children in the household. Results of preliminary ethnographic research will
be utilized to construct a survey questionnaire to be administered to a larger
and more randomly sampled population.
