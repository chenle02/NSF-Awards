This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry of the University of Maryland College
Park purchase a new 400 MHz NMR spectrometer and to upgrade an existing 500 MHz
NMR spectrometer. The projects that will use the new equipment include:
Synthesis of bioactive substances, chemistry and biology of the trichothecene
antibiotic complex, mechanistic enzymology, metallated zintl ions, biological
macrocompounds, and peptide glycosylation. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation
of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances,
characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and study the
dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-
art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier
research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in areas such as
polymers and catalysis and in biology.
