The aluminosilicate mineral phases allophane and imogolite occur as tiny
particles in soils and have important effects on the movement of nutrients and
pollutants in soil, on forest productivity and on the response of soils and
during road and building construction. These minerals are highly surface-active
and are also metastable relative to the crystalline clays in soils. A knowledge
of their surface properties and their reactivity is essential to understanding
soil evolution and surface geological processes. This proposal requests 50%
support for the acquisition of a high-speed centrifuge that is needed to
separate allophane and imogolite from soil samples in order to measure their
chemical and physical properties. The centrifuge is to be housed in the
Department of Agronomy and Soils at Washington State University.
