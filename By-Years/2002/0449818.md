CAREER: Beyond the Minimal Dark Sector: Finding New Physics in Cosmology and
Collider

Abstract

We now know that there in fact is physics beyond the standard model, in the form
of dark matter, dark energy, and neutrino masses, but we have only begun to
study these areas experimentally and theoretically. The PI intends to explore
many topics including unexpected signals of the dark sector in terrestrial and
cosmological experiments, sensitivity of neutrino masses to new forces, and
interactions between the standard model and dark energy. By exploring what
connections could exist between these apparently disparate fields - dark matter,
dark energy, neutrino physics, collider physics - we gain insights into their
possible nature, and find ways terrestrial and cosmological studies can
compliment one another. The PI also intends to develop new course materials to
teach the rapidly evolving details of this field. The outreach part of the
proposal will involve the development of new interactive classroom
demonstrations, aimed at high school students, in partnership with the
Governor's School in North Carolina, a public summer school for academically or
artistically advanced students.
