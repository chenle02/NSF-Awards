This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to
demonstrate the feasibility of fabricating nanometer-scale magnetic-tunnel-
junction (MTJ) sensors that are highly sensitive, operate at room temperature,
and surpass the performance of existing magnetic sensors. Nanoscale MTJ sensors,
currently unavailable in the marketplace, are urgently needed for sensing weak
magnetic fields with nanometer-scale resolution. One application is a scanning
magnetic microscope that can non-invasively measure the electrical current
distribution of semiconductor chips down to the smallest spatial feature. Other
applications include magnetic imaging arrays, biomagnetic sensors, and
read/write heads for data storage devices. The project is to develop a process
for fabricating sensors with unprecedented miniaturization. The feasibility
study will address three key issues: 1) the large increase in junction
resistance that accompanies the reduction of junction area will be minimized; 2)
the nonlinear response caused by discrete domain-wall motions in small sensor
elements will be overcome; and 3) the thermal fluctuations that become
problematic as the anisotropy energy of the sensor is reduced will be
stabilized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this will deliver versatile
magnetic sensors with the potential to broadly impact the semiconductor, data
storage, and biotechnology markets.
