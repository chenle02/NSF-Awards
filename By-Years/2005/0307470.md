The purpose of this project is to provide financial assistance
to&lt;br/&gt;engineering students to attend the 2002 International
Mechanical&lt;br/&gt;Engineering Congress and Exposition (IMECE), sponsored by
the American&lt;br/&gt;Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) International. The
focus of the&lt;br/&gt;conference will center around theoretical issues,
engineering&lt;br/&gt;methodologies, and industrial applications in various
areas of Mechanical&lt;br/&gt;Engineering, including Dynamic Systems and
Control. The primary goal of&lt;br/&gt;this project is to expose students to
current advances in Dynamic Systems&lt;br/&gt;and Control. Furthermore, it is
hoped that DSCD Student members will&lt;br/&gt;become and maintain active
participation in ASME DSCD activities. As&lt;br/&gt;part of a new initiative of
the ASME Dynamic System and Control&lt;br/&gt;Division (DSCD), the PI will
organize travel support for DSCD&lt;br/&gt;student attendees, in the form of
IMECE 2002 Student Travel Grants.&lt;br/&gt;These grants will be advertised
nationally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
