A new curriculum for a one-semester biochemistry laboratory course has been
designed and is being implemented by the Chemistry Department at California
State University at Long Beach. The course is the capstone of a newly approved
degree program leading to a Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry. The course
emphasizes the acquisition of both experience with modern biochemical research
techniques and instrumentation and the acquisition of problem-solving skills
used in a research setting. The following equipment has been recently added to
the department's instrumental holdings, specifically for use in this regard: a
high speed centrifuge, three ultraviolet-visible scanning spectrophotometers, a
high pressure liquid chromatography gradient system with variable wavelength
detector, and three low pressure liquid chromatography systems. In addition to
experiments on protein determination, enzyme kinetics, and gel electrophoresis,
the isolation and characterization of hemoglobin, DNA, and messenger RNA, from
the brine shrimp Artemia Salina, is carried out, together with experiments on
the transformation of bacteria with recombinant plasmids and the isolation and
characterization of the plasmids.
