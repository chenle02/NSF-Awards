ABSTRACT 0203315 Ronald Goldman William Marsh Rice U

Resultants have many applications in Computational Science and Engineering. They
are a powerful tool for determining whether or not a system of polynomial
equations have a common root for solving for the common roots when they exist.
Resultants are currently employed to compute intersections of rational curves
and surfaces, to solve inverse kinematics problems, and to analyze dynamic
systems. Robotics, Computer vision, Comptuer Graphics, Solid Modeling, and
Computer Aided Geometric Design all utilize resultants.
