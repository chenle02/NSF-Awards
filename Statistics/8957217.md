This research project is in the general area of mathematical statistics and
concerns topics in geometric probability, density estimation, asymptotic methods
and approximate inference, decision theory, and non-parametric tilting methods.
The investigation involves viable computer- intensive techniques for data
analysis. A general theme of the research is the theoretical development of
general purpose methods that are widely applicable to problems in statistics.
This statistical research addresses problems of constructing confidence
intervals for unknown parameters in statistical models. 'Automatic' percentiles
methods are being developed to handle such problems, motivated by Efron's work
on bootstrap confidence intervals. Based on mathematical theorems and simulation
studies, the automatic methods are generally more accurate than Efron's work and
are easier to implement in practice.
