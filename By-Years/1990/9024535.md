Approximately 65 genera and 200 species of pteridophytes (ferns and fern-allies)
make up one-seventh of the Hawaiian higher plant species and constitute a major
segment of the vegetation. Many of the species are poorly known and many are
rare, threatened, or endangered. There are numerous systematic and
distributional questions about these plants, and a modern survey and inventory
of them is urgently needed. This will involve a comprehensive assessment of
existing collections and detailed studies of the current populations in the
wild, including new collections and data on habitats. The results of the
inventory will form the basis of a much-needed manual of Hawaiian ferns and
fern-allies to parallel recent volumes on the flowering plants. Surveys will be
made on the main islands of Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Lanai, Maui, and Hawaii. The
resulting specimens will be processed at the University of Michigan and the
Bishop Museum, and duplicates distributed to other appropriate herbaria. A
scientifically new manual will facilitate numerous studies of biodiversity,
evolution, and plant dispersal. Conservationally the results will influence the
preservation of species and natural areas.
