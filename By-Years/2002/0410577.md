Biological Science (61). This CCLI Adaptation and Implementation Type II project
supports the collaboration of six regional Appalachian institutions from five
states (Ferrum College, King College, Sewanee: The University of the South,
Lindsey Wilson College, West Virginia Wesleyan College, and Montreat College)
who are seeking to strengthen their field science offerings by the collaborative
study of watersheds near their respective colleges. The project addresses the
need to engage students in hands-on inquiry-based experimental activities
through the adoption of a small watershed research approach -- providing shared
curricula (via an online Lab Manual for Small Watershed Studies (eManual)),
electronic data sharing, and participation in cross-site collaborative student
research projects supported by fully equipped field sites at each campus. In
addition to inquiry-based laboratory exercises (modeled after LTER and GLOBE
activities), and participation in a common research project across all watershed
sites, students may conduct personally designed field studies, sharing their
findings online and at a student research symposium. Instructors also receive
training in the use of the equipment and methodology at faculty development
workshops. This project may serve as a model for other small undergraduate
institutions hoping to improve student learning via a collaborative approach to
environmental or field studies.
