Studies of the microbiome have shown that gut microbe communities can affect a
hostâ€™s ability to harvest energy and store fat. However, the significance of gut
microbiome plasticity and its relevance to host survival when faced with
environmental fluctuations in nutrient availability remains unclear. This
doctoral dissertation research uses evolutionary and ecological approaches to
examine gut microbiota changes in wild primates that cope with extreme
variability in forest fruit production, resulting in substantial fluctuations in
caloric intake and major shifts in the types of foods available for consumption.
This study advances knowledge about primate microbiome adaptations, which may
also provide comparative data for examining adaptations in the hominin lineage
and microbiome function in modern humans. The project facilitates doctoral
degree completion for a woman and first-generation student and provide field,
laboratory, and bioinformatics training for students from groups
underrepresented in STEM research. The project also enhance research capacity at
the research location through training workshops and collaboration.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Orangutans cope with environmentally-induced variations in
diet, such as reductions in caloric intake by up to 48%, and fall short of their
energetic requirements for several months out of the year. Because gut
microbiota have the potential to be powerful drivers of orangutan energetics
during periods of fruit scarcity, this study investigates whether gut microbial
community compositions change across marked fluctuations in nutritional intake,
and also whether those changes result in increased energy harvest and microbial
energy production. More specifically, this project (1) monitors environmental
changes in fruit availability; (2) uses observations to estimate food intake and
match intake with known nutritional values; (3) identifies gut microbial
compositions from fecal samples using Next-Generation DNA sequencing; and (4)
approximates microbial energy production by measuring short-chain fatty acid
concentrations in fecal samples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
