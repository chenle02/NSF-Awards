With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
continues its support of the work of Professor Kenneth B. Wiberg, of the
Chemistry Department at Yale University. The research will combine experimental
and theoretical techniques to investigate electronically excited states and
spectral properties of organic molecules. Studies directed toward an
understanding of the molecular factors responsible for properties such as
optical rotatory strength, ultraviolet and visible absorptions, and NMR chemical
shifts, which all involve electronically excited states, will be carried out.
The goal of these investigations is not only to undertake accurate calculations
of these properties but also to provide an understanding of the electronic
effects that determine their magnitudes. The experimental data will also provide
tests of the adequacy of the theoretical methods in reproducing experimental
results.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;These studies, with their potential of leading to
a theory of the molecular basis of optical activity are expected to have broad
positive impact upon the biological and pharmaceutical communities.&lt;br/&gt;
