purchase an eight-node compute cluster for use as a small parallel computer.
This equipment will be dedicated to support research in the mathematical
sciences and will be used for several research projects, including in
particular: 1. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging by William F. Eddy and
Christopher Gen 2. Nested Analysis of Variance Directed by Evolutionary Graphs
by Bernie Devlin and Kathryn Roeder 3. Dynamic Methods for Modeling Sea Height
Anomalies by Ngai Hang Chan and Joseph B. Kadane
