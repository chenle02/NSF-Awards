The proposed work seeks to apply data analytics to the software development
process. An analytic is typically data analysis that changes the behavior of an
organization. Application of data analytics to software engineering is
relatively new and limited. The proposed research plans to use five significant
software technologies, each of which has been shown to have a positive impact on
the software process and product, to identify and quantify software development
patterns whose analysis will be used to better understand and improve the
software development process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcomes of the proposed
work have the potential for significant impact the software design and
engineering process. The resulting analytics have the potential to greatly
improve the ability to assess quality, predict reliability, diagnose problems,
discern impending faults and identify maintenance procedures in real time. The
work is supported by the Industry Advisory Board as well as individual industry
members of the center and has the potential to extend the centers portfolio
through expansion into the relatively new software analytics area. The center
will involve graduate students and undergraduates in the work, publish and
incorporate the results in existing coursework software engineering.&lt;br/&gt;
