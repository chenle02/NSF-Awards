The main physics program supported by this award is directed at the study of
flavor structure of nucleons and nuclei. Research will be carried out at the
Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) near Chicago as part of the
SeaQuest collaboration. The program with SeaQuest is focused on Drell/Yan
production of di-muon pairs to determine the light antiquark flavor
distributions in the nucleon sea, and how the light antiquark flavor
distributions are modified in nuclei. This information will provide direct input
to the parton distribution fits that cannot yet be determined from first
principles. A smaller effort is aimed to enable measurements of a fundamental
prediction of Quantum Chromodynamics that tests our concepts for analyzing hard-
scattering reactions in strong interactions, known as the sign change of the
Sivers function. In addition, the Michigan group will lead the operation of the
cryogenic targets as part of their hardware responsibility to the SeaQuest
experiment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SeaQuest experiment at the Fermi
National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) near Chicago will provide a better
understanding of how light anti-quarks are distributed in nucleons and nuclei,
and on the physical mechanism which generates the sea of the nucleon. A smaller,
but very important effort will be spent on developing a polarized Drell-Yan
program at Fermilab that is complementary to the spin physics programs at
Brookhaven National Lab and Jefferson Lab. This program builds on the expertise
the group has gained, and is a natural extension of the group's work over the
past years. It allows them to play a major role in the Drell-Yan experiment at
Fermilab now, and to lead the way towards a polarized Drell-Yan program at
Fermilab in the future. Education and training of both, undergraduate and
graduate students, as well as outreach aimed at the general public is an
important aspect of this research program.
