The objective of this research is to use recent advances to develop the
experimental and interpretive means to characterize fractures in rock and
concrete. Recent advances in the understanding of the effects of discontinuities
on seismic wave transmission make it feasible to locate and characterize
macroscopic discontinuities in rock and concrete structures, as well as to
determine their strength and deformability parameters. These characterizations
will then be used in a Discontinuous Deformation Analysis (DDA) model to build a
numerical simulation that evaluates the overall properties of the defective zone
within the structure or foundation. The methods will be developed in the
laboratory, tested in bench scale experiments, and applied in a series of
preliminary field trials.
