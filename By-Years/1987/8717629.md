This is a proposal to carry out numerical experiments related to shallow
convection and partial melting in conjunction with the formation of passive
margins and mid-ocean ridges. One set of calculations involves the attempt to
explain the large volumes of basalt produced at some margins in which there is a
sharp transition between oceanic and continental crust. The second set of
calculations concerns the interaction of small scale convection and mid-ocean
ridge crests. It addresses such questions as when does small scale convection
initiate? Is it responsible for ridge segmentation? What happens if a ridge
crest overruns an existing small scale convection pattern? The problems
addressed by this proposal are of considerable to the geological community. The
models should provide important constraints on mid-ocean ridge processes. The
results of the models can be tested by other geological data.
