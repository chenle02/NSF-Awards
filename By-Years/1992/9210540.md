Functional recovery from peripheral nerve injury hinges on the ability of
neurons within the nerve bundle to re-grow damaged neurites (axons and
dendrites) and to reestablish connections with the specific targets they
innervate. While the capacity for re-growth exists, and can in fact be
extensive, the ability of the regenerating neurite to successfully navigate a
course back to targets more that a few millimeters away is typically limited.
Biological studies have established that the growth cone, a motile structure at
the leading tip of the neurite, is the primary site at which navigational
decisions are made. Little is known about growth cone dynamics or their specific
contributions to neurite outgrowth and guidance. This project proposes a
conceptual framework for investigating cellular events occurring at the growth
cone and their effects on developing neurite trajectory in the presence or
absence of directional guidance cues. This work is to provide a means for
bridging the existing gap between current experimental approaches to the
understanding of nerve growth, and the available theoretical tools that could
serve to speed the progress of nerve regeneration research.
