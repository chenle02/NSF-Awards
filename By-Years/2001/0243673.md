This 10-week summer research program is aimed at involving 8 undergraduate
students in active research &lt;br/&gt;under the supervision of applied
mathematicians who are dedicated researchers and mentors. The major area
&lt;br/&gt;of concentration will be applied mathematics emphasizing population
dynamics and wave propagation in nonhomogeneous media. At the end of the summer
program the students will have developed a good understanding of mathematical
modeling, interpretation of solutions to explain the underlying physical
problems, dependence of solutions on the parameters used in the models, inverse
problems and their importance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary focus of the REU
site project is mathematical training, active participation in research, and
mentoring. The objectives are to provide the undergraduate students with
meaningful research experience in applied mathematics, to show them the
enjoyment of doing research, to encourage them to pursue advanced degrees in
mathematics, science, and engineering, and to increase participation by women
and other &lt;br/&gt;underrepresented groups. There will be various scientific,
cultural, and social activities enhancing the program and helping to improve the
students' computational and communication skills.
