9405374 Jacobsen Project involves development of a high-precision 87Rb-86Sr
dating technique applicable to both lavas and foraminifera. One objective is the
evaluation of this method for leucite-bearing Italian volcanics by study of
groundmass minerals and phenocrysts in historical lavas. A second is an
evaluation of the disequilibrium dating method applied to both shallow and deep
water samples containing forams from the Pacific, plus initial investigation
using del 234U dating of forminiferal ooze in Toba Ash horizons. The ultimate
goal is to provide precisely time-resolved climate proxy records to increase our
ability to understand causes of cyclic variation in climate.
