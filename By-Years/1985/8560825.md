A new technique for reducing skin friction in a turbulent boundary layer will be
investigated. This involves a combination of suction and longitudinal groves
(riblets). Experiments to explore the enhanced benefit from the simultaneous
action of these two mechanisms, and their optimum characteristics, will be
carried out in a flat plate boundary layer with no presure gradient, towed in a
water channel.
