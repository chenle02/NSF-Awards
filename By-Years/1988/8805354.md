This grant provides travel support for US invited speakers to attend the 16th
International Quantum Electronics Conference (IQEC), Tokyo, Japan, 18-21 July
1988. IQEC has been, since its establishment in 1959, the major international
forum for the presentation and discussion of all aspects of quantum electronics,
emphasizing basic scientific research in lasers and electro-optics. Additional
emphasis will be given this year to semiconductor lasers, fiber optics and their
applications, areas which are now studied intensively in Japan. Because of the
potential difficulties which high travel expenditures to Japan are causing for
prospective US attendees and the need to have strong representation from the
American scientific community at this important international conference, this
proposal requests partial travel support for invited speakers and other
meritorious scientists from the US academic research community.
