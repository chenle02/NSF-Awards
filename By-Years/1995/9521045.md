9521045 Moore A numerical study of the singular vectors of the Gulf Stream
meander and ring region will be conducted for two different time periods during
which regular analysis of the region are available. This work will be done in
the context of both quasi-geostrophic and primitive equation models with the aim
of understanding the dynamical and physical factors which are believed to limit
the predictability of a highly non- linear oceanic region such as the Gulf
Stream.
