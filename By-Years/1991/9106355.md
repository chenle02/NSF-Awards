This State-of-the-Art survey award will provide partial support for Dr. Subhash
C. Goel, of the Civil Engineering Department at the University of Michigan, to
visit Japan to do an in-depth critical survey of Japanese use of steel
reinforcement for seismic upgrading and strengthening of existing concrete
buildings. Dr. Goel will spend a month of his sabbatical leave at the Building
Research Institute in Tsukuba, reviewing relevant Japanese literature and
visiting related Japanese research institutions.
