This grant will support research which addresses the interest generated in the
field of cosmic ray physics by reports of point sources - possibly neutron stars
in space - of Ultra High Energy (UHE) gamma rays detected by conventional ground
based Extensive Air Shower (EAS) arrays. The investigator plans measurements of
the distribution of gamma rays from space. He will work at the University of
Notre Dame with two postdoctoral associates and a team of graduate and
undergraduate students. The array uses a new concept involving position
sensitive detectors which, it is claimed, provides superior angular resolution
by directly measuring individual angles of the charged secondaries in the air
showers. This array "Gamma Ray Astronomy at Notre Dame" (GRAND) consists of 16
stations. Each station is made up of eight planes, each with area 1.25 square
meters, of position sensitive detectors spaced vertically. The bottom two planes
are separated from the top six by a thin steel absorber used to distinguish
muons from electrons or soft secondary photons. Crucial features of the array
then are smaller angular resolution and good muon, electron and soft photon
identification.
