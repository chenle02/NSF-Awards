This project investigates hierarchical machine intelligence for modeling and
composing complex soundscapes. We adapt methods for extracting time-dependent
information from text documents to the problem of extracting spectral
(graphical) patterns and the probabilities that they occur or co-occur in
soundscapes. We are analyzing the spectral patterns that emerge from sound files
of many types, including recordings of building interiors with regular foot
traffic, musical files, and synthesized sound. A significant part of the
research is in devising spectral features that are important for this kind of
mapping/identification. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research under this award is also
investigating the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to identify time-dependent
'landmarks' from soundscape models, and we employ RL agents to compose large
soundscapes from thousands of millisecond length grains of sound in a process
called granular synthesis. Systems of RL agents enable us to study distributed
time-dependent RL agents in a complex environment, with the ability to produce
aural demonstrations of the agents' learning. We also expect the system to
produce some compositions that are pleasing in the electronic music
sense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will have an impact on curricular
efforts in Arts and Technology at Smith College, supporting the Computer Science
Department's efforts to attract more students, especially to research.
