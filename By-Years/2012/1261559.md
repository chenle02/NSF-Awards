This project involves post-processing of original field data collected as part
of the Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry Study (DC3) conducted in May and
June of 2012. The primary goal of the DC3 campaign was to determine the
influence of deep, midlatitude continental convective clouds, including related
dynamical, physical, and lightning processes, on upper tropospheric/lower
stratospheric (UT/LS) composition and chemistry. In the UT/LS, formaldehyde and
peroxides are major sources of ozone. Careful analyses of the DC3 dataset are
important for understanding and interpreting radical production in the UT/LS due
to convective transport of precursors that influence the production of ozone.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data from the DC3 campaign will increase the understanding
of the atmospheric chemistry and dynamics related to the formation of ozone in
the upper troposphere, where ozone acts as a greenhouse gas. Detailed analysis
of campaign data will help elucidate possible mechanisms that occur during deep
convection and plume aging that influence water vapor, ozone, cirrus cloud and
aerosol concentrations that all play important roles in contributing to
radiative forcing of the Earth's climate system.
