This proposed workshop on Sources, Transport, Energization and Loss of
Magnetospheric Plasmas will focus on all aspects of the modeling of
magnetospheric plasmas, and specifically will tie in to the international Solar
Terrestrial Energy Program (STEP), the upcoming ISTP and IMI spacecraft
missions, and the NSF Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM) program. Workshop
sessions will involve seven oral sessions including four tutorial talks per
session with extended discussion time. These sessions will cover the topics of
Distribution, Sources, Transport, Energization, Loss, Imaging, and Synthesis
(summary of existing consensus and outstanding issues). Contributed papers will
be in two evening poster sessions. The workshop will be held at Guntersville
Lodge south of Huntsville, Alabama.
