A locally testable language is a language with the property that, for some
nonnegative integer k, whether or not a word x is in the language depends on (1)
the prefix and suffix of x of length k, and (2) the set of substrings occur and
to the number of times each substring occurs. The order of a locally testable
language is the smallest such k. Locally testable languages and related problems
will be investigated. In particular, the objectives are: (1) improve the time
complexity of the approximation algorithm for computing the order of a locally
testable automaton; (2) find a tight upper bound on the order of a locally
testable deterministic automaton with n states; (3) resolve Robert Martin's
conjecture on the problem of feedback-shift-register realizability of a
sequential machine, (4) investigate two dimensional locally testable languages
and parsers.
