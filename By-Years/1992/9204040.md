9204040 Richman In this project, four principal investigators with support from
five separate institutions will study energy, momentum, and vorticity budgets,
and zonal volume and heat transport variability in the Antarctic Circumpolar
Current (ACC) south of Tasmania, Australia. A mix of moored current meters
seafloor electric field recorders, and inverted echo sounders will be used in
collaboration with similar resources from scientists in Hobart, Tasmania. In
this component, the PI will oversee the preparation and deployment of an array
of conventional current meters for direct velocity and temperature measurement.
