Anyone who exercises notices that we naturally pace our breathing to our
movement pattern. While running, for example, we may take four full strides for
every breath (a ratio of 4:1). We use different ratios to ensure that sufficient
oxygen is available for movement, thus coaches and trainers often instruct us to
control our breathing during exercise deliberately. However, despite nearly four
decades of research on motor-respiratory coupling, there have been no studies on
this intentional control. With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr.
Polemnia Amazeen and Dr. Richard Hinrichs, together with breathing specialist
Wendy Waxman, will investigate how people learn to coordinate their breathing
and movements. A simple arm swinging task is used to maximize the variety of
breathing-movement patterns that can be studied. Feedback displays encourage
participants to focus their attention on relevant aspects of the breathing-
movement coordination, and yoga practitioners are tested to identify aspects of
breath training that improve control. Strategies for "learning for free" are
identified when people who have practiced one breathing-movement pattern
subsequently improve their performance of other patterns. Requiring people to
engage in a competing, cognitive task during the breathing-movement task reveals
whether attention is critical to sustaining coordination between breathing and
movement. All findings are summarized within a mathematical model called the
Farey tree, a model that has been applied successfully to the performance of
polyrhythms (e.g., drumming). This research uses experimental techniques and
theoretical tools from many different scientific fields and will integrate
research and education through substantial student involvement. Its findings
will improve the general understanding of motor coordination and learning theory
and will enhance sports instruction and the creation of therapeutic techniques.
