In this program various devices based on the AlGaSb material system for optical
source and detector applications will be studied. Various (Al,Ga)Sb based on
photodetectors structures including MSM (metal-semiconductor-metal), PIN, SAGM
(Separate absorption graded and multiplication), etc., will be fabricated and
characterized. In this area preliminary results have been very encouraging.
Record breakdown voltages (6V) for molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) grown PIN
diodes without surface passivation have already been obtained, and it is
expected that significant progress will be made by pursuing a more comprehensive
program. In addition to detectors, GaSb/AlSb quantum well optical modulators and
quantum well lasers will be studied along with the integration of PIN and MSM
detectors with the n- and p-channel FETs based on AlSb/InAs/GaSb. The optimal
MBE conditions for the material growth will be established through reflection
high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) and Auger electron spectroscopy. The
structural properties of the materials will be characterized by x-ray
diffraction. The electrical and optical properties will be characterized Hall
measurements and photoluminescence. Finally, GaSb MSM, PIN, avalanche and SAGM
photodetectors will be fabricated and characterized.
