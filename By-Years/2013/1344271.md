Typically, an electronic component goes through process of design, fabrication,
assembly, distribution, usage in the system, and finally end of life. Obsolete
integrated circuits (ICs) are commonly targeted by counterfeiters through
recycling, remarking, and cloning. If counterfeit components end up in critical
applications such as defense, aerospace, automotive, or medical systems, the
results could be catastrophic. This research will raise awareness of
counterfeiting, piracy, and electronic components recycling and remarking issues
which will have positive socioeconomic effects on electronic components
innovation and growth, rights' holders and
consumers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Detecting these counterfeit ICs is an extremely
difficult task because of the large number of counterfeit types, part types, and
defects and anomalies associated with the counterfeit parts. In this project, we
develop innovative 2D/3D optical imaging for detecting exterior physical
defects, novel 3D X-ray imaging technologies for interior physical defects
detection and to eliminate the need for decapping of ICs, and a Tera-Hertz
imaging technology for exterior and interior physical defects detection.
