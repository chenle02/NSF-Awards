How hail is produced in deep convective storms has been studied for several
years, but many questions still remain. It is well-known that hailstones begin
their growth around small ice particles which are referred to as hailstone
embryos. Results over the last decade have drawn attention to an area in severe
storms known as feeder cells. These are small convective clouds that form near
the main storm cell and eventually are absorbed ("feed") into the main
convective cell. It is speculated that, at least in some types of hailstorms,
these feeder cells are the main producers of the embryos that eventually grow
into large hail. In conjunction with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, the National Science Foundation will participate in a field
program to study hailstorms. This project, known as the North Dakota
Thunderstorm Project, will be held during the Summer of 1989. As part of this
research effort, the Principal Investigator intends to study two aspects of
embryo production. First, using in situ aircraft measurements, the microphysical
characteristics of feeder cells will be investigated. This will include
experimental seeding with artificial ice nuclei in the feeder cells to
investigate the effects of premature nucleation on microphysical processes. The
second area of investigation will focus on a phenomenon known as fine scale
reflectivity patterns. These are areas of enhanced radar echo return and have
been thought to be a source of hailstone embryos. Through direct sensing, the
Principal plans to investigate the hypothesis that these are indeed areas of
high concentration of embryos and that these embryos often find their way into
the regions of the storm where large hail is produced. //
