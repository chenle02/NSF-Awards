97-31725 ZABORSKY This award initiates the Engineering Research Center for
Marine Bioproducts Engineering. The lead institution is the University of Hawaii
at Manoa with the University of California, Berkeley as a core partner
institution. The award funds the first five years of effort under a new
cooperative agreement, with a potential duration of ten years. The vision of the
ERC for Marine Bioproducts Engineering is to build the foundations of
engineering research and education for a 21st century marine biotechnology
business devoted to high-value products destined for the chemical,
pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, cosmetic, food, feed, and life sciences
industries. The ERC brings together two disparate topics, marine sciences and
process engineering, in order to address apreviously under-utilized bioproducts
resource, the world's'oceans. The Center builds on well-established expertise in
marine sciences at the University of Hawaii and in bioprocessing at the
University of California, Berkeley, the open ocean collection resources at the
University of Hawaii, and the Center's partnership with the nascent marine
biotechnology industry. The world's oceans represent a great, and largely
untapped, resource of marine organisms containing products or the raw materials
for products that are of use in many different industries. The Center's research
spans from exploration of the oceans for new product leads, through the
development of production processes, such as bioreactors and separation
technologies, to the formulation and stability of newly discovered marine
bioproducts through combinatorial chemistry and other techniques. The research
program involves chemists, oceanographers, biologists, bioengineers and chemical
engineers. By introducing marine concepts into undergraduate and graduate
courses taught at both institutions, the Center will produce marine
biotechnology engineers who have theoretical and practical engineering expertise
and a working knowledge of marine and life scie nces disciplines and practices.
The Center will also provide training for professional marine bioengineers, will
outreach to K-12 school children and the general public through the Bishop
Museum in Honolulu, and will partner with community colleges. The Center will
collaborate with industrial partners from Hawaii, the U.S. Mainland and the
Pacific Rim. It also will have support from banks and venture capital firms that
fund the nascent marine biotechnology industry in Hawaii. This award is the
outcome of the entry of the ERC's preproposal in the FY 1997-98 Engineering
Research Centers Competition under the ERC Program Announcement, NSF 97-5.
