This project will provide Student Travel Fellowships to support U.S. based
students traveling to the 14th International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC
2015). The conference, which will be held in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania from
October 11-15, 2015, is the premier major international forum for state-of-the-
art research on all aspects of the Semantic Web - the next generation World Wide
Web. Student Fellowships help cover the travel costs for US students, making it
possible for them to attend the conference. This funding will allow students to
meet key members of the Semantic Web research community, it will give them the
opportunity to disseminate their work, and it will provide a venue for them to
interact with future national and international scientific
collaborators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Semantic Web Conference,
which is now in its fourteenth year, is an interdisciplinary conference that
includes work on: Data Management, Natural Language Processing, Knowledge
Representation and Reasoning, Ontologies and Ontology Languages, Semantic Web
Engineering, Linked Data, User Interfaces and Applications. It regularly has
several hundred attendees. In addition to the main technical tracks, the
conference includes a variety of events that provide opportunities for deeper
interaction amongst researchers at different institutions, at different stages
of their research careers, and researchers who are interested in many different
aspects of Semantic Web Research. Students may benefit from the Doctoral
Consortium - a full day event where students can get critical, but encouraging,
feedback on their work from senior members of the community. They can also
benefit from the career mentoring lunch, where experienced members of the
community from both academia and industry answer questions in an informal
setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information see the project web site
