Professor Yariv and his co-workers are the innovators of the quantum well laser,
a device which has tremendous potential for practical application in opto-
electronic systems. NSF supported this early work and the research proposed here
is a continuation of this effort. One major contribution will be both the
theoretical and experimental study of these devices in order to achieve a major
reduction in the threshold current. Because of materials problem associated with
fabrication of these systems, Dr. Yariv has devoted considerable commitment,
time, money and effort into materials technology to enhance this productive
research.
