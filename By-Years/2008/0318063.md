The keystone role of heterotrophic microbes in driving ecosystem-level effects
of nutrient enrichment &lt;br/&gt;A. D. Rosemond, J. B. Wallace, K.
Suberkropp&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This project builds on a previous nutrient
addition to a headwater stream in the southern Appalachian Mountains. This
addition resulted in rapid decomposition of terrestrially derived organic
matter, enhanced microbial production, especially fungi, and elevated
invertebrate productivity. The proposed study is designed to separate the
relative importance of fungi and bacteria in detritus-based systems. We will
continue to add nutrients and eliminate the fungal component of the microbial
community by adding a fungicide to the treatment stream. By greatly reducing
fungi we will assess their importance to ecosystem processes such as litter
decomposition, overall microbial production and respiration, invertebrate
secondary production, suspended particle export, and organic matter storage. Our
hypotheses will test the nature, and types of relationships between fungi and
bacteria in detritus-based systems, i.e. do fungi and bacteria compete for
carbon and nutrients or do they complement each other? &lt;br/&gt;This study
adds to our understanding the importance of microbial diversity in ecosystem
functions. &lt;br/&gt;
