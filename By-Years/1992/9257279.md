Yang This research is on modeling and simulation of mixed analog/digital circuit
designs. Topics include: 1. Hierarchical modeling and simulation of tightly
coupled, mixed digital circuits; 2. Simulation of high-performance circuits with
complex nonlinear and electromagnetic effects; 3. Modeling and simulation of
optoelectronic integrated circuits, with the focus on automatic model
generation; 4. Development of a technique for fast power waveform simulation
based on analytic digital macromodeling, which makes the method well suited to
simulating circuit netlists derived from layout extraction; 5. Fast simulation
of interconnect problems using asymptotic waveform evaluation so as to obtain
efficiency and accuracy in approximating nonlinear portions of the circuit.
Algorithms for solving these problems, including methods for simulating designs
with over 100,000 transistors, are being developed.
