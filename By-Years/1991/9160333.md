Leading scientists and educators have stressed critical thinking problem
solving as top priorities for science education. A neglected aspect of this
broad area is the ability to make good decisions through logical habits of
thought relating knowledge, uncertainty and human values. This project will seek
to establish the feasibility of developing educational materials and teacher
workshops to help science teachers incorporate these skills into existing
science units which address important problem relating to science, technology
and society. If use of these materials in schools increases the ability of youth
to make wise decisions, the effort can contribute to economic competitiveness.
