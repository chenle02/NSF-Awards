In this two-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project in solid state
physics between Matjaz Lukac, Josef Stefan Institute and Erwin L. Hahn,
University of California, Berkeley, the investigators will study magnetic and
optical resonance techniques and applications to surfaces of single crystals.
Systems, such as rare earth ions in single crystals, will be analyzed. The
collaborating facilities and expertise are complementary. Hahn's innovative and
insightful uses of magnetic and optical resonance techniques combined with Dr.
Lukac's expertise in single crystals and optic spectroscopy will advance our
understanding about these techniques and properties of single crystals.
U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on Cooperation in Science and Technology is supported
through a joint fund consisting of matching contributions from the governments
of the United States and Yugoslavia. The U.S. contribution is provided annually
by the Department of State. No NSF funds are involved. Grants are made to the
principal scientific institution in Yugoslavia, but include dollar funds for
U.S. scientists' travel to Yugoslavia and for Yugoslav scientists' living
expenses in the U.S.
