9600118 Wright This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project from
Consultec Scientific, Inc. seeks to develop a computer simulator that can be
used in place of actual radiation sources. The consequence of the availability
of such a simulator will be a substantial reduction in the cost of training,
provision for a wider variety of training situations, and elimination of the
safety hazards associated with actual radiation sources. Consultec Scientific
proposes to build a computer system that will simulate the presence of various
types of radiation sources in a variety of environments. The Phase I effort
showed that the concept of radiation calculations "on the fly" in a two-
dimensional space is feasible. The Surveyor module developed in Phase I allows a
user to create a radiation environment on the computer screen and conduct a
radiation "survey," interacting with software and hardware instruments. The
Phase II effort will make it possible to use the simulator in three-dimensional
space. The project will develop a wireless, hand-held version of the hardware
instrument for untethered operation; incorporate a three-dimensional location
detection system for location of the wireless hardware device; and create two
other software modules (Radiation Physics Laboratory and Examiner). These
combined components will result in a comprehensive radiation simulator that will
remove radioactive sources from the training environment and reduce the amount
of radiation to which students and faculty are exposed. This simulator is
expected to have numerous commercial applications and to make a major impact on
health physics training. It will improve the efficiency and productivity of
training activities in nuclear medicine, nuclear power production, nuclear
research, nuclear weapon production and disposal, environmental restoration, and
waste management.
