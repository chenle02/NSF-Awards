This project will analyze stable isotopes and taxonomic assemblage of planktic
foraminifera in high-sedimentation-rate cores from the South China and Sulu
Seas. The PIs postulate that large changes in oxygen isotopes observed for the
last interstadial period reflect changes in monsoon-induced precipitation in the
South China Sea. This assumption will be tested by comparing isotopic and
taxonomic data; in the Sulu Sea, the relative roles of sea-surface temperature
and salinity will be assessed by the same methods. Conclusions will be applied
to a Global Circulation Model to assess the possible linkage of the regional
monsoon and circulation changes in the North Atlantic.
