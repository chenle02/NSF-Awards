0352482&lt;br/&gt;Johnson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides partial
support for the acquisition of two instruments necessary for direct examination
of colloidal attachment-detachment dynamics, and direct determination of colloid
and substratum interactions: 1) a system combining a flow cell with total
internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and image analysis capability (Flow-
TIRFM); and 2) an electrochemical atomic force microscope (AFM) with TIRFM
capability. The acquisition will enhance existing research and education
projects in colloidal (bacterial) attachment-detachment dynamics in porous
media, imaging of intercellular and appendageal molecular transport pathways,
identification of structures associated with electron transport across oxide
films, and quantification of interaction of macromolecules with inorganic
surfaces, protein (or polymer)-surface interactions, and determination of the
effects of these interactions on adhesion dynamics with various surfaces.
Benefits to society include improved pathogen transport models for determination
of rules for groundwater resource protection, improved drug delivery strategies,
enhanced composite battery materials, and improved surface preparation
technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
