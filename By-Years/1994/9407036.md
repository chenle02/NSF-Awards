9407036 Steinmetz Marquette University The photochemistry of aryl substituted
di- and tri-silanes will be investigated. The hypothesis will be tested that the
triplet local excited state (3LE) is populated by a 1LE -> CT -> 3LE sequence of
electron transfer processes, which passes through a charge transfer state (CT).
A p-cyanostilbenyl substituted disilane will be used to distinguish the singlet
and triplet LE states by triplet quenching. These states will also be monitored
by unique photo-products from a disilanyl substituted benzo 2.2.2
bicyclooctenone. CT photoreactivity will be monitored through kinetic studies
involving reaction with alcohols. In addition, a study of wavelength effects on
silylene extrusion versus electron transfer in trisilane systems will be
pursued. The photoreactivity of exciplexes will also be probed by tethering the
disilanyl electron transfer donor to electron deficient styrenes. This grant
from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of Professor Mark G.
Steinmetz at Marquette University. The photochemistry of compounds containing
two and three silicon atoms bonded together will be studied. These compounds
will also have a benzene-like substituent bonded to one of the silicon atoms.
Ultraviolet light absorption by these compounds produces excited states from
which photochemistry may proceed. These excited states and photo-products will
be characterized. The results may provide insight to the design of photoresists
that are important in the electronics industry.
