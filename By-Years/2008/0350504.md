Under this award the PIs will be responsible for the curation of the Lamont-
Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) Deep-Sea Sample Repository (D-SSR) which
contains the world's largest collection of sediment cores from the major world
oceans and seas. Total size of the collection is over 18,760 cores and 3,750
dredges. The cores with their potential for high-resolution research position
this collection at the forefront of the focus on abrupt climate change. During
the past three-year proposal period, 30,076 samples from the collection were
distributed to 89 scientists and teachers throughout the world, and 324 new
cores were added to the collection. In addition to actual sediment and rock
samples the repository will passively process core material using and array of
sensors: multi-sensor, corelogging, x-radiography, magnetic susceptibility,
color spectra, and grey-scale analysis. Data will be given out in the form of
computer searches, information on sampling history, digitized core descriptions,
and on publications resulting from use of LDEO material.
