In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry Division,
Prof. Curt Wittig of the University of Southern California will investigate
fundamental chemical reaction processes. In particular, resonances that decay
via competing decomposition pathways will be examined using the nitrate radical
as a prototype system. Additionally, double resonance techniques will be used
for the first time in such investigations involving weakly bound complexes. This
will allow the unequivocal identification of the complexes in which the
reactions are photoinitiated. Complexes such as carbonyl sulfide-hydrogen
bromide and water-carbon monoxide will be considered as prototype systems. The
goal of these investigations is a better understanding of chemical reactions on
a molecular level. The results of this work will be quantitative, mechanistic
data which will serve as benchmarks against which theoretical models of reaction
chemistry can be tested.
