In response to an Announcement of Opportunity for the Global Learning and
Observations to Benefit the Environment Program (GLOBE) this project is designed
to meet GLOBE goals and objectives of linking scientists and schoolchildren in a
global information network with the ultimate goal of better understanding
Earth's environment and changes that take place within it. This proposal
consists of various segments addressing GLOBE Program needs: support for an
existing protocol, support for teacher training and outreach, data quality
control, student surveys on attitudes about the environment and climate
misconceptions, and finally, scientific research based on GLOBE data. This
proposal will support the existing Atmosphere Protocols including an assessment
of the quality of the data already received. Information from other GLOBE
investigations (Soils, Land Cover/Biology, Phenology) and external data will be
used to address scientific questions relating to climate feedback, including
that of human-caused land-use changes.
