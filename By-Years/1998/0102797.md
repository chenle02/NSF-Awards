0102797&lt;br/&gt;Reidy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This U.S.-Mexico award will support
joint collaborative work between Prof. Richard Reidy of the University of North
Texas and Prof. Oscar Mendoza Gonzalez of the Instituto Tecnologico de Saltillo
together with colleagues at CINVESTAV-Queretaro, in the field of biomaterials.
More specifically, the researchers will focus on the relationship between the
structure and surface functionalities of silica xerogels and aerogels and the
consequent growth mechanisms, compositions, and morphologies of hydroxyapatites
grown on these substrates from simulated body fluids.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using small-angle neutron scattering, gas adsorption,
electron microscopy, and a range of instrumentation and expertise available at
the collaborating institutions, the results of this research collaboration
should prove useful in the development of inexpensive bioactive or resorbable
bioceramic materials with many potential bioengineering
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
