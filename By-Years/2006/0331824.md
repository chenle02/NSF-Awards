0331824 Logan In this project we will demonstrate power generation from
wastewater is optimal for current flow in an MFC when substrate is first
fermented, and that power generation can be much higher than previously
believed. Current flow has recently been demonstrated by others from microbial
sediments in the ocean. However, power generation was low and it was not shown
that power was coupled to specific substrates. Our hypothesis is that substrates
produced by fermentation are optimal for electricity production if used by
metal-reducing bacteria. Fermentation end products, such as acetate, ordinarily
are used by slow growing methanogens. However, in a MFC bacteria capable of
metal reduction have higher growth rates and will out grow methanogens. Thus,
electricity generation could be stable and bacteria on the electrode would not
be out competed by methanogens for available substrate.
