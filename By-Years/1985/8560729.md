The inspection of structures to determine the extent of maintenance because of
the aging effects requires more data than can be provided by a visual
inspection. This project plans to automate the acquisition, analysis, and
interpretation of visual data used for inspecting structures. The objective of
the project is to develop a concept and specification for a system which
integrates visual data acquisition, date conversion, visual image processing,
symbolic feature discrimination and pattern recognition, and knowledge-based
interpretation of symbolic features and patterns.
