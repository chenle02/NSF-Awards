This project will support research and educational activities as part of the
Thematic Program on Inverse Problems and Imaging at the Fields Institute in
2012. The organizers aim to create an environment conducive to collaborative
research by combining the particiapnts' high-level expertise from Partial
Differential Equations, Nonlinear Variational Methods, Differential Geometry,
Regularization Theory and Numerical Analysis. Techniques initially developed in
image processing or in microlocal analysis will be extended to treat novel
hybrid inverse problems. Modern faster and more accurate optimization techniques
for recovering data from undersampled measurements will be explored. Nonlocal
methods have been recently proven to be the most efficient techniques in image
denoising and image regularization. Current and future directions for solving a
large range of inverse problems by nonlocal methods and their computational
challenges will be studied.

By integrating research and education, the organizers will introduce next
generation researchers in Medical Imaging to the recent important and deep
mathematical advances in the field. Numerous lectures, graduate and short
courses will be given by leading researchers in the fields of inverse problems
and imaging. These problems have important applications in medical imaging,
geophysical prospecting and nondestructive testing. Graduate and postdoctoral
students will greatly benefit from being exposed to these most active areas of
research in mathematics today. They will also be exposed to interdisciplinary
research mixing theoretical advances with up to date applied issues. Women and
underrepresented groups will be given the opportunity to actively participate in
the program as organizers, speakers, and regular participants. Teams of graduate
students will be offered a summer research experience on concrete problems in
medical imaging.
