Vanderbilt University seeks funds to develop and field-test new applications of
videodisc and hypermedia technology for use in educating preservice teachers of
elementary school mathematics. The project will build upon and extend work
supported by NSF. The proposed areas of development include hypermedia cases,
library materials, research environments, and prototype assessment materials.
The materials will be tested at Vanderbilt and eleven institutions of higher
education in Alabama which are already structured into a consortium for the
project Validating the Use of Hypermedia in Elementary Mathematics Education,
supported under the NSF project TPE-9053826. Cost sharing by Vanderbilt
University is 11% of the total cost requested from NSF.
