The field of homotopy theory is the study of mathematical invariants that are
insensitive to deformations. It is applicable whenever one is interested in
studying qualitative aspects of a system, emergent properties of a statistical
ensemble of structures, or whenever there might be imprecision in the
specification of the state of a system. In recent years the methods of homotopy
theory have found use in fields as diverse as condensed matter physics and the
foundations of mathematics. This project aims to bolster these relationships
with new tools from algebraic topology, and to apply them to these and other
areas of mathematics and science. There are applications of this work to
condensed matter physics, classical algebraic geometry, algebraic topology and
categorical logic.

The scope of this project involves several interrelated areas of study. One of
these, on algebraic vector bundles, depicts a new interface between complex
analysis and algebraic topology, and is intended to get at the obstruction to
topological vector bundles having algebraic structures. Another explores the
prospect of investigating the aggregate of all models of a given physical
system, with the idea that the phases of physically measurable quantities occur
as topological invariants of the space of models. The two principal
investigators will continue their joint work on strict units in chromatic
homotopy theory. This project has produced many striking analogies between
chromatic homotopy theory and higher category theory. Six further projects
involve new stuctures in homotopy theory and its applications. One investigates
new formulas and expressions of duality in chromatic homotopy theory, another
explores the "transchromatic" version of the hierarchy of limits expressed by
the principal investigator's earlier work on "ambidexterity," and a third offers
a new explanation for the ubiquity of Lie algebras occurring in stable homotopy
theory. Other projects involve applications of homotopy theory to categorical
logic, to the characterization of higher categories of interest in mathematical
physics, and to a new construction of the famous de Rham-Witt complex used in
number theory and algebraic geometry.
