This project is concerned with the relations between the ordinary and modular
representation theory of finite classical groups, and in particular, the
relations between the Deligne- Lusztig theory and the Brauer theory, when the
characteristic for the modular theory is unequal to the underlying
characteristic of the groups. A number of questions on the modular
representation theory of these groups is suggested by the recent classification
of the l-blocks of these groups. This research is in the general area of the
representation theory of finite classical groups. One of the main applications
of group theory to other mathematical and scientific fields is in representation
theory, and finite classical groups are a primary source of finite simple
groups.
