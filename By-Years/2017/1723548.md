This award provides partial funding for a monograph on the role of ice in
clouds. Ice crystals play an important role in the formation, evolution and
impact of clouds on weather and climate. The monograph is a summary of the
scientific field's current state of understanding of how ice forms and evolves
and of our technological capability to measure the critical properties of these
ice crystals. Broad dissemination of the results of past research and workshops
will help the community to guide future research that is necessary in ice
microphysics.

The monograph, titled "Ice Formation and Evolution in Clouds and Precipitation:
Measurement and Modeling Challenges," has 5 primary objectives: 1) To summarize
our current understanding of ice evolution in clouds, from first ice formation
to removal by precipitation, melting, evaporation or sublimation, 2) To identify
those processes in ice formation and evolution that are not well understood, and
highlight the impacts of those knowledge gaps on the ability to forecast
weather, predict future climate, understand cloud electrification, and aviation
hazards, 3) To assess current and new measurement systems that characterize ice
particle properties and of models that diagnose or prognose ice evolution, 4) To
evaluate and compare methodologies used for processing measurements of cloud
properties and recommend best practices that minimize uncertainties and maximize
extracted information, 5) To formulate a list of recommended actions that can
and should be implemented to improve our understanding of ice evolution in
cloud.
