9306696 Kvam An interdisciplinary effort will be followed to examine the growth
fundamentals and structure of CVD growth of SeGe alloys on Si(100), over
insulating layers and in constrained configurations. Studies will emphasize
seeded epitaxial overgrowth of both two- and three-dimensionally constrained
growth configurations. The near-term target of this research is the fundamental
understanding and reliable controlled production of heterostructure layers
within a fully confined cavity by epitaxial lateral overgrowth. Highly strained
and strain- relieved materials will be examined for their microstructural
integrity. The effects of limited lateral dimensions may be tailored to remove
defects from device regions. Surface infrared spectroscopy, in combination with
kinetic modeling, will be used to analyze the behavior of the growth, carrier
and etching gas species to provide quantitative descriptions of growth behavior
in both full wafer and seeded epitaxial growth. Oxidation due to atmospheric
exposure and to thermal treatment will also be examined. %%% Novel growth
configurations(selective and confined) are proposed to employ SiGe layers in Si
for high-speed transistors and optoelectronic devices. Surface reactions which
control this growth, and the quality of the materials produced, will be
assessed. Structural integrity of strained layers and practical oxidation
processes(both protective and harmful) will be examined. Modeling will be done
for use in fundamental process understanding and industrial scale-up. This
research will enable reliable uniformity even in highly integrated three
dimensional structures and lead to improving the general performance of advanced
devices and integrated circuits used in computing, information processing, and
telecommunications. ***
