Zirin and his collaborators will use the frequency-agile interferometer at Owens
Valley Radio Observatory to map coronal magnetic fields and electrical currents
in active regions and near flares. They will also investigate the microwave
spectra of active regions, small bipolar magnetic regions, and flares. Solar
flares and other forms of activity near sunspots have dramatic effects on Earth.
They are caused by electrical currents running in the solar corona. The radio
detector developed by Zirin and Hurford, the "frequency-agile interferometer" at
Owens Valley Radio Observatory, is the only instrument able to make detailed
three-dimensional maps of these coronal currents. The mapping procedure will be
perfected in time for the vigorous solar activity anticipated during the next
solar maximum, in about 1990-1991.
