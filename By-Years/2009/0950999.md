This grant is supporting the PI and his three graduate students to attend the
11th meeting of the European Social Cognition Network (ESCON) in Warsaw, Poland,
on August 26-30, 2009. This conference provides an international forum for the
exchange of the most recent scientific developments in the field of Social
Cognition. The intellectual merits of this conference are extensive. First, the
conference is innovative in its cross-national representation (some 16 countries
will be represented, including the best European labs). The PI, as one of the
invited plenary speakers, will also be afforded the opportunity to present his
research to an international audience and to discuss his work more broadly and
informally with attendees. This will allow the PI and his students to learn
from, and present to, an audience that approaches social cognition questions
from a different perspective, and get exposed to some of the most cutting-edge
research being done these days in European countries. Further, the conference
provides a platform for young researchers -- including the three graduate
students whose travel would be supported on this grant -- to present their
research ideas and to receive extensive feedback from a variety of experts in
the field. This should greatly stimulate their professional development, not
only conceptually, but also in terms of contacts with international colleagues.
Finally, one of the broader goals of this meeting is to foster international
research collaborations and to develop additional opportunities for young
researchers to become integrated into the international scientific community.
