This dissertation research conducts an comparative study of the agricultural
productivity of Removal Period (1835-1838) Cherokee Indian farmers and white
farmers who later cultivated the same land. At this time, the argument for
removal revolved around the inefficient agricultural practices used by the
Cherokee. Using the stochastic distance frontier approach, the technical
efficiency, as well as other productivity measures, for each Cherokee and white
household can be estimated. Yet, the goal for this research is not to justify an
antiquated policy, but to examine the variation of efficiency across Cherokee
farms as well as between these two groups. By isolating the differences between
Cherokee and white societies, this study will strengthen our understanding of
Indian/White relations at this particular juncture. The data collection and
analysis will add greatly to the dearth of economic studies on Native Americans.
Despite a vast literature on Cherokee acculturation and removal, this project is
the first large-scale comparative study of the agricultural performance between
these two groups.
