With the aim of understanding the process and mechanism of molecular evolution,
three mutually related research projects are proposed. The first project is for
identifying positive Darwinian selection at the DNA level by examining the
relative rates of synonymous and nonsynonymous (amino acid altering) nucleotide
substitution. Both statistical analyses of DNA sequence data and mathematical
modeling of nucleotide substitution will be conducted. Special attention will be
given to the active and contact sites of proteins involved in the immune and
nonimmune systems in vertebrates. We are particularly interested in examining
whether overdominant selection is involved in the antigen-recognition sites of
proteins concerned with the immune system. The second project is intended to
clarify the effect of population bottlenecks on the divergence of nucleotide
sequences within and between populations. Stochastic theory of population
genetics will be used to solve this problem, and the mathematical theory
developed will be applied to analyze data on mitochondrial DNA phylogenies. The
third project is to study the evolution of the major histocompatibility complex
gene family, which is one of the most complicated genetic systems in
vertebrates. Analyzing DNA sequences available, we will examine the evolutionary
relationships of genes within and between loci as well as within and between
species. The functional change of different groups of genes in the evolutionary
process will also be investigated.
