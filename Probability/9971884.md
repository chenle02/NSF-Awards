The investigator is exploring tilings and related mathematical objects from the
perspectives of combinatorics and probability theory. In the study of tilings
one examines the different ways in which a region can be built by fitting
together smaller pieces (called tiles) taken from a small collection of shapes.
The combinatorial perspective focuses on the question `In how many ways can this
tiling problem be solved?' while the probabilistic perspective focuses on the
question `What does a typical solution to this tiling problem look like?' In
many instances these tiling models are equivalent to models studied by
statistical mechanicians for decades, but the new outlook is leading to many
results that the physicists missed. The tools that are used in attacking these
questions range from complex analysis and the calculus of variations to ergodic
theory and interacting particle systems.

On one level, this is basic mathematical research whose main motivation (like
that of most theoretical mathematics) arises from the desire to understand
phenomena that are simple yet surprising, especially in cases where existing
analytical tools do not make it possible to provide rigorous proofs of
empirically well-founded conjectures. A further (and potentially more
applicable) motivation for this research comes from the fact that tilings are
simplified models of matter, particularly of matter that incorporates randomness
at the very finest levels of organization. In many cases, the precise details of
the tiling problem (the shape of the tiles and of the region to be tiled)
enforce a kind of large-scale heterogeneity reminiscent of physical systems in
which different phases of a substance (such as ice, liquid water, and steam)
coexist. In studying tiling models, one can prove rigorous results concerning
the ways in which the boundaries between different phases are maintained
thermodynamically. Thus the study of tilings can serve as a kind of a test-bed
in which some ideas about random media can be subjected to mathematical
analysis.
