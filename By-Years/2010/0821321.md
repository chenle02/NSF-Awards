The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) is a pathfinder system for the Square
Kilometer Array (SKA), a next-generation array of very many antennas that will
be used to probe many large-scale facets of the universe. One project of the MWA
is to attempt to make sensitive, low-frequency observations from its radio-quiet
site in Western Australia, to search for redshifted hydrogen from near the
earliest epochs of the universe. As part of the project, much will be learned
about observing at low frequencies with large arrays of individual antennas.
This project will fund a the acquisition of a large (500 terrabyte) archive to
store much of the raw data obtained from the MWA, which can then be studied and
reprocessed at later dates to refine the design of similar future instruments.
