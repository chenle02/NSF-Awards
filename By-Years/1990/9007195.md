This research investigates theoretical and practical issues in the design and
evaluation of parallel algorithms, and involves cooperative work in theory and
systems. The project ideally has four objectives. First, to develop a high level
language for expressing parallel algorithms such that there is a natural
correspondence between algorithmic concepts and programming language constructs
and an algorithm can be expressed without forcing a serialization. Second, to
study and develop techniques for mapping algorithms expressed in this high level
notation to various architectures subject to simple user specified constraints.
Third, to study instrumentation techniques for monitoring an algorithm's runtime
behaviour on a given architecture. Fourth, to investigate issues related to
giving high level visual feedback to the user on the performance of
implementation of his or her algorithm on a specific architecture. These will
set up an interactive loop between the user and the system that will enable
rapid design and prototyping of parallel algorithms.
