9970009 Henson This project emphasizes mathematical logic in relation to other
areas of mathematics and computer science. C. Ward Henson will use methods from
logic to solve problems within these areas and will use logic as a basis for
formulating new concepts and posing new problems within them. This project has
the following main aspects: (a) further development of Henson's logic for
structures that are based on metric spaces, especially on Banach spaces, and
continued application of this theory to problems in functional analysis; (b)
study of exponentiation and other elementary functions from the logical point of
view; and (c) continued investigation of the computational complexity of logical
decision problems, especially those arising in the most central areas of
mathematics. During the past 40 years or more, techniques from logic have not
only clarified the foundations of mathematics, but they have contributed new
tools for solving mathematical problems. These tools have been especially
effective in those areas of mathematics that are close to algebra and number
theory. In this project, C. Ward Henson aims to make those tools from logic
equally effective in the areas of mathematics that are close to topology,
geometry, and analysis. ***
