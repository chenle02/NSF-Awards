This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2). The goal of this project is to improve estimates of
ground NO2 and ozone concentrations over the contiguous U.S. at high spatial and
temporal resolution using machine learning techniques. This data will be useful
in multiple fields, including public health, environmental health, air quality,
agricultural research and environmental
justice/inequality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will address the following
three science questions: (1) Which machine learning model(s) can best estimate
the ground NO2 and ozone values in specific regions? (2) Which
variables/parameters have more significance to estimate the ground NO2 and ozone
values in the model? (3) How accurate are the ground NO2 and ozone products? The
PIs plan to use ozone profile data and tropospheric NO2 vertical column density
(TropNO2VCD) data from OMI and TROPOMI, and the synthetic data of TEMPO in
conjunction of meteorological data, land cover and ground measurements from the
U.S. Environmental Agency (U.S. EPA).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
