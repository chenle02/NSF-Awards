Equipment and experiments are provided for teaching the behavior of structures
to undergraduate engineers. Instruction begins with simple linear elastic
experiments, progressing through structures exhibiting geometrically non-linear
behavior (e.g., beam-column) and post linear conditions involving inelastic
material response (e.g., the ultimate load capacity of reinforced concrete
beams). All experiments will be done using small-scale structures that can be
easily prefabricated and built by students. The overall objectives of these
experiments are: (i) to enable the student to gain a better understanding of
structural behavior; (ii) to give them an additional experience in experimental
work beyond that gained in the first materials behavior laboratory course; and
(iii) to serve as a motivational force and as a general enrichment of their
educational experience.
