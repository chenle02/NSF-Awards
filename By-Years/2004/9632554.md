9632554 Robb This proposal is on research to examine two key issues in the
development of enzymes and other proteins from thermophilic microorganisms which
are to: (1) develop processing methods to obtain significant quantities of these
enzymes for further investigation and potential application, and (2) examine the
mechanisms of pressure-induced stabilization of proteins from extreme
thermophiles and devise approaches to manipulate the thermostability of these
enzymes. Site-directed mutagenesis is to be used in a systematic way, along with
biocatalytic studies at elevated pressures to elucidate the effects of pressure
on protein thermostability and the interaction of subunits in these multimeric
enzymes. ***
