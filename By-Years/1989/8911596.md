One of the most exciting topics today in the area of stellar evolution is the
formation of new stars and of planetary systems. We have convincing
observational evidence that these events take place in interstellar clouds of
gas and dust that have been compressed sufficiently (by a still poorly
understood process) for gravity to pull together locally and at 100s of places
the gas and dust. As the matter collapses, its residual angular momentum causes
it to rotate more rapidly, resulting in a central condensation and a surrounding
disk. Matter from the disk continues to be accreted by the central condensation,
which evolves into a T Tauri star. The surrounding disk that remains may give
rise to planets. The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to continue with the
optical and infrared observations and the theoretical research of these young
stellar objects, which was previously funded by NSF. In particular, he will
focus on T Tauri stars, their variability, and the disks that surround many of
them. He will also study the magnetic fields associated with the activity cycles
of cool stars.
