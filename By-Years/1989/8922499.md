The principal investigator will study the interplay between geometry and
analysis on complete manifolds. The existence of harmonic maps between non-
compact complete manifolds will be given special consideration. Earlier work of
the investigator as well as the work of Hamilton, Schoen, Yau, Liao, and Tam
will serve as the basis for a new study of harmonic maps from simply connected
strongly negatively curved manifolds into Hadamard manifolds. The investigator
will also study one of Yau's conjectures that complete Ricci-flat Kaehler
manifolds with finite topological type must be compactifiable to a compact
Kaehler manifold. Generalized surfaces, and functions between them, will be
studied in detail by the investigator. Specifically, he will concentrate on such
surfaces within certain Ricci curvature ranges. An example of the kinds of
surfaces to be studied would be the infinite extension of a saddle; this surface
has the property that in one direction the surface curves away upward while in a
different direction it curves away downward. The greater these two separate
curvatures, the greater this Ricci curvature.
