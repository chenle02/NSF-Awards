The investigator exploits the Whitney Reduction Network, a new tool for
processing and analyzing data sets of high ambient dimension. Whitney's theorem
motivates the architecture of the network, which consists of a "good
projection," designed to be bilipschitz and retain the differential structure of
the data, followed by a nonlinear inverse with good interpolation properties
inherited from the choice of projection. The approach provides a natural
representation of the data as the graph of a function that is approximated using
radial basis functions (RBFs). The basic technique may be implemented in a
variety of ways, hence the development and evaluation of a broad class
algorithms is a primary focus of the research. Problems and algorithms examined
include adaptive basis methods, RBF center selection, (spatio-temporal)
clustering methods, direct and iterative methods for solving for RBF weights,
RBF approximation with constraints and a local implementation of the basic
algorithm.

Scientific research has to a certain degree become a problem in data
processing. High-speed numerical simulations of intractable model equations of
natural phenomena produce enormous quantities of data. Understanding the
phenomena means extracting and interpretting information in the data. The main
goal of the project is to develop mathematical tools to produce efficient
representations of data so as to expose the information it contains in a manner
that the orignal data does not. Potential applications of this methodology are
widespread and multi-disciplinary. In particular, the basic research undertaken
here has direct applications through collaboration with Honeywell Corporation
and the Air Force materials research program at Wright Patterson Air Force Base.
