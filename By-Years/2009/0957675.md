In this project the PI will develop a cellular biophysics program at the
predominantly-undergraduate Physics Department at Miami University in Ohio. By
involving students in all stages of the research process, emphasis will be on
discovery-oriented learning and undergraduate scholarship. The research
activities focus on cellular biophysical studies at high hydrostatic pressures.
The educational activities will be synergistic with research goals and will
emphasize research mentoring and integration of discovery elements into
biophysics courses for STEM and non-STEM majors. The PI will study physiological
responses, in vivo, to hydrostatic pressure. Cellular energy metabolism related
to respiration and mitochondrial function will be assessed by monitoring
endogenous fluorescence from metabolic co-factors such as reduced nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NADH). The main goal of this project is to characterize
free/bound NADH fluorescence from a model cellular system under metabolic
conditions that are well defined under ambient pressure. The outcome will be the
identification of pressure-sensitive metabolic states. The PI will continue to
build a strong record for mentoring undergraduates who will be key participants
in completing the research project.
