The categories Proximate and Obviative are familiar from Algonkian linguistics,
where they serve to distinguish the 3rd person of greatest discourse salience
from all other 3rd persons in a given span. In Algonkian, these categories are
morphologically visible and though anchored in discourse, they play a major role
in the syntax of the clause. While much previous work has explored the relevance
of discourse salience to natural language morphosyntax, the categories Proximate
and Obviative have generally been viewed as simply one language-particular way
to relate the two. The present project explores the idea that relations of
obviation are much more widely relevant, functioning cross-linguistically as an
important structuring device which mediates between discourse and clausal
syntax. The key claim to be investigated is that these relations are relevant
not only to languages with overt obviative morphology like the Algonkian
languages, but also to languages lacking such morphology. The project focuses on
languages of the Mayan family as a case-study, especially Tzotzil and Tz'utujil,
languages from distinct sub-families.
