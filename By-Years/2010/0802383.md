Montgomery County Community College (MCCC), in partnership with Rohm and Haas
company, is creating an in-house laboratory service facility to provide MCCC's
biotechnology students with real-world training opportunities. The laboratory
functions as a contract research organization to test new proteins developed by
Rohm and Haas for use in biopharmaceutical manufacturing. The project is
incorporating work-based experiences into existing science courses, exposing
students to state-of-the-art instrumentation, and enhancing STEM content in
technician education courses. Besides establishing a working biotechnology
training facility, the project is enhancing MCCC's biotechnology curriculum,
providing summer internship opportunities for regional high school or community
college teachers, providing students with additional training opportunities at
company facilities, developing a laboratory practical exam for assessing student
learning and skills, and pilot testing a strategic partnership model between a
community college and a biotechnology company.
