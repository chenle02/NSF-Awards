During the week of September 11, 1988, Hurricane Gilbert struck the Caribbean
and Mexico. Characterized as one of the most powerful hurricanes ever recorded,
with sustained wind speeds of 175 mph, Gilbert caused enormous destruction. Two
impacted communities will be the focal points of this study which will address
community-wide policy issues related to the reconstruction process following the
Hurricane Gilbert disaster. The study will attempt to improve the knowledge base
that can be used by local, State, and Federal officials both before and
following a disaster. With findings from this study, public officials should be
better able to anticipate and respond to the range of policy issues they may
face. This knowledge base can also be applied to various kinds of natural
disasters in various geographic locations. So, for example, given the potential
for catastrophic consequences of earthquakes in the United States, and thus the
need for knowledge about reconstruction, research based on the Hurricane Gilbert
recovery could fulfill a significant national need.
