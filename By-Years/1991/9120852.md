The Principal Investigator, together with senior researcher A. Edelman, plan to
apply geometric techniques of singularity theory to analyze and explain the
behavior of certain numerical algorithms widely used in eigensystem analysis and
systems and control. These algorithms include such apparently diverse
applications as computing the Jordan canonical form of a matrix, determining the
distance from a control system to the nearest uncontrollable system, and
"clustering" the zeros of a polynomial. Although there are algorithms for these
problems that often work in practice, there are certain classes of problems for
which they perform quite poorly. These algorithms have been widely studied and
their failures duly noted, but no unifying explanation of their behavior has yet
emerged. Numerical Linear Algebra is an area of importance in its own right and
has major implications in many areas of computing.
