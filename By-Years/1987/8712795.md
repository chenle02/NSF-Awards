This award deals with a program of studies in intermediate energy nuclear
physics using the accelerator facilities at MIT- BATES, TRIUMF, and IUCF. At
MIT-BATES measurements are proposed of the gamma-ray angular correlation when
electrons are scattered from protons inelastically with the emission of a gamma-
ray at the (e,e) resonance region of the nucleon. At TRIUMF and IUCF, inelastic
proton scattering studies will be continued, with gamma-rays detected in
coincidence with the scattered protons. In addition, at IUCF, measurements will
be made of the differential cross sections and analyzing powers for the
intermediate energy proton capture reaction. This experimental program is based
on the use of a very large sodium-iodide scintillator spectrometer which has
been optimized for high-resolution detection of gamma-rays in the energy range
up to about 500 MeV. The development of the sodium-iodide scintillator
spectrometer has been made possible through various university grants.
