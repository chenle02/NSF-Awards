ABSTRACT Thole 9624591 This work was awarded under the CAREER program and
includes objectives for both research and education. The research plan addresses
the effects of free-stream turbulence on turbine blade heat transfer.
Experimental study of a up-scaled version of a first row stator vane will yield
information on the flow field and the heat transport. Optimization of film
cooling of the turbine blade, using both numerical simulation and experimental
measurements will then follow. The educational plan includes recruiting women
engineering students, retaining women engineering students and restructuring
courses in the thermal sciences area. Seminars at rural high schools in southern
Illinois will be aimed at attracting women and at informing guidance counselors
of opportunities in engineering. In addition, an optional all-women engineering
design course will be offered at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
