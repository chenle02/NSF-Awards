Minority students from three HBCU;s (Historically Black Colleges and
Universities) and a major university (The University of South Carolina) will
work with three geology professors for two summers; additionally, students from
the local HBCU (Benedict College) will have the opportunity to continue working
on their projects during the academic year. The program proposes to accomplish
two main objectives: (1) to provide research experiences in the geosciences for
regional minority students, and (2) to expose them to alternatives to strictly
theoretical approaches to science; many minority students never get this
opportunity. The participants will gain experience in geologic field work;
sample collection/preservation; data gathering and analysis; and oral and
written presentation of scientific results. Inherent to these research
experiences will be exposure to geologic information (both formally and
informally), and the opportunity to work with accomplished researchers. The
projects include environmentally relevant areas of research, namely: (1) the
physico-chemical properties of saprolites of the South Carolina Piedmont, and
biogeochemistry of salt marshes of South Carolina.
