A one dimensional model of itinerant electrons interacting with an
antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 chain is introduced and solved. The model is designed
to create ferromagnetic spin polarons around each itinerant electron. The model
is mapped onto a sine- Gordon Hamiltonian of three massless Bose fields. A
renormalization group analysis of the bosonic theory shows that the original
model possesses quasi long range odd-parity superconductivity and spin density
wave order. Relevance to high temperature and heavy fermion superconductors is
discussed.
