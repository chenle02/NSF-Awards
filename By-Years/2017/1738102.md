This grant will enable students to attend the Verification Mentoring Workshop
(VMW 2017) which will be co-located with the International Conference on
Computer Aided Verification (CAV) in Heidelberg (Germany), July 22-28, 2017. CAV
is one of the premier conferences in computer science, dedicated to the
advancement of the theory and practice of computer-aided formal analysis methods
for hardware and software systems. The purpose of Verification Mentoring
Workshop is to provide mentoring and career advice to early-stage graduate
students, to attract them to pursue research careers in the area of computer-
aided verification. Funded students will benefit greatly from the opportunity to
engage in the critical technical, professional, and social exchanges that both
conferences foster.

Computer-aided verification covers a broad range of applications, from ensuring
the correctness and safety of computer systems, to improving design and
development productivity. The funded students will attend CAV, a top conference
where they will learn about current research problems and interact with leaders
in the field, and the VMW workshop which will focus on mentoring and career
advice specific to early-stage graduate students who aim to pursue research
careers in the area of computer-aided verification.
