This grant supports a conference on "GPS Measurements in Geodynamics". The
purpose is to plan the future of the GPS program of field measurements, which
are rapidly becoming the primary tool for studying crustal deformation over
regions of tens to hundreds of kilometers. During the past two years, the NSF
has sponsored the acquisition of GPS receivers by the University Navstar
Consortium (UNAVCO) and the use of these receivers by different groups of
investigators for experiments along the Pacific-North American plate boundary in
California, between several of the Hawaiian Islands, and in Yellowstone Plateau
- Hebgen Lake region of Wyoming and Montana.
