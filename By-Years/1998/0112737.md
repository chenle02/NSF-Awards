Abstract

ROVs, AUVs and other submarine robotic systems deliver quantitative data from
sensors at a huge and escalating rate. Usually these data are stored for later
processing and are viewed in real time as numbers flashing by on a screen. What
is needed is a way to utilize these data more fully in real time to optimize the
use of robotic vehicles for science. This proposal explores three ways of making
progress on this goal. 1) develop interactive 3-D graphic interfaces for data
display, 2) develop sensor-based macros for performing routine tasks such as
surveys, docking, obstacle avoidance and other functions, 3) Test the effect on
mission performance of prioritizing data transmission over low-bandwidth
acoustic channels, These will be developed on full-scale dynamically positioned
vehicles and will extend the present capabilities of underwater robotic vehicles
for more difficult and complex tasks.
