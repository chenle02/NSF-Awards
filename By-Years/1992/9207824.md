This work involves the development of a consensus document by a
multidisciplinary team of scientists on the needs for ecological freshwater
research in the United States. This report will be developed in light of the
national need for a predictive understanding of freshwater ecological systems
and resources in the context of environmental change. Document development will
take place at the University of Washington in 1992, building upon previous
disciplinary efforts to articulate research agendas for specific types of
freshwaters (e.g. streams, lakes, wetlands and reservoirs) and for specific
scales of interest (e.g. organisms to landscapes). Products of the
multidisciplinary collaboration will be a consensus document of key issues, an
analysis of each issue, priorities for future research directions, communication
of significant advances that can be achieved if the priority recommendations are
followed, and an analysis of how priority recommendations could be implemented.
The report will synthesize the current status of freshwater ecological research,
as well identify the most significant future directions for this discipline. It
will also enhance our understanding of research and management needs for the
freshwaters which sustain the social, economic, and ecological systems of North
America.
