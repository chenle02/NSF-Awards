The project investigates the dynamics of transition fronts and other nonlinear
waves in spatially discrete systems. These waves play a major role in
transporting energy in lattices and mechanical metamaterials, engineered
structures that exploit instabilities of their components to yield a desired
collective response. The project aims to advance the fundamental understanding
of the energy transfer phenomena associated with the wave propagation. This
information is important for designing novel mechanical metamaterials with
desired characteristics that enable applications in soft robotics, morphing
surfaces, reconfigurable devices, and mechanical logic, among others. Due to the
ubiquity of nonlinear transition waves in physical and biological settings,
understanding their properties, as well as the conditions for their existence
and stability, is relevant in fields such as mechanical engineering, materials
science, condensed matter physics, and biophysics. The project will provide
research training opportunities for doctoral students.

This project will study traveling transition waves in a Fermi-Pasta-Ulam lattice
and its various extensions that include viscous dissipation, diatomic structure,
and long-range interactions. The intent is to provide insights into the effects
of nonlinearity, nonconvexity, dissipation, heterogeneity, and nonlocality on
the existence and stability of different types of transition waves and the
extent to which some of these effects can be captured by quasicontinuum
approximations. Open fundamental questions in the dynamics of transition waves
will be addressed, including the dispersive mechanism of energy transfer inside
the transition front of a supersonic kink and the structure of the kinetic
relations for subsonic kinks. The research program involves the development of
analytical and numerical approaches, such as representing traveling waves as
fixed points of a nonlinear map and constructing semi-analytical solutions of
the problems with piecewise linear nearest-neighbor interactions, that will be
useful in other studies of discrete nonlinear systems. The constructed solutions
will serve as benchmark cases for testing quasicontinuum approximations and
inform the investigation of the fully nonlinear problems. Numerical explorations
of the consequences of instability will clarify the solution structure and
possibly reveal bifurcations of other nonlinear waveforms.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
