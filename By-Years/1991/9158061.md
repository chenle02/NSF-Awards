Adaptive control has evolved in the past three decades and has provided a
framework within which the control of unknown dynamic systems can be carried
out. While fundamental results have been derived for linear time-invariant
systems with unknown parameters, the scope of theory needs to be significantly
enlarged to include nonlinearities, unmodeled dynamics, and large parameter
variations before adaptive control can be used as a design methodology for
complex dynamic systems. The research will focus on flexible structures,
aircraft systems, and tactile sensing for robots. The intent is to directly
address, in each application, the underlying dynamical system and its
peculiarities. The objective is to develop adaptive controllers, for each
application, by understanding the nature of uncertainties present and the
quality of prior information.
