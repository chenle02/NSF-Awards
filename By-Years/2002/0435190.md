Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lightweight embeddable sensor systems are
revolutionizing the way that we use computers. They have many potential
applications, both in the home and in the workplace, creating systems that
automatically act to enhance conditions for living and working while reporting
useful information to central collecting points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research investigates new technologies for low-power wireless sensors, including
new computational devices, new operating systems, and new algorithms and
protocols for exploiting the resulting capabilities. The methods being employed
include advanced circuit design, discrete mathematics, algorithm design and
analysis, and specialized tools for the development of new software. The
research team includes both computer engineers, telecommunications engineers,
and computer scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific results from our work
will include sensor platforms that can operate with very little power, allowing
for extended, unattended use. Other results include sensor data recovery
mechanisms based on mobile platforms, allowing for rapid data collection as cars
or other mobile platforms move through fields of sensors. New software tools
will also be developed that collect, combine, and present information to human
users in a meaningful manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from this project are
being made available to research and development engineers throughout the
country. Processors, novel algorithms, software tools, and operating systems
will be made available on the Internet, and will be described in scholarly
journals and at conferences. An effort is being made, in particular, to make
these results available to corporations interested in furthering their
application and making them commercially available to the public at
large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
