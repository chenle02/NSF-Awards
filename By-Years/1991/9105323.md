We propose to develop an instrument for x-ray magnetic circular dichroism
experiments on paramagnetic samples of bioinorganic interest. It will record
fluorescence-detected x-ray absorption spectra (XAS) and x-ray magnetic circular
dichroism (XMCD) measurements. The device will be optimized for the vanadium
through copper L-edges (500-1000 eV). Preliminary experiments will be conducted
on paramagentic V, Mn, Fe, Cu and Mo model compounds with known molecular
structure and magnetic properties. Crystallographically characterized small
proteins such as azurin and various ferrodoxins will also be examined. The x-ray
sources and monochromators for this project are provided by national synchrotron
radiation laboratories (NSLS and SSRL). Ultimately, the instrument will be used
at the Advanced Light Source, a new high brightness soft x-ray ring under
construction in Berkeley.
