Adding instruction-level parallelism to an architecture is a technique becoming
popular for increasing power in modern computers. One consequence of this trend
is the need to include instruction scheduling in a compiler. ``Global
Instruction Scheduling Without Copies'' investigates a method of global
sch\-eduling which, unlike other global scheduling techniques does not suffer
from the need for compensation copies. The work's goal is refining a technique
for scheduling which will work better than existing methods for ILP
architectures with limited parallelism, a characteristic of ILP architectures
found today, and expected for superscalar architectures in the future. The study
investigates dominator-path scheduling (DPS) in some detail and compare DPS to
other global scheduling methods. Since DPS is better suited than other
scheduling techniques for the levels of ILP found in current architectures, one
outcome of the research is the ability to generate better code for currently
popular computers. Additionally, the work quantifies the parallelism available
in imperative programs when compensation copies are not allowed. This
measurement of such parallelism will influence the design of ILP architectures
in the future.
