This project examines how the brain becomes specialized to learn language over
development using state-of-the-art functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
Previous fMRI developmental studies have only examined one age group, have
examined a wide age range (i.e., from kindergarten through adolescence) and/or
have not examined multiple aspects of language processing in the same children.
This project will overcome previous shortcomings by studying the same
individuals at two time points during a period of rapid language development (5
to 7 years of age). Longitudinal approaches (following the same individual over
time) are rarely used in developmental brain imaging research, but are crucial
for gaining insights into how the brain acquires language. This study will also
overcome previous shortcomings by using multiple language tasks, revealing
developmental changes in specialization of brain function. A significant
strength of this research is the use of behavioral evidence in the study of
language development to generate questions regarding brain development. The
study evaluates the novel hypothesis that greater connectivity between brain
regions early in development results in increasing specialization of brain
regions later in development. This project will integrate research and education
by providing training to a post-doctoral research associate and several
undergraduate students. This project will broaden the participation of
underrepresented groups by providing in depth internships for high school
students from underrepresented minorities. Project dissemination will occur
widely, not only through professional journals and conferences, but also to
audiences consisting of high school students, undergraduates, parents, teachers
and administrators. This project will fundamentally advance the field's
understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying language acquisition in early
childhood, while also laying the groundwork for future investigations of
language impairment in this age range.
