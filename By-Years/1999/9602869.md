This grant supports the research at the Michigan State University National
Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory of a faculty member from the University of
Michigan at Dearborn, a primarily undergraduate institution. The research work
involves undergraduate students in investigations of heavy ion reactions and
scattering experiments with advanced detector systems. The experiments will
elucidate the properties of exotic new nuclear species using radioactive nuclear
beams.
