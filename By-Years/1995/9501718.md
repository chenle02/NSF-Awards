9501718 Muraleetharan The objective is to develop a fully-coupled analysis
procedure to study the static and dynamic behavior of unsaturated soils, and to
validate the analysis procedure using geotechnical centrifuge model test
results. The analysis procedure involves the finite element implementation of
the equations governing the dynamic behavior of a three-phase system consisting
of pore fluid, pore gas and soil skeleton. The governing equations are derived
by extending Biot's formulation for the dynamic behavior of a fluid-saturated
porous media to a three-phase system, with an independent verification using
mixture theory. In developing these governing equations, special attention is
focused on defining the appropriate set of constitutive equations. This analysis
procedure will improve the understanding of the behavior and design for static
and earthquake loading of structures such as landfill clay covers and bottom
liners and compacted soil embankments. The developed analysis procedure will
also help to prevent the huge financial losses caused each year by the damage to
houses, buildings, roads and pipelines resulting from the shrinking and swelling
of soils. Furthermore, the analysis procedure as well as the centrifuge tests
will provide a better understanding of the flow of water through unsaturated
soils, an important problem in studying the migration of pollutants through
soils. EDUCATION PLAN The education plan is a comprehensive approach to
familiarizing undergraduate and graduate students with the emerging cross-
disciplinary field of geo-environmental engineering and current research and
industry practices in geotechnical and geo-environmental engineering. An
objective is to introduce more multi-disciplinary real world design problems
into the undergraduate courses, such as introducing multi-media modules in the
teaching of basic principles so as to allow the students to explore a certain
topic at their own pace. Another objective is to acquire a small teaching
centrifuge for undergraduate students and to introduce them to this important
research tool in geotechnical and geo-environmental engineering. Graduate
students are encouraged to acquire a broad knowledge base by combining both
experimental and analytical aspects in their research, as well as working on
projects with other faculty outside their thesis or dissertation topics.
Development of a graduate level course called "Environmental Geotechnology",
which can also be taken as a professional elective by undergraduate students,
emphasizes the importance of geotechnical issues in solving environmental
problems. ***
