Current "engineering models of human performance" can predict the processes
experts use to accomplish tasks with a computer system and the time it takes to
complete these tasks. In this project the models are extended to predict the
problem-solving behavior exhibited by novice computer users, learning in
realistic situations, and their commission and detection of errors. As is the
case with the previous models of expert users, these new models can be used by
computer developers who understand the predictive power of these improved models
of behavior to evaluate alternative interface approaches early in the
specification stages of their design, even before running systems or prototypes
are available.
