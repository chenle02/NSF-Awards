This is an investigation of the recently discovered Lost City Vent Field, atop
the dome-like Atlantis Massif at 30 degrees north on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.
This field is different from all other known seafloor hydrothermal fields in
that it is located on 1.5 Ma crust, is dominated by steep-sided carbonate
chimneys, and is underlain by significiant exposures of serpentinized
peridotite. A detailed mapping and sampling program will be conducted to address
the following: the tectonic and geologic controls that focus venting, the
chemical and isotopic compositions of the vent structures and fluids, the
indicence and phylogentic diversity of microorganisms, and whether macrofauna
exist.&lt;br/&gt;
