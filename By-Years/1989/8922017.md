This proposal outlines a significant project to evaluate a quantitative
approach to carcinogenic screening. The scientific foundation for testing
potentially carcinogenic chemicals is in a state of controversy. Regulatory
agencies must formulate policies for testing and interpreting bioassay results
with a goal of lowing the incidence of cancer without needlessly penalizing the
economy. The principal investigators have developed models to measure the
information value of bioassays. They propose to extend the models and
demonstrate how they can improve current regulatory decisions. The proposed
research provides a structure for scientific thinking about uncertainty in
testing potentially carcinogenic chemicals. This project has considerable
potential for helping federal and state regulators, as well as chemical
manufacturers, to make better decisions. In all, the anticipated impact of the
research fully justifies support for the proposal.
