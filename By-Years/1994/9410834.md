The communication between nerve cells ultimately depends on release of chemical
messengers termed neurotransmitters from one nerve cell and subsequent
activation of another nerve cell by the released neurotransmitter.
Neurotransmitters are released from a specialized portions of a nerve cell
called nerve endings or nerve terminals. The most important initiator of
neurotransmitter release at nerve terminals is the concentration of free calcium
within the terminal. As a consequence of their small size and of their being
mixed with glial cells and other nerve cell regions in intact tissue, direct
investigation of the basic secretory mechanisms at nerve endings of vertebrates
has been limited. It is the purpose of this proposal to utilize a unique nerve
terminal preparations of vertebrates which overcomes the above limitations to
characterize the fundamental relationships between calcium and induction of
secretion of the chemical messengers. State of the art electrophysiological and
optical approaches which provide high quantitative and high time resolution will
be used in the proposed studies. Specific questions that will be addressed
include: What are the qualities of the changes in intracellular calcium that are
most important for initiation of secretion? Which calcium entry pathways are
most important for induction of the secretory response? Does continued
activation by electrical activity alter the importance of these influx pathways?
In addition, a number of specific proteins have recently been implicated in the
chain of events leading to secretion by biochemical evidence. To date, the
specific functions of these proteins have not been elucidated and is a specific
aim of this proposal.
