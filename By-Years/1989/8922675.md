This proposal is to hold a workshop on coastal ocean predictive modeling.
Several U.S. agencies have interests in the coastal circulation, and how models
with predictive capability can be developed. The workshop will provide an
opportunity for modelers and users to exchange information leading to a strategy
for such model development.
