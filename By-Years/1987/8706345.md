Professor Zoltan A. Schelly is supported by a grant from The Physical Chemistry
Program to study the dynamics of reverse micelle formation in nonpolar solvents.
This research has technological importance in such industrial areas as
catalysis, lubrication, corrosion prevention and biotechnology. Reverse micelles
are aggregates of surfactant molecules which may spontaneously and reversibly
form in nonpolar solvents such as oils. In contrast to normal micelles in
aqueous solution, the polar head groups of the surfactant molecules comprise the
core of reverse micelles, and the hydrophobic tails face the apolar solvent
region. The polar core contains some water, referred to as the "pool", which
remains even after drying the components of the solution. The current study
addresses the dynamics of reverse micelle formation. Questions which are being
addressed include: 1) How fast and by what sequence of elementary processes are
reversed micelles formed? 2) What is the average lifetime of surfactant
molecules in the aggregates? 3) How does the pool size affect the above
processes? and 4) How does the rate process contribute to the stability of the
aggregates? The experimental techniques employed in this study are electric
field-jump and laser-induced birefrigence with real time computer data
acquisition and analysis.
