This project focuses on molecular systematics and biogeography of the fish genus
Gambusia (Cyprinodontiformes, Poeciliidae). Samples of up to about 45 nominal
species will be collected from Caribbean islands, Central America, and the
southeastern United States in order to examine phylogenetic and zoogeographic
relationships. Results from electophoresis and mitochondrial DNA restriction
site analysis will be used to construct a phylogeny for the genus. These data
are to be combined with morphological information, which thus far has been
inconclusive in resolving taxonomy, to examine character congruence.
Zoogeographic evidence will be compared to area cladograms constructed for other
monophyletic taxa (of a single ancestral origin) available in the scientific
literature in order to test hypothesized vicariant events in the Caribbean
region. The work will be performed at Auburn University by Charles Lydeard under
the direction of Dr. Michael C. Wooten.
