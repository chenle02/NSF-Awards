The project gives physics, astronomy, and physical science students the
opportunity to perform classical experiments using an array of sensory probes,
computer analysis, and graphic displays. This project uses the following
equipment to provide a microcomputer-based laboratory for physics and physical
science students: 1) six Vectra 386/25, Model 80 computers with VGA monitors,
and hard disc drives; 2) two Epson LQ1070 printers; 3) additional hardware and
software for HP Vectras; 4) MPLO software and hardware from Vernier; 5) PSL-IBM
starter kit and software; 6) assorted sensors and probes from IBM; 7) assorted
sensors and probes from Vernier; and 8) transducers and sensors from Pasco.
