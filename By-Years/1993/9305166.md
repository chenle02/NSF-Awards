9305166 Low This proposal describes experiments that will examine the roles of
DNA methylation patterns in regulating Escherichia coli gene expression and
physiology. Although most of the 18,000 "GATC" sites in the E. coli chromosome
are methylated at the N-6 position of adenine by the deoxyadenosine methylase
(Dam), eleven nonmethylated GATC sites (NM-GATC sites) have been identified and
cloned. Two of these sites, NM-GATC 76 and NM-GATC77 located at 76 and 77 min on
the E. coli chromosome respectively, require the presence of leucine-responsive
regulatory protein (Lrp) for methylation protection. Additional Lrp-dependent
NM-GATC sites have been identified and will be isolated by direct cloning from
CHEF gels. The objective of this research are to identify and characterize the
genes controlled by Lrp-dependent NM-GATC sites and to determine the roles of
DNA methylation in regulating gene expression in response to environmental
stimuli and growth state. %%% These experiments will have a significant impact
on our knowledge regarding the mechanisms by which E. coli responds to
environmental stimuli and coordinates gene expression. Methylation pattern
formation provides a mechanism by which multiple genes can be controlled
coordinately in response to environmental signals. ***
