This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I will develop coatings
containing post-consumer commingled polymer (PCCP) waste. The very large volume
of plastics in the waste stream is a significant environmental burden. The use
of plastics is increasing rapidly due to the advent of new resins and increased
efficiencies in polymer processing. Concurrently environmentally benign coatings
are needed to protect the civil infrastructure from the effects of corrosion.
Increasingly restrictive environmental regulations regarding volatile organic
compounds (VOC's) may soon ban the use of existing coating systems that contain
high levels of VOC's. This SBIR Phase I will produce a composite polymer powder
containing PCCP and a commercially available ethylene methacrylic-acid copolymer
(EMAA). The composite powder will be used to deposit barrier comings onto steel
substrates using a thermal spray process. Specific commercial applications are
expected to include include: i) bridge surfaces, ii) pipe coatings and linings,
iii) flood-gates, iv) chemical and/or water containment, v) sealers for
hazardous waste containment, vi) domestic waste containment, vii) transfer
chutes, and viii) propeller blades.
