A fundamental goal of evolutionary biology is to understand how diversity arises
within and among species. Among sexually reproducing species, many traits have
evolved astonishing diversity, although the processes that drive this pattern
remain poorly understood. The baculum fits this classic pattern of rapid
divergence over time. In some cases, baculum shape correlates with reproductive
success, implying that this change over time is shaped by selective, rather than
random, processes. Unfortunately, rigorous testing of evolutionary hypotheses
has been hampered by the lack of appropriate methods to quantify complex
morphology, and the absence of integrated methods to evaluate different
evolutionary hypotheses. Thus, many basic questions about how morphological
diversity arises remain unanswered. Is morphological divergence accelerated by
some form of selection? Do different parts of the baculum experience different
strengths of selection? Do different species accumulate baculum divergence
differently, and might this be related to the evolution of their mating systems?
Does the baculum respond to environmental conditions such as mating history?
These questions span multiple time scales, from understanding evolutionary
processes acting across species and populations within a species, to the
development of the bone over an individualâ€™s lifetime. This project will support
the training of a postdoctoral researcher, a citizen science initiative, and
participation in a large science outreach festival to engage the broader
community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; To answer these questions, the researchers have
proposed three specific aims that combine modern morphometrics with comparative
phylogenetic methodology, as well as laboratory manipulation. First, relying on
museum collections, they will quantify baculum size and shape variation across
species from three large mammal groups (primates, carnivores, and Peromyscus
rodents) using state-of-the-art methods to test if and how selection shapes
morphological divergence over time, and how that divergence correlates with
variation in mating systems. In the second aim, they extend their approach to
well-defined populations and subspecies of raccoons, while generating low
coverage sequence data from these same specimens to rigorously test how
morphological divergence scales with genetic divergence. Lastly, in a series of
laboratory manipulations, they test how baculum morphology varies across mice
with different mating histories or diet. Ultimately, this work will lead to a
better understanding of the forces that generate
diversity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
