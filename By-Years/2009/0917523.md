This planning effort, a collaboration of teams at the University of Maryland,
Cornell University, Carnegie Mellon University and the Sciencenter of Ithaca,
deals with the development and testing of a unique methodology for educating
youth in computer programming. Through a mobile robot that is cleverly disguised
as a small animal, participants will learn to manipulate the system by
physically moving it as well as setting variables via electronic buttons thereby
learning programming and design. The eventual use of this system and methodology
is in museum exhibits so preliminary survey data will be gathered from various
venues that presently use less capable devices. Iterative testing will be done
at the Sciencenter in its exhibits.
