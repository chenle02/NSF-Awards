This project involves the development and application of new enumerative
invariants in low-dimensional, symplectic, and contact topology. There are two
main goals. The first is to develop and compute ``periodic Floer homology'', a
theory defined for an area-preserving surface diffeomorphism, which counts
periodic orbits together with embedded pseudoholomorphic curves in R cross the
mapping torus. This theory is conjectured to agree with the Seiberg-Witten Floer
homology of the mapping torus, thus giving a link between low dimensional
topology and surface dynamics. Also, an analogue of periodic Floer homology for
three-dimensional contact manifolds should have applications to the topology of
overtwisted contact structures and smooth four-manifolds. The second main goal
is to develop and compute invariants of families of equivalent objects in
different versions of Floer theory. These give topological invariants of
families of symplectomorphisms, three-manifolds, Legendrian knots, and any other
type of object for which a version of Floer theory can be defined.

This project fits into the broad theme of developing tools to understand the
possible global shapes of three and four dimensional spaces. For example the
universe we live in is a four dimensional space if one includes time, and its
global structure is not known. The tools used here to understand the shape of a
space involve counting interesting geometric objects inside the space. An
important class of such objects are pseudoholomorphic curves, which are surfaces
resembling soap films. By counting the number of such surfaces with appropriate
constraints that exist in a space, one can gain information about the global
structure of the space.
