A study of acceleration processes of the auroral particles is proposed. The
approach is theoretical, numerical using the data base from the VIKING satellite
and sounding rockets. The auroral acceleration mechanisms are complex and no
clear candidate has emerged from the past studies. This study will use new
nonlinear parametric mechanisms in which Alfven wave decays into a sound wave
and backscattered Alfven wave. A hybrid simulation code will be used. The
simulation results should provide information on the weak double layers which
evolved from parametric processes. Plasma wave data will be analyzed from the
VIKING satellite and rocket data and will be interpreted in conjunction with the
simulation results. This combined approach of data analysis, theory and
simulation will provide information concerning the auroral acceleration
mechanisms.
