This highly theoretical research develops a formal, mathematical model of the
interaction between voters and legislators in a unicameral legislative system.
Most existing formal models of the relationship of voters and legislators deal
with a fixed time period and treat the relationship as one directional. Voters
are assumed to influence legislative behavior or vice versa but not both.
However, because elections and the legislative process are inherently dynamic
processes where influence flows both ways simultaneously, existing models are
limited in the questions they can address. This research models the
representative process as one of reciprocal influence where decisions by voters
influence decisions by legislators which then influence decisions by voters in
the next period. The process continues indefinitely until equilibrium is
achieved. This means that voters, when they make their decisions, anticipate the
reactions of legislators. Legislators, in turn, anticipate the reaction of
voters when deciding policies. The project will proceed to use these models to
explain the development of certain common institutional features of legislatures
including political parties, seniority, safe seats and lobbying. When completed
this project will greatly strengthen existing theories of representative
relationships, enhance their realism, and provide a more systematic and rigorous
basis for evaluating the potential effects of proposed legislative reforms such
as legislative terms limits.
