This award will provide support for participants in the Workshop in Technical
Japanese to be conducted this summer through the MIT-Japan S&amp;T Program. The
objective of this workshop is to enable computer science and electrical
engineering professionals to develop reading proficiency of technical Japanese.
Selected participants will be offered financial support for the workshop in the
form of tuition, living and travel expenses. There is a critical need for more
effective technical communication between American and Japanese researchers.
Financial support of those studying technical Japanese will both stimulate
applicant interest and enable participation by researchers who would otherwise
be unable to pursue such in-depth study of the language because of budgetary
contraints.
