There are many large simulations in science and engineering which are very
time-consuming when performed on sequential machines. Parallel simulation is the
most promising approach for speeding up these simulations. Two major strategies
have emerged as viable candidates for parallel discrete-event simulations: the
conservative strategy, pioneered by Chandy and Misra, and the optimistic
strategy, pioneered by Jefferson. In the past several years, there has been a
great deal of research in comparing the two strategies, using both empirical and
formal methods. But several interesting issues remain. This project addresses
some of these issues in formal models for parallel and distributed discrete-
event simulation algorithms. Of specific interest is to include some of the
costs which are ignored or vastly simplified in many existing formal models,
such as rollback, message-passing, state-saving, and deadlock detection and
recovery costs. In general, including these overhead costs in analytical models
causes the resulting analysis to be intractable. By restricting the application
domain, these costs can be included in formal models, resulting in models which
more accurately reflect actual behavior. In particular, it is planned to compare
different simulation strategies, so inclusion of the overhead costs could affect
the resulting analysis.
