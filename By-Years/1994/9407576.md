9407968 Pearson ABSTRACT A quantitative investigation of the physiological and
behavioral responses of females of two moth species is proposed. The species are
the grape root borer (Vitacea polistiformis Harris) and the squash vine borer
(Melittia cucurbitae Harris), both members of the lepidopteran Family Sesiidae.
The two species under investigation are the first insects to have female
responses to synthetic pheromones documented in the field. Changes in female
behavior under pheromone treatments have been postulated as a new mechanism for
resistance to mating disruption. If altered female behavior under pheromone
treatments increases the probability of mating, and if these behavior changes
are heritable, a potential disruption resistance selection may exist. Sesiids
are unique in that they have highly similar pheromone blends, and cross species
attraction is known. Thus, the proposed research also has evolutionary interest
relating to questions of reproductive isolation and evolution of mating systems.
Lastly, both insects under investigation are serious plant pests that are not
controlled by either chemical or biological controls in North Carolina or other
areas on the East Coast. Mating disruption may be the only method by which to
achieve a satisfactory level of control can be achieved in the Southeastern
United States.
