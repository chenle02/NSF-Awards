Big data is having a profound impact on scientific research and knowledge
discovery. And while big data poses many statistical and computational
challenges, it also presents unprecedented opportunities for statistics and data
science. The investigator will focus on emerging scientific problems through the
development of novel statistical and computational means, and address the
challenges that arise in solving data intensive complex problems. The research
in this project on finance statistics and computational algorithms is motivated
by solving practical problems, and will yield cutting-edge statistical
techniques and effective computational tools. The investigator actively
participates in activities to integrate research with student training and
applies the research outcomes to fields like finance and deep learning.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will conduct novel research on stochastic
gradient descent algorithms and unified models for financial data. The research
goals are to develop innovative statistical methodologies, computing techniques,
and theories for: 1) unified stochastic models for combined inference based on
both high-frequency and low-frequency financial data, and 2) statistical and
computational analysis of stochastic gradient descent algorithms with
applications to machine learning in particular deep learning. The investigator
intends to establish theoretically-supported statistical methodologies and
computational procedures, and significantly advance computational and
statistical understanding to the proposed research
problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
