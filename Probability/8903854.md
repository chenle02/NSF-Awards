The topic of research is the asymptotic theory of spectra for large random
matrices. The types of matrices to be studied include square matrices whose
entries are independent identically distributed random variables, symmetric
matrices for which various entries are mutually independent, and matrices of a
sort that are covariance matrices in special cases. For each of these types of
matrices problems that involve the asymptotic spectral distribution of the
random matrix and problems that involve the asymptotic behavior of the extremal
eigenvalues for the random matrix will be studied.
