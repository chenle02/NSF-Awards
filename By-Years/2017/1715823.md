The workings of every biological cell are carried out by "molecular machines"
made up of proteins, RNA or combinations of these. This project will investigate
how such machines function using physics-based computational methods. The
project's focus will be the "rotary ATPases", which can convert one type of
chemical energy into another - from a transmembrane pH difference into ATP, the
well-known "molecular fuel" of the cell. The project will develop mathematical
models of the machines in order to: (i) understand the biophysics of how these
machines function (and malfunction) over a wide range of conditions encountered
by the cell; and (ii) develop more powerful modeling approaches that are
transferable to the study of other machines. The project will also continue
development of an online textbook covering the biophysics of the cell's
molecular machines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work will enhance physics-based
strategies for modeling molecular machines. Novel elements include systematic
exploration of alternative mechanisms, evolution-motivated constrained
optimization in place of parameter fitting, examination of reversibility, and
consideration of a wide range of conditions and stoichiometries. Biologically,
the work can provide optimal and limiting ranges for many uncertain parameters,
and explicitly disentangle adaptations in the wide range of species-specific
stoichiometries and organelle-specific directionality (synthesis vs. pumping).
The consideration of alternative and hypothetical mechanisms could also
contribute to understanding the evolutionary history of ATP synthesis, prior to
the advent of the rotary synthase, as well as aiding the study of other families
of molecular machines. The project will also lead to further development of a
free online cell biophysics book (PhysicalLensOnTheCell.org), expanding the
topics covered and adding interactive numerical models, based in part on the
research to be performed.
