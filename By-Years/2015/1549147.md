The Principal Investigator will undertake a study of 3-, 4-, and higher-
dimensional spaces using a theory called "higher-dimensional Heegaard Floer
homology'' which the PI is developing with his collaborator Vincent Colin. These
spaces will locally be similar to the standard (Euclidean) n-dimensional spaces
and may be very complicated globally, but a local observer cannot tell the
difference, just as an ant cannot tell whether it is sitting on a flat plane or
a very large sphere. Higher-dimensional Heegaard Floer homology is defined
through contact and symplectic geometry, which in turn are closely related to
mathematical physics and string theory. These studies in higher dimensions
should in turn contribute significantly towards our understanding of low-
dimensional (i.e., 3- and 4-dimensional) shapes, from the knotting of DNA at the
microscopic level to the shape of the universe at the macroscopic level.

The PI will study contact and symplectic geometry in higher dimensions through a
higher-dimensional generalization of Heegaard Floer homology. Heegaard Floer
homology, due to Ozsváth and Szabó, is a package of invariants of 3- and
4-dimensional spaces as well as knots and links in 3-space, which is extremely
effective at distinguishing these spaces and knots and links from one another.
The main goal of the PI's research program is to develop the theory of Heegaard
Floer homology in higher dimensions, i.e., in dimensions greater than 4. This
theory is expected to yield important applications to contact and symplectic
geometry in higher dimensions, which in turn are related to algebraic geometry
and mathematical physics. Khovanov homology, another important invariant of
knots and links in 3-space, can at least conjecturally be viewed as a special
case of higher-dimensional Heegaard Floer homology.
