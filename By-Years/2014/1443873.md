The goal of this proposal is to provide support for approximately 20 students to
attend the Wireless Innovation Forum Conference on Communications Technologies
and Software Defined Radio (WinnComm) to be held March 31-April 2, 2015 in San
Diego California. The grants will provide partial support for travel, housing,
and conference attendance. Software-defined radio technology will become
increasingly important as the foundation of wireless communications, and
attendance at the conference will expose students to many technical and
practical aspects of the technology.
