The PIs plan to continuously collect and telemeter fumarole temperature data at
the summit dome of Colima volcano in Mexico. They will simultaneously monitor
variations in the Earth's magnetic field intensity induced by changes in the
bulk temperature of the dome, precipitation rates and seismic events. These data
will provide a comprehensive view of conductive and convective heat transfer
within the summit dome. Resulting models should aid in the interpretation of
fumarole temperature data gathered at other volcanoes and provide new insight
into the use of fumarole monitoring in the mitigation of volcanic hazards.
