Selective lesions limited to neuroanatomically discrete areas within the
hippocampal formation and sensitive behavioral testing procedures, will be used
by Dr. Leonard Jarrard to study the involvement of these different areas in
learning and memory. His previous research demonstrated the feasibility of
selectively lesioning these areas with neurotoxins and his behavioral research
has indicated important functional differences. The proposed research centers
around the following areas: 1) the utilization of spatial and intramaze cue
information, 2) object recognition memory, and 3) the role of hippocampal
formation structures in elementary learning processes. The proposed experiments
will add to our understanding of structure-function relations within the
hippocampal formation, will help clarify the rather confusing literature on the
effects of hippocampal lesions on learning and memory, and will provide
information relevant to recent theorizing and modeling in the learning and
memory field.
