Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Student Travel Support
for the 2004 North American Membrane Society&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
CTS-0411623&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Benny
Freeman&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of
Texas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is intended to
stimulate the participation of U.S. students and postdoctoral fellows in the
North American Membrane Society's (NAMS) 2004 national meeting. The funding will
be used to provide partial support of travel and related expenses. The objective
is to encourage student participation in the largest American meeting focused on
this subject, to provide opportunities for them to present their work, meet
other scientists and engineers from around the world with similar interests, and
to see state-of-the-art presentations from other research groups working in this
area. This funding will be used to help disseminate knowledge about state-of-
the-art research in membrane science and engineering from around the world to
students. This is the premier meeting for scientists and engineers in the
American membrane community, and this technology represents one of the fastest-
growing separations techniques. It is widely used in the chemical,
petrochemical, food processing, food packaging, medical and pharmaceutical
industries. The most respected and accomplished membrane scientists and
engineers from around the world will participate in this meeting. In terms of
the broader impacts, the proposed meeting sponsorship would allow U.S. graduate
students and postdoctoral fellows to attend the most important meeting in the
U.S. on membrane science and technology. In addition to 20 technical sessions,
five workshops are being planned, and they would provide an additional venue for
students and postdoctoral fellows to receive intensive, tutorial training in key
fundamental and developing areas of membrane science and technology.&lt;br/&gt;
