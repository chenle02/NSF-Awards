Artificial intelligence (AI) has had a profound impact in information technology
and commerce to the degree of in?uencing societal transformation over the last
decade. The remarkable success of AI has led to a torrent of research aiming to
use AI to solve challenging problems in science and engineering. Despite the
empirical success of these methods, our mathematical understanding of the
underlying algorithms is limited and we do not fully understand why and how
these algorithms perform so well, making their predictability less certain. The
aim of this project is to address these shortcomings as they pertain to AI
algorithms for a large family of engineering problems called "inverse problems",
where an unknown parameter is predicted from indirect measurements, such as MRI
imaging. The project will also involve outreach activities organized through the
University of Washington such as the training and retention of young researchers
including explicit plans to involve underrepresented groups in the STEM fields.

Recent advances in Machine Learning (ML) have led to the development of novel
techniques for the solution of inverse problems but our theoretical
understanding of these methods is limited and the majority of them are incapable
of uncertainty quanti?cation. The purpose of this project is to address these
shortcomings by developing foundational theory for ML methods for Bayesian
inverse problems and to design novel computational techniques that enable ML
methods to quantify uncertainties. A measure theoretic interpretation of BIPs
will be employed in our theoretical analysis to address the questions of well-
posedness, stability, and consistency. New computational techniques will be
developed using Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms, data-driven construction of
prior information, and recent variational inference techniques based on
generative modeling and optimal transport.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
