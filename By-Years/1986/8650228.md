Undergraduate instruction in introductory environmental geology, hydrogeology
and geophysics is being improved significantly at the University of Wisconsin-
Eau Claire by the acquisition of modern instrumentation for seismic studies,
earth resistivity measurements, conductivity studies, gamma ray logging, and
ground-water flow analysis. In addition, equipment for particle size analysis
and for ground water sampling is now available, together with IBM-PC computers
for instruction in ground water modeling and contaminant transport for the Eau
Claire Water Well and Seven Mile Creek Landfill projects. Students participate
in three integrated projects in hydrogeology and geophysics: determining ground-
water flow near a municipal well field, identifying leachate migration from an
engineered landfill site, and understanding and applying computer techniques to
hydrogeology.
