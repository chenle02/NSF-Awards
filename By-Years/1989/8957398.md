This award supports research in Elementary Particle Physics by Dr. Larry
Gladney, a Presidential Young Investigator. With the Collider Detector Facility
(CDF) at the Fermilab Tevatron, Dr. Gladney will be making a detailed study of
the leptonic decays of W and Z bosons, the mediators of the weak nuclear force.
He will search for new physics which extends beyond the Standard Model of
Electro-weak Interaction.
