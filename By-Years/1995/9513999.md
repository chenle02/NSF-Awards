9513999 Burchat This grant to a faculty member at Stanford University supports
two research projects. First, she, a postdoc and graduate students will continue
analysis of a massive data sample on Charm meson decays obtained some years ago
at Fermilab. They are also established in the BABAR collaboration, an
international group that has been formed to design and contruct the detector to
be used to study Bottom mesons at the PEPII electron-positron collider at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. They will continue to the Vertex Detector
component of BABAR and will develop and operate radiation monitoring devices to
be used in a beam-abort system for the collider. ***
