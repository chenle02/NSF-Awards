In its thirty years of existence, finite element analysis has become an
indispensable tool of engineering. Because of its wide applicability, the
present lack of knowledge of this complex method among U.S. engineers is costly
to our economy and to the competitive position of our nation. The purpose of
this proposed project ISAIAH (the Interactive Structural Analysis Instructor and
Helper) is to utilize modern hypermedia technology to research and develop an
Interactive Finite Element Analysis Knowledge Base on a microcomputer laser disk
to provide: (1) engineering students with "hands-on" experience combined with
interactive instruction and (2) practicing engineers with interactive assistance
during pre- processing and post-processing, to improve the quality of finite
element analyses and the resulting quality of U.S. engineering. As a first step
toward this goal (to be realized in privately-funded Phase III), a proof-of-
concept Prototype Frame Analysis Assistant on a microcomputer diskette will be
formulated and tested in Phase I to: (1) verify the feasibility of the
hypermedia approach, and (2) test its effectiveness with engineering students
and practitioners. With non-Federal funds, an interim Interactive Frame Analysis
Knowledge Base will be developed in Phase 1.5.
