This workshop focuses on new challenges of signal processing and communications
in decentralized (non-cellular) wireless networks. Of particluar interests are
fundamental limitations of wireless networks, emerging signal processing and
communications theory and techniques, sensor networks and applications, and
recent initiatives by commercial and defense industry. The objective is to
identify pressing problems in communications and signal processing in the
network environment and make recommendations about important research areas. The
workshop will feature keynote speakers from leading researchers followed by the
panel discussions.
