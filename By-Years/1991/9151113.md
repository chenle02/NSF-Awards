A subject area of increasing importance to mechanical engineers is control
systems and microcontrollers. Mechanical engineers must often be able to
translate the algorithmic processes used to control devices into the language of
microcontrollers. A controls curriculum is being developed for undergraduate
mechanical engineers, and as part of this curriculum project two microcontroller
laboratory courses are developed. In these courses, the students learn about
microcontroller architecture and interfacing, assembly and high-level language
programming, advanced debugging techniques, analog and digital electronics, and
industrial control systems and algorithms.
