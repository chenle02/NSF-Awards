This proposal is to make hydrographic measurements on the first leg of the
World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) cruise in the southeastern Pacific on
longitude 88 west. The data are used to identify describe ocean processes in
this region, an very interesting one due to the complex vertical circulation
that occurs there. These measurements and related tracer observations will form
the basis for the ocean circulation description which is an objective of WOCE.
