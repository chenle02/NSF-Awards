This award provides funds for purchase of a wide field confocal microscope
equipped with two high- sensitivity, intensified charge-coupled-device cameras,
a spinning disk-type confocal imaging device, and imaging software. The cells
system capable of high speed, dual excitation or dual emission ratiometric
imaging, and includes equipment needed for microinjection of living cells. The
microscope will be the centerpiece for a new Laboratory for the Study of
Developmental Dynamics to be shared by a number of investigators. The high-
sensitivity detectors allow extended fluorescence imaging of developing systems
that is not possible with laser scanning confocal microscopes, or multi-photon
instruments. The system will be used by postdoctoral associates, graduate and
undergraduate students, and faculty investigators for a variety of research
projects in cell biology, and will provide the basis for an expanded course on
modern techniques in optical microscopy.
