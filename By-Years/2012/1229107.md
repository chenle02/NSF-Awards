Today computational science, in addition to theory and experimentation, forms an
essential component of scientific inquiry. High Performance Computing
(HPC)enables scientific inquiry that was unthinkable just a few years ago.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under this proposed Major Research Instrumentation
Project, Langston University, HPC Center, will acquire, deploy and maintain an
HPC cluster supercomputer that will support computing-intensive research and
training across a broad variety of STEM disciplines. As a campus-wide shared
resource, it will be available not only to all of the LU members but also to
researchers across Oklahoma and will enable many areas of CDS&amp;E research.
