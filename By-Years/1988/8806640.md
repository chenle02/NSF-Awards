A scanning tunneling microscope is being acquired. This will be integrated with
existing data reduction systems. It will be used for atomic-scale analysis of
the morphology and structure of single-crystal platinum catalysts and model
supported platinum catalysts. Features observed with tunneling microscopy are
correlated with catalytic activity for two test reactions: oxidation of carbon
monoxide and hydrogenolysis of ethane.
