The New York Hall of Science, the Institute for Learning Innovation, Hunter
College of the City University of New York, and a consortium of five regional
science center/zoo partnerships will collaborate to develop, implement, and
evaluate a project with the working title "Wild Minds: What Animals Really
Think." It will develop a research-based traveling exhibition for science
centers that explores animal cognition and cross-institutional programming
strategies for zoos as a case study for the ISE field. The project's primary
goal for public audiences is to foster a deeper understanding of similarities
between people and animals in terms of cognition, i.e., how we
think.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wild Minds will explore two interrelated hypotheses:
(1) a deeper insight into how animals think will create or strengthen the
awareness of an evolutionary link between animals and humans; and (2) that this
sense of a strong connection can stimulate interest in the welfare of animals in
the wild and in our homes. The project will create a 1,500 s.f. traveling
exhibition with 15-20 exhibit components exploring aspects of animal cognition
for general audiences at five major science centers with zoo partners.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Institute for Learning Innovation project will conduct
applied research that will expand on the results of the summative evaluation of
the exhibition by investigating whether changes in awareness, understanding, and
knowledge about action are sustained over time and/or lead to attitudinal
change, behavioral intention, and observable behavior. In addition, process
research with the science center and zoo collaborators will provide an analysis
that will identify factors contributing to or inhibiting an integrated local
informal science education infrastructure in a community. The project will also
conduct exploratory research to identify the challenges and benefits encountered
during collaboration between science centers and zoos.
