The award will provide funding in support of participation by U.S. graduate
students and post-doctoral researchers at the 2017 Gordon Research Seminar (GRS)
and Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Chemical Reactions at Surfaces to be
held back-to-back in Lucca (Barga), Italy, February 4-10, 2017. The conference
and seminar will expose a new generation of scientists and engineers to the
latest international advances in the area of surface science and engineering as
applied to some of the world's most pressing technological challenges.
International exchanges of this type are essential for ensuring that U.S.
scientists and engineers maintain leadership in areas of critical importance to
the environment, sustainability, and manufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GRC
on Chemical Reactions at surfaces is the preeminent international meeting in the
field of surface chemistry and related catalysis. Together with the GRS, it will
bring together an interdisciplinary group of students and young researchers from
chemistry, physics, chemical engineering and materials science. They will have
an opportunity to present their work in the form of oral presentations or
posters while interacting with some of the most eminent researchers in the
field. The GRS and GRC will address fundamental aspects of surface chemical
reactions, which are related to the grand environmental and sustainability
challenges facing mankind. These include environmental interfaces, solar energy
conversion to chemical energy, and capture and storage of CO2. Specific emphasis
will be given to defining the next generation challenges in surface chemistry
and surface science. Participation by young researchers will add significant
value to this conference and will foster communications among current and future
leaders in a field that combines academic and industrial issues.
