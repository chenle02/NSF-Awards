Special laboratory equipment has been obtained for use in JMU's newly formed
College of Integrated Science and Technology. The focus is on the freshman and
sophomore years where engaging students in the excitement of science is
particularly important. A special effort is being expended to attract more women
and minorities into science and science teaching careers. The project addresses
the need to develop laboratory facilities in direct support of the curriculum.
This is being done with an innovative instructional approach that combines
hands-on exercises with specially prepared instructional technology units. The
approach promises better instructional quality, accommodates a wide range of
student preparation, reduces the need for large multiple station labs, and
insures the creation of an integrated laboratory experience that can be adapted
and used in other institutions. Fewer student stations are required, because
state-of-the-art instructional technology is used to produce demonstrations that
are photo-recorded for interactive learning. A multimedia authoring system is
used to develop learning modules that familiarizes the student with the
experiment, the procedure, and the instrumentation. The result not only enriches
the laboratory experience, but it also prepares the student to perform the
experiment without constant faculty supervision. Products of the authoring
system will be in the form of CD ROMs, video tapes, interactive software
packages, and/or presentation packages. The authored experiments may also be
disseminated to other schools and for distance learning. The interdisciplinary
nature of the program is accomplished through a series of laboratory experiments
in environmental science, biology, modern physics, lasers and optics, and
automation.
