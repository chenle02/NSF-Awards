Non-technical Description: Spintronics, based on the manipulation of the spin of
an electron and not its charge, provides a promising avenue for a more energy
efficient and faster architecture for electronics. In order to realize such a
new architecture, low dimensional materials with spin polarization are required.
In this research project, low dimensional spin polarized metals are developed
based on a magnetic insulator grown adjacent to a low dimensional metal. Success
of the research can have significant impacts on not only complex oxide materials
but also more broadly materials science and device physics. These research
activities provide educational opportunities for graduate and undergraduate
students. In addition, high-school outreach activities at a newly established
high school in the form of mini courses and curriculum development are in
progress. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description: This research project
focuses on the development of emergent materials with spin functionality formed
at the interface of a ferromagnetic insulator and a low dimensional electron
gas. In order for the ferromagnetic insulator to induce spin polarization in the
entire metallic layer, a low dimensional electron gas, made from the surface of
perovskite strontium titanate, is combined with a spinel structure oxide
material. Understanding the modifications in the electronic and magnetic
structure at the non-isostructural interface and the extent to which the
electronic and magnetic interactions can be tuned across this interface is the
core of this project. The research activities include materials synthesis,
structural and magnetic characterization as well as the demonstration of spin
dependent effects in transport measurements.
