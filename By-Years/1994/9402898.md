*** 9402898 Rosen . This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
will develop and demonstrate an innovative light-weight damping treatment for
noise isolation and vibration control. The research will focus on an innovative
composite stiffness gradient damping concept which has the potential for a
significant performance improvement over conventional constrained layer damping
treatments. Major sources of noise contamination in industrial environments
include rotating high speed machinery, motors, engines and gearboxes with
vibrations in the 100Hz. to 10 Khz. frequency range. This high-level noise is a
contributory factor in operator fatigue and discomfort. The research is designed
to fully define the interactions between controlled constraining layer property
variations and the damping performance of the structure. This understanding will
be used to optimize the damping performance against structural requirements and
manufacturing considerations for application in the high noise environment of a
gas turbine engine gearbox mount. On completion of these optimization studies, a
demonstration article will be manufactured and tested to validate the damping
performance and demonstrate structural reliability under typical operation. ***
