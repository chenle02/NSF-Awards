This exploratory research will study the development of NASA's mission to
Jupiter's moon Europa, in order to understand how large, complex, cyber-human
systems get started; how their team members develop and then implement a shared
vision for their system given heterogeneous backgrounds and collaborative
experiences; and what role these activities play in future science and
technology outcomes. The Europa robot space probe will repeatedly scan this icy
moon that may possess subsurface lakes comparable to those in Antarctica, using
nine distinct computerized instruments, including cameras, spectrometers, a
magnetometer, and a thermal instrument. While no hardware or software for the
Europa mission yet exists, over the period of the research members of the
planetary science community will engage in a frenzy of mission activity to turn
their plans for space exploration into tangible technologies, building the
cyber-human system that will enable their collaborative mission to the Jupiter
system. This is a rare opportunity to observe a highly innovative cyber-human
team forming for the first time, before their system is constructed, as they ask
the questions and articulate the values that will establish the core elements of
their eventual information system. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Four elements of this
cyber-human system will be studied during their formation: the question of
integration (of science, hardware and software), the question of data management
(how to balance expertise and sharing), the question of heritage (individuals
with multiple mission heritages and different institutions), and the question of
trajectory (how decisions early in the project affect activity downstream).
Findings will prove crucial to our understanding of how a group dynamic becomes
established that ultimately affects the developed information system from the
ground up especially in the case of a long-lived system. The project will also
contribute to our understanding of data management and standards-setting in
scientific groups, and presents an unusual opportunity to engage
ethnographically with a community with an interest in how cyber-human systems
research might inform their work. Findings about data management, integration,
and long-livedness that can take into account the nested, overlapping, and co-
extensive nature of these collaborations will go further to support upcoming
collaborations at NASA and beyond.
