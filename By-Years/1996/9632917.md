Demott/Abstract The objective of this research are to determine how the chemical
composition of atmospheric aerosols influences the formation of cirrus clouds.
The Hypotheses to be tested are that ice formation by homogeneous freezing
nucleation occurs in agreement with theory for solution droplets existing below
100% relative humidity at temperatures below -35 degrees Celsius, and that the
insoluble components of partially- soluble atmospheric aerosols readily serve as
heterogeneous freezing nuclei under less stringent conditions. Systematic
laboratory measurements to temperatures as cold as -60 degrees Celsius will be
made using a continuous flow diffusion chamber to determine the onset solute
concentration conditions for homogeneous freezing nucleation in solution
droplets formed on sulfate aerosols of atmospheric relevance. Measurements will
be repeated for aerosols including well-characterized insoluble aerosol
components. Validation measurements for distributions of soluble and partially-
soluble aerosols will be made in a cloud chamber which simulates adiabatic air
parcel ascent. The laboratory data will be used together with existing data on
upper tropospheric aerosol and ice nuclei composition to numerically investigate
ice formation in cirrus clouds. The results are expected to be relevant to the
role of aerosols in influencing the radiative properties of upper tropospheric
clouds through controls on cloud microphysical composition.
