This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in the general
area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfield of sensor
technology. The primary objective of this research project is research leading
to proof of concept of a new gas sensor technology based on the Kelvin method of
electronic work function measurement. The sensitivity of this technique to
adsorbed gases will be augmented by the use of a gold-film active surface and
elevated temperature operation to establish selectivity and extend the
concentration limits of operation. Initially, a prototype sensor will be
designed, built, and evaluated to determine the feasibility of the approach.
Hydrogen sulfide will be used in the evaluation because of its importance as an
industrial toxin, its strong interaction with gold, and the critical need for
hydrogen sulfide sensors that continuously monitor wide ranges of concentration.
The successful pursuit of this Phase I activity could lead to the
commercialization of a new class of compact, cost-effective gas sensors
permitting a degree of control of sensitivity and selectivity heretofore not
possible. The potential flexibility of this technology could enable the
development of a broad array of toxic industrial gas sensors that could
penetrate significantly a market which is currently dominated by foreign
interests.
