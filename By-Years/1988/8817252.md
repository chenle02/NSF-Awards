This award will provide one-half of the funds needed to acquire an X-ray
diffraction spectrometer system for installation and operation by the Department
of Geology at the State University of New York in Buffalo. The University is
committed to providing the other half of the funds required. X-ray diffraction
is a fundamental technique for the study of the molecular structure and the
properties of solid, crystalline materials. The instrument will be primarily
used for research on the defect structures of clay minerals, especially
kaolinites, which have commercial as well as geological value. The new equipment
will also be made available to qualified researchers in the departments of
Chemistry and Engineering.
