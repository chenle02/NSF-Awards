This is a Career Advancement Award supported under the Research Opportunities
for Women Program and the Economics Program. The broad purpose of this type of
award is to enable promising women scholars to increase their research
productivity. With this award, the investigator will pursue three areas of
research. The first will involve the refinement of measures of labor quality, to
more accurately reflect the impact of changes in the composition of the labor
force, thereby improving estimates of economic growth. The second, a related
area of research, will also be directed at improving the measurement of economic
growth by including the valuation of nonmarket activities that takes into
account the loss in lifetime earnings due to interruptions of labor force
activity for child rearing. The third area of research will focus on analyzing
the factors that give rise to a comparative advantage in computer-hardware
manufacturing. Since computers are a vital component in the acceleration of
technical progress, it is important to understand what gives rise to comparative
advantage in their manufacture.
