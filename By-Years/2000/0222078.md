Building upon the current two-year Computer Science Associate Degree Program,
Salish Kootenai College will develop and implement a Bachelors of Information
Technology Program (BIT) using the TCUP five-year implementation award.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The structure of the BIT will enable students to obtain
the most recent industry certifications such as those developed by Microsoft and
Cisco and to pursue different educational tracks including networking, wireless
communications, security and database administration. Components of the BIT will
be offered online and through summer "boot camps", allowing working
professionals the opportunity to upgrade their knowledge. Project activities
include development of curriculum, faculty and facilities. Project funds will
also support student recruitment, retention and internship programs. &lt;br/&gt;
