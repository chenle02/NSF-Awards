Millersville University of Pennsylvania will purchase a 6250 bpi tape drive and
associated software. This equipment will be used to upgrade courses in
meteorology, oceanography, and geology. With the equipment students will be able
to read in Landsat and NOAA polar orbiting satellite data from standard magnetic
tape to an existing Earth Resources Data Analysis System (ERDAS). They then will
be able to archive processed images from ERDAS on tape for later analysis.
Likewise students will use the tape system to capture sequences of weather
satellite images for analysis. Millersville University of Pennsylvania will
match the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
