Semiconductor manufacturing is an essential technology for US competitiveness in
the global economy, especially as chip shortages continue to make headlines
worldwide. Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP) is a critical processing
technology that is used by the semiconductor industry to manufacture a wide
variety of materials and devices, including wafers, logic devices, memory chips,
and microelectronic machines (MEMs). The CMP process uses concentrated
suspensions of stable particles that create abrasion and remove waste materials
when polishing surfaces at very high shear rates. High shear processing is also
critical in other manufacturing operations such as coating, spraying, and
lubrication flows. Previous research in high shear rheology (&gt;10,000 s-1) has
helped explain the underlying mechanisms leading to large increases in the
viscosity of concentrated suspensions, which is commonly called shear
thickening. This project will use a series of experiments to characterize the
shear thickening behaviors of suspensions composed of mixtures of relatively
small and large particles under a wide range of high shear conditions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finding the mechanisms by which smaller and larger
particles interact to modify and, in some cases, eliminate shear thickening
under high shear conditions is an important, fundamental particle science
problem. The goal of this project is to determine mechanisms underlying the
dynamics of particle mixtures under flow in sufficient detail that findings can
be generalized to other particle systems and flow types, including polishing,
pipe, and nozzle flows. Using high shear rheology combined with scattering
experiments to monitor structure formation in the suspension, the project has
potential to demonstrate a new mechanism for high shear particle flow that can
result in jamming of pipes and nozzles and the formation of defects in
polishing. Ultimately, this research has potential to impact a wide range of
industries, including large area silicon manufacturing for flat panel displays
and solar cells, uniform application of paper filler and coatings, improved
processing of soldering inks, ceramics, composites, and stabilization of time-
release pharmaceutical formulations. The project will form the basis for
training graduate and undergraduate students in the fields of rheology as well
as particle and surface science. The project will also provide opportunities for
middle and high school teachers to gain hands-on laboratory experience and to
translate research to their classrooms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
