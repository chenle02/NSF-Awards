The research activity of this project is the reliability of structural
components and systems in order to predict the degree of safety of the total
structure. The study of the reliability of connections for steel structures is
the first case study. Algorithms will be developed which combine connector
reliability and structural analysis with Monte-Carlo simulation, Fault Tree
analysis, and First-Order Second-Moment reliability methods. Research results on
reliability of structures and components are brought into the classroom to
relate design to safety.
