This award supports collaboration between Peter Santschi, Texas A&amp;M
University, Bruce Honeyman, Colorado School of Mines, and Wan Guojiang,
Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences on the study of the
cycling and mobility of lead and its isotopes. Aquatic habitats are threatened
by urban and industrial inputs of toxicants such as heavy metals. Lead is one of
the most toxic, and is concentrated in sediments of lakes and estuaries. Little
is understood about the cycling of such heavy metals in lakes. Using facilities
in China and in the US, the investigators will study the mobility of lead across
the sediment-water interface in some Chinese lakes. This study should contribute
to the assessment of radioactive dating techniques used for paleolimnological
studies and of anthropogenic effects of the toxicant lead.
