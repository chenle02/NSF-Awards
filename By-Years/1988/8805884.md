The work covered by this proposal includes a study of individual monarch
butterflies reared in captivity, then used in a mark- release-recapture
experiment to determine rates of female mating, spermatophore (a large nutrient
mass transferred from male to female) masses from wild males, and body condition
and weight change under natural conditions. Nitrogen levels in spermatophores
from released and captive males will be measured to determine how protein
content changes with male age and mating history. The rate at which
spermatophores are digested by females will also be determined. The effects of
the nutrients contained in spermatophores will be studied by comparing fertility
in females that have received spermatophores of different masses.
