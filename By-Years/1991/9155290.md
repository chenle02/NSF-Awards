Through the proposed project, approximately 555,000 youth and adults will
improve their knowledge of the basic sciences and mathematics, and learn to
integrate and apply these disciplines, by analyzing local environmental problems
using remote sensing imagery and maps. Faculty from the Cornell laboratory for
Environmental Applications of Remote Sensing (CLEARS) and Cornell Department of
Natural Resources will train county teams of teachers, museum and nature center
educators, community leaders, and Cooperative Extension agents from throughout
New York State to conduct educational programs with youth and adults in their
communities. Previously developed CLEARS educator enrichment workshops and
training materials will be enhanced and revised based on the interactions among
Cornell Faculty, informal and formal science educators, and students during this
program. A facultative evaluation focusing on the workshops, training materials,
and educator teaching skills, and a summative evaluation focusing on student
learning and attitudes, program delivery in the various community education
settings, and the effectiveness of the county educator teams will be conducted.
The results of the evaluation will be incorporated into a program handbook and
used in nationwide dissemination of the program.
