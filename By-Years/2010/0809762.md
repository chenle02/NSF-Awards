Angela Wilson of the University of North Texas is supported by an award from the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program for research to develop methods
for the calculation of thermodynamic properties of main group and transition
metal species to near chemical accuracy, i.e. to within one kcal/mol or less.
The approaches are being applied to problems that have implications for
environmental sustainability and has five components: (1) A multireference
composite method based on the correlation consistent Composite Approach (ccCA)
is being developed; (2) The ccCA composite approach is being extended to larger
chemical systems via methods such as orbital localization and basis set
truncation; (3) The current generation of ccCA for transition metal species is
being improved; (4) Hybrid QM/QM and QM/MM techniques that are applicable to
more diverse chemical environments are being developed; (5) The scission of
lignin linkage models via a transition metal (e.g., Ni, Pd, Pt) catalyst is
being investigated using the first four methodological developments.

One of the long-standing challenges in computational chemistry is in achieving
chemically accurate energetics and this work is having an impact on that.
Composite model approaches have been developed to allow the consideration of
larger molecules and Wilson and her group have contributed through the
development of the correlation consistent Composite Approach, or ccCA method,
which can be applied to transition metals, a notoriously difficult group of
elements in the computational chemistry field. The work is having a broad impact
through its applications in systems that are important for environmental reasons
as well as through the large number of students involved in the work at UNT.
