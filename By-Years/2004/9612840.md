This in an award to provide support for research on a modification to a
suspended growth biological process used for treatment of wastewater to enhance
its ability to reduce the phosphorus content of the process effluent. The
objective of this project is to elucidate the mechanism of the enhancement
process. This is planned to be accomplished by isolation of pure cultures of
organisms that have been identified as capable of the enhancement process, study
of their growth characteristics, metabolism and genetic control. The procedures
to be used in this project include enrichment techniques for isolation of the
organisms from suspended growth reactors exhibiting significant phosphorus
removal, verification of their ability to enhance phosphorus removal in pure
culture and determination of their growth characteristics, metabolism and
genetic control. Specific objectives include determination of growth
characteristics of isolated organisms and their ability to shift from completely
aerobic conditions to aerobic/anaerobic cycling and back to completely aerobic
culture conditions. The investigators plan to determine the influence of
phosphorus, carbon substrates and anaerobic shifts on gene expression, the
interactions between an energized cell membrane and transport of phosphorus and
acetate, and the importance of intracellular storage materials. The project is
expected to provide a better understanding than now exists of the fundamental
microbial mechanisms involved in enhanced biological phosphorus removal by
suspended growth biological reactors. This improved understanding is expected to
improve the engineering design of suspended growth biological reactors used for
treatment of wastewaters that contain phosphorus including adequate control to
improve the efficiency with which they meet their design objectives.***
