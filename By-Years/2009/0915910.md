This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary objective of this research
is to formulate a framework for a new paradigm for clustering: discovering all
possible non-redundant multiple clustering views from data. Typical clustering
algorithms only find one clustering solution, but many real and complex data are
multi-faceted by nature. Data can be interpreted in many different ways. Given
the same data, what is interesting to a physician will be different from what is
important to an insurance agency. This research will provide new formulations,
algorithms, and tools for exploratory data analysis that are widely applicable
to many domains. The PI will apply the new algorithms in detection of skin
lesions, including cancers/ This will involve the automatic segmentation of the
dermis and epidermis junction in skin images, automated detection of machine
sounds, and in developing algorithms for multiple non-redundant clustering of
text and natural images. Additionally, this project will provide research
experiences for both undergraduate and graduate students in the classroom and in
the lab. The PI will work with the Society of Women Engineers to inspire female
students to pursue careers in engineering and computer science, and to ensure
that under-represented groups are involved in this research.&lt;br/&gt;
