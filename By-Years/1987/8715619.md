The objective of this work is the analysis and interpretation of observations
of wind, temperature, and moisture from the atmosphere's boundary layer; the
measurements were acquired at four sites over the past three years. The
observations are perhaps the best taken in the past two decades and will be used
to determine the turbulent energy budget in the boundary layer, the Kolmogoroff
constants for temperature and velocity, and an independent determination of the
von Karman constant. The behavior of the boundary layer is important to
understand since it is capable of transporting water vapor, heat and momentum to
the upper layers of the atmosphere, thus initiating or suppressing other
meteorological developments throughout deep layers of the troposphere. Professor
Friehe is well qualified to pursue the proposed work; he participated in all
four experiments as well.
