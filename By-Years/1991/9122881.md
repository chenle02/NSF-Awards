The primary objective of this US-Polish Joint Fund project between Dr. Ryszard
Kozlowski of the Institute of Natural Fibers and Dr. Tom Maloney of the
Washington State University is to research use of some annual plants wastes for
production of particleboards. The researchers will also perform research on
urea-formaldehyde resin that allows lowering of formaldehyde emmissions. The
proposed research will provide new knowledge of a production of a new class of
particleboards with lowered formaldehyde emission on the basis of annual plants
wastes and modified urea-formaldehyde resins. This project in materials fulfills
the program objectives of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading
experts in the U.S. and Poland to combine complementary efforts and capabilities
in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality,
reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
