The research is to demonstrate the feasibility of a software shell that will
allow teachers and others interested in scientific education to construct
specific "experiments" on personal computers. The resulting programs or
experiments will, by virtue of the built-in utilities and simulation packages,
provide lively interactive programs that students can use to explore scientific
concepts in a non-threatening, self-paced manner. A partnership has been
established with the North Carolina Science and Mathematics Alliance to identify
teachers who will help in the design and testing of the shell.
