Preserved plant and animal specimens in natural history museums and herbariums
are critical resources for biological research. Systematists, ecologists,
biogeographers, and investigators from many other fields rely on these specimens
and the data associated with them. Most specimens are accompanied by information
concerning their geographic location, but most commonly these locality data are
in the form of narrative descriptions, rather than standardized map coordinates
such as latitude and longitude. Dr. Matthew McGranaghan, a geographer, proposes
to develop new computer software that will use an expert system approach to
interpreting these text-based locality descriptions into map coordinates. The
software will call on electronic gazetteers and digitized maps that are
currently available. The proposed software will be tested on label data from the
plant collections in the Bishop Museum of Natural History of Hawaii. Biologists
are keenly interested in understanding the geographic distributions of
organisms, but it is prohibitively time-consuming to plot individual specimens
on maps. The proposed software development effort has the potential to make
hundreds of millions of museum specimens readily available to researchers
working on problems of geographic distribution. This effort will have wide
impact in the museum research community, in geography and regional sciences, and
in the development of artificial intelligence applications in biology.
