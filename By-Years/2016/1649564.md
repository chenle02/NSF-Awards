The Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI) is a nationwide suite of
infrastructure supporting experimentation in networking, distributed systems,
security, and novel applications. This project supports hosting a set of 5 GENI
Regional Workshops (GRW), as well as hosting the GENI Network Innovators
Community Event (NICE) workshop. The intent of both GENI NICE and the GRWs is to
continue to broaden the GENI research and experimental user
community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2nd NICE workshop will be co-located with
the ACM International Conference on emerging Networking EXperiments and
Technologies (CoNEXT) in December 2016. GENI NICE is a one day event focusing on
presentations and demonstrations by researchers and educators on their use of
GENI. GENI NICE also serves to convene the network systems research community to
discuss advances in computing research infrastructure. Each GRW is focused on
`hands-on' laboratory education and broadening community outreach; regional
events serve to reach underserved faculty and students unable to travel to a
less frequently occurring geographically distant event. This proposal requests
support for one additional GRW in the fall of 2016 in the Northwestern US, and
four more in 2017 at various locations throughout the US.
