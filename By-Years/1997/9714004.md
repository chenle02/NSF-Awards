The Turtle Cove Environmental Research Station has become an important focus for
research and educational programs on the Lake Pontchartrain system. Use of the
facility has increased dramatically in recent years and Turtle Cove has reached
a significant stage in its development, where facility demands exceed available
resources. Plans are being developed for construction of new facilities to
enhance the mission and scope of Turtle Cove by providing additional research
and educational laboratories, housing for students and scientists, supporting
facilities such as docking and boat storage, and complementary on-campus
facilities. However, several questions remain regarding how construction should
be prioritized, how educational and research programs should progress, how the
facility should be administered, and what activities should be emphasized.
Wetlands acreage (approximately 324 hectares or 800 acres) has been donated to
Turtle Cove recently and plans need to be developed for the potential use and
incorporation of such lands into programs at the research station. Therefore a
planning workshop, to be held in February, 1998, is will address these and other
questions, and will develop long-term plans for development of the station. In
addition support will be provided for data management training for the station
data manager. Such training in automated monitoring of weather and water quality
data, and the proper archiving procedures for such data will improve the long-
term data set being generated by the station. The proposed planning process
should help to insure that Turtle Cove will reach its goal to become a
nationally recognized center for environmental education and research in low-
salinity estuarine environments.
