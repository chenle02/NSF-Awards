This is a proposal for U.S.-Polish cooperative research on the study of soft and
semi-hard interactions in hadron-hadron, hadron- nucleus, and nucleus-nucleus
collisions at high energy. The subject is at the interface between particle
physics and nuclear physics. There is no theory at present that can provide a
systematic scheme for calculating the outcomes of such interactions. The U.S.
and Polish teams will be led by Dr. Rudolph Hwa of the University of Oregon and
on the Polish side by Drs. Andrzej Bialas of the Jagiellonian University
(Krakow) and Jan Kwiecinski of the Institute of Nuclear Physics in Krakow. The
members of these teams are highly regarded specialists on individual aspects of
particle and nuclear physics who can be expected to complement each other's
strengths and thus to make significant advances in the theoretical understanding
of these complex interactions.
