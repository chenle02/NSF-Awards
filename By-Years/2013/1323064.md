This study will enhance understanding of how different forms of representation
and assistance with procedures affect civil court proceedings for low-income
participants in hearings. The investigators will evaluate how different
assistance models shape proceedings in the context of individual-level
proceedings, specifically civil contempt hearings. In this study examining how
different assistance models shape legal access, the investigators examine and
compare child support enforcement hearings in several sites across two states,
selected because each state utilizes a distinct model of assistance. The study
draws on four sources of data across the two models of legal assistance: focus
groups with professionals who handle relevant cases, participant observation of
proceedings, transcripts of proceedings, and review and analysis of
corresponding court records. The study will contribute to an under-theorized
area in the literature on assistance with state procedures. Thus far, research
has focused primarily on analyzing the outcomes of civil cases in an effort to
gauge the overall efficacy of assistance in obtaining positive case outcomes.
This study examines an area that has received little attention, namely, how
representation and other forms of legal assistance make a difference, and what
kind of a difference assistance makes. This study informs the ongoing policy
debate about how best to secure fair proceedings for people with individual-
level claims. This project will provide the empirical base necessary for
creating evidence-based policy and intervention.
