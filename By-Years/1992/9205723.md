The principal investigator, in collaboration with Dr. Frank Spera of the
University of California at Santa Barbera, will numerically study several
classes of problems related to dynamic evolution of magma bodies. Each problem
will be constrained by observations from classical petrology. The ultimate goal
is to better understand the dynamics of magma chambers and the formation of
igneous rocks.
