9506722 Stevenson The PIs will develop models for Earth's thermal evolution that
differ from previous efforts in the extent to which they develop a fully self-
consistent picture of the interplay of various convective processes (plates,
plumes and "small scale" convection), the extent to which they incorporate
important physical processes that are frequently omitted, and the number and
diversity of observables to which the models seek to make a connection. The
approach is eclectic, involving specific pieces of physics that require
theoretical development, analytical scaling arguments and numerical convection
experiments. The PIs will specifically include effects of small scale
convection, the role of kinetics of phase transitions, and the role of water in
plate tectonics, crustal production and mantle cooling. ***
