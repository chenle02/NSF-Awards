Over the last generation, bioinspiration has transformed into an important,
widespread and growing design movement with applications in fields as varied as
building, energy, water, transportation, communication, food systems, health
technology, manufacturing, and consumer products. Bioinspiration views nature as
a vast library of robust, efficient, multifunctional and sustainable designs,
and espouses the use of biological systems as sources of inspiration as well as
standards of evaluation for designing technological systems. Over the last
generation, bioinspiration has transformed into an important, widespread and
growing design movement.Bioinspiration is expected to have a global economic
value of $1.6 trillion - $2.1 trillion by 2030.

The adoption and growth of the bioinspiration movement is limited by the fact
that most designers are novices in biology. This causes two major 'pains': slow,
tedious, frustrating search for biological analogues relevant to a design
problem, and slow, inaccurate and imprecise understanding of biological systems.
Thus there is a need for information systems that provide access to biological
knowledge from a design perspective, and interactive tools that support the
process of making biological analogies in conceptual design. In this project,
the I-Corps team will investigate the commercial viability of interactive
technologies for supporting design ideation in bioinspired invention that has
been developed. A successful commercial enterprise in knowledge access for
design ideation in bioinspired invention has the potential for a transformative
impact on the business of bioinspiration.
