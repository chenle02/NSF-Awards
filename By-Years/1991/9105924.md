The role of fluids in the structural and thermal evolution of large-scale
crustal extension is not fully understood. This project will examine possible
fluid-related thermal variations and the depth to which meteoric waters can
penetrate in such systems. The research approach is to study the oxygen and
hydrogen isotopic characteristics of fluid-rock interactions in a well-studied
Cordilleran metamorphic core complex (Whipple Mountains of southeastern
California). Results will be applicable to thermal and tectonic models for
extensional tectonic regimes.
