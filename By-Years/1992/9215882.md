An experimental and theoretical study is proposed for low temperature plasmas
that contain particulates. A plasma is an ionized gas, and in this work we will
concentrate on weakly- ionized plasmas of the kind that are used widely in
industry for manufacturing semiconductors, optical materials, and magnetic
media. In a plasma, particulates (i.e. micron-size dust particles) become
electrically charged. They also may grow in size by collecting sputtered atoms
in the plasma. Particulates are a costly problem industrial uses of plasma
processing because they can fall to a substrate and contaminate it. This is the
motivation for this work. Experiments will be carried out to observe the time
and density dependence of electrical charging of dust grains. These measurements
will employ optical detection of grains in parallel-plate radio-frequency
plasmas, and the results will be used to test theories of particulate charging
in plasmas. Theoretical modeling will be performed to simulate the trapping of
ions by charged grains. Negatively charged grains can trap positive ions in
confined orbits, and this cause a reduction in the net electric forces that the
charged grains experience. This modeling will employ numerical simulations of
the motion of ions, including collisions with neutral atoms as well as the
electric force created by charged grains.
