This award will support collaborative work between Prof. Richard Glass of the
University of Arizona (UA) and Prof. Eusebio Juaristi of the Instituto
Politecnico Nacional (IPN) in Mexico City, Mexico. The researchers intend to
study geometric factors that affect the reaction pathway of electron transfer in
biological systems. Using conformational-structural analyses and synthesis by
electrochemical methods, the researchers intend to probe subtle stereoelectronic
properties of sulfur-containing heterocycles that are of considerable
biochemical interest. The approach has a good balance of synthetic development
and mechanistic studies. Furthermore, the project evidences a good match of
complementary skills with the UA providing a strong analytical capability while
the IPN contributes its strength in synthesis. Additionally the project
continues a previous successful collaboration between the two investigators,
which led to the development of a practical electrosynthesis method applicable
to the proposed work.
