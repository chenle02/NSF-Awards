This workshop is to develop a seminal statement about research topics needed in
developing a science of tools for electronic systems design. It brings together
academic and industrial researchers with experience in VLSI chip, electronic
system, and other design automation fields to integrate their varied points of
view. The workshop facilitates the integration of a wide range of design
automation research ideas, and their integration into a new science for systems
design.
