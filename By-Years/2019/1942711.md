Distributed systems are the backbone of modern computing. However, they are
complicated and prone to bugs due to their combinatorially large state-spaces,
and node and network failures. Recent occurrences of data, currency and service
loss have shown that reliability of distributed systems remains elusive. The
inherent complication is faced by not only protocol and system designers that
provide interfaces but even distributed application programmers that use these
interfaces. This project addresses programmer productivity and reliability of
distributed systems that spans both the client applications and the supporting
distributed middleware. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project includes both novel
automatic synthesis techniques for client applications and novel verification
techniques for distributed middleware. Distributed stores provide a spectrum of
consistency choices that impose a dilemma for clients between correctness,
responsiveness and availability. Given the high-level integrity properties of
the application, this project automatically decides the minimum required
coordination that guarantees integrity and convergence and automatically
synthesizes protocols for replicated objects. The reliability of these
applications is crucially dependent on the correctness of the underlying
middleware of subtle protocols such as broadcast and consensus. The middleware
is classically designed as stacks of layers, and its correctness is often stated
compositionally as intuitive arguments on temporal precedence of the events
exchanged between each layer and its sub-layers. This project builds a
development and verification framework in a proof assistant to design a
mechanically verified middleware stack. The framework is based on a
compositional and temporal program logic so that the proofs match the intuitive
arguments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
