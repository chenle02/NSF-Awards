The oceanographic instrumentation program supports requests to acquire
instrumentation for the collection, processing and analysis of oceanographic
data. This proposal from the University of Hawaii requests funding for equipment
that will be used to support NSF-funded research cruises aboard the R/V MOANA
WAVE, a 210 foot vessel that is owned by the NAVY and operated by the
University.
