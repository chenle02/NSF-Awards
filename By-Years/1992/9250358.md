A computer-based, interactive instructional laboratory is being developed to
enhance the curriculum in College Algebra, to institute new instructional
methods, and to develop instructional materials for enrichment. To meet the
instructional goals, the laboratory is equipped with twenty- four workstations
linked in a token ring network managed by a network server that will maintain
commercial software and exercises developed by the faculty. The networked system
provides a wide range of problem solving and graphing capabilities. The
laboratory provides the faculty with a new instructional vehicle and affords the
student the opportunity to practice math skills in a non-traditional manner and
explore mathematics beyond normal limits in an efficient, non- threatening
environment. Instruction is further enhanced by opportunities for enrichment and
a new emphasis on classroom/laboratory demonstrations incorporating active
learning strategies.
