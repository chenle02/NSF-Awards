9453469 Stewart The long-term goal of the research in Caro-Beth Stewart's
laboratory is to understand the molecular basis for adaptive evolution of higher
organisms, such as humans. That is, the research is aimed at understanding how
changes in DNA and protein sequence are responsible for observed differences
between species. To address this large goal, Stewart's current research
primarily focuses on the regulatory and structural/functional evolution of
digestive enzymes in animals with different diets. The digestive tract is an
ideal place to look for evidence of adaptive evolution because the gut mucosa
contacts the external environment, and diets can shift rapidly due to
environmental or behavioral changes. The gut is genetically plastic, showing
morphological adaptations to the diet of a species and expression of relevant
digestive enzymes in different regions. A change in the expression pattern of an
enzyme can place it under new selection pressures, which may drive the evolution
of its primary structure and function. This research will help elucidate how
organisms adapt genetically to environmental change. In addition, it will give
insight into changes that are allowed in protein sequence, structure, and
function.
