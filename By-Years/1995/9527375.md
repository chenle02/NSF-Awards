9527375 Elgamal This action concerns the analysis and interpretation of downhole
seismic records from the Hualien site in Taiwan. Over the past four years,
extensive studies of downhole array data from recorded earthquake motions at
Lotung, Taiwan, and at the Wildlife Refuge site, Imperial County, CA, have
resulted in the identification of a great deal of practically-oriented site and
soil dynamic response characteristics. The identification of these
characteristics is entirely based on the recorded downhole acceleration data.
Through these studies, a system of well developed and integrated techniques has
evolved for conducting state-of-the-art analyses of downhole array data. In this
project, these techniques are used to analyze the recorded downhole Hualien
seismic records. These records are used to identify the site low-amplitude shear
wave velocity profile, and shear wave propagation; also the soil dynamic
response properties. The primary analysis tools used are optimization routines
combined with site amplification codes. Emphasis is placed on the definition of
practical analysis methodologies, and design-oriented procedures. ***
