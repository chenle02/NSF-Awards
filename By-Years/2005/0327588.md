Seismic experiments and seafloor morphology indicate that the region of crustal
accretion, where melts reaches the base of the crust, has a half width of ~ 2
km, whereas the zone of melt production by decompression melting is much
broader. Somehow, melt becomes focused by a factor of ~ 50 as it ascends, yet no
single mechanism that has been proposed fully explains this focusing. Under this
award, the PI will follow several lines of investigation, to: 1) Improve the
treatment of crystallization and melt-rock reactions in steady-state one-
dimensional columns to better understand the permeability structure at the base
of the thermal boundary layer 2) Explore the effects of lateral variations in
the crystallization function and the viscosity field, due to the thermal
structure at the base of the lithosphere 3) Revisit the large-scale flow models
to include non-Newtonian rheology and the effect of porosity variations on
viscosity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
