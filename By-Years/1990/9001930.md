An Elzone (Model 180XY) Particle Size Analyzer will be purchased. The system
produces precise and detailed grain-size data and will have an immediate impact
on both current and planned research projects by the principal investigator.
These include: 1) an ATM study of the stratigraphic and geochronologic controls
on sedimentation in Lake Turkana, Kenya; 2) an ongoing study of contourite
deposition in Lake Superior; 3) a study of sediment dynamics in the Great Lakes
by Notre Dame's Environmental Research Station.
