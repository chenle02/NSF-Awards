Topological data analysis (TDA) brings techniques from algebraic topology to the
applied domains. It emphasizes methods that are stable, and as such resilient to
noise in the data, as well as methods that are computationally efficient, and as
such practical across a range of applications. Over the last two decades, TDA
techniques have found applications in many domains, including biochemistry,
cosmology, materials science, neuroscience, climate research, and many others.
One significant limitation that practitioners encounter is that one of the main
methods in TDA, persistent homology, is limited to studying one-parameter data,
i.e., measurements of a single quantity. The focus of this project is that in
practice, multiple measurements are available, and it is precisely the
correlation between them that will be used to reveal important features of the
problem. Software for practitioners using this methodology will be developed and
the project will include graduate student training in topological data analysis.

Recently, generalized persistent homology was introduced. It interprets
persistence as a Moebius inversion of a certain function derived from the
changes in topology of the data across parameters. The construction generalizes
all the properties of 1-parameter persistence needed in applications, including
stability and the particular structure of the diagrams used in machine learning
and statistical pipelines. This project will develop a software implementation
for computing generalized persistence diagrams, a crucial gap in this research
program and the missing bridge between theory and applications.
