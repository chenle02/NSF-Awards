This NSF Young Investigator award supports the research and teaching interests
of Ludwig C. Nitsche of the University of Chicago. The nature of the recipient's
teaching plan involves "one day at a time, one student at a time" in fundamental
principles, computational opportunities, technological innovation, and
undergraduate research projects. His research includes antipolarization dialysis
for fractionating complex mixtures and acoustic diffusion gates for microporous
membranes.
