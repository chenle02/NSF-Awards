This project aims to understand how changes in community interactions above- and
below-ground alter ecosystem function. As an example, Arbuscular mycorrhizae
(AM) are plant mutualists that help maintain plant function, especially under
environmental stress. Little is known about broad-scale diversity patterns of
mycorrhizal fungi, which hinders our ability to predict how communities will
respond to climatic change. Using an observational and experimental approach
this project will explore how climatic change and species interactions alter
mycorrhizal community structure and ecosystem function at several sites
worldwide. This work will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Jin-Sheng He at
Peking University, a world authority in climate change and ecosystem ecology.

To understand how above- and below-ground communities will respond to climatic
warming, this study will use a series of observational plots as well as a
manipulative warming (+2.5 degrees ambient temperature) Ã— dominant plant species
removal (to restructure plant communities) experiment along elevational
gradients. This study will attempt to answer two main questions: (1) What biotic
and abiotic factors structure arbuscular mycorrhizal communities along
elevational gradients, and (2) how will these communities respond to warming and
changes in plant communities. By combining different sites worldwide, this
project will be able to understand common patterns in current and future
plant/mycorrhizal distributions worldwide. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in
collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology.
