A cluster of instruments interfaced with microcomputers will be established for
first-year students of instrumental methods of analysis. Traditional analytical
techniques and modern instrumentation will enable students to carry out
laboratory projects using real and synthetic samples, and to gain experience in
chemical science as it is practiced. The centerpiece of the instrument cluster
is a diode array uv- visible spectrophotomer, interfaced with a microcomputer
for data acquisition and manipulation. Instrumentation for potentiometric
analyses, also computerized, and atomic absorption spectroscopy completes the
initial stage of development of this introductory laboratory for chemistry
majors and minors. The grantee will match the NSF award from non-Federal
sources.
