9627777 Gee The PIs propose a direct magnetostratigraphic test of the origin of
the tiny wiggles in the older portion of anomaly 5, utilizing directional and
paleointensity information from a 600 m section of Icelandic lavas spanning this
time interval. Documentation of the time significance of tiny wiggles in anomaly
5 may ultimately provide a window for analyzing aspects of the evolution of the
geomagnetic dynamo and may lead to the establishment of a finer temporal
resolution for seafloor spreading processes. ***
