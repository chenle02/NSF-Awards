The aim of this project is to strengthen the Biology curriculum at Marist
College by developing a dimension presently lacking -- that of allowing seniors
the opportunity to pursue scientific inquiry by engaging in an integrated field-
laboratory research project. Since the College is located on the banks of the
Hudson River, the Biology faculty has chosen to focus on studying the near-river
and riverine communities of its ecosystem. To implement this project the college
is using NSF grant funds and its matching monies to purchase binocular
microscopes for the rapid scanning and accurate identification of organisms, a
fluorescence microscope for identifying unknown viruses/bacteria using
fluorescent-dyed antibodies which glow under the scope if they react with a
specific virus/bacterium, and environmentally controlled growth chambers to
allow for simulation in the laboratory of such field conditions as CO2 level,
light intensity, tidal movements, temperature, humidity and day length. This
project allows the Marist Biology faculty to prepare students for realistic
challenges they will meet in graduate schools and professional work.
