On October 1, 1987 the Whittier Narrows Earthquake struck approximately 10 miles
east of downtown Los Angeles, California. This very well instrumented region
includes thousands of tilt-up buildings of varying ages which experienced strong
motions and in some cases, significant amounts of damage. Starting the day of
the earthquake perishable performance data on approximately 120 tilt-up
structures were collected throughout the area. This research project collates
the performance data and conducts statistical analyses of it. Detailed
performance and structural data are collected for the more seriously damaged
structures. Special attention is paid to the relative performance of pre- and
post-San Fernando Earthquake structures in order to evaluate seismic code
provisions intended to eliminate deficiencies identified in the 1971 event. The
documentation of these data will prove invaluable in highlighting serious design
and construction problems common to these buildings and in improving the
accuracy of future damage estimates. This is desirable because the construction
type is very popular for low-rise commercial and industrial buildings and houses
many strategic industries.
