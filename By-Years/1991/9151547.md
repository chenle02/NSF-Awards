The goal of this project is to expand the laboratory experiences for
undergraduates in molecular biology and recombinant DNA technology. An ultra-low
temperature freezer, microcentrifuge, vacuum oven, gel apparatus and power
supplies are being used in new lab exercises include large scale plasmid
isolation, DNA cloning, Southern blot analysis, restriction site mapping, SDS-
poly-acrylamide gel electrophoreses, submarine gel electrophoresis and sucrose
gradient ultracentrifugation.
