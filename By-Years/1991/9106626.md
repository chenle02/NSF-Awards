With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Michl will organize and fund the travel of young faculty,
advanced graduate students, and invited speakers to attend the VIIth
International Congress on Quantum Chemistry in Menton, France, July 2-5, 1991.
The scientific program consists of plenary lectures, topical symposia, poster
sessions, and satellite meetings. The five satellite meetings will immediately
preceed the conference and will be in the areas of: catalysis, electron
transfer, recent methodological advances in dynamical and in correlation
calculations, computer simulations of biomolecular systems, and new materials.
