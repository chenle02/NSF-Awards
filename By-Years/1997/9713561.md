CMS 9713561 PI: M. Arockiasamy Florida Atlantic University The proposed workshop
on Fiber Reinforced Plastics (FRP) will address construction and performance of
FRP productssubjected to loading conditions typical to cold regions. Application
area of primary focus will be civil structures including transportation,
buildings, and sanitary facilities. One of the major concern regardimg the
prolonged use of composite materials is their ability to retain integrity in
cold regions where thermal cycling between ambient temperature and cryogenic
temperature is experienced. Performance of compositre structures and components
is seriously affected in very cold environment. Only scant information is
available on the life cycle costs, environmental degradation, and extreme
environment performances of the composites. The workshop will provide a unique
forum for the researchers, academics, practiving engineers, and FRP product
manufacturers to discuss problems associated with FRP composites in extreme
environments.
