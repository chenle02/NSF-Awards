The objective of this US-Poland research project between Dr. Alan L. Balch of
the University of California-Davis and Dr. Lechoslaw Latos-Grazynski of the
Institute of Chemistry, University of Wroclaw, Poland, is to explore the
synthesis and coordination properties of core-modified porphyrins -- porphyrins
which one or more of the pyrrole nitrogens has been altered, particularly by
replacement with a different heteroatom. The researchers anticipate that these
ligands will stabilize metal ions in low oxidation states and in planar, rather
than tetrahedral geometry. The reactivity of the metal ions in these unusual
environments will be examined. They will continue their studies of the
coordination properties of monothiaporphyrins, particularly their (formal) Ni(I)
and Pd(I) complexes. Results are expected to improve our understanding of
certain aspects of metallobiochemistry and may yield complexes that are good
catalysts for alkylation or oxidation of organic molecules. This project in
chemistry fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by
enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine
complementary talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual interest and
competence.
