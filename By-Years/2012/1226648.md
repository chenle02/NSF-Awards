This study will investigate focus and focus-senstivity in K'ichee', a Mayan
language of Guatemala. Focus -- the special prominence given to contrastive or
question-answering constituents -- may be realized in different ways in
different languages: for instance, using prosodic emphasis, or changes in word
order. This has made it a phenomenon of particular interest for researchers
curious about the interfaces between phonology, syntax and/or pragmatics. Focus
also has relevance to the semantics/pragmatics interface, via the phenomenon of
focus sensitivity: changes in focus placement can affect the entailments or
presuppositions of a sentence which contains certain expressions focus-sensitive
expressions, including exclusive (e.g. 'only,' 'mere(ly)') and additive or
scalar- additive particles (e.g 'also' and 'even').&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Working
under the direction of Dr. Beaver, Mr. Velleman will conduct fieldwork in the
town of Nahual√°, in the K'ichee'-speaking region of the Guatemalan highlands, in
order to arrive at a more complete picture of focus marking and focus-
sensitivity in K'ichee'. Past work on focus in Mayan langauges has described
focus movement as the sole focus-marking strategy. Mr. Velleman's own
preliminary field data shows that this is incorrect: K'ichee' also has a focus-
in-situ strategy which has so far gone undescribed. As for focus-sensitivity, it
has not been discussed in detail in K'ichee', or indeed in any Mesoamerican
language. Over the course of two field trips, he will elicit semantic judgments
from native speakers; and will collect, transcribe and analyze recordings of
spontaneous conversation, task-related dialogue, and semi-spontaneous
question/answer pairs. The analysis of these data will contribute to our
understanding of crosslinguistic semantic and pragmatic variation. The
recordings and transcriptions will also add to our documentary record of the
K'ichee' language, and will be publically archived so that future researchers
and interested K'ichee' speakers may access them.
