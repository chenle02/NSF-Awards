Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: CNS 0454259&lt;br/&gt;PI: John C.
Kelly&lt;br/&gt;Institution: North Carolina Agricultural &amp; Technical State
University&lt;br/&gt;Program: NSF 04-588 CISE Computing Research
Infrastructure&lt;br/&gt;Title: CRI: Advanced Sensor Network Applications for
Environmental Monitoring Systems &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Investigators
at North Carolina A&amp;T will develop a sensor network infrastructure with
environmental monitoring for water quality management as an application focus.
The proposal will support research and education in information systems in
conjunction with an application in environmental science. Computer science
issues to be addressed include wireless sensor networks, wireless network
security, wireless network protocols, data collection for environmental
monitoring, and data mining. Broader impacts include using sensor network
technology to explore new sensor application in water quality management. The
investigators have a strong educational program integrated with their research
and plans to increase minority participation in computer science and engineering
education and career paths. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
