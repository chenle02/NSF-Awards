A Comprehensive Listing System is created to increase the amount of mathematics
and science materials available in alternate formats including braille, large
print, recorded, and electronic form in Canada and the United States for blind
and print-disabled students in grades 3-14. Four major organizations serving
print-disabled persons in North America are adding their bibliographic
information to both the APH-CARL and UNION national databases major databases
serving Library of Congress users and institutions serving the blind and print-
disabled. The collaborative also invites more than 400 small publishers and
colleges with Disabled Student Services (DSS) Offices on their campuses to
contribute other titles not presently included on the database. Materials are
available in several languages to accommodate users' needs. As a part of this
project, Recording for the Blind (RFB) provides training to DSS offices on RFB
standards for recording science and mathematics materials to ensure uniform
quality. They also train users, educators, and librarians on the new systems to
increase use and minimize problems associated with the transition to college by
print-disabled students.
