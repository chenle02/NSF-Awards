Abstract ATM-9629391 Clayson, Carol Anne Purdue University Title: Influence of
Tropical Clouds on Sea Surface Temperature, Sea Surface Salinity, and the Ocean
Mixed Layer The science aims of this "CAREER" proposal are 1) improving the
physical representation of solar radiation and precipitation processes in the
existing surface flux and ocean mixed layer models, 2) evaluation of the
influence of high frequency convective events and seasonal to interannual
variability on SST and SSS and cloud characteristics over the warm pool and the
entire tropical ocean. The educational component consists of 1) development of a
number of inter disciplinary courses at under graduate levels, 2) enhancement of
learning using computer-assisted instruction, 3) completion of an electronic
textbook on small scale processes in air-sea interaction.
