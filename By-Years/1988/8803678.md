The investigations into the statistical mechanics and quantum field theory of
systems with an infinite number of degrees of freedom will be continued. In the
past year a major discovery in statistical mechanics was made by finding that
many of the N state chiral Potts models used in the study of commensurate
incommensurate phase transitions are solvable in the sense of possessing a one
parameter family of commuting transfer matrices, and that these transfer
matrices are parametrized by curves of genus greater than one. Such models,
based on higher genus curves, have been searched for over fifteen years and
their discovery opens new areas of research both in solid state physics and in
the related area of algebraic geometry. During the course of this award studies
will be made of the free energy and excitation spectrum of these models and
their correlation functions, particularly in their connection with conformal
field theory. They will also continue to search for more models based on curves
of genus higher than one and to investigated whether such models can be found in
three dimensions. Investigations of the relation between these new models, the
methods of deformation theory, and possibly string theories will be made.
