The principal investigator will continue his research on large deviation
analysis of stochastic systems. In particular his work will deal with
applications to queueing networks, which will give insight into the behavior of
the new high performance computing networks and very large multiprocessor
systems that are covered by the HPCC initiative. The principal investigator will
continue his research in probability. In particular he will be looking at
applications which deal with computing networks. This research has relevance to
the High Performance Computing and Communications initiative.
