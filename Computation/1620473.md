This project is concerned with the development of mathematical theory and
computational tools for some hybrid methods in medical imaging. By hybrid
methods we refer to imaging techniques where two modalities with distinct
underlying physics are coupled together to achieve the contrast and resolution
not attainable separately by each of the modalities involved. This project is
concerned with a specific class of hybrid imaging modalities that couple
ultrasound imaging with optical imaging to achieve high-resolution imaging of
optical properties of heterogeneous media. Our objectives are (i) to develop
fast and robust image reconstruction algorithms for these hybrid modalities for
practical use, and (ii) to train advanced undergraduate students, graduate
students, and postdoctoral researchers on the mathematical and computational
research in this field. The main proposed research efforts in this project
include, but not limited to: (i) to develop efficient inversion algorithms for
multi-coefficient inverse problems in photoacoustic tomography (PAT) with
unknown ultrasound properties; (ii) to develop efficient reconstruction
algorithms for inverse problems in quantitative fluorescence PAT (fPAT) and two-
photon PAT (TP-PAT) for molecular imaging; (iii) to perform mathematical
analysis on inverse problems in ultrasound-modulated fluorescence optical
tomography (UMfOT) and to develop robust image reconstruction strategies in the
same setting; and (iv) to develop fast algorithms for the transport equation for
optimization-based iterative image reconstruction strategies for PAT, fPAT, TP-
PAT and UMfOT with partial measurements. The mathematical ideas developed in the
proposed projects are expected to provide insights on the mathematical and
numerical solutions of many similar inverse coefficient problems to partial
differential equations that appear in many fields of science and technology.
