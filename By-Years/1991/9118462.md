Marine geological and geophysical studies of the Ross Sea and Weddell Sea
continental shelves provide evidence that the ice sheet grounded near the shelf
edge in these areas during the late Wisconsinan, and that the retreat of the ice
sheet to its present position was rapid and probably episodic. This Award
supports a project which will establish the most recent (late Wisconsin-
Holocene) history of ice sheet advance and retreat in Ross Sea. The objectives
include: 1) reconstruction the late Wisconsin paleodrainage regime, including
ice stream drainage divides; 2) reconstruction of former grounding zone
positions; 3) constraint of the timing of ice sheet retreat from the shelf; and
4) acquisition of geophysical, sedimentological, and paleontological data which
may provide indicators of the environmental factors that may have influenced to
ice sheet retreat. This is a joint effort between Rice University, the
University of Colorado, and Hamilton College. The project involves experts in a
wide variety of fields, and will interface with glaciologists, physical
oceanographers, and climatologists who will address the problem of ice sheet
stability and the record of climatic and glaciological change.
