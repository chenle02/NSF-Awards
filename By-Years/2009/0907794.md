The research objective of this Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) award
is to better understand the properties of information value within the context
of resource allocation decisions made under significant uncertainty. For
example, the core of the Department of Homeland Security's National
Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) is a risk-based resource allocation, which
includes both risk assessment and prioritization phases. The risk assessment
provides information that is used during the prioritization or resource
allocation phase. While prioritization methods have been extensively studied,
the relationship between the risk assessment and prioritization phases has not,
leaving many interesting questions unanswered. For example, how is the value of
the risk assessment related to the structure of the underlying resource
allocation problem? As resources become tighter or the need becomes greater,
thereby constraining the funding of NIPP programs, should we spend more on risk
assessment to improve the allocation decision? Do tighter resource constraints
in one area mean that we should allocate additional resources to another?
Deliverables of this research include reviews of the value of information and
resource allocation literatures, model formulations, identification of value of
information drivers in diverse settings, archival journal publications, and
engineering student education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research
will enable us to better design information gathering and analysis activities
within constrained resource allocation settings, which has wide applicability in
government and in industries ranging from oil and gas exploration and production
to life sciences research and development. This improved design will increase
the efficiency of resource allocation decisions, enabling better funding of
critical projects. The results of this research will be transferred to graduate
and undergraduate engineering students through direct involvement in the
research and incorporation of findings into classroom instruction.
