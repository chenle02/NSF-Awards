PI: Hochgeschwender, Ute H.&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: 1450216&lt;br/&gt;Title: BRAIN
EAGER: Genetically Encoded Light Sources for Non-Invasive
Optogenetics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Significance&lt;br/&gt;The realization of
light-driven genetically targeted neuronal activation and silencing has led to
unprecedented possibilities in manipulating neuronal activity in the behaving
experimental animal.&lt;br/&gt;However, translation of this approach into the
clinical arena for potential therapeutic applications is complicated by the need
for implanting optical fibers in the brain as the light source for activating
lightsensing opsins. This proposal describes an integrated research, education,
and outreach program which focuses on developing a new generation of genetically
encoded light sources for non-invasive manipulation of optogenetic sensors. If
successful this will be a key threshold advance that will provide the foundation
for new technologies enabling minimally invasive and highly efficient
diagnostics and therapies. Currently there are no alternative approaches which
would achieve, non-invasively, the full range of photonic control of neurons as
proposed here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;The
investigators will build on the highly innovative concept of combining
optogenetics with bioluminescence. To exploit the concept?s potential for non-
invasive light activation of optogenetic sensors in clinical settings, they will
utilize protein engineering to both improve light output and extend the emission
spectrum of the luciferase by optimizing intramolecular bioluminescence
resonance energy transfer (BRET) between Gaussia luciferase and various
fluorescent proteins. They will test the novel constructs for their efficiency
in activating channelrhodopsins and proton and chloride pumps in vitro. The
development of these concepts and reagents will have potentially transformative
and broad impacts on the implementations of optogenetics in medicine.
