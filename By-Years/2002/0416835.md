Abstract 0416835

The University of Massachusetts Boston has been awarded a grant to continue and
greatly expand the Electronic Field Guide (EFG) project for identification of
species in the field, in the laboratory, or via the Internet. The research
places special emphasis on ways to make digital images more useful in the
identification process by making it easy for experts to annotate them and have
those annotations travel with copies of the images around the Web. The proposed
work includes significant extensions to the JPEG2000 specification for
biodiversity studies as well as development and integration of advanced
authoring and image annotation tools. The EFG will be enhanced to allow broader
use on a variety of platforms, including handhelds. Broad use will be
facilitated by the adoption of emerging community standards for descriptive data
and by the extensive involvement of teachers and students in the Boston Public
Schools and use by hundreds of US college students doing research at Monte Verde
Cloud Forest Preserve in Costa Rica. Field Guides produced by the research will
also support observations by professional scientists and informed lay observers,
thereby helping researchers gather data about the occurrence of species on a
wider scale than might otherwise be possible.
