This award will support precise investigations into the symmetry properties of
fundamental interactions, as they are manifested in nuclei and atoms. Detailed
correlations will be made of the decay products of polarized neutrons, to test
for time-reversal non-invariance in parity conserving electro-weak interactions.
The work will also provide an improved measurement of the axial vector coupling
constant and test the relationship between the half-life and the beta-asymmetry
predicted by the standard model. The principal investigator is a very promising
young scientist. He has developed many of the techniques that make these
extremely precise experiments possible.
