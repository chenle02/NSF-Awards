This award provides funding for the continued conduct of an open workshop on
decision-based design. The workshop will be conducted via a series of face-to-
face meetings, and with continuing interaction between all interested parties
via electronic and Internet technologies throughout the three-year continuation
period. Specifically, the workshop will include the continuation of a web site
for conduct of the workshop. A primary component of the workshop will be the
continual, open development and dissemination of the philosophical, theoretical
and practical results of the workshop discussions and activities. The workshop
will continue to concentrate on a diversity of research efforts directed at the
development of a theory of engineering design based on the emerging notion that
engineering design is a decision making process amenable to the tools and
theories that have developed in the field of decision theory. Specific goals for
this phase of the workshop include continued development of a mathematically
sound theory of engineering design, the building of a repository of foundational
materials (a lexicon, case studies, references, text materials), the
establishment of ties between decision-based design and other areas of science,
and the transfer of decision-based design tools to industry. The workshop web
site address will be located at:
&lt;br/&gt;http://dbd.eng.buffalo.edu/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will
provide new directions for research and education in engineering design. New
theoretical concepts should lead to approaches to engineering design that will
enable the design of better products, products that have greater market appeal,
cost less, have lower environmental impact, and that are more friendly for
customers. Further, these concepts are likely to lead to entirely new approaches
to engineering education, with a strong focus on engineering design as a
decision making process.
