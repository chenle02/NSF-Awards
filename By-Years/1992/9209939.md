Neurons extend two distinct types of neurites, axons, and dendrites. Axons are
highly specialized to transmit information over long distances, whereas
dendrites are highly specialized to receive and process information. A growing
body of evidence indicates that the more overt differences between these
neurites derive from underlying differences in their cytoskeletal structure, and
in particular of their microtubules. Microtubules are filamentous proteins that
have important functions in cellular architecture and motility. In recent years,
considerable effort has been devoted toward understanding the regulation and
functions of microtubules in the axon. In contrast, dendritic microtubules are
poorly studied. The experiments in this application will explore the role of
MAP-2, a somatodendritic-specific microtubule-associated protein in the
organization and stability properties of dendritic microtubules. Other
experiments will explore the potential role of microtubules in regulating
organelle transport in the dendrite. These studies will resolve important issues
about dendritic microtubules, and will thereby provide new insights into the
mechanisms that generate and maintain neuronal polarity. Information of this
kind is essential for understanding the cell biology of the neuron, and for
elucidating the causes and potential cures for neuropathologies involving
retardation of dendritic growth, and/or loss of neuronal polarity.
