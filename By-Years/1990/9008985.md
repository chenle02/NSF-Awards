Hydra is the most primitive metazoan possessing a nervous system. This
multicellular animal has been a favorite model for developmental studies, yet
electrophysiological studies are practically non-existent. For a number of
technical reasons the application of traditional electrophysiological techniques
using hydrozoans have proven to be quite difficult and overall not successful.
This study will examine the properties of dissociated Hydra neurons by utilizing
the technique of patch clamping. This microelectrode technique permits the
recording of ion channels from cells too small that would not be possible with
traditional electrophysiological methods. The effects of a putative
neurotransmitter on whole cell ionic currents and single channels activity of
hydra nerve and epithelial cell membranes will be studied. Results from this
study will provide additional information on membrane function and physiology of
chemical transmission in hydra cells.
