9354818 Newman As computing continues to become an essential and integral part
of the basic skills of all undergraduates, it is critical that the service
courses for non computing majors reflect the advances made within the computing
disciplines. This project integrates recent developments in computer based
techniques with the current best educational practices to create an innovative
computer curriculum for Scientist, Engineers, Mathematicians, and Educators. The
curriculum is based on an emphasis of solution correctness, team orientation,
and the use of advanced languages, tools, and application packages. This
foundation is combined with the fundamentals of the Software Engineering, Object
Oriented, and Cleanroom paradigms to provide the skills necessary for each
undergraduate to take advantage of potential computers can provide them in their
educational and professional careers. This project produced the foundation for
three sequences of introductory level computing service courses. The courses
were categorized as application based consumer computing, software development
of small projects by a single individual, and large scale, team based, system
development. The initial motivation for these sequences of courses was based on
the innovative curricula at Florida Tech. The foundation for the course
sequences developed by this project included an analysis of the expected needs
of the academic majors, a set of evaluation criteria, and a set of preferred
educational paradigms for course development. Initial course outlines were
prepared, sample multimedia presentation were developed, and a sequence of
reports were produced. This effort also produced several general conclusions and
a proposal for the continuation of this project. ***y
