It is proposed to study certain inverse scattering problems arising in quantum
mechanics and wave propagation. Such problems are governed by the Schroedinger
equation, its variants, the wave equation and the telegraphy equation in the
frequency domain. Using techniques related to Riemann-Hilbert problems, operator
factorizations, and spectral analysis of differential operators, the aim is to
recover coefficients appearing in the relevant differential equations in terms
of a suitable set of scattering data. In addition to their practical importance
in physics, engineering, and other applied fields, these inverse problems
contribute mathematical techniques to various areas of mathematics such as
nonlinear differential equations, integral equations, boundary value problems,
and applied functional analysis.

The inverse scattering problems under study are motivated by their important
applications in many areas such as materials science, nondestructive testing,
acoustic imaging, seismology, geophysics, and remote sensing. In materials
science the solution of the inverse scattering problem amounts to determining
surface and subsurface structure of materials by analyzing neutron beams
scattered off the materials, for example, helping to understand bonding of
polymer components. In quantum mechanics it corresponds to the determination of
forces holding molecules, atoms, and subatomic particles together by analyzing
colliding beams of particles. In remote sensing it helps to profile unknown
targets by analyzing acoustic or electromagnetic waves scattered off such
targets.
