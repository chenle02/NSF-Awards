Kramer 9315091 The project goal is to gain a better understanding of how the
growth of coccoid marine cyanobacteria is regulated by nitrogen supply. The
approach will be to build a strong theoretical and methodological base using
studies of laboratory cultures. The project will be directed towards the
development of nucleic acid probes and antisera to glutamine synthetase and
nitrate reductase. Together with specific probes for rRNA, these tools provide a
direct means to analyze variations in the nitrogen assimilation system and
general physiological state caused by variations in nitrogen supply. The results
will be used to provide detailed analyses of patterns of gene regulation in
chemostat cultures of marine Synechococcus spp. These studies comprise a
comprehensive effort to develop and implement the means to determine the
molecular biological basis of the responses of autotrophic picoplankton to
nitrogen flux in the sea. ***
