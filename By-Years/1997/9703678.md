9703678 Stanton The supported project lies in the area of several complex
variables; in particular, it involves the study of real hypersurfaces in complex
Euclidean space. Specifically, the investigator plans to find a complete normal
form for the defining equation of a rigid hypersurface in complex Euclidean
space; find a necessary and sufficient condition for analyticity of
infinitesimal Cauchy-Riemann automorphisms; study the evolution of a strictly
convex hypersurface by the Levi flow; study the off-diagonal small time behavior
of the heat kernel on a CR-manifold; understand the singularities of kernels
arising in the study of the Neumann problem and the corresponding heat kernel.
Real hypersurfaces in complex Euclidean space generalize surfaces in space: they
are higher dimensional analogs of surfaces sitting inside a space equipped with
a complex structure. Complex structures - locally, arrays of complex numbers -
were first introduced in the study of polynomial equations; they continue to
find many uses in various parts of mathematics, often leading to conceptual as
well as computational simplifications.
