Equipment for constructing a computer-based facility capable of processing
video sequences and 3D and 4D images including two Sparc 10 computers capable of
24 bit color display will be interfaced with Parallax video boards and other
video equipment for control of frame-by-frame processing and recording shall be
acquired. The resulting facility will make possible advanced education and
research in video sequence processing, image sequence filtering, image sequence
segmenting, visualization and analysis of heart motion, and 3D and 4D ultrasound
images for medical diagnosis.
