This research is a 5-year continuation of investigations carried out under two
former grants dealing with earthquake source analysis and earth structure.
Topics include 1) continuation of the ongoing Centroid Moment Tensor (CMT)
analysis; 2) refining the CMT analysis procedure through the combined use of
waveforms and travel time observations; 3) extending the CMT procedure to the
analysis of smaller events by the use of teleseismic surface waves; 4) using
SKKS and SKS observations, in conjunction with 3D mantle models, to constrain
outer core structure; 5) using combined data sets to obtain improved spherically
symmetric reference Earth models; 6) performing joint inversions for the P and S
3D-velocity structure of the mantle; 7) performing modeling experiments based on
joint inversion of seismic and geodynamic data, as well as exploring the
geodynamic implications of the 3D velocity models; 8) including higher frequency
data in the 3D earth structure modeling experiments in order to improve radial
and lateral resolution; 9) developing procedures for hybrid region/global model
parameterizations which will allow for proper inversions for large- scale
regional structure; 10) investigation of mantle anisotropy and lateral variation
in attenuation and how these phenomena may be accounted for in the 3D modeling
experiments. The service provided by these efforts to the world seismological
community, especially the CMT catalog, is widely used in determination of earth
structure, tectonics, and earthquake analysis. This research is a component of
the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
