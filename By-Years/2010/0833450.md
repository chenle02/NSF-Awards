This project builds on the strengths and successes of the Unidata Program Center
with an enhanced focus on the application of cutting-edge technologies and tools
for a broad community of scientists and educators, with the overarching goal of
transforming geoscience education and research. The endeavors emphasize
providing data and a rich set of tools, services, and collaborative activities
that will enable the community to advance scientific exploration and learning.
It will continue to provide real-time meteorology data to over 170 institutions
to instruct and conduct research. The goals, objectives, and activities in this
projet are based on national science, technology, and education trends, as well
as community concerns and needs.
