The killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus, naturally spawns in Northeast Florida salt
marshes with semilunar periodicity throughout most of the year. In addition,
during the biweekly 3-to 4-day periods of spawning, killifish only spawn once
each day coincident with the highest tide. Since killifish oocytes are
periodically recruited, grown, and ovulated as eggs in preparation for this
spawning activity, this animal can thus serve as a superb model for periodic
female reproductive activity. Gonadotropins secreted by the pituitary are
thought to directly regulate essentially all ovarian activity. The PIs will
purify gonadotropins from killifish pituitaries so that they can prepare
antibodies against them. Then, by using appropriately labeled antigonadotropin
antibodies, the PIs plan to identify which cells in the pituitary synthesize and
secrete each identified gonadotropin and when this occurs; the PIs will also be
able to measure gonadotropin levels in the bloodstream and discover whether or
not these levels are constant or cycling. This should allow the PI to correlate
each type of gonadotropin with specific ovarian events. Specific ovarian events
will also be studied in order to better understand how the various cells of the
ovary respond to circulating gonadotropin.
