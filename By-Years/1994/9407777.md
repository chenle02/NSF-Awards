9407777 DeFanti The CAVE is a virtual reality System which allows users to
surround themselves with artificially generated reality. One of its unique
features is the ability for a group of persons to immerse themselves at the same
time. This makes the CAVE a natural for demonstrations. This project will
choose, by peer review, around 40 science projects and will work with the chosen
disciplinary scientists to translate their work into the CAVE environment. A
CAVE system will be set up at SIGGRAPH (the foremost exhibition in high-end
visualization equipment, software, and underlying research) to show the results
of the project.
