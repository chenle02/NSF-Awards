9414136 Kennedy The focus of this research is the development of several methods
for the preparation of heavily substituted cyclopropanes. All methods involve
the use of hexasubstituted pyrazoles as precursors to the desired systems. %%%
With this Minority Research Initiation award, the Division of Chemistry is
supporting the research of Dr. G. Davon Kennedy of the Department of Chemistry
at Georgia State University. Professor Kennedy will focus his work on developing
methods for the preparation of a class of organic compounds known as
cyclopropanes. These compounds have use as synthetic intermediates and they
appear in a number of natural products.
