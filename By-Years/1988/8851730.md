Old Dominion University believes that their curriculum is deficient in that
undergraduate students in Science and Engineering are not educated in the theory
and practice of high performance vector/parallel computing. They believe that
there is a pressing need for this kind of education at the undergraduate level
in view of growing importance of large scale computing in Science and
Engineering and the proliferation of supercomputers. This project is intended to
introduce Senior students in the Science and Engineering to the theory and
practice of high performance vector and parallel computing. This will be
centered around a laboratory where each student will obtain hands-on experience
in programming vector and parallel computers, both SIMD and MIMD. The students
will measure the performance of the program and compare it to the prediction
obtained form simple complexity analysis. The emphasis will be on the analysis
and implementation of a few representative examples chosen from computational
problems in Science and Engineering, of course tailored to the capabilities of
undergraduates.
