9424370 Akemann Unbounded derivations of operator algebras have been studied
extensively as a model for the infinitesimal time development of a quantum-
mechanical system. The proposed research involves a study of unbounded
derivations of von Neumann algebras building on Weaver's characterization of the
domains of such derivations as Lipschitz algebras, in the commutative case.
Operators on a Hilbert space are infinite analogues of finite matrices. They
have applications throughout mathematics but the proposed research relates
specifically to mathematical physics. Algebras of operators have been used to
model certain quantum mechanical systems, particularly those arising in quantum
statistical mechanics. The proposal involves a change of the type of operator
algebra used in this manner, with the double aim of clarifying the general
theory and giving insight into specific examples. ***
