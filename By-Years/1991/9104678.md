This is an international travel grant to support the principal investigator's
participation in the "International Symposium on Building Technology and
Earthquake Hazard Mitigation", scheduled for March 25-29, 1991 in Kunning,
China. The Symposium is jointly organized by the National Center for Earthquake
Engineering Research (NCEER) at the State University of New York and the China
Building Academy in Beijing. It will be implemented under Annex III of the US-
China Protocol on Cooperative Earthquake Studies, for which the Division of
Biological and Critical Systems at NSF is the implementing agency on the
American side. The principal investigator has an outstanding track record of
successful research in hazard mitigation, and is an invited symposium speaker.
The activity will advance knowledge and the technological basis for earthquake
countermeasures and will stimulate bilateral research in this important area.
