This engineering education research award to Washington State University will
develop an integrated design experience focused on sustainability engineering.
The goal of the project is to establish a replicable model for faculty
development and student engagement in sustainability engineering. This will be
achieved through a year long integrated design experience that brings together
skilled practitioners with faculty and students. The goal is to better prepare
students for the practice of engineering through apprenticeship type activities
with skilled practitioners and faculty and focused on environmental
sustainability. These techniques are expected to increase student's interest in
engineering and will enhance the number who complete engineering degrees and are
ready to fill engineering jobs.
