This research tests whether American's evaluations of the president have become
more volatile in the postwar era. If the American public has become more
volatile, less consensual and more uncertain in their evaluations of the
president, it becomes more difficult for presidents to build and maintain
legislative coalitions, unify domestic actors behind foreign policy initiatives,
and maintain their own electoral coalitions. The proposal has two parts. The
first explores changes in aggregate, group and individual bases of presidential
approval. This part develops new measures of volatility in assessing
Presidential approval. The second part turns toward the consequences of
volatility for presidential success in Congress. This study uses new
methodological techniques to combine public opinion poll data and legislative
roll calls. These data constitute a new and valuable resource for scholars of
the Presidency and Congress.
