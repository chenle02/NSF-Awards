An ultracentrifuge will be purchased to be used in a molecular biology course.
This equipment will be used in experiments involving high purity nucleic acid
isolation and rapid phase isolation. This will give students experience with the
instrument, and also demonstrate applications and teach the principles of
equilibrium, gradient, and moving-zone centrifugation. The instrument will also
be used in courses in genetics, biochemistry, and embryology, and will be of
particular value for independent student research. The college will provide 50%
matching funds.
