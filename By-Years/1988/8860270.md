Polar exploration and study of the polar world have brought about the necessity
for housing engineers and scientists who produce liquid and solids wastes that
must be disposed of in what constitutes a hostile environment. This study deals
with selecting waste water techniques which when operating efficiently, will
least perturbate the natural polar microbiological and chemical environment. The
objectives of this proposal are to (1) study a group of unit operations and
processes for a polar environment, (2) select physical/chemical processes to
dispose of the residual solids, in a safe manner and (3) assure that the gaseous
and liquid effluents contain contaminants at a level below current detection
techniques before dilution.
