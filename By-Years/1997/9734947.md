DMI-9734947 Kyriakides The space frame is the preferred design concept for all-
aluminum light-weight cars. It is made of extruded tubes that are stretch formed
to the required shape and joined by nodes. Automated assembly requires unusually
tight dimensional tolerances on the formed tubes. To achieve these, the hollow
extrusions are prestretched and bent to the required shapes over dies. An
unwanted byproduct of this process is distortion of their cross section. Tension
applied during bending over a mandrel aggravates such cross sectional
distortions. To reduce this unwanted deformation, the parts are internally
pressurized. At the present, the design parameters for each part (i.e. die
shape, prestretch load, level of internal pressure) are selected empirically
which is both costly and slow. This two-year project will use a combination of
experiment and analysis to study the stretch forming process, understand the
factors that govern it, and develop methods for optimizing it. The project is a
joint venture between Industry (Alcoa) and University (UT-Austin). The
experiments will be conducted in a custom bend-stretch-pressure forming facility
recently developed. The three axes of loading have closed-loop control that
allows operation of the facility via a computer. Custom nonlinear analyses have
been developed which are capable of predicting the cross sectional changes of
rectangular tubes bent over a rigid surface while being stretched and internally
pressurized. This work will involve the use of the test facility along with the
analyses to understand and optimize this manufacturing process on more general
shapes.
