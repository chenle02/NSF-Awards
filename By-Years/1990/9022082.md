In this study the aurora will be viewed from Godhavan, Greenland (near the
magnetic meridiana distance ~290km northwest of Sondre Stromfjord, Greenland)
with an imaging spectrometer. Simultaneously the incoherent scatter radar and
other optical instruments will view the same aurora in the magnetic zenith at
Sondre Stromfjord. The method provides measurements of source emission
intensities versus altitude, while simultaneous measurements of the particle
beam is made with the radar. The first scientific objective is a study of
electron beam versus emission heights. Studies of auroral arcs and thermospheric
effects will also be performed. Two winter campaign periods are planned. A
dedicated two week "aeronomy" campaign is planned where the radar will be
predominantly operated looking up the magentic field. Operation is also planned
for two additional two-week, low moon, periods with "shared" radar time. The
first campaign will concentrate on the 420-800 nm spectral region. Height
distributions of the entire spectrum will be measured. The spectral region for
the second campaign will evolve from the results of the first.
