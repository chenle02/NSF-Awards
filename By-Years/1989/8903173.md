This is a two-year collaborative research project between Dr. Franz
Rosenberger, University of Alabama and Professor Ming Nai-Ben, Nanjing
University to study the conditions for achieving morphological stability for the
growth of high quality crystals. This project studies an important field of
physics. The U.S. group is known for its work on the transport and kinetics
concepts in crystal growth while the Chinese team is strong in in-situ
crystallographic characterization and has the ability to identify growth
mechanisms and defects. Both areas are needed for understanding the processes
and conditions of crystals growth. The study is complementary in nature and can
advance this field of science in both countries.
