The objective of this project is to examine the electrostatic potentials on the
production of second messengers. The hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol
4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a lipid located on the cytoplasmic surface of cell
membranes, produces inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DG).
IP3 induces the release of calcium; DG activates a protein kinase C. Dr.
McLaughlin will carry out a number of projects including: 1) studying the
binding of polyvalent cations like neomycin to PIP2; 2) labelling the
hydrocarbon tails of PIP2 and making fluorescence energy transfer measurements;
3) studying the effect of electrostatic potentials on the ability of calcium to
activate a polyphosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C; and 4) continuing
theoretical and experimental studies of the role of surface potentials and
cooperativity in the binding of polyvalent cations to monovalent anionic lipids
in bilayer membranes. Although very few biophysicists are working in this area
and little information is available about the physical factors that influence
the production and mechanism of action of these second messengers, there is a
great deal of evidence present for believing that one of these factors is the
electrostatic potential produced by charged lipids such as phosphatidylserine.
