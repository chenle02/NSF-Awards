Student research projects are extended mathematical and scientific projects
involving a variety of skills, frequently using computer capabilities, and
requiring a final written report. They are effective means of integrating
technology in larger classes. The Department of Mathematics and Statistics is
implementing student research projects in multivariate calculus for
undergraduates as the initial step of the reform of its entire mathematics
curriculum. This implementation is an expansion of previous experiments in
selected sections of the multivariate calculus course. A classroom laboratory is
being constructed with networked workstations and audiovisual capability,
initially serving about 150 calculus students each semester. As the program
expands, the laboratory can also serve students in undergraduate courses in
linear algebra, differential equations, and mathematical modeling. The
laboratory is a center of efforts at the university to influence the direction
of calculus reform through workshop programs for in-service teachers, programs
in mathematics education for preservice teachers, and collaboration with other
institutions in the U.S. Military Academy Consortium.
