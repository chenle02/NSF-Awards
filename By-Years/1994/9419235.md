9419235 Tape This project is an experimental and theoretical study of ice
crystals in the antarctic atmosphere and the halos that they produce. For
reasons that are not currently known, the antarctic interior experiences more
frequent and better developed halos than any other location on Earth. The
objectives of the project are to observe natural halos at South Pole Station and
to sample ice crystals in order to validate computer models of light refraction
and reflection in ice crystals. Such models have the potential for the remote
sensing of atmospheric conditions. Controlled experiments, such as seeding the
atmosphere with dry ice, will produce artificially generated, but simple and
well-formed single- species crystals. The project provides a unique mechanism
for examining the crystal growth and evolution process in the natural
atmosphere; the observation of halos through polarizing filters will also allow
an examination of the atmospheric ice crystal orientation, shape, and size. It
will advance our understanding of the reasons for the growth of well-formed ice
crystals, which is a characteristic of the antarctic atmosphere, but is not
generally observed elsewhere. ***
