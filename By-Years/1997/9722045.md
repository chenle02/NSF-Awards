The purpose of the project is to construct and study mathematically precise
quantum field theory models. The broader goal is sharpen our understanding of
quantum field theory and increase its predictive power, thereby deepening our
understanding of elementary particle physics and critical phenomena in
statistical mechanics. The project particularly emphasizes the renormalization
group. This is a widely applicable method for analyzing asymptotic behavior in
space or time, and another broad goal is to make renormalization group
techniques more precise, systematic, and easy to use. Specific project goals
are: (1.) the construction of non-Gaussian fixed points for the renormalization
group, and a study of the associated anomalous critical exponents, (2.) the
construction of quantum electrodynamics and/or non-Abelian gauge theories in
three space-time dimensions, and (3.) the study of mass generation in a scalar
model simulating non-Abelian gauge theories.
