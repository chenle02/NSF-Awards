9309449 Yin This research project is directed towards the development of a
method to simultaneously isolate and characterize virus clones from a
heterogeneous population. The principle of the method stems from recent
theoretical results suggesting virus strains can be "fingerprinted" in a petri
dish by measuring the dependence of their propagation rates on the density of
their host. Embedded in the shape and amplitude of a fingerprint are a wealth of
detailed information reflecting a particular strain's interaction with its host,
i.e., its adsorption rate, replication rate and yield per infected host. An
image acquisition and analysis system is to be designed and built to measure
fingerprints. ***
