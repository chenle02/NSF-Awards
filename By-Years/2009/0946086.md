This SBIR Phase I project will develop a nanogel stabilized biocatalyst for the
measurement of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). If successful, this test would
take less than 10 minutes, be automated, and would result in a substantial
decrease in cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of the
project will be that BOD tests are performed by many municipal and industrial
wastewater treatment plants and therefore this project, focusing on the
development of a rapid BOD test, could have a large impact.&lt;br/&gt;
