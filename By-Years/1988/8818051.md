Mosses form a conspicuous element in many tropical ecosystems, yet they remain
little known to those residing in tropical countries and little known even to
those conducting research on mosses. Dr. Steven Churchill of the New York
Botanical Garden has embarked on the first complete moss inventory of a South
American country, Colombia, to produce an illustrated and descriptive account of
the estimated 900 species of mosses of this rich, mountainous country. The
project involves cooperative activities with Colombian institutions; Dr.
Churchill will lecture on his moss researches, will help build reference
collections for museums, and will work with staff and students to promote better
understanding and research possbilities for this group of plants. The first
phase will include intensive field collecting in half of the 32 departments of
Colombia, to augment existing herbarium collections in the U.S., Colombia, and
elsewhere. The area for collection will inlude the western half of Colombia from
the coastal Pacific and Atlantic departments which contain both wet and dry
tropical vegetation, and extending to central montane regions. Concurrent with
this phase will be the preparation of descriptions and illustrations for half of
the expected species. Also to be accomplished are preparation of a checklist of
scientific names of Colombian mosses and a catalogue of herbarium specimens of
Colombian taxa, compiled in a computer database at the New York Botanical
Garden.
