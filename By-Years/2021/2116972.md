Language reflects and supports the ability to reason about the likelihood or
goodness of unrealized possibilities--a critical capacity underlying practical
decisions, scientific explanations, moral judgments, legal agreements, and
attitudes like regret and relief. Conditional and modal expressions are ways to
talk about what is, will be or would have been likely or preferable, and to flag
contingencies and degrees of confidence. In English, such expressions (examples
are 'if-then' sentences and auxiliaries like 'must' and 'might') have been
extensively studied. However, languages other than English employ radically
different ways to express similar notions, and much remains unknown about the
cross-linguistic picture with regard to both the variety of expressive means and
the uniformity of the underlying concepts. This project works towards filling
that gap. Its linguistic goal is to elucidate how general concepts and cognitive
abilities interact with the grammatical idiosyncrasies of different languages.
Its wider applications include language teaching and artificial intelligence,
where the ability to use and understand modals and conditionals correctly helps
improve the quality of machine translation systems and human-computer
interfaces. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is a detailed
comparative study of the meaning and use of conditional and modal expressions in
typologically unrelated languages. As a starting point, this work relies on the
existing descriptive literature for important observations and data points.
However, such descriptions are not typically geared towards a detailed cross-
linguistic comparative study using the theoretical and methodological tools of
contemporary formal semantics and pragmatics. One crucial part of this project,
therefore, consists of a comprehensive survey and systematization of the results
of prior research. The project builds on the survey results to develop
theoretical analyses and cross-linguistic comparisons. The empirical base
underlying the project's theoretical work includes data reported in the
literature, supplemented with introspective judgments by native
speakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
