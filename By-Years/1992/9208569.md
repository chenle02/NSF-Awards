This proposal applies the multi-dimensional reinforcement and near-net-shape
manufacturing offered by 3-D fabric composites to the textile processing of
ceramic matrix composites (CMC). The processing methodology has been successful
in the field of polymer matrix composites. Sol-Gel process will be used to
produce ceramic materials and CMC. This methodology, if proved to be successful
in the field of CMC, can help to make CMC less limited by damage tolerance and
composite machining and joining problems. %%%% This program applies the
methodology which has been successful in the textile processing of polymer
matrix composites to the textile processing of ceramic matrix composites (CMC).
Sol-Gel process will be used to produce the ceramic materials. This type of
textile processing open up new opportunities in manufacture and tailoring of CMC
according to microstructures and properties.
