This doctoral dissertation improvement project will study the movement and
transformation of carbon in streams. Streams and rivers are not passive pipes
that merely transport carbon. Active uptake of carbon through photosynthesis and
subsequent release of carbon through respiration takes place in streams and can
lead to complex patterns of carbon exchange with the atmosphere as water moves
from land to the oceans. This study will measure the amount of carbon in
mountain streams that is respired, stored in living organisms, and transported
downstream.

Current freshwater carbon budgets include the role of terrestrial carbon
processing, but have not addressed the role of in-stream carbon fixation and
processing and, consequently, may underestimate rates of carbon dioxide transfer
from streams to the atmosphere, carbon burial, and carbon export downstream.
This study will help complete our understanding of the role streams and rivers
play in carbon movement in the landscape.
