AST-0205130&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Jayawardhana&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The past
five years have seen the identification of a large number of sub-stellar objects
in the solar neighborhood and in star-forming regions. Indeed, it appears that
brown dwarfs may&lt;br/&gt;be as common as stars. However, there are few
observational constraints on their origin and early evolution. Studies of young
brown dwarfs provide valuable clues to their formation&lt;br/&gt;mechanism(s).
This program explores the physical properties of brown dwarfs in star-forming
regions and compare them to the much better studied pre-main sequence stars, in
order to shed light on their origin. The program employs many of the methods
developed in the study of T Tauri stars, and includes (1) a search for thermal
infrared emission from disks around young sub-stellar objects, (2) optical
spectroscopy to derive their accretion luminosities and mass accretion rates,
(3) modeling of scattered light and thermal emission of disks, (4) observations
of X-ray emission, as an indicator of activity, and (5) measurements of rotation
periods based on photometric variability in the optical. The results of this
program will help distinguish among different formation scenarios for brown
dwarfs, such as cloud fragmentation, protostellar disk instability, and ejection
from newborn multiple systems, whether young sub-stellar objects undergo a T
Tauri-like phase.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
