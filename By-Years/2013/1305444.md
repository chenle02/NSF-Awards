Feng Wang of Boston University is supported by a CAREER award from the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry for research that seeks to employ
computational methodologies to gain an atomistic scale understanding of the
growth and dissolution processes of methane hydrates. The PI is developing an
iterative adaptive force-matching method to enable the parameterization of force
fields for these systems. He is also using a classical nucleation theory
approach for carrying out atomistic simulations and will devise a new basin-
hopping kinetic Monte Carlo scheme.

Methane clathrates play an important role in the global carbon cycle. Since they
are greenhouse gases, environmental implications are key and are being taken
into account in this research, which focuses on developing new ways to do
computer simulations of these important molecules. The PI is also devising an
education plan which involves the development of Gaussian modules for use by
undergraduates at his insitution.
