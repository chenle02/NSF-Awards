Significant seedling loss in forest nurseries can occur due to fungal
pathogens. Fungicides help but don`t eliminate the problem. The U.S. Forest
Service has stated a preference for biological disease control systems if they
are effective. Biocontrol technology is available for fungal root pathogens but
has not been applied to forest nurseries. This project will evaluate combining
new technologies of fungal protoplast fusion and seed coating systems with
established mycorrhizal fungus inoculation techniques for an effective
biocontrol system. Research will test three biocontrol fungi and two mycorrhizae
on five tree species for disease control relative to fungicide application.
Significant disease reductions with biological vs. chemical systems is
anticipated. This will stimulate private investment for product development.
Domestic as well as foreign markets could open for forest, horticultural and
food crop systems using biological disease control technology.
