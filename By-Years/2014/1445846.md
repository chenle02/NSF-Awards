Safety hazards resulting from distributed energy storage devices (e.g., lithium
ion battery) failures range from reduced performance to operational impairment.
Therefore, fault diagnostics is a very important function of distributed energy
storage management systems such as battery management systems. Real time
diagnostics of the failure and early warning of these faults can mitigate
potential catastrophic events in electric vehicles, community energy storage
devices as well as grid-scale energy storage systems. This team has developed a
technology for the differentiated diagnosis and early detection of battery
faults, including internal and external short circuit faults, over charge, over
discharge, and over temperature. The differentiated diagnostic algorithms can be
further implemented in the future generation of distributed energy management
systems for real time fault diagnosis and prevention. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With
rapidly evolving technologies of electric vehicles, consumer electronics (e.g.,
cell phones, computers), aircraft and aviation, the battery has emerged as the
most prominent energy storage device. It is important to improve the performance
of the battery management system to make the battery a safe, reliable, and cost
efficient solution. The developed technology, when successfully commercialized,
will provide intelligent, fast monitoring, estimation, and management for
distributed energy storage devices at a cost acceptable to the market place;
help prevent catastrophic events; and translate the legacy Centralized
management for a cluster of distributed energy storage devices to a completely
distributed architecture by only exchanging local information with neighbors.
