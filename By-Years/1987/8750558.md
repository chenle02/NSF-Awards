Use of the new computer-interfaced spectrographic equipment provided through
this project is improving laboratory instruction in Developmental and Cellular
Biology courses. The students in this historically Black institution are being
exposed to current state-of- the-art equipment in laboratory studies of
functional aspects of living systems. Although the primary emphasis is on
Cellular and Developmental Biology, instruction in Biochemistry, Human
Physiology, Human Anatomy, and special projects also benefit greatly from the
project. One of the most important elements of the project is its introduction
of modern data collection and analysis techniques to the Department's
curriculum.
