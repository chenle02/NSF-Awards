A new undergraduate sequence in Dynamical Systems is being developed and
selected topics from dynamics are being introduced into existing courses in
Differential Equations, Geometry, and Analysis. The new course and affected
courses make extensive use of a new dedicated computer graphics laboratory. This
laboratory enables students to experiment with dynamics and in particular
explore boundaries and domains of attraction, and Mandelbrot and Julia sets. The
laboratory includes 6 80386-based PC's, one 80386-SX PC laptop for classroom and
outside presentations, and a laser printer.
