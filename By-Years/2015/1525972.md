Spinal cord injuries can lead to complete leg paralysis, drastically limiting
mobility and reducing quality of life. Significant progress has been made
towards wearable exoskeletons that provide some ability to walk, but these
require the use of crutches, which create unnatural loads on the wearer, as well
as restricting use of the hands and arms. The objective of this research is to
develop a lower body exoskeleton able to balance and walk without the use of
crutches, thus allowing the wearers to interact with their environment and
maintain proper posture. The resulting platform will improve the overall quality
of life for those with spinal cord injury by granting them a level of mobility
that is currently unachievable. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will apply
methods advanced in the field of humanoid robots to the design of exoskeletons
for functionally impaired persons. Specifically, the project will apply a method
called whole-body control, which finds motions that resolve multiple motion
objectives at once, to a lower body exoskeleton with 12 degrees of freedom,
providing a range of movement similar to natural human locomotion, with the
exception of ankle yaw. High fidelity torque control will be achieved using
series elastic actuators to enable compliant locomotion of the wearer.
