ABSTRACT PI: Borgia PROPOSAL NUMBER: 9601560 Nonresoruce-based (NRB) mating
systems are often associated with exaggerated male display traits. Studies of
the evolution of these traits have taken a prominent place in behavioral and
evolutionary biology. Little is known, however, about the genetics, dispersal
and female searching behavior in NRB mating systems. Here we propose an
integrated study of the genetics and behavior of the NRB mating system of the
satin bowerbird (Ptilonorhychus violaceus). We will identify patterns of
dispersal and factors affecting patterns of female visitation at bowers, test
sexual selection models, measure heritability of male display traits and
repeatabilities of female preferences for males, and evaluate the role of
genetic relatedness in female choice, male learning of display elements and male
interactions. We will use newly developed microsatellite genetic markers to
score relatedness and will determine patterns of dispersal using blood samples
from past and present members of a natural population of resolution satin
bowerbirds one generation apart. New camcorders will allow high resolution
monitoring of 40 bowers for accurate identification of banded females as they
visit display courts and mate. By radio-tracking females and monitoring a
primary food source, we will be able to determine if there is an effect of
resources on female choice of nest sites and bowers that they visit. This study
will provide the most comprehensive view of the process of mate selection in any
avian species with an NRB mating system. We will test current models of mate
selection and our findings will aid in the development of realistic new models
for the evolution of exaggerated male display. This work should improve our
general understanding of the genetics of mate choice
