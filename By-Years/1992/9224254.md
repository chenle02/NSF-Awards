9224254 Andrews This award supports a program to study sediment cores from the
inner continental shelf and fjords of East Greenland. The goals are to determine
paleoclimatic conditions and to understand ice- sheet ocean interactions during
the late Quaternary. The project will use oxygen isotopes, carbon-14 ages,
benthic foraminifera, and sediment provenance studies to develop a high
resolution history of the paleoenvironmental conditions in the region. This
project will develop information about the extent and duration of sea ice cover
on the inner continental shelf of East Greenland during the late Quaternary and
about discharge of freshwater from melting of land based ice in the Arctic
Basin. The results of this work should be useful to help constrain models of
climate change that are being developed from the Greenland Ice Sheet Project
(GISP) ice core. ***
