This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "Summer
Symposium in Real Analysis" that will be held June 24-29, 2019 at Trinity
University. The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis,
especially in the fields of harmonic analysis, differential equations,
mathematical biology, geometric measure theory, fractal geometry, dynamics and
probability, nonlinear operator theory, and regularity theory for elliptic
equations under minimal smoothness assumptions. A number of distinguished
mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference. This award
gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers
not funded by NSF an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference.
The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to
target groups through a number of different activities. More information will be
made available at: https://sites.trinity.edu/alamo-symposium.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
