Many benthic marine invertebrates, including polar species, produce larvae that
must survive a period in the plankton before setting into benthic adult
populations. Understanding the factors that influence larval survival therefore
is crucial for understanding recruitment and the maintenance of adult
populations. This study will clarify one of the most important of these factors:
nutrition. Larvae may be nourish by particulate food, dissolved organic
material, and/or yolk provided by the parent. The relative role of these sources
for different types of larvae is poorly understood. This project will examine
comparable larvae (asteroid and echinoid; feeding and nonfeeding) in two
contrasting environments; Monterey Bay, California, where primary production and
phytoplankton production are high during most of the year; and McMurdo Sound,
antarctica, where phytoplankton production and biomass are markedly seasonal and
extremely low during most of the year. The study will have important bearing on
the understanding of how different nutritional environments affect larval
growth, survival and subsequent availability of recruitment into adult
populations and influence the evolution of larval nutritional modes.
