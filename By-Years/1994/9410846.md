9410846 Sandorfi A Gordon conference will be held in the series on Photonuclear
Reactions at Tilton School, Tilton, NH July 31- August 5, 1994. This meeting
will focus on topical questions in nuclear physics, including the structure of
baryons, quark sub- structure in nuclei, the charge structure of the neutron,
the response of nuclear systems to different probes, multi-nucleon correlation
studies, meson exchange currents and relativistic effects, and finally
fundamental symmetries. Many young people and many leaders in the field will
attend, both from the US and abroad. ***
