Systems of strongly interacting quantum particles are capable of realizing novel
phases of quantum matter, which can exhibit astonishing emergent macroscopic
properties like superfluidity, superconductivity, and long-termstorage of
quantum information. Despite significant effort in simulating these systems
using conventional supercomputers, progress has been limited by a fundamental
barrier of computational complexity which veils an unexplored frontier of
physics called the entanglement frontier. Quantum computers are naturally able
to probe this frontier because they harness entanglement in their elementary
operations, and so the eventual development of mature quantum computing
technology will greatly advance our understanding of quantum phase transitions
and enable the discovery of new phases of quantum matter with potentially
transformative properties for technology and society. All of this depends on the
development of efficient quantum algorithms for simulating the thermodynamic
properties of quantum systems. This project investigates the quantum Metropolis
algorithm, which is a quantum algorithm that directly generalizes one of the
most successful 20th century paradigms for simulating classical statistical
physics. By paralleling developments that occurred in the corresponding
classical algorithm, this project seeks to determine general conditions which
imply that a quantum computer can efficiently simulate quantum thermal
properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main new perspective used in this project
is based on a connection between physical thermalization - the process by which
a physical quantum system comes into thermal equilibrium with its environment -
and the behavior and convergence of the quantum Metropolis algorithm. The
eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) is a prominent explanation for how
physical quantum systems approach thermal equilibrium, despite their dynamical
behavior being time-reversible in principle. This project connects mathematical
inequalities developed in the context of the ETH directly to the transition
probabilities that govern the behavior of the quantum Metropolis algorithm. This
quantitative characterization of transition probabilities opens the door to
establishing the first non-trivial cases of rigorously efficient (polynomial-
time) quantum algorithms for simulating thermal states of some class of quantum
systems that is strongly suspected to be beyond the range of efficient classical
simulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
