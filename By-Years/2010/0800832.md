Shepler and Witherspoon will develop a theory of deformations expanding that for
graded Hecke algebras. They will study deformations of skew group algebras that
combine groups of symmetries with algebras of functions. Particular deformations
of these algebras arose independently in work by many prominent mathematicians
in representation theory and noncommutative geometry, but many open questions
remain. Shepler and Witherspoon will answer some of these questions using new
tools created by blending methods from invariant theory, combinatorics,
homological algebra, and representation theory. They also will solve some basic
open problems about the structure and cohomology of Hopf algebras and prove
several conjectures on modular reflection groups, invariant theory, and
arrangements of hyperplanes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objects throughout the natural
world reveal themselves through their symmetries, for example, crystals,
molecules, DNA, and quantum systems. When we deform an object, we alter or even
break the symmetry. Remarkably often, we discover new attributes of the object
after studying its deformations. Shepler and Witherspoon's research program on
graded Hecke algebras and related deformations addresses a variety of
mathematical fields and grows from the exploding interest the mathematical
community shows in graded Hecke algebras. Hecke algebras are pervasive
throughout mathematics, appearing in algebra, geometry, number theory,
combinatorics, topology, statistics, harmonic analysis, mathematical physics,
special functions, quantum groups, knot theory, and conformal field theory.
Shepler and Witherspoon are active in the mathematical community, mentoring
students and postdocs, collaborating with international experts, and organizing
conferences and workshops. Their research program supports these broader
activities.
