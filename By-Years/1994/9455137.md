The Computer Science Department at SUNY Geneseo has developed a "three-fold"
introduction to computer science, whose central mission is to give students
rudimentary but real ability in all three methods of inquiry. The Department is
offering a faculty enhancement workshop for instructors interested in adopting
this curriculum. The curriculum contains relatively abstract material, material
that is often not what students expect. A number of active learning techniques
are essential if students are to master this material. The workshop presents the
rationale behind the new curriculum, and provides intensive introductions to
using and developing the kinds of active learning materials that have succeeded
at Geneseo. The workshop consists of a primary meeting in June of 1995, and a
follow-up meeting in June of 1996. Between these meetings, participants will
integrate elements of the three-fold introduction into their own curricula. This
workshop improves participants' undergraduate computer science programs through
direct training, evaluation of each other's strategies for adopting the three-
fold introduction, and ongoing dissemination of materials (both at the meetings
and via Internet).
