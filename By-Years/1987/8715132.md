The work described in the proposal seeks to reformulate the conceptual
foundation of power systems theory in light of newly emerging communication,
computing and control (3C) technologies. This reformulation involves proposing
an architecture that might supervise the power system function (generation,
transmission, distribution and user subsystems.) The system, if properly
integrated would increase efficiency and safely reduce current level of
redundancy.
