9414976 Fischer The tribochemistry of silicon-based ceramics sliding in aqueous
solutions will be studied. The results will be used to improve tribochemical
polishing of these materials. The composition of the chemical reaction products
and their formation rates will be determined and the synergy between friction
processes and chemical surface reactions will be estimated by conducting the
tests under a variety of conditions. ***
