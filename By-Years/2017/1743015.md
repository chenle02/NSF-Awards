Moons have been found orbiting some of the largest asteroids in the main
asteroid belt, located between the orbits of the planets Jupiter and Mars. These
investigators have obtained telescope time to observe thirty-six large asteroids
in the main asteroid belt with an instrument that will provide very high
resolution observations of these asteroids. Their shapes, sizes, any moons that
are present, and information about the asteroids' compositions will be
uncovered. All of this information will give the investigators clues about how
these multiple-asteroid systems formed and, further, how the major planets in
our Solar System formed. This project serves the national interest by advancing
our scientific understanding of how our Solar System formed and changed within
its lifetime. The investigators will tell the story of their research to both
students and the general public through undergraduate student research programs,
press releases, and social media outlets. The PI will also develop movies for
planetariums through the California Academy of
Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This systematic study will use adaptive optics
instrumentation to refine the multiplicity rate of larger main-belt asteroids
and will search for a relationship between an asteroid's multiplicity and its
composition. High angular resolution allows the shape models of these asteroids
to be measured to unprecedented accuracy. A study of the orbits of these moons
(satellites) will constrain the bulk density of the primary asteroid and provide
clues about the composition and distribution of its material, supporting studies
addressing the formation of these multiple-asteroid systems in the Solar System.
