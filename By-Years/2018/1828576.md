This project, developing a Reconfigurable Environmental Intelligence Platform
(REIP) aims to alleviate many complex aspects of remote sensing, including
sensor node design, software stack implementation, privacy issues, bandwidth,
and centralized compute limitations, bringing down start up times from years to
weeks. REIP will be a plug-and-play remote sensing infrastructure with advanced
edge processing capabilities for in situ- insight generation. Sensor networks
have dynamically expanded our ability to monitor and study our world Sensor
networks have already deployed specialized sensor networks for many
applications, including monitoring pedestrian traffic and outdoor noise
monitoring and the need for sensing networks keeps increasing as the use cases
for sensor networks expands and becomes more complex. Sensors no longer simply
record data, they process and transforms it into something useful before sending
it to central servers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the core of REIP is a set of
hardware modules that connect together to form a sensing solution. Each sensing
module will come in a number of variants allowing the user to find the proper
tradeoff between complexity/ ost and power/features. The REIP infrastructure
will expand the use of audio-visual sensing architectures beyond the highly
specialized research groups that are able to design, build, and purchase all the
necessary components and make it available to a wider community as a research
infrastructure. REIP will be tested on real-world applications, including
observation, integrated sensing transportation networks, and indoor sensing for
reducing waste in HVAC (Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning) systems.
Experts will be able to customize each application domain.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Led by a team of researchers with expertise in sensor networks,
machine learning, deep learning, visualization, data analysis, human computing
interface, engineering, and occupational therapy, this work will contribute to a
variety of projects and is bound to have significant broader impacts. REIP and
this research will directly impact a diverse population of students and foster
education in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Mentoring
opportunities will be provided for all the involved graduate and undergraduate
students&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
