One of the basic aims of the CEDAR program is to study the temperature and
dynamics of the mesopause and lower thermosphere (MALT) region of the upper
atmosphere (80-110km.). One of the primary instruments used in this effort is
the Fabry Perot interferometer. With this instrument one can deduce both the
temperature of the region and the direction and magnitude of the wind. The main
purpose under this award is to assemble a new state-of-the-art system using a
solid state imaging detector system. Successful completion of this will allow a
substantial enhancement in both the sensitivity and time resolution of the
observations. Application of this system will be directed towards the long term
acquisition of mid-latitude MALT observations in order to support the
development and testing of global circulation models. 3/3/89
