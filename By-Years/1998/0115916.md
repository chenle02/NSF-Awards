ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;SGER&lt;br/&gt;Bradshaw, An Archive of Viki, A Home Reared
Chimpanzee&lt;br/&gt;SES 01-15916&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beginning in 1947,
Catherine and Keith Hayes raised Viki, a common chimpanzee, as if she were a
human infant. The experiment continued until Viki's untimely death in 1954 of
viral encephalitis. During that time, Catherine Hayes kept a detailed daily
diary of Viki's behavior, collected numerous photographs of the project, along
with unpublished book chapters and manuscript materials. This is the most
important cross-rearing project of its kind, given the length of the effort, the
quality of the investigators, and the thorough documentation of the
project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Catherine Hayes (now Catherine Nissen), preserved
these extensive records of the project. She is now suffering from Alzheimer's
disease, and is reluctant to make any permanent arrangements for the disposition
of these invaluable scientific records. Her daughter, Diana Hovey, believes it
is possible to negotiate such an arrangement. This project supports a visit by
the PI to meet with Catherine Nissen in Middleton, WI, in the near future. The
goal is to arrange for a donation of these invaluable scientific records.
Photocopies of all material are to be made, along with copy photographs of
images. The project supports an undergraduate student to conduct the preliminary
sorting of the copied materials. The PI also intends to negotiate with an
institution, according to Ms. Nissen's wishes, for a permanent home for the
extensive records of this singularly important research project.&lt;br/&gt;
