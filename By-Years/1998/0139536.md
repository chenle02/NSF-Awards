Abbott&lt;br/&gt;0139490&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
Americas Program proposal requests support for Dr. Richard N. Abbott,
Appalachian State University to conduct research of an unusual metamorphic rock
called Alpine-type spinel-garnet peridotite, recently discovered in the
Caribbean nation of the Dominican Republic. Dr. Abbott will be collaborating
with Dr. Draper Greenville of Florida International University, Miami, Florida,
Engineers P.V. Chavez, and V. Silva, Direccion de Mineria (bureau of
mines/geological survey),Santo Domingo, and Dr. Ivan Tavares, Universidad
Autonoma de Santo Domingo. The principal objectives of the research are to
determine and map the relationship between these rocks and others in the same
unit, find their source, and analyze samples in the
laboratory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding these unusual rocks will help to
refine the current model of the origin of the islands of the Greater Antilles in
the broader context of the origin of the Caribbean basin. Identifying the
geological sources of these peridotite boulders will provide fundamental
knowledge on the tectonic processes that have occurred in this part of the
Caribbean. The resulting geologic maps from this research will be useful for the
development and management of natural
resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
