Schelp This award funds the work of Prof. Richard Schelp in graph theory. Prof.
Schelp will study special edge colorings of graphs and their connections to
Ramsey numbers or special edge labelings. In particular there are three
conjectures, two due to Schelp and one to Burr and Erdos about edge colorings
that Prof. Schelp will study in this project. The research is in the general
area of combinatorics, in particular graph theory. Combinatorics attempts to
find efficient methods to study how discrete collections can be organized.
Graphs are arrangements of points connected by lines. The behavior of discrete
collections like graphs is extremely important in modeling systems and plays a
role in modern computing, communications and operations. For example, the design
of large networks, as in telephone systems, and the design of algorithms in
computer science all use graphs in their development, and make use of
combinatorial research. ***
