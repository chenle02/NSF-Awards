*** 9760627 Samman This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
conduct research on a novel laser-based device that will accurately measure
surface roughness of drilled shaft boreholes. Drilled shafts are foundation
elements whose capacity is derived predominantly from the shear resistance
developed at the rough interface between the shaft and the surrounding
geomaterial. Current design methods ignore roughness and instead are generally
based on past experience and rules of thumb. This ultimately leads to shaft
designs that are perhaps overly conservative and expensive. Over the last ten
years, theoretical models have been developed to include roughness in all stages
of the design process. However, until shaft roughness can be measured accurately
in situ, it is unlikely that these models will reach their potential, nor will
the potential cost savings to society be realized. In Phase I, the feasibility
of the proposed device will be established by: (1) measuring the accuracy and
establishing the limitations of laser range sensors, and (2) assessing the cost
and challenges associated with developing a prototype device that ensures
satisfactory field performance. The annual US market for drilled shafts is
estimated at $1 billion per year. This research will ultimately lead to shaft
designs that are conservative yet economical. A moderate 20% reduction in shaft
lengths would translate to a saving of some $150 million annually in the US
alone. Because of its strong potential, the Federal Highway Administration has
expressed interest in providing supplementary funding and the International
Association of Foundation Drilling has also indicated a willingness to support
the research project. ***
