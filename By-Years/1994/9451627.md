9451627 Calle This project will acquire an Instructional Scanning Tunneling
Microscope, which will be used to strengthen and modernize the advanced physics
laboratory. The extreme magnification and measurement resolution capability of
the STM will permit the students to visualize surface atoms, perform experiments
in atomic structure, measure atomic dimensions, and study the surfaces and
defects of semiconductors. The STM will also be used in the second semester of
the traditional calculus-based physics course in class demonstrations to allow
the students to observe atomic surfaces and perform a simple measurement
experiment. We also plan to introduce the instrument in our course for
nonmajors, allowing the students to observe atomic surfaces. Finally, our
seniors will be able to undertake research projects with the STM. The equipment
will strengthen and modernize our laboratory offerings at all levels and will
provide our students with exciting state-of-the-art experiences.
