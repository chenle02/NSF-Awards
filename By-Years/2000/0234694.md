Multiple parties are increasingly using distributed information systems,
especially the Internet, for automated negotiations. Game theory provides a
basis for engineering incentives into the interaction mechanisms of these
systems so that desirable social outcomes follow -- even though every party acts
based on self-interest. However, there is a hazardous gap in game theory when it
comes to incentives and computation, leaving such systems open to manipulation.
Extensions to game theory that address computation are required for settings
where the participants are self-interested, and there is an underlying
intractable problem that limits the agents' rationality. In this project, a
theory of interaction is being developed where computational actions are treated
as part of each agent's strategy. The work involves model development, game-
theoretic analysis, mechanism and algorithm design, and computational
experiments. This research paves the way to building secure systems that are
robust against manipulation, yet computationally feasible. The theories being
developed allow the construction of optimal negotiating agents in settings where
computation is an issue. This enables wider and fairer access to Internet
commerce by putting novices, assisted by these software agents, on an equal
playing field with expert market participants. The methodology being developed
also enables the design of economically and computationally more efficient
interaction mechanisms.
