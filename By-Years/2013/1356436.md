As a means to increase the number of students who complete associate's degrees
in STEM disciplines and either transfer into baccalaureate programs or go
directly into the STEM workforce, the Community College of Baltimore County
(CCBC) will provide student support through the Community of Math and Computer
Inspired Scholars (MCIS) program. Leveraging existing partnerships with
employers of STEM graduates, the Baltimore County Public Schools and four-year
institutions, the MCIS program will create effective pathways from high school
through employment, upon successful completion of a degree in a STEM field. As
individuals from underrepresented minority groups comprise nearly half of the
student population at CCBC, the MCIS program will contribute to enhancing
diversity in the STEM professional workforce.

From a technical standpoint, the MCIS program will provide 25 scholarships each
semester to students who demonstrate financial need, possess high academic
potential and are enrolled full-time in the STEM disciplines of Engineering,
Engineering Technology, Mathematics, Physics, Computer Science, Information
Technology and Network Technology. In addition to the financial support through
the S-STEM scholarships, students in the MCIS program will receive a personal
faculty mentor to provide academic and professional advising, opportunities to
network with STEM professionals, supplemental instruction, and special courses
in spatial skills development. Through the use of institutional research data
and student surveys, outcomes to be measured include the impact of the project
on the enrollment, academic performance, retention and graduation of students
from the MCIS program, student perceptions of STEM, employment secured by
program graduates and successful transfers to four-year institutions.
