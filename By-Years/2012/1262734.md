This award from the Division of Chemistry at the National Science Foundation
supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site led by Professors
Carla Mattos and Patricia A Mabrouk, both at Northeastern University. The REU
site in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology (CCB) at Northeastern
University will be centered on the theme of catalysis and will include
perspectives from both chemical and biological systems. Nine undergraduate
students will participate in the program each year, with priority given to those
from institutions that do not have graduate programs and that graduate large
numbers of students from underrepresented groups in the sciences. Each student
will join a research group in CCB and will be paired with a Northeastern
undergraduate and a graduate student in the group, where he/she will perform
experiments that will involve some aspect of catalysis in research. The theme on
catalysis will be introduced at the opening day and reinforced through weekly
faculty seminars and a final presentation by the students. During the summer
each student will write a statement of mutual expectation with the mentor, put
together an electronic portfolio and prepare a poster to be presented at a
national conference during the following year. Over the three years of the
project, a total of 27 students will have the opportunity to do summer research
full time at Northeastern with a diverse group of research-active faculty highly
experienced in mentoring undergraduates. The mentoring relationships will be
maintained with each student throughout the remainder of their undergraduate
years.
