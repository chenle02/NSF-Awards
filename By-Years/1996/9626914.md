Rosen 9626914 Professors Rosen and J. Hoffstein developed, some years ago,
average value theorems for Dirichlet L-series formed with quadratic characters
over rational function fields. Taking the special value at s=1 allows one to
derive average value theorems for class numbers of hyperelliptic curves. If the
constant field is a finite field with q elements, the (q-1)'st roots of unity
are in the base field. If l is a prime dividing q-1, then every cyclic extension
of the base field of degree l is a Kummer extension. Therefore, it seems likely
that one can average Dirichlet L-series (and certain products of such series)
formed with characters of order l. Also, by taking the special values at s=1,
one can hope to derive class number averages as done in the quadratic case.
Professor Rosen has begun work on this project and published some promising
results. He will work on a number of specific problems raised by these general
considerations. This research falls into the general mathematical field of
Number Theory. Number theory has its historical roots in the study of the whole
numbers, addressing such problems as identifying prime numbers and decomposing
whole numbers as products of primes. It is among the oldest branches of
mathematics and was pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons.
However, within the last half century it has become an indispensable tool in
diverse applications in areas such as data transmission and processing, and
communication systems.
