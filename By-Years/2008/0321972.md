0321972&lt;br/&gt;Stojanovic&lt;br/&gt;A suspension array of cross-reacting
hydrophobic sensors on encoded beads is being constructed to model the olfactory
system. The cross-reactive suspension array will provide in flow cytometry an
instantaneous fingerprint of all hydrophobic molecules present in urine. A
typical array at the end of funding period will consist of six to 64 selected
molecular sensors with up to 5000 readings (beads) per sensor. The arrays will
be validated on urine specimens collected for metabolite screening. The
hydrophobic fingerprints will be correlated with disease states. This approach
will be initially demonstrated on Cushing's disease, adrenal adenoma, adrenal
carcinoma, hirsutism and congenital adrenal hyperplasia. This approach will be
expanded to other analytes and other samples.
