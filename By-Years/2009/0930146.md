This award supports planning of a collaborative research project on modeling and
analysis of designs for rechargeable batteries. The research project under
development will address dynamical processes occurring in novel battery
materials. The research aims to (i) extend battery models to include elastic
stress, interfacial tension and diffusion, and slow electron transport; (ii)
perform asymptotic and stability analyses and numerical simulations of the
nonlinear waves; (iii) study wave-defect interactions, as a new mechanism for
power loss; and (iv) simulate, analyze, and optimize transport in realistic
cathode microstructures.

While significant effort has been invested in applied research over the past few
decades, the performance of rechargeable batteries has improved only
incrementally. Atomistic simulations have predicted new materials with higher
energy density, but the physical limit has nearly been reached. However, power
density (charge/discharge rate per unit mass) and cycle life must improve
drastically for new applications such as electric vehicles. These properties are
governed by dynamical processes occurring on larger length and time scales,
better suited for continuum or statistical models, which have not been
developed. Breakthrough advances towards the next generation of rechargeable
batteries will require new fundamental understanding of such processes, and the
field is ripe for contributions from applied mathematics. To meet this need, we
plan a collaboration consisting of experts on atomistic simulations of batteries
(Ceder), microstructural simulations (Thornton), and mathematical modeling of
electrochemical systems (Golovin and Bazant). The team will build on a recently-
formulated general continuum model for phase-transformation dynamics in battery
materials and a new mode of intercalation by nonlinear waves.
