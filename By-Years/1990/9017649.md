Professor Jiri Jonas is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to study the dynamic structure of liquids using
NMR spectroscopy and Rayleigh and Raman scattering. The primary importance of
this research is in furthering our understanding of the effects which pressure,
temperature and nature of the solvent have on chemical structure and reactivity.
Jonas plans to use NMR spectroscopy and laser Rayleigh and Raman scattering
techniques to study molecular motions, intermolecular interactions and reaction
rates in various liquid systems. Properties such as self-diffusion coefficients,
shear viscosities and densities will also be measured. The use of pressure as an
experimental variable represents the important feature of the experiments to be
conducted because this approach enables Jonas to separate the effects of density
and temperature on dynamic processes in liquids. The main emphasis will be on
the use of high resolution multinuclear FT NMR techniques at high pressures to
study: 1) dynamical solvent effects on reaction rates; 2) dynamics of complex
liquids; 3) applicability of hydrodynamic equations at the molecular level; and
4) chemical shift studies of hydrogen bonded liquids. Laser Raman scattering
studies will concentrate on: 1) collision induced scattering in binary liquid
mixtures; and 2) frequency non-coincidence effects in polar liquids.
