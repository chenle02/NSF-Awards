****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;Transition-metal dichalcogenides such as
titanium disulfide possess a layered crystal structure consisting of atomic
trilayers stacked along the c axis. The trilayers are weakly bound by van der
Waals forces. Pure dichalcogenides exhibit interesting properties such as charge
density waves and superconductivity. Foreign atoms can be introduced into the
interlayer gaps; this is called intercalation. In this project, the effects of
intercalating magnetic ions on the properties of dichalcogenide materials will
be experimentally investigated. By varying the type and content of the
intercalant and the nature of the host, competition between magnetic phases will
be controlled and transitions between phases studied. Quasi-one-dimensional
nanostructures will also be fabricated and studied. The outcome of the project
is a better understanding of how structure and interactions determine magnetic
ground states in the dichalcogenides and other materials such as manganites.
Undergraduates will be deeply involved in sample fabrication, measurements and
data analysis. The efficacy of undergraduate research for training students in
scientific reasoning and writing will be assessed using nationally recognized
instruments. High-school students from underrepresented groups will also be
immersed and mentored in the research environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Non-
Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;Transition-metal dichalcogenides (for example,
titanium disulfide) have a crystal structure consisting of layers of atoms
(three atoms thick) stacked along a direction perpendicular to the layers. The
layers are weakly bonded, which permits the introduction of new atoms between
the layers in a process called intercalation. The intercalated material has
properties that reflect both those of the host and the inserted atoms. Thus, one
can control the overall properties of the material by controlling the type and
number of intercalant atoms. Such tunable materials could be very useful in new
magnetic and electronic devices in which specific characteristics could be
engineered by controlling the properties of the intercalant. This project will
investigate a variety of intercalated dichalcogenides, including newly
fabricated nanotubes. Magnetic and electronic properties will be carefully
measured to obtain a thorough understanding of the behavior of these materials.
Their potential for applications will then be evaluated. Undergraduate students
will play an integral part in every aspect of the research. The efficacy of
undergraduate research for training students in scientific reasoning and writing
will be assessed. High-school students from underrepresented groups will also be
immersed and mentored in the research environment.
