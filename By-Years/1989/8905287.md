This research is in the area of operator algebras and consists of three
projects. First, is a study of the problem of uniqueness of extension of complex
homomorphisms on maximal abelian diagonal subalgebras to pure states of the
algebra. Second, the research will involve work on the Index theory of
inclusions of arbitrary factors and the study of the 'chi' invariant for finite
factors. Third, the research will continue previous work on the inclusions of
von Neumann algebras which involve group-like objects called 'quantized groups'.
This research concerns the general theory of operators on a space. One of the
fundamental concepts in physics is the notion of the symmetry groups of
operators on a space. The most important groups arise as the symmetries of
structured spaces, such as the symmetric, linear, and unitary groups from a set,
linear space, and Hilbert space, respectively. In quantum physics, the space is
replaced by a noncommutative algebra of operators on a Hilbert space. The
quantum groups, and among them the deformations of classical groups, have proved
important in several areas of physics and mathematics.
