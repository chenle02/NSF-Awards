Sea otters are unique among all the marine mammals because large foraging fronts
are invading historical feeding grounds as the sea otter populations recover and
expand their range. This population expansion provides important natural
experiments that help to evaluate how otters affect prey populations, non-prey
communities and benthic habitats. Although most previous studies of the
community role of otters derive from the rocky shore, none have documented these
exciting natural experiments and almost nothing is known about the foraging
habitats of otters in soft-sediment environments. Oliver proposes to establish
long-term studies of how sea otters utilize soft-sediment prey communities,
which are primarily dominated by clams. The general approach is to locate active
foraging fronts and to establish permanent underwater transects. These transects
will be located in old feeding grounds that are heavily exploited, in recently
invaded sites that are heavily exploited, in relatively unexploited feeding
grounds that will be invaded by otters, and in unexploited areas that are not
likely to be used by otters. One such gradient of feeding activity exists around
Afognak Strait, by Kodiak Island. Although the quantitative sampling that will
be done along existing feeding gradients (foraging fronts) will provide
considerable insight into how changes in sea otter populations relate to changes
in prey communities, the long-term monitoring of permanent transects is even
more important and will provide the most direct evidence for the sea otter's
role in structuring soft-sediment communities. This work is closely coordinated
with population and behavior studies of sea otters that will be done by the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service in Alaska. This is a Research in Undergraduate
Institutions Award.
