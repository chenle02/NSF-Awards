This project is to support the organization of the 2016 NSF Enhancing Access to
Radio Spectrum (EARS) Principal Investigators (PI) Meeting. The PI meeting
provides important information to NSF and the community about progress and
trends into research on enhancing access to radio spectrum. This PI meeting will
be held on March 15, 2016, collocated with WInnComm 2016, the annual US
conference of the Wireless Innovation Forum which will be held March 15 to 17 in
Reston, Virginia. WInnComm is a conference focusing on the innovative use of
spectrum and advance radio technologies supporting essential and critical
communications. Collocation of the EARS PI meeting with WInnComm will provide
the EARS PIs with access to a primary user community for the type of research
being performed under the EARS Program, including Radio Manufacturers, System
Integrators, Procurement Authorities and End User Representatives in commercial,
civil and defense markets. Such an environment provides an ideal venue for PIs
to get industry recognition of their current work and receive relevant feedback
on future directions. Similarly, representatives from this user community
attending the conference will gain access to some of the latest research in
spectrum sharing and dynamic spectrum access through interactions with the EARS
PIs. This exchange of information will accelerate the realization of the EARS
program goals to improve the efficiency with which the radio spectrum is
utilized. Such improvements will have significant impact to the nation and the
world by improving access to limited spectrum resources for current and new
wireless technologies.
