The objective of this research is to develop methods and tools for analyzing
the information flow between engineering tasks in order to plan and manage
design strategies. The work is based on the concept of a Design Structure Matrix
that allows for explicit representation of predecessor-successor relations
between design tasks. This effort extends work on "tearing methods", or the
elimination of circuits in Design Structure Matrices, to allow for configuration
control as well as design planning. These concepts are expected to play a
significant role in the development of concurrent design methodologies and their
extension to industrial environment.
