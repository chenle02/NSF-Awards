They propose a study of quantum liquids via deep inelastic neutron scattering
to obtain the atomic momentum distribution function, n(p). The focus will be on
the properties of liquid helium-3 and mixtures of He-3 and He-4, and the effects
of restricted geometries on n(p) of liquid helium-4. Secondly, elastic neutron
scattering will be used to probe the structure of both solid and liquid phases
of quantum systems, such as helium and hydrogen, inside porous media.
