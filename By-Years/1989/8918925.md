In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Professor Micha will develop new methods to describe the
ways in which molecules behave as they collide and react with each other, and as
light of various frequencies is focussed on them. The objectives of the
investigations are (a) to introduce new concepts to describe the electronic
structure of non-stationary molecular systems in collisional and spectroscopy
experiments, and (b) to develop ways for calculating related quantities such as
state-to-state cross sections and spectral line shapes. These goals will be
accomplished by the use of time-dependent Hartree-Fock theory and time-dependent
variational methods for incorporating correlation effects. Applications will be
made to atom-atom and atom-diatom collisions.
