This project develops a high-level notion of context that exploits the
capabilities of next generation networks to enable applications that deliver
better user experiences. In particular, it exploits mobile devices -- always
with a user -- to capture key elements of context: the user's location and,
through localization, characteristics of the user's environment. What matters
for the user experience is the user's place: a location in conceptual terms such
as "at home," "jogging," or "grocery shopping" -- descriptions that combine
positions with activities, environmental properties, and the activities of other
nearby people. Realizing this notion of place requires that information from
devices and infrastructure flow in ways unanticipated in current network
architectures. It presumes enabling opportunistic interactions while preserving
the users' privacy and designing incentive mechanisms to promote cooperation
without exploitation of any. The above architectural concerns lie far beyond
traditional network topics such as routing.

This project will develop, demonstrate, and evaluate a novel network
architecture that gives primacy to user experience. It will lead to theoretical
advances in semantic context modeling, mobility tracking at multiple levels of
abstraction, collaborative localization, and incentive mechanisms. Networked
applications offering enhanced user experience will have significant payoffs for
industry and the productivity and quality of life of citizens. A prototype
system will implement and evaluate context-aware services in university settings
with prospects of expansion to K-12 schools and public facilities.
