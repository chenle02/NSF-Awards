This research applies asymptotic methods, involving expansions for large and
small values of parameters appearing in differential equations, to the analysis
of structures of flames in real combustible mixtures. Through
nondimensionalization of the conservation equations, large and small parameters
are identified. These parameters involve activation energies leading to
activation-energy asymptotics, magnitudes of reaction rates leading to
Damkohler-number asymptotics, and ratios of reaction rates leading to rate-
ratio asymptotics. Rate parameters for elementary steps are taken from the
literature on reaction rate experiments. The identification of limiting values
of the parameters simplifies the conservation equations and enables solutions to
be obtained largely analytically without resort to numerical integration of the
full set of conservation equations. The research will address structural
differences between premixed flames and diffusion flames for hydrocarbon-oxygen-
nitrogen systems for systems involving carbon monoxide, hydrogen and oxygen, as
well as the intrinsic stability and influences of strain for these flames.
Special attention will be paid to the derivation and application of useful
reduced schemes for hydrogen-oxygen systems, for systems containing halogens,
for higher hydrocarbons, and possibly also for methanol. The methods typically
lead to formulas for the quantities of interest, such as burning velocities, and
the formulas usually contain parameters determined by numerical integrations of
two-point boundary-value problems for ordinary differential equations. Since
these differential equations are much simpler than the starting differential
equations, full parametric solutions are obtained, rather than solutions
restricted to specific conditions. As a consequence, a better understanding of
flame structure ensues, the essential aspects of the combustion processes are
identified, and inessential complications that play no significant role are
eliminated.
