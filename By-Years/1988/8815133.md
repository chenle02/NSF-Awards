Bombesin-like peptides play a pivotal role in both normal and pathological
processes in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). This class of
neuropeptides are potent hypothermic, hyperglycemic and satiety agents and they
also alter pituitary hormone secretion as well as behavior. Bombesin stimulates
turnover of dopamine, an important neurotransmitter in schizophrenia,
Huntington"s and Parkinson"s disease. Although it is clear that bombesin-like
peptides are biologically active in the CNS, its precise physiological role
remains unknown. Dr. Moody hypothesizes that bombesin-like neuropeptides alter
the growth and/or development of brain cells. During his previous National
Science Foundation support, Dr. Moody reported the presence of high affinity
receptors in discrete brain regions. He will now characterize and determine the
regulatory role of bombesin-like peptides and their receptors in CNS. He will
evaluate the possibility that receptors for these neuropeptides regulate cell
growth by examining effects on neural transplants, development and human
cultured cells. In addition, Dr. Moody plans to solubilize and purify the
bombesin-like neuropeptide receptors and then generate specific monoclonal
antibodies. Interestingly, high levels of receptor have been localized to some
types of cancer cells and bombesin-like peptides stimulate the growth of these
malignant cells. Thus, understanding the various effects and mechanisms of
action of these neuropeptides could lead to important breakthroughs as well as
the development of new therapeutic approaches in the cancer field.
