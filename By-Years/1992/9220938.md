This research is the third major effort in a collaborative research program on
the anatomy of ray-finned fishes (actinopterygians), a group containing about
half of living vertebrates. This project concerns detailed comparative
descriptions of the early embryology of a cluster of four organ systems that
develop at the rostral tip of the head including the hypophysis (pituitary),
nose, adhesive and hatching glands. The adenohypophysis has been stressed
because it is both central to interpreting the development and history of the
vertebrate head and unites studies of comparative anatomy, embryology, and
endocrinology. %%% For approximately 50 years comparative embryology of ray-
finned fishes have been neglected. The use of scanning electron microscopy and
modern histology to study comprehensive series of embryos of several primitive
ray-finned fish will help to resolve many century-old controversies. In
addition, fishes are better suited for detailed embryological and developmental
studies of organ systems, and the data produced from these comparative data will
provide valuable information that will allow one to interpret patterns of
development of the vertebrate head and its many organ systems.
