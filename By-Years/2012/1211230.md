This award will support a theoretical program that will create complex general
relativistic radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations to study black hole
accretion flows. These flows will be modeled over a wide spatial scale from the
immediate vicinity of the black hole to many hundred times the radius of the
black hole. The project has several goals: (1) studying instabilities in the
accretion disk, (2) exploring how strong radiation pressure alters the power and
orientation of jets associated with black hole accretion, and (3) establishing
the impact of radiation pressure in driving strong
outflows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The contribute to the training of undergraduate
students and to ongoing efforts to incorporate research results into the
curriculum at the College of Charleston. The work is expected to have an impact
on the study of black holes of a variety of masses, including those that drive
active galactic nuclei.
