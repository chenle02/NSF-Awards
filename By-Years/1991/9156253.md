There is a national need to produce capable molecular biologists as basic
researchers, teachers and biotechnologists. More undergraduates--especially
minorities--must be suitably educated and encouraged to continue as biology
majors and to enroll in advanced courses in molecular biology. To help
accomplish these goals, we propose a number of approaches designed to increase
academic success and interest in freshman molecular biology; to encourage
student entry into the teaching profession; and to enhance the effectiveness of
teaching assistants at SUNY-Binghamton as well as teachers from secondary
schools and other colleges. To address these needs, the freshman Cell and
Molecular Biology courses is being reorganized and restructured to use
historical and empirical approaches, to introduce cooperative learning and
computer- constructed concept mapping, and to have laboratory classes that
include more independent, student directed experiments. A training workshop and
training manual focused on constructivist learning theory and practice is being
developed for teaching assistants. The effectiveness of the entire effort is
being assessed with the help of an independent evaluator.
