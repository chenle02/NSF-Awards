Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal 0341386&lt;br/&gt;Educational Materials
Development for a Mobile Information Systems Course&lt;br/&gt;University of
Pittsburgh&lt;br/&gt;D. W. Tipper&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop
a set of educational materials (slides, draft textbook manuscript and a
laboratory manual) for a course on mobile information systems that deals with
the special challenges posed by mobile information systems. These include such
issues as the need to track and route information to the mobile user, the
limited battery life and display capabilities of devices, security, and
frequency planning. . The track will look at not only the technical aspects,
usually considered in standard engineering courses, but also at the challenges
in developing application software and the economic and regulatory aspects of
these systems. The planned course together with a more commonly found course in
Wireless Networks can form a focused study in the development, design and
deployment of such systems. The course supported by these materials can be
taught in undergraduate information science, computer science and electrical and
computer engineering curricula.
