MCB 9507206 Angela Wandinger-Ness This project examines the mechanisms of
membrane transport in the endocytic pathway and the function of the late
endosome in both transport and in catalyzing specialized reactions. To this end,
a combination of biochemical and genetic approaches will be used to characterize
the interaction of specific forms of rab7 with the actin cytoskeleton. The yeast
two hybrid system will be employed to identify interacting partners of rab7 as a
corollary approach. In addition, an in vitro assay system will be developed to
study late endocytic membrane transport. This latter analysis will be extended
by the development of a permeabilized system which examines the mechanisms of
interaction between rab7 and its partners. This project is a Faculty Early
Career Development Award and also entail an education plan. In the Education
portion of this project an approach is developed for active learning in the
undergraduate classroom. In addition, introduction to career-training programs
will be provided to the students to make them better suited to the job market.
Finally, the project includes outreach to pre-college educators. %%% This
project will examine the mechanisms by which components are directed to specific
locations within the cell. It will help explain how molecules such as food enter
the cell and end up in the correct location for digestion. The education plan of
this project will serve to strengthen the undergraduate education at the
awardee's institution, and to make the undergraduates at the institution better
suited to the job market. ***
