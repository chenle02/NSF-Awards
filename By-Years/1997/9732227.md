DMR-9732227&lt;br/&gt;Amiridis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of South
Carolina will establish a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site in
its Department of Chemical Engineering. Undergraduate students will be recruited
from universities and colleges in the Southeast, including minority
institutions. Students will participate in research on the theme of "Novel
Materials for Power Sources", including fuel cells, supercapacitors and
electrode materials. In addition, students will attend weekly seminars and
tours, and workshops on ethics in science and engineering and on graduate
studies in chemical engineering.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;The REU site, with a
regional focus whereby high quality undergraduates will be recruited from the
Southeast, and with and emphasis on underrepresented minorities in science and
engineering, will provide a research experience on an emerging technology to
students who would not normally have access to a research
environment.&lt;br/&gt;***
