9322207 Blows This award provides for a research environment for a group of six
undergraduate researchers in the mathematical sciences. The project will run for
a period of eight weeks. Students will be recruited nationally and selected on
the basis of mathematical ability and background and the perceived benefits
which will result from the program. Efforts will focus on attracting
applications from students in underrepresented groups. Students will be paired
with faculty advisors to work on problems from areas such as combinatorics,
dynamical systems and stochastic processes. Each topic will focus on an unsolved
problem close to state-of-the-art research in the mathematical sciences. To
foster the research environment, students will participate in a seminar series
and present their own results both orally and in writing. Healthy interaction
among the students will be an important goal of this activity. Availability of
university resources such as a computer laboratory will add to the strength of
the activity. Students will have offices and computational facilities available
for the duration of the project. ***
