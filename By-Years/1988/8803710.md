This research, undertaken in collaboration with Alan W. Biermann of Duke
University, is concerned with the problem of how to int- eract with a computer
system in natural language by voice. It continues and builds on the results of
research carried out by the investigators over the past seven years. Working in
the problem domain of electronic equipment repair, they are currently
investigating a range of interactive modes from "passive" (the computer merely
follows orders and answers questions) to "direct- ive" (it takes charge and
questions and instructs the human user). They are also investigating the nature
and role of com- ments in a task-oriented dialog and ways of representing and
generating appropriate, fully grammatical, natural language spo- ken responses.
The motivating goal of the research is to be able to design a machine partner,
capable of natural language voice dialogue, and able to assist human beings of
varying abilities and experience in an electronic repair task. Progress toward
this goal contrib- utes in important ways to knowledge of how to employ automata
in roles previously possible only for skilled human beings.
