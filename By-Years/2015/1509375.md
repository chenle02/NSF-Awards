The principal investigator will accurately measure the global properties of
stars, like their mass, size, brightness, temperature, and composition. He will
use these measurements to improve the ability of computer models to predict
stellar properties at various stages in their life cycles. Such models are the
foundation of our understanding of how our Milky Way Galaxy and its member stars
(including our Sun) reached their present state. They also tell us about the
timescale for planet formation, which has a significant impact on how well we
understand the origin of planets like our own. Despite advances in recent
decades, stellar models still show some significant disagreements with
observations. The measurements obtained by this project will help to improve
stellar physics, and it will offer valuable opportunities to engage students in
all aspects of scientific research, providing support for two summer
undergraduate students each year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will measure
the fundamental properties of carefully-selected target stars in eclipsing or
astrometric binary systems, which will provide the strongest constraints on
theory. The sample includes low-mass stars, which have been shown to often be
larger and cooler than predicted by models, for reasons that are still unclear.
The main goal is to obtain highly accurate measurements of the absolute masses,
radii, effective temperatures, luminosities, chemical composition, and other
properties of the components, aiming at relative precisions of 1-2% in the
masses and radii. The observational component of the project will include
photometric light curves, high-resolution spectra, and long-baseline
interferometry. Specific aspects of theory that will be tested include
convection (mixing length approximation, overshooting), tidal effects that lead
to rotational synchronization and orbital circularization, and the effects of
magnetic activity and spots on the absolute stellar properties.
