Physics (13)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing a new type of
undergraduate laboratory course at Caltech called the Physics Design Lab. The
course is patterned after the highly successful Engineering Design Lab courses
that exist throughout the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Physics Design
Lab, undergraduate students are asked to design, build, and debug their own
physics experiments in a professional laboratory setting, much as their
engineering counterparts are asked to design and build electro-mechanical
devices in the Engineering Design Labs. Resources and equipment are available to
allow the students to "ask their own questions" and "design their own
experiments" in tracks related to Dynamical Ion Trapping, Dynamical Magnetic
Trapping, Quantized Conductance, The Josephson Effect, and Optical Tweezers, or
students can design and build a Magnetoelectrodynamic Coin Shrinker
demonstration. Each track presents interesting physics while still being fun to
build and simple enough to enable less experienced students to be
successful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching goal of the Physics Design Lab
is to allow students to become "practicing physicists" by giving them the
opportunity to design their first experiment and to build their first simple
piece of apparatus, while enabling them to learn basic experimental techniques
through hands-on experience.
