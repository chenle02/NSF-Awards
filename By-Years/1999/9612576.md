This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, seeks
to create, stimulate, and sustain interest in science among sophomore and junior
level high school students by providing them the opportunity to take an intense,
college-level lecture and laboratory course in analytical chemistry. Professors
Mildred Smalley and Robert Miller of the Department of Chemistry at Southern
University in Baton Rouge will lead a course for approximately sixteen high
school students with assistance from two high school chemistry teachers. The
course will use problems in environmental chemistry to illustrate principles of
analytical chemistry and to convey to these students a sense of the excitement
that is attendant to careers in chemistry. This project is aimed at attracting
underrepresented minority student into successful careers in science. An intense
college-level course in environmental analytical chemistry will be made
available on a competitive basis for some sixteen high school sophomores and
juniors from the Baton Rouge area. Two high school chemistry teachers will serve
as teaching assistants in this course. Particular attention is given to
attracting underrepresented minority students to science pursuits and to
enhancing the likelihood of their future success in scientific careers.
