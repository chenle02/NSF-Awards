The Denver Audubon Society will, over a three year period, provide the training
and materials necessary to disseminate their Urban Education Project to six or
more cities across the country. Their outdoor education program is "hands-on,"
locally supported with funds and volunteers, and targeted to include inner-city
children who will be served in locales close to their homes and schools. NSF
funding will support project staff, provide initial curriculum materials, and
insure close contact with the developing programs. About 20,000 elementary
children and nearly a thousand adult volunteer leaders will participate in the
program over the three year period. At the end of the project, the new programs
will continue without further assistance, and will serve as models for other
community programs. Over the three year project period, more than $380,000 in
local funds and in-kind support will be provided, nearly equalling the NSF
support. Participating cities include: Boston, MA; Louisville, KY; Birmingham,
AL; Prescott, AZ; Arlington, TX; Gainesville, FL; Seattle, WA; and Broward
County, FL.
