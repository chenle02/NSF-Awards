The proposed study will investigate the social movements that are driving one
major US city to address food recovery and composting initiatives. The study
will identify what conditions are facilitating competing and diverse actors and
strategies to work together in order to transform a large city waste system. The
findings will be of interest to community organizers, policy makers, city urban
designers and planners who are managing, updating and maintaining urban waste
systems.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This research will ask what happens to a huge,
obdurate sociotechnical system when it is challenged by numerous alternative
solutions. The research will examine how top-down and bottom-up designs are
coordinated through the deployment of future projections by people developing
alternative food waste systems. The study will use a mixed-methods, multi-sited
design to understand how actors building alternative food waste systems in New
York City imagine and coordinate projected futures as they create new
infrastructures. Data collection will include: 1) participant observation of
design, building and maintenance of alternative food waste infrastructures; 2)
participant observation at planning and policy events; 3) semi-structured
interviews with organizers, volunteers, and users of systems; and 4) daily use
of, and interactions with, emerging food infrastructures. This study will
demonstrate how informal urbanism can create decentralized solutions to the
complex problem of waste. Insights about the effectiveness and pitfalls of this
approach to sociotechnical transformation will help to inform policy makers and
designers seeking effective ways to weave together centralized and situated
approaches to green infrastructure. Findings will be reported in both scholarly
and popular venues and shared with food recovery and composing practitioners.
