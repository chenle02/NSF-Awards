The "Strengthening the Teaching and Learning of Electro-Mechanical Technology
(STLET)" project is responding to a significant demand for highly skilled
advanced manufacturing technicians in the Southeastern Pennsylvania (SEPA)
region. Meeting this need is critical because the advanced manufacturing sector
is growing in the region, where it is a major economic driver, with an estimated
$36 million Gross Regional Product (GRP). The STLET Project is employing
curricular improvements and professional development activities to enhance and
deliver advanced manufacturing technician education that meets industry needs.
The main project activities are a) improving and implementing an industry-
aligned, apprenticeship-based early college-to-university Electro-Mechanical
technology career preparation pathway and b) upgrading the teaching competencies
of faculty through competency assessment, formal pedagogy training, and
engagement in a community of practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual
merit of the STLET design and approach is that it is comprehensive, innovative
and replicable. It is comprehensive in that it is addressing both teaching and
learning outcomes. STLET is innovative because it is integrating two proven
educational programs (early college programs and community college-university
transfer agreements) and a competency-based apprenticeship into a career
preparation pathway. Normally these three programs, with demonstrated success in
improving completion outcomes at both high school and college/university levels,
are offered independent of one another. In STLET, however, they are interwoven
to provide a structured career preparation pathway. This pathway is replicable
and can be adopted by other community colleges seeking to assist in the economic
development of their regions. This demonstrates STLET's broader impact to the
larger advanced technological community.
