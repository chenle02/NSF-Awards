This program focuses on the application of THz time-domain spectroscopy (TDS) to
experimental problems that cannot be solved by Fourier Transform Spectroscopy
(FTS). A detailed comparison between THz-TDS and FTS will be carried out both
experimentally and theoretically. In addition, a current effort in coherent
transients will be extended to include transient species and free radicals. A
new topic of THz impulse ranging will be introduced through the first direct
experimental test of theoretical predictions for the surface wave contributions
to the scattering of electromagnetic radiation by dielectric spheres.
