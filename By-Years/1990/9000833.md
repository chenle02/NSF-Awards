This award provides ongoing support to The Jackson Laboratory, a private, non-
profit research institution, to continue their Research Experience for
Undergraduates Site. In 1990 12 undergraduates, selected from a nationwide group
of applicants, will conduct independent hands-on research for 9 weeks in the
summer under the direct supervision of staff scientists. Working in their
sponsors' laboratories, the students conduct original basic research on problems
in mammalian genetics and development that are components of their sponsors' on-
going research programs. Students gain experience in all aspects of doing a
research project, from project design to reporting the results. Inbred and
mutant laboratory mice are utilized in many projects. All students are from
outside the host institution; about half are from baccalaureate colleges.
Students with a wide range of science preparation are accepted, with each
participant's research project tailored to his or her individual background and
interests. The students' work at the bench is supplemented by organized group
educational activities, including a formal symposium. Follow-up activities are
in place to help foster the students' continuing interest in science and
research. Informal studies of program alumni indicate that a very high
percentage receive doctoral degrees in the biological sciences or medicine.
