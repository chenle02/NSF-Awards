Modern information networks are composed of heterogeneous nodes and links, whose
capacities and capabilities change unexpectedly due to mobility, failures,
maintenance, and adversarial attacks.  User demands and critical infrastructure
needs, however, require that basic primitives including access to information
and services be always efficient and reliable.  This project studies the design
of highly robust networked systems that are resilient to extreme failures and
rapid dynamics, and provide optimal performance under a wide spectrum of
scenarios with varying levels of predictability.

The focus of this project will be on two problem domains, which together address
adversarial network dynamics and stochastic network failures.  The first
component is a comprehensive theory of information spreading in dynamic
networks.  The PI will develop an algorithmic toolkit for dynamic networks,
including local gossip-style protocols, network coding, random walks, and other
diffusion processes.  The second component of the project concerns failure-aware
network algorithms that provide high availability in the presence of unexpected
and correlated failures.  The PI will study failure-aware placement of critical
resources, and develop flow and cut algorithms under stochastic failures using
techniques from chance-constrained optimization.  Algorithms tolerant to
adversarial and stochastic uncertainty will play a critical role in large-scale
heterogeneous information networks of the future. Broader impacts include
student training and curriculum development.
