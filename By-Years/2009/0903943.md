This award is made in response to a proposal submitted to and reviewed under the
NSF/DoE Partnership in Basic Plasma Science and Engineering joint solicitation
NSF 08-589. The award provides funds to support undergraduate participation in
the overall research effort, which is being funded separately by the DoE under
contract to UC-Irvine (Grant DE-
FG02-03ER54720)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A test-particle experiment is
planned to study the transport of fast ions by microturbulence. Drift-Alfven
turbulence will be created by drawing electron current to a biased disk. The
fast-ion orbit will traverse the sharp density-gradient region, where the
fluctuation amplitude is largest. The pitch angle and energy of the beam will be
varied to study the dependence of fast-ion transport on energy. The results will
be compared with gyrokinetic simulations of the expected transport. Other
experiments with the lithium source will revisit the Doppler-shifted cyclotron
resonance with shear Alfven waves at larger wave amplitudes, where nonlinear
effects will become important. &lt;br/&gt;In addition to these studies,
Professor Heidbrink coordinates the fast-ion "campaign" at the Large Plasma
Device (LAPD), an NSF-DoE supported user facility. This campaign promotes
communication between the fusion, space, and basic plasma physics communities
and involves additional scientists in the LAPD program. The project will support
one Ph.D. dissertation and several undergraduate
projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF support of undergraduate participation
adds a broader educational impact through the early-year training of students by
introducing them to scientific research as a possible career path.
