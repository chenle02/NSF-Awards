Utah State University has carried out a very successful program involving the
preparation by undergraduates of self contained canisters for Space Shuttle
flights. These are known as "Getaway Specials". This REU proposal is to broaden
the program in 1987 to involve more students from outside USU. It is led by
individuals very well qualified in Space Science and with demonstrated success
as sources of inspiration for young people. The program is likely to serve as an
effective means of attracting bright young students into Space Science.
