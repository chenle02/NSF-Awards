A series of symposia on Structural Dynamics and Control have been scheduled
every two years since 1977. The objectives are to provide a forum for exchange
of ideas on structural dynamics and structural control and to disseminate
results of research in these areas. The next symposium which will be convened in
May 1997 at VPI, aims to bring together researchers from a broad spectrum of
engineering disciplines such as aerospace, civil, electrical and mechanical
engineering, as well as engineering mechanics. The scope of the symposium has
continuously expanded over the years to reflect the changing interests, needs,
and priorities of the technical community. The symposium covers theoretical,
numerical and experimental developments from such areas as: flutter and/or
vibration control in aircraft, rotorcraft, civil and space structures dynamics
and control of civil structures subjected to seismic and wind excitations
maneuvering and control of flexible multibody systems structural optimization
and tailoring of composite structures structural identification structural
acoustics; noise control active control of rotors.
