9312478 Morgan This U.S.-Mexico award will support a research workshop in atomic
and molecular physics. Organized by Prof. Thomas Morgan of Wesleyan University
and Prof. Carmen Cisneros of the Institute of Physics of Cuernavaca, this
workshop will involve researchers from Canada and Europe to promote new
collaborations, facilitate the transfer of ideas among researchers from
different areas of specialization, and strengthen ties with a strong nucleus of
researchers in this area in Mexico. A key feature of this workshop will be the
participation of junior researchers to promote new collaborations. The proposed
topic for this workshop, few-body problems and correlation, continues to be a
topic of much current interest and in the past two years many new findings have
emerged, both in theory and experiment. A sample of the topics to be discussed
includes electron scattering, simple molecules, multiply charged ion collisions,
excited state systems, and chaos and photon effects (both laser and synchrotron
radiation research.) ***
