The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve
predictivity in preclinical pharmaceutical research and development to lower
drug development costs and to improve drug approval rates. Recent cost estimates
for developing a prescription drug is $2.6 billion over the 10-year development
period, and the annual drug approval rate is as low as 20-30 drugs, while
hundreds of drugs candidates fail each year. The failure rates of a large
percentage of drug candidates at the clinical trial increase the overall costs
of approved drugs. Replacing simplistic 2D cell culture models and animal models
with human organ-on-a-chip (OoC) technologies will provide human-specific
solutions for drug development. These tests can provide stronger predictions and
confidence to advance the right drug candidates to clinical trials and also
identify problem candidates early to save time and money associated with
progressing the wrong compounds through expensive clinical
trials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project provides an integrative
solution to the pharmaceutical industry for preclinical drug testing using
Organ-on-a-Chip (OoC) technologies with companion computational tools. OoC
technologies, which are micro-engineered systems combining living 3D human
cells, fluidic channels, and biomaterials, emulate biological and physiological
processes of the real organ in vitro. The need for more physiologically relevant
in vitro systems for preclinical efficacy and toxicity testing has led to a
major effort to develop OoC technologies. OoC approaches have been recognized as
emerging technologies with potential to revolutionize medical research and drug
discovery. However, OoC technologies require specialized operational
infrastructure including instrumentation and an experienced tissue engineering
team not common in industry. By providing a specialized service model, the
benefits of human-relevant OoCs become accessible by bridging the gap between
pharmaceutical companies, OoC companies, and academia.
