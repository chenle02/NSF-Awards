This project is a CBMS Regional Conference in the Mathematical Sciences
entitled "The Polynomial Identities and Invariants of n x n Matrices". This
conference will be held July 16-20, 1990 at DePaul University's Lincoln Park
campus in Chicago. The study of polynomial identities has been of great interest
in non-commutative ring theory since Kaplansky's result in 1948 that a primitive
ring satisfying a polynomial identity must be a simple algebra of finite
dimension over its center. Work in the seventies and early eighties by Formanek,
Procesi, Regev, and others established connections between the theory of
polynomial identities, representation theory, invariant theory, and
combinatorics. There is presently much interest in the area, recently spurred by
Kemer's solution to the Specht problem. A series of ten talks by Professor
Formanek will be geared to a diverse audience, and meant to provide participants
with information and insights into the recent advances in these areas.
