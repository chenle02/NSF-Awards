The PI will use simultaneous ground-based measurements of the most prominent
features of nightglow to observe dynamical and photochemical processes that
control the mesopause region's thermal structure and composition. The PI will
verify a detailed analysis scheme to deduce the atomic oxygen density maximum
and its centroid height variation, compare these quantities for consistency with
simultaneous sodium lidar density and temperature profiles, and verify tidal
model predictions using the time variations of intensities of visible and near
IR airglow features and rotational temperatures. Such an analysis will enhance
understanding of the photochemistry of nightglow emissions and lead to an
improved theoretical framework for studying oxygen atom density variations and
atmospheric dynamics in the mesopause region.***
