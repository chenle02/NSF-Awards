Analytical solutions will be developed for the effects on measured friction
values of the offset between the friction force in the surface of a sliding
system and the exterior force which is applied to overcome the friction. The
analysis will be based on the Greenwood-Williamson theory for asperity contact
of randomly textured surfaces and on adhesion between contacting asperities as
the friction mechanism. The analytical solutions will be validated with
experimental data.
