Drs. Lu and Szekely build on their previous work in combinatorics and graph
theory and continue their research on problems related to graph visualization
and graph drawing; random graph models; tree indices relevant for chemistry;
models for biomolecular sequence evolution; and phylogeny reconstruction for
species evolution. They also continue their long-running projects on fundamental
questions in extremal set theory, extremal graph theory, and discrete geometry.
The particular problems on which they work include * the further development of
the theory of crossing numbers of graphs and of better graph drawing algorithms;
* improving current bounds on Turan type extremal problem on hypergraphs, one of
the toughest problems in extremal combinatorics; * improving our knowledge on
Property B, where notoriously hard problems provide testing ground for new
techniques; * extending current probabilistic tools in combinatorics to be
applicable in a new or more general scenario; * work towards the unification of
random graph models; * searching for new insights on antichains and on
intersecting families of subsets; * reach a much better understanding of the
Randic index, a concept of extremal graph theory that has been introduced and
widely used in chemistry; * continuing the study of models of biomolecular
sequence evolution and phylogenetic trees, of phylogenetic tree reconstruction
algorithms, in particular the maximum likelihood method, and investigating the
phylogeny problem in the setting of inverting random functions.

There is increasing demand to understand ``optimal'' extreme structures and
``typical'' random structures in discrete mathematics as this understanding
often leads to new algorithms This project will investigate basic combinatorial
questions about structures and will look for various applications of discrete
mathematics in computer science, biology, and engineering. In addition, the
proposers plan to continue their interdisciplinary collaborations with
colleagues from engineering, biology, statistics, and computer science, and
expect to solve some of their new problems.
