This engineering research equipment grant will provide for the purchase of a
computer-controlled image analyzer system and for the expansion of the available
experimental research capabilities at the institution. This equipment will
provide the capability to perform cyclic loading tests of granular soils and to
assess the soil fabric response. The acquisition of an image analyzer,
particularly when coupled with a scanning electron microscope which is available
at the institution, will facilitate evaluation of the physical and chemical
properties of soils.
