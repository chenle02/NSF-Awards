This project will support the Thesis research of CoPI Gjesfjeld, which is a
systematic examination of ceramic use and social organization in the Kuril
Islands. The CoPI proposes to utilize a quantitative network modeling approach
to understand social organization via material remains, specifically ceramic
sherds. Network models will be created based on geochemical sourcing of the
ceramics and these models will potentially provide insights into social movement
of ceramics in the prehistoric past. The CoPI has completed significant
preliminary work on the ceramic sourcing and has obtained agreements from the
Russian and Japanese institutions to analyze the materials. This project will
contribute to a broader understanding of early social organization in the North
Pacific and specifically in island environments.
