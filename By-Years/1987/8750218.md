The addition of an autosampler and fraction collector to existing units has
produced a modular microprocessor controlled liquid chromatography (LC) system
for the Chemistry Department at California State University, Chico. The added
components facilitate the use of the system for large undergraduate classes by
automating time consuming separations and semi- preparative purifications and
sample collection. The entire system is being used for the experimental
enhancement of four chemistry classes, and for undergraduate independent study
projects. Five new experiments, using LC technology are being developed for the
undergraduate laboratories.
