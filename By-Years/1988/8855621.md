Following the 1986 Tokyo meeting of the International Commission on Physics
Education, leaders of the U. S., Japan, and China delegations agreed to
establish Advisory Committees in each of the three countries to plan ways to
work together in exploring various aspects of physics education. This project
will allow representatives of those committees to meet in Hawaii in the summer
of 1989 to explore ways to interact on such topics as the role of women in
physics, the education of physics teachers, the physics curriculum, development
of low cost experiments, computer applications in physics education, research in
concept formation by physics students, and the relation between physics
education and languages. The meeting will be followed by planning and
implementation of concrete activities in each country under the guidance of the
respective Advisory Committees.
