The Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) project is located at the Cambridge
Crystallographic Data Centre in the United Kingdom. This award from the Division
of Chemistry, Office of Special Projects, will provide 25 percent of the support
for access to this database by U.S. scientists from the academic, government,
and not-for-profit research communities. This contribution will be transferred
to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as the NSF becomes a co-supporter of
the CSD. The U.S. has over 1600 crystallographers who are potential users of
this database. The CSD contains the most comprehensive collection of evaluated
crystallographic data in the world. Data for about 140,000 organic and
organometallic crystal structures were included in the CSD as of January, 1995.
Atomic coordinates, chemical connectivity tables, bibliographic data fields
including reference sources fop the data, and coordinates for chemical structure
diagrams for each molecule are part of the system. Software for search,
retrieval, and analysis of the data will be supplied as well as any improvements
and updates of the software. About 12,000 new crystal structures are added to
the database each year. Thus this international resource will remain accessible
to crystallographic community and other users in the U.S. through the joint
support of NSF and NIH.
