Cheilostome bryozoans are colonial marine invertebrates that are a common
constituent of post-Paleozoic seas. The individual polyps that comprise the
colony are capable of differentiating into several different "heteromorphs",
each of which serves a distinct function that benefits the colony (e.g.,
protection from encrusting competitors). Biologists have tended to rely on the
characteristics of individual zooids (within which polyps reside) in
distinguishing species and constructing classifications. Dr. Scott Lidgard
proposes a study of both zooid- and colony-level features, for the purpose of
establishing their relative value in unravelling evolutionary relationships in a
genus of fossil cheilostomes. Dr. Lidgard will use the most current techniques
of computer-based image analysis and phylogenetic reconstruction. The proposed
research has implications beyond paleontologists interested in bryozoan
classification. The focus on colony-level organization is relevant to botanists
and invertebrate zoologists interested in corals, sponges, and other colonial
groups. The results of this study will suggest whether or not the colony-level
of integration has a significant effect on the evolutionary history of these
groups, and on the way research is conducted on them.
