The Principal Investigator will organize U.S. participation in a joint
U.S.-French workshop on underwater robotics. The workshop will be held May 17 to
19, 1992, in Toulon, France. The French co-organizers have agreed to host the
meeting at the Toulon laboratory of IFREMER, the French Agency responsible for
ocean related research activities. Fifteen U.S. participants, selected to
represent a wide range of underwater technology experience and research
interests, will discuss and report on potential areas for joint U.S.-French
collaborative research. The goal will be to identify research areas which are
important to underwater robots; interesting as research topics; and in which the
French and U.S. interests match sufficiently that the workshop participants
believe substantial collaboration would be possible and beneficial. This report
will be published in order to form the catalyst for U.S. researchers to propose
and initiate joint projects with the French counterparts.
