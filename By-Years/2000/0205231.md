0205231&lt;br/&gt;Umashankar &amp; Choi&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a planning
visit grant for Drs. Ray Umashankar and Christopher Choi, in the College of
Engineering at the University of Arizona, to travel to Namibia to meet with
Professor Ibo Zimmerman and his colleagues in the Department of Natural
Resources with the Polytechnic of Namibia, to explore the feasibility of
developing a US-Namibia REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) Site in the
area of Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) with Web-cam and CAD
applications. CEA is the production of plants and their products within
structures, such as greenhouses, that are engineered to control the environments
of the plants. Structures are monitored by Web-cams and Web-based control
systems. Student projects would focus on the mechanatronics and hydrophonics
areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being jointly funded by the Office
of International Science and Engineering and the Division of Engineering
Education and Centers.&lt;br/&gt;
