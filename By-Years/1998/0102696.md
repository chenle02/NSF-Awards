Adaptive Performance and Power Management for Real-Time Systems

This research will enable real-time computer systems to monitor and
automatically adapt their power usage to specified fault-tolerance and
performance requirements, prevailing workload, and current and projected
energy/power constraints.

Many systems, which are power-constrained, do not always have a strict limit on
their power consumption. Instead, they have periods of time during which energy
supply is very limited, and should be used sparingly, while at other times, the
power available is adequate and the system is allowed to exploit all its
resources to deliver maximum performability. While there has been a great deal
of research in developing circuits and design techniques to build low-power
devices, there is very little reported on techniques to adjust power consumption
on-the-fly to adapt to changing levels of workload and energy/power
availability. There is the need for an integrated approach, ranging from the
hardware operation (using voltage-clock scaling or a sleep mode) to the
application level. Our preliminary investigations have shown that such an
integrated approach, exploiting the synergy between these various layers, is far
more effective than single-layer approaches adopted incrementally.
