This award will provide support to defray expenses of researchers participating
in the International Workshop on Concentration, Functional Inequalities and
Isoperimetry to be held October 29-November 1, 2009 at Florida Atlantic
University. Support will be provided to participants who do not currently hold
NSF awards, with exceptions made for some plenary speakers. It is understood
that much of the funding will be directed to graduate students, postdocs, and
junior faculty but that certain senior participants will be funded as well.

The program will feature 16 one hour plenary lectures and a number of
contributed talks. The principal objective of this meeting is to introduce young
mathematicians to the field, as well as to provide a forum for presentation of
the current state of the art of the theory. The organizers intend to actively
involve young mathematicians, female mathematicians, and mathematicians from
other under-represented groups, to which much of the funding will be directed.
Graduate students are expected to participate at the meeting.
