This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and the
Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Programs. Professor
Carla Slebodnick from Virginia Polytechnic Institute &amp; State University and
colleagues David Kingston, Victoria Soghomonian, Nancy Ross, and Bin Xu are
acquiring an X-ray diffractometer with a dual molybdenum and copper source. In
general, an X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the
full three-dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and
angles. The instrument provides accurate information about the spatial
arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies
described here impact many areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry,
materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of
teaching as well as research and research training of undergraduate students in
chemistry and biochemistry at this institution, as well as collaborators from
regional institutions. Training in specialized methods such as high pressure and
biomolecular crystallography prepare students for challenges in both academia
and industry. This instrument serves as a regional facility with students and
faculty from many neighboring colleges accessing and collaborating on research
projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The diffractometer enhances research and
education at all levels. It especially aids in investigating perovskites and
related mineral-inspired substances, metal-organic-frameworks (commonly referred
to as MOFs), and electronic materials. The diffractometer is also used in small
molecule determinations that may be relevant to the drug discovery. The
instrument is essential for studies requiring biomacromolecular crystallography.
