This award supports the research in arithmetic algebraic geometry of Professor
Alice Silverberg of The Ohio State University. Dr. Silverberg's project is to
study arithmetic quotients of bounded symmetric domains and their points, and
especially certain special group representations associated to such points. This
is research in the field of arithmetic algebraic geometry, a subject that
combines the techniques of algebraic geometry and number theory. In its original
formulation, algebraic geometry treated figures that could be defined in the
plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Number theory started with
the whole numbers and such questions as divisibility of one whole number by
another. These two subjects, seemingly so far apart, have in fact influenced
each other from the earliest times, but in the past quarter century the mutual
influence has increased greatly. The field of arithmetic algebraic geometry now
uses techniques from all of modern mathematics, and is having corresponding
influence beyond its own borders.
