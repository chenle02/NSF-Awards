The recent successes of theoretical chemistry with improved programs and faster
computers have generated a need for still faster machines. Experienced users
wish to solve larger and larger problems of more and more relevance to the
experimental chemist. Similarly, experimental chemists, seeing these results,
are compelled to become new users. The acquisition of state-of-the-art
computational equipment is essential to the modern chemistry department carrying
out of frontier reseach. The Department of Chemistry of Vanderbilt University
will use this award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program to help
acquire an advanced parallel- and vector-processing research computer. The areas
of chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition include the
following: 1) The study of core ionization in atoms and molecules 2) Theoretical
studies of molecular energetics and novel molecular structures 3) A
collaboration between theoretical and experimental organic chemistry 4)
Structure-reactivity relationships of ligands to nonmetals in hypervalent
species 5) Mathematical modeling of in situ clean-up methods.
