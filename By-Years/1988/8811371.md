This is a fundamental engineering research project that intends to utilize the
electro-mechanical signal, which can be derived from living cartilage, to form
the basis of a diagnostic tool which can quantitate the degradation of living
cartilage. Quantitative information of such a nature has the potential to be
used to determine the vitality and character of living tissue. This proposal is
obviously aimed towards an emerging engineering technology, and is definitely a
"High Risk-High Gain" research proposal. This research will determine whether it
is possible to use the mechanical-electro- kinetic effect obtained from the
living cartilage to produce the necessary mechanical strain required for making
the measurements.
