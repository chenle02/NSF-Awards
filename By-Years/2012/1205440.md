This grant is for research in applications of Noncommutative Geometry (NCG) to
models in theoretical physics. One part focuses on applications to quantum Hall
systems and quasicrystals. The goal is to extend the NCG approach to fractional
Hall effects. For quasicrystal structures, the aim is to combine algebro-
geometric techniques and NCG methods. A second part of the research deals with
the use of NCG techniques in spin foams models, as developed in recent work of
the PI, with the aim of combining this method with the almost commutative
geometries used in the NCG approach to particle physics models. A third part of
the proposal deals with extending models of particle physics and cosmology based
on NCG, and to connect these models of low energy limits of String Theory. The
last part proposes a new point of view, based on the correspondence between BPS
states counting and statistical physics model of crystal melting recently
developed in String Theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: The PI was
invited speaker in the Mathematical Physics session of the International
Congress of Mathematicians, Hyderabad 2010, and plenary speaker in the European
Congress of Mathematics, Amsterdam 2008. The PI graduated twelve PhD students
over the past five years (eight belonging to ethnic minorities) and is currently
supervising seven other graduate students. The PI has also supervised eleven
undergraduates at Caltech (four belonging to underrepresented groups) on summer
research projects. In the past two years, seven papers were coauthored by the PI
with Caltech undergraduates. The PI is also mentoring two postdocs (one from an
underrepresented group). For outreach the PI has authored four research
monographs and has edited eight volumes arising from conferences, workshops and
special programs that she co-organized over the past few years. In addition to
these publications and to frequent lectures at workshops and conferences, the PI
also delivered five general audience lectures on her research over the past
three years.
