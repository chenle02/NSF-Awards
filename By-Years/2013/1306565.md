The vision of creating fully controlled spatial and temporal quantum mechanical
electron waves will be realized in the near future. Such coherent electron
control offers exciting possibilities for the development of new technologies
and the exploration of new physics. The challenge to combine very small
(nanometer scale) parts with ultrafast (femto- and atto-second) lasers to
control electrons is going to be addressed by the work funded through this
grant. The largest enclosed area electron interferometer ever will be built, and
electron switches directing signals at extreme rates of about a million
GigaHertz will be explored.

The impact of having a largest electron interferometer (that still fits in a
car) is that new frequency ranges and sensitivities of electromagnetic fields
can be tested. The use of a simple low frequency magnetometer is explored
together with Honeywell and these devices are applicable for hunting submarines
and locating mines. Higher frequencies are used for detecting electromagnetic
communications. On the scientific side, the interferometer will be used to help
understand one of the largest puzzles of the century, which is the transition
between classical and quantum physics. The impact of having ultrafast electron
switches is that this may enable a new generation of devices, such as the
fastest microscopes, oscilloscopes and signal processors. The educational impact
is that training for graduate students will be provided in an area of national
need, while previous outreach has already reached an estimated 100,000 high
school students. This grant will allow a continuation of these efforts.
