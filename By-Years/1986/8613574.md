This research is concerned with machine perception and analysis of complex
sound signals. The goaL is to reliably identify and track simultaneous acoustic
sources in a monaural signal. In the proposed architecture, perception results
from the interaction of data-driven and expectation-driven agents. The
allocation of resources to systems agents, and the control of feedback loops
between different levels of interpretation of the time-varying signal are
approached with strategies that simulate real-time problem solving. At the
lowest level of analysis, multi-rate signal processing, used in conjection with
focus-switching heuristics, ought to yield high resolution simultaneously in
time and frequency, thus giving an efficient method for improving upon
traditional bandwidth-time tradeoffs. Source coherence criteria derived from
psychoacoustic work on auditory streaming (including correlated AM and FM
modulation among partials) are expected to be useful for separating sources when
more familiar methods do not suffice. The proposed system relies on a learning
co-processor to attune itself to increasingly elusive aspects of a signal.
Relevant techniques include traditional parameter adaptation, numerical
taxonomy, syntatic pattern matching and concept learning. Especially important
is the development of hybrid methods that combine parametric and structural
views. In summary, the research addresses key areas of acoustic analysis as well
as broader issues in the architecture of artificial intelligence.
