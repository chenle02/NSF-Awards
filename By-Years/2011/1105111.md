Dr. Herbst and his team continue their investigations of astrochemistry in
different environments of the interstellar medium, ranging from chemistry in
molecular clouds to stellar outflows from AGB stars to the formation of
prebiotic molecules, and some types of extragalactic sources. The focus is on
improved chemical simulations of regions that will be observed in detail by ALMA
and other interferometers to study both the dynamics and heterogeneity of
sources. The work is done with chemical network computations which include gas-
phase reactions and gas-surface (ice) reactions, as well as kinetic
considerations. &lt;br/&gt;Observations of molecular spectra of the interstellar
medium can be analyzed to tell us about the physical conditions of the objects
in which the molecules reside. In order to understand how molecules are formed
and destroyed, the PI and his team have created large networks for chemical
reactions which include both gas-phase and grain-surface processes. Coupled with
physical models of sources, either homogeneous or heterogeneous, these chemical
network computations are used to calculate molecular abundances both in the gas
and on the surfaces of dust grains. A comparison with observational data then
gives us information on physical conditions and lifetimes of
sources.&lt;br/&gt;Postdoc and graduate student training is a vital part of this
project. The work in astrochemistry by the PI has been important in the
burgeoning use of molecules as probes of the interstellar medium in our galaxy
and others. Much of the knowledge of diffuse and dense interstellar clouds now
comes from an understanding of what molecules in these regions tell us. The
field of molecular astronomy has become a worldwide endeavor in which
observational astronomers, theoretical chemists, experimental scientists, and
modelers collaborate on problems of mutual interest.
