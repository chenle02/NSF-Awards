The chemistry curriculum will be enhanced by introducing the theory and practice
of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometry in the organic chemistry
course and two other chemistry courses. The instrument will give organic
students hands-on experience with modern computer-controlled instrumentation and
will reinforce the learning of chemical principles. The instrument will also be
introduced in the general chemistry course. This acquisition will enable the
department to offer, for the first time, an analytical chemistry course. The
FTIR will be integrated into this quantitative analysis laboratory. The grantee
will match the NSF award from non-Federal sources.
