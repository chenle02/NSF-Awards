So-called von Neumann algebras have their origins in the attempt by Murray and
von Neumann to put the study of quantum mechanics on firm mathematical footing.
The two generalized ideas from linear algebra, about symmetries of three-,
four-, or higher-dimensional space, to an infinite-dimensional setting that
arises naturally in quantum physics. When trying to understand von Neumann
algebras and their underlying structure, one is led naturally to consider
"subfactors." These are pairs of minimal von Neumann algebras, one of which
contains the other. The study of subfactors has resulted in some surprising
connections with other areas of mathematics. One of the earliest is the famous
Jones polynomial, which arrises in the mathematical study of knots. This
polynomial has led to a deeper understand of the connections between subfactors
and topology (the qualitative study of shape--as opposed to geometry, which is
the quantitative study of shape). More recently, subfactors have been connected,
through the seemingly abstract algebraic field of "category theory," to the
topic of topological quantum computing. Quantum computers would be capable of
efficiently computing a large class of problems that are widely believed to be
intractable on traditional computers, and topology may be the answer to the
difficult question of how to stabilize quantum systems enough to make computers
from them.

The principal research goals of this project deal with questions in subfactor
theory: the study of inclusions of von Neumann algebras with trivial center. In
this approach, questions about subfactors are translated into questions about
finite invariants of subfactors, namely, planar algebras and principal graphs.
Planar algebras have many advantages: they allow one to calculate in finite-
dimensional spaces, exploit the connection between subfactors and topology, and
illuminate the underlying symmetry of the subfactors. The principal investigator
plans to extend her previous research on classification and construction of
small index subfactors and also to apply ideas from this classification in new
places. This project is guided by the following big questions that the principal
investigator does not expect to answer completely but that lead one to ask
smaller and more approachable questions: (1) Which graphs can occur as principal
graphs? (2) What is the highest supertransitivity a subfactor can have? (3) Can
subfactors with integer index have objects whose dimensions are not square roots
of integers? (4) Are exotic subfactors common, or rare, at higher indices? (5)
Are there symmetry principals relating graphs and subfactor planar algebras
embedded in their graph planar algebras?
