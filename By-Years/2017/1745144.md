The Workshop on "Valleytronic Materials, Applications, and Devices" will be held
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, MA on 22-23 August,
2017. It will focus on a class of devices and will host leading Valleytronics
researchers in the field whose expertise range from synthesis,
characterizations, device development, theory and applications. The devices make
use of the momentum state of charge carriers instead of, or in combination with,
charge and/or spin and are expected to provide a new degree of freedom for
information processing. The Workshop seeks financial support to allow extension
of the conference to include student and postdoc attendees, a student poster
session, a student/postdoc lunch and a Q&A session, and a half day extension to
the workshop to develop a draft of a whitepaper in the area of valleytronics.
The meeting will be attended by graduate students as both an educational
opportunity (similar to a 2-day short-course in Valleytronics) and as an
opportunity to interact with senior researchers to whom they otherwise may not
have access at larger symposia. A poster session is also planned for graduate
students and postdocs to present their work related to the field.
