Structural crystallography gives the chemist a powerful method for determining
the structure of solids and molecules at the atomic level. However, the
technique is ignored in virtually all undergraduate chemistry curricula. In
response to this need, a new undergraduate laboratory course in which each
undergraduate major will participate in hands-on X-ray crystal structure
determination will be established in the Chemistry Department at the University
of Wisconsin at Milwaukee. The cornerstone of this program will be single
crystal X-ray diffractometer, automated with a PC/AT compatible computer driven
by software written by the project director. This ILI award from the Chemistry
Shared Instrumentation Program will help the Department to acquire X-ray and
computer instrumentation that will be used to enhance undergraduate laboratory
instruction and aid in chemistry curriculum development.
