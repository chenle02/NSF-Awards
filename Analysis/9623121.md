ABSTRACT Proposal: DMS- 9623121 PI: Gesztesy Gesztesy proposes to study two
related areas in differential equations pertaining to inverse spectral theory
and meromorphic solutions of systems of ordinary differential equations related
to integrable evolution equations. The first area is connected to inverse
spectral theory and the characterization of isospectral sets of potential
coefficients for the Schrodinger equation and representations of solutions of
integrable systems such as the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation. Building upon
recently developed trace formulas for (multi-dimensional) Schrodinger operators
in terms of appropriate Krein spectral shift functions and a general device for
constructing isospectral potential coefficients, he intends to continue recent
work on the inverse spectral problem for confining potentials and inverse
spectral theory for short-range interactions. In connection with the second
area, he proposes a strategy to solve the problem of characterizing all elliptic
algebro-geometric finite-gap solutions of general matrix hierarchies of
completely integrable evolution equations. In particular, Gesztesy proposes to
continue work which recently led to a solution of this characterization problem
for the KdV hierarchy on the basis of a newly developed approach centered around
a theorem of Picard. Inverse spectral theory has significant applications in
atomic, molecular, and nuclear physics and in areas as wide-ranging as computer
tomography, acoustics, electromagnetics, resolution of structural/material
properties of media, and aviation technology. Similarly, completely integrable
equations play a vital role in nonlinear optics and especially in soliton-based
optical communications systems. Gesztesy' work can be expected to have an impact
on these areas.
