This award provides renewed funding for the Consortium for Undergraduate
Research Experiences (CURE), which is a collaboration between six Los Angeles-
area community colleges and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Fifty-five
percent of all California State University students, and nearly one third of all
University of California students, start their careers in community colleges,
and yet these students may never have access to top-notch research and mentoring
opportunities while at their local colleges. CURE's mission is to provide these
students -- especially females, underrepresented minorities, non-traditional
students -- this cutting-edge access. Students will be paired with JPL
scientists to conduct research at both JPL and its Table Mountain Observatory.
They will perform detailed research into a variety of topics, including space
physics instrumentation, observations and analysis of asteroids, and
spectroscopy of minerals likely to be found on Mars. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By
offering high-quality research experiences and dedicated mentoring to students
in partnership with one of the world's most prolific space science institutions,
CURE aims to propel its participants to transfer successfully to four-year
universities and advanced degree programs and careers in STEM fields. Its
previous award (AST-1156756) is an exemplar of success: many students have
published their research, and almost all have transferred to four-year
universities. This new award will enable CURE to place a renewed focus on
boosting the numbers of females and African American in the program, which will
expand STEM training opportunities to these groups.
