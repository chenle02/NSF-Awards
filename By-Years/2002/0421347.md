As scientific data becomes larger and more complex, the problem of presenting
data effectively is joined by another, potentially more difficult one - how to
extract presentable data from the flood of raw information. This problem is
equally difficult for results from large simulations and data from high-
resolution instruments. Thus, the field of scientific visualization becomes
intimately tied to more traditional studies of data analysis, including image
processing, pattern recognition, artificial intelligence, and computer vision.
However, in contrast to those fields, visualization explicitly includes the user
in the process of filtering, extracting, and rendering meaningful data. The goal
of this project is to make level-set modeling - a useful but computationally
expensive visualization technique - interactive for use in 3-D visualization of
biological data sets.

Technically, the project has three components. The first is the design and
implementation of a hardware and software system for interactive level-set
surface model computation and display. This system will use off-the-shelf PC
hardware and graphics boards and new algorithms and software to reach its
interactivity goals. The second component will create the human-computer
interface that allows users to interact with the level-set models. This will
require mapping user input onto the mathematical descriptions controlling
surface motion and deformation in the models. Finally, the third component will
be the application of the techniques to visualize large biological data sets by
researchers in this project.

This is a collaborative project between California Institute of Technology and
the University of Utah.
