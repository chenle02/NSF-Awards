This project will utilize a T7 expression vector for the production of anti-
dansyl VH protein in E. coli. The VH proteins associated with two anti-dansyl
hybridomas have been purified from bacterial extracts and recombined with
homologous light chains to yield fully active VH-L products. These VH genes will
be subjected to site-directed mutagenesis with single or paired primers to
provide mutated VH proteins with replacements in the hypervariable regions. The
mutant VH proteins will be recombined with L chains and the purified products
characterized with respect to affinity by resonance energy transfer, a method
established in this laboratory. In addition, the CDR3 segments of high affinity
and low affinity VDJ genes will be interchanged to evaluate the role of CDR3 in
specific reactivity, particularly with germ-line (IgM) antibodies. The goal of
this research is development of a general method to manipulate the affinity of
monoclonal antibodies for their ligands using techniques of genetic engineering.
If this project succeeds the method will have many practical as well as basic,
scientific applications.
