Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and related processes have been developed as a
means of producing synthetic diamond at relatively low temperatures and
pressures. However, in spite of recent progress, CVD diamond is less than
satisfactory because the deposits are polycrystalline in form with grains of
varying sizes and orientations. Ion implantation of diamond and polycrystalline
diamond (an alternative technique) creates substantial radiation damage,
amorphization, and ultimately graphitization. The ion bombarded layers created
on diamond substrates are substantially softer than the bulk materials, and are
therefore much easier to polish. This project will provide a proof-of-principle
study, demonstrating a process for polishing polycrystalline diamond which
consists of ion implantation followed by mechanical polishing. Optical quality
finishes significantly better than those which can be obtained from mechanical
polishing alone are produced by such sequential implantation and polishing; it
is anticipated that this process will significantly simplify the polishing of
polycrystalline diamond.
