IBN-9604729 Brandt Calcium plays an integral role in regulating cellular
function. It exerts its effects in the cell through interactions with a variety
of specialized proteins. One of these proteins is the plasma membrane (PM)
calcium pump. PM calcium pumps remove calcium from the cell, while consuming ATP
to drive the reaction. It has recently been found that genetic manipulation to
block production of one type of PM calcium pumps in a neuronal cell line
prevented this cell from developing into a mature nerve cell when treated with
nerve growth factor. This observation suggested that PM calcium pumps may be
important in nerve cell development and regeneration. Further, it was found that
a class of steroids known as glucocorticoids, which have been known to prevent
the type of neurons used in these studies from developing into mature nerve
cells, had a greatly enhanced effect when PM calcium pump production was
blocked. From these two observations it was hypothesized that PM calcium pumps
might be involved in controlling calcium levels in the cell responsible for
determining how effective glucocorticoids are in preventing neuronal
development. The studies to be undertaken as part of this research project will
first examine changes in internal calcium levels that might be affecting the
efficiency of glucocorticoid action by interacting with another calcium-
regulated protein called calreticulin. If changes in internal calcium levels are
found, then the underlying alteration in biochemical properties will be
determined by studying possible changes in proteins that regulate calcium levels
in the cell, among these proteins will be the PM calcium pumps. The ultimate
goal of this research program will be to better understand the mechanisms of
calcium regulation that affect nerve cell development and regeneration.
