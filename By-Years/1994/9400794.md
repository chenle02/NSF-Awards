Professor Todorov will work on the geometry and topology of Calabi-Yau manifolds
and K3 surfaces. In particular he wants to work on the Teichmuller theory and
the analytic discriminant of Calabi-Yau manifolds. He also wants to study the
Krotweg de Vries equation. This is research in the field of algebraic geometry,
yet it directly connects to two of the great advances in theoretical physics in
this century--quantum mechanics and general relativity. Algebraic geometry
itself is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a
revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origin, it treated
figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely
polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only from algebra, but
from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding application in those
fields as well as in physics, theoretical computer science, and robotics.
