0339984&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
project explores the feasibility of developing &lt;br/&gt;software architecture
for backward integration of the knowledge supply chain in the
&lt;br/&gt;manufacturing industry. It is well known that the decisions made
during early stage in &lt;br/&gt;design affect a significant portion of the
products total cost. The research objectives are to (1) Develop prototype
architecture of a tool that includes process configuration with part and tooling
for casting initially. (2) Include a geometric analysis of the artifact . Show
features in geometry that concern the process and tooling through a generic
rules engine that can be used to interface with the geometry. (3) Integrate a
hybrid cost analysis approach that can be used dynamically with the design to
&lt;br/&gt;come up with a method that can allow concurrent cost analysis with
what if scenarios. (4) Eventually this tool will be generalized in phase II so
that is extendable across verticals in manufacturing using a rapid application
development (RAD) methodology.
