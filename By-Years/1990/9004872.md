An eighteen month study of taphonomic and sedimentologic processes in a modern
marine carbonate environment will be conducted. PIs will assess the biologic and
physical and sedimentologic characteristics of six diverse environments in
Graham's Harbor, Bahamas. The objectives of the study are (1) to contrast and
compare rates of taphonomic loss from a variety of carbonate environments within
Graham's Harbor with those measured rates along the Texas coast--are loss rates
in clastic environments different than those in carbonate environments? Loss
rates in carbonate environments may be less than in clastic environments. If
loss rates are less, then the death assemblage and by analyogy, the fossil
record, might contain more of the original thought. (2) to recognize transported
assemblages on a very fine environmental scale--we will quantify transport
between and within habitat in Graham's Harbor. The techniques developed and
perfected in this study should be transferable to the analysis of fossil
outcrops. (3) size frequency analysis of the living community and death
assemblage--do carbonate death assemblages contain a more accurate
representation of the population dynamics of the living community than in
clastic environments? (4) Taphonomic signatures of the biota from six distinct
environments in Graham's Harbor will be determined and compared with the
sedimentary record. How closely do sedimentologic parameters reflect taphonomic
properties?
