This research is to investigate the factors that control the localization of
moment release at subduction zones. By comparing the positions of maximum moment
release between subduction zones with different characteristics and correlating
them with a variety of subduction zone parameters, information on the physical
processes that influence the localization of moment release will be revealed.
Determination of whether earthquakes of very different magnitudes rupture the
same regions on the plate interface is important in understanding the role that
fault strength plays in the localization of moment release. Since great
earthquakes account for the majority of moment release at subduction zones,
their influence on seismic behavior is essential to understanding the
localization of moment release. This research is a component of the National
Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
