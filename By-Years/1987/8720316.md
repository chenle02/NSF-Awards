Mapping the pattern of convection beneath the plates is central to our
understanding of the mode of heat transfer within the earth, the chemical
differentiation and evolution of the mantle, the viscosity structure of the
mantle, and the forces that drive plate tectonics. Much progress has recently
been made toward directly mapping the pattern through the effects of convection
on seismic velocities. Two types of velocity variations are expected; lateral
heterogeneities related to composition or temperature, and anisotropy caused by
fabric or crystal alignment associated with deformation during flow. The purpose
of the research proposed here is to map velocity structures in the upper mantle
related to convection beneath the plates, with particular emphases on testing
hypotheses of the existence of anisotropy in specific regions and on mapping
small- scale (wavelengths 500 to 3000 km) features using phases that sample the
earth in ways that provide high lateral resolution in otherwise inaccessible
areas.
