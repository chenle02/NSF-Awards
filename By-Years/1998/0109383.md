0109383&lt;br/&gt;Srienc&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigator's overall
objective is to study the biosynthesis of novel types of polyhydroxyalkanoic
acids (PHA), which are spatially structured and, therefore, confer specific
physical properties to this material. The microstructure will be achieved by
periodic alteration of the nutrients supplied to the microorganisms that are
capable of PHA synthesis. The different nutrients result in the formation of
different precursors for the polymerization reaction and lead to the controlled
deposition of homo- and copolymer in spherical granules with architecture
structured at the nanometer length scale. Furthermore, the nutrient switching
strategy can be designed to generate structure at the individual polymer chain
level resulting in block-copolymers that can self-assemble into specific
morphologies that could have useful physical properties. This biosynthesis
approach will be further developed to generate specific diblock- and tailback-
copolymers and their physical properties will be evaluated. In addition to the
synthesis of such PHAs with improved value, the biosynthesis of this material
will be investigated in the context of anaerobic metabolism of the yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae extending preliminary studies that demonstrate that
anaerobic biosynthesis of PHAs is possible. The combined effort of producing
'smarter' materials of higher value together with metabolic engineering
manipulations of the organisms for more efficient production processes could
have significant impact on the technology of biodegradable plastics.&lt;br/&gt;
