This award supports participation in the 2018 Algorithmic Number Theory
Symposium (ANTS XIII) held in Madison, Wisconsin on July 16 - 20, 2018. The
meeting is part of a biannual research conference series that specializes in
problems related to computations on numbers and algorithms that answer questions
about numbers. Two examples of such problems are (1) given a number, determine
if it is prime or composite and (2) given a composite number, determine its
prime factorization. Techniques for solving such problems are the foundation of
internet security and digital commerce. Approximately 130 mathematicians
participate in each meeting. The research presented will be compiled into a
proceedings volume of peer-reviewed papers. For more information, visit
http://www.math.grinnell.edu/~paulhusj/ants2018/.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
Algorithmic Number Theory Symposium is a leading scientific venue for
dissemination and catalysis of novel research in the fields of algorithmic and
computational number theory. The meeting is devoted to algorithmic aspects of
number theory, including elementary number theory, algebraic number theory,
analytic number theory, geometry of numbers, arithmetic algebraic geometry,
finite fields, and cryptography. Speakers submit papers that are peer-reviewed,
selected through a competitive process, and subsequently compiled into a
proceedings volume. Funding is available for graduate students and other early-
career mathematicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
