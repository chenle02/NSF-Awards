Alabama A &amp; M University, a historically black land grant university,
through a systematic and progressive effort has developed a comprehensive
research and training program in plant biology. This effort was recently
recognized by the State granting it approval to offer a Ph.D. program in Plant
and Soil Science. This is the only doctoral program of its kind among
historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). This proposal outlines
five individual research that are currently underway involving six primary users
and numerous research staff scientists, graduate and undergraduate students. The
culture and their cytogenetic evaluation in Triticeae (wheat, barley, rye,
triticale), Pinus (Southern pines) and Cossypium species. These efforts will
utilize the confocal, inverted and stereomicroscopes, cryogenic apparatus and
bioreactor requested. Plant transformation research will strengthen by the
nucleic acid sequencer and synthesizer, laser densitometer, and gel analyzers.
Investigations and manipulation of cold hardiness is a topic that exemplifies
ongoing phytohormone and plant growth regulation studies in the program.
Availability of liquid chromatograph (with diode array HPLC and ion
chromatography) and liquid scintillation counters for labeled hormones and
substances will aid in strengthening this research.
