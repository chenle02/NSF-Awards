The university is developing a set of new laboratory exercises for its basic
astronomy courses, which introduce students to modern telescope automation and
data acquisition techniques, and upgrading and modernizing its telescope.
Included in the up- grade is a new mechanical guiding system and a Cassegrain
secondary. The modernization involves automating the drive system and
introducing digital optics, such as a CCD and digital spectrograph. These
improvements can increase the interest that minority students have in astronomy
and in science in general.
