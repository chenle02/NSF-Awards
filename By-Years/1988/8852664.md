The department is seeking to improve the sophomore and junior level chemistry
laboratories. The development and implementation of modern experiments into the
quantitative analysis laboratory is of immediate concern. To effectively grasp
new methods and techniques used in the industry's increasingly computerized
laboratories, it is necessary for the student to have "hands on" experience with
computer-controlled instrumentation. Specifically a scanning uv-visible
spectrophotometer and a fluorescence spectrophotometer, both interfaced to
computers, are being added to expand the current level of experiments and data
handling capabilities. In addition, an introduction to the interfacing of simple
equipment such as pH meters and temperature probing devices is available to the
student as a result of the computer's versatility. The grantee is matching the
award from non-Federal sources.
