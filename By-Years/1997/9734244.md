The objective of this integrated education and research plan is to augment
damping in large civil structures applications, via both passive and active
means, to reduce structural response. The proposed research program will
develop, analyze and experimentally demonstrate passive, semi-active, and active
structural damping control for civil structures using smart materials and
structures technology. The research builds on the ongoing research efforts at
Maryland on stability augmentation, shock, and vibration control using
electrorheological (ER) and magnetorheological (MR) dampers. Damping strategies
will be tested on dynamically scaled three story civil structures building model
currently under development.
