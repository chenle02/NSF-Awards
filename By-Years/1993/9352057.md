The ILI request results from a two and one-half year MVCC Physical Science
Department "pilot program". This program involves the laboratory development and
testing of microcomputer-based applications to improve the physics laboratory
experience and further enhance the students' critical thinking skills. Our
objectives are to: (1) modernize performance of certain traditional experiments,
(2) provide a platform for Introducing certain cognitive based learning
experiences, (3) stimulate learning and creative thinking by the use of
numerical based open-ended simulation exercises, and (4) expose students to
emerging physics based technologies important to their curricula. Our objectives
are being accomplished by the creation of a "state of the art" fully networked
Macintosh based physics lab. Eight (8) workstations have been set up in the
physics laboratory and are being used to accomplish our objectives. New
laboratories and instructional techniques are being developed to integrate the
latest in Engineering Physics, General Physics, Descriptive Astronomy, and
Photographic Science technologies. Our long range goal is to develop a multi-
disciplinary course structure to meet the emerging demands of our four-year
transfer institutions.
