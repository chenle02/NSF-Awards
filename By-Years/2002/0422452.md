This project enhances needy students opportunity to complete a degree in a
technical major. The scholarships are administered by the Mathematics,
Engineering, Science Achievement (MESA) Engineering Program (MEP), whose major
objectives are to recruit, retain and graduate educationally disadvantaged
students pursuing technical majors. The students selected for a scholarship are
expected to progress in their chosen technical discipline and are required to
meet with their faculty advisor and counselor in the MEP Program to discuss
progress, academic advising, and other retention efforts administered by the
office.
