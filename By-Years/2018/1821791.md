ACM MobiSys is part of a series of annual conferences sponsored by ACM
SIGMOBILE. The research and development results reported in MobiSys conferences
span multiple disciplines, including wireless networks and communication, mobile
sensing and crowd sourcing applications, wearable computing, vehicular and
robotic wireless systems, operating systems, distributed algorithms, data
management, energy management, sensors, security and privacy. MobiSys seeks to
provide a cross-disciplinary venue for researchers addressing the design of
mobile computing in the context of an integrated system. In addition to the
regular conference program, MobiSys 2018 will include a set of technical
workshops, research demonstrations, and a poster
session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funds to support US-based
graduate students to attend ACM MobiSys 2018 to be held in Munich, Germany, on
June 10 - 15, 2018. The travel grant will enable meritorious students to take
advantage of this gathering and interact with the top researchers in the field
of mobile systems. Through conference participation, students will be able to
identify and/or sharpen their career goals during discussions with experts in
the field and also with their peers. While selecting award recipients, the award
selection committee will emphasize participation of under-represented groups
(women and minorities) and first time attendees with no accepted papers at the
conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
