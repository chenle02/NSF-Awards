An on-going national debate about our schools is taking place at a time of
increasing concern, both about the education of minority children and about
dramatic changes in workplace driven by changing technology and altered
competitive conditions. In this broader context, state and especially local
efforts at reforming the public school system are very important topics of
study. This is especially true with the increased involvement of corporations in
the leadership of many current reform efforts. These efforts, however, are
marked by a diversity of interests among the major players now involved:
teachers, large as well as small business leaders, parents of majority and
minority group children, and unions. This research, already underway, is being
conducted in Charlotte, N.C., an excellent site. The work of a Chamber of
Commerce initiated Task Force on Education and Employment has been the object of
field work by the PIs since its inception in 1988. The proposed research
includes completion of both observational and interview data at the local level
and a comparative assessment of national business-led school reform efforts. The
PIs bring a rich combination of practical experience and strong graduate
training to this work.
