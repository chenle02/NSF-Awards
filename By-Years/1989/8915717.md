The objective of this conference, the first of broad interest in the field of
nonlinear optics, is to provide an international forum for presentation and
discussion of new and original research in this field. The emphasis will be on
new fundamental or applied scientific discoveries in theory and on experiments
on materials, processes, and devices. This conference will bring together the
physicists, engineers, material scientists, and chemists that make up this
multidisciplinary research area. It is also intended to be international in
scope, with a selected group of eminent scientists from various representative
regions of the world.
