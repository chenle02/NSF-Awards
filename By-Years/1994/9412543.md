The goal of this study is to understand the relationships between motivated
behaviors, such as feeding, drinking, aggression and sexual behaviors, and the
chemistry of the brain. Neurotransmitters are chemicals released by nerve cells
to communicate with other nerve cells. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter thought to
be involved in motivation and reward. In this study the relationships between
changes in levels of dopamine and the expression of the motivational components
of sexual behavior in female hamsters will be examined. Dopamine will be sampled
from specific parts of the brain to determine which attributes of the male
effectively contribute to the rise in dopamine levels, what effects prior sexual
experience have on the response to the male, and whether conditioned stimuli
associated with sexual behavior will induce a rise in dopamine. Studies will be
also be done to identify the nerve cells in the brain that release this
dopamine. The results of this study will contribute to our understanding of the
role of dopamine in sexual behavior. The results of the study could also have
important implications for our understanding of drug abuse, since several types
of additive drugs have dopamine-like action on brain cells.
