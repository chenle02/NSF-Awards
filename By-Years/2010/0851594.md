This award supports the renewal of the Stony Brook Research Experience for
Undergraduates in Physics program which brings undergraduate students to the
Stony Brook campus each summer for participation in an eight-week program of
forefront research in the laboratories of Stony Brook physics and astronomy
faculty members. The program offers research opportunities in the areas of
astronomy and planetary sciences, atmospheric physics, high-energy particle
physics, instructional laboratory instrumentation, lasers and optics, nuclear
physics and solid-state/condensed matter physics. Most projects are experimental
but a few are theoretical. The immediate aim of the program is to provide
training in, encourage interest in, and appreciation of, scientific research in
physics and to facilitate career planning by the actual doing of research in a
collegial setting, by site visits to research laboratories at Stony Brook and
Brookhaven National Laboratory, by weekly seminars on current topics in physics
and astronomy, and finally by presentations of student research results in a
formal symposium and a written report at the conclusion of the program.
Outstanding projects are submitted for presentation at other student research
symposia.
