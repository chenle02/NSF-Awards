This project will make use of the energetic neutral atom (ENA) images from the
NASA IMAGE spacecraft to investigate the global plasma pressure distributions
(both H+ and O+) in the magnetosphere during geomagnetic storms. Additional data
from the AMPTE/CCE spacecraft will be used to validate the pressure and specify
the pressure anisotropies. Other data sources that will be utilized include the
Cluster spacecraft, GOES magnetometer data, LANL, Geotail and Polar particle
data. The project will utilize the data to investigate how storm-time substorm
injections effect the storm-time ring current. A magnetic index equivalent to
the commonly used Dst index will be computed from the ENA data and this will be
used to determine the importance of substorm injections to the energy balance in
the ring current during magnetic storms. The ion pressure distributions computed
for the different storms studied will be made available to the general space
physics community and can be used to compare observations with model results.
