graduate students has been pursuing a diverse program of research in particle
physics. Its members, together with collaborators at other institutions, are
completing analysis of Charm particle photo-production data obtained in 1990-
1991 at the Fermilab Tevatron and is searching for exotic particles, glueballs
and others, among data produced in an experiment at the Brookhaven National
