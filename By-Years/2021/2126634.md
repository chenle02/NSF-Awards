While modern developments in large-scale sensing and imaging modalities bring
great premise in discovering novel scientific phenomena and improving the
quality-of-life, making sense of the sensed data in an efficient and accurate
manner require transformative designs of scalable and effective optimization
methods for solving inverse problems that go beyond classical linear models.
There is a significant need to advance the theory, algorithms, and applications
of nonlinear inverse problems, where the collected data exhibit a nonlinear
relationship with respect to the unknowns being sought after. Focused on taming
nonlinear inverse problems, this project will be tightly integrated with
education, outreach and dissemination activities including mentoring both
graduate and undergraduate students with diverse backgrounds, developing courses
and monographs on nonlinear inverse problems in data science, and organizing
special sessions at suitable conference venues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
intellectual goal of this project is to develop theoretical and algorithmic
foundations for solving nonlinear inverse problems, including the design and
analysis of efficient algorithms with provable guarantees, characterization of
fundamental trade-offs between resources (sample, computational and memory
complexities, signal-to-noise ratio, etc.) and performance (statistical error
rates, resolution, etc.), and validations on real data whenever applicable. The
project seeks to leverage the diversity of multiple measurements and the
invariance of data representation in the algorithm designs to minimize
complexity and improve performance. The tools and techniques developed in this
project will lead to further cross fertilization among the fields of signal
processing, inverse problems, optimization theory, and machine
learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
