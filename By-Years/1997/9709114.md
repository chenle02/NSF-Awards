9709114 Gregory The history of Andean uplift is highly pertinent to climatic
studies. The Andes forms the only major barrier to zonal atmospheric circulation
in the Southern Hemisphere. They extend throughout the tropics, a sensitive zone
where small changes in climate impact on a global scale. As of now, the
development of Andean elevation is poorly constrained. Under the previous
proposal "Uplift History of the Bolivian Andes" to which this is a renewal, the
14-20.8 Ma Potosi and 10.35 ( 0.06 Ma Jakokkota floras from the Altiplano were
estimated to have paleo mean annual temperatures (MATs) of 24.8 and 21.3 (C,
respectively, using foliar physiognomic analysis of Wolfe (1993, 1995). The
similarity of these estimates suggests that uplift occurred before the first
flora was deposited and after 10 Ma, but not between the two floras. The
objective of this study is to constrain the absolute paleoelevation at 10 Ma by
estimating the paleoclimate and paleoelevation of two newly discovered floras
from Bolivia: the 8-10 Ma Yecua flora, which grew near sea level in eastern
Bolivia, and the 10.35 Ma Calunchullpa flora from the Altiplano. Analysis of the
Yecua flora will constrain the sea-level paleoclimate at 8-10 Ma. Using MAT and
enthalpy-based paleoaltimeters, the Yecua paleoclimate can be compared to that
of the previously studied Jakokkota flora and the new Calunchullpa flora to
derive absolute paleoelevations for the Altiplano sites. To improve the
paleoclimate estimates, modern analogous vegetation will be collected from
eastern Bolivia for addition to the database of Wolfe (1995). This study fits
the objectives of Earth Systems History because it will provide 1) well-dated,
quantitative, terrestrial paleoclimate proxy data which can be used to evaluate
the results of general circulation models, 2) topographic and vegetation
boundary conditions for general circulation models, and 3) an improved
calibration between leaf physiognomy and climate, which will increase the
accuracy of the foliar physiognomic climate proxy.
