Sensor networks are ideal candidates for a wide range of applications such as
critical infrastructure protection. It is necessary to guarantee the
trustworthiness and resilience of sensor networks as well as the sensing
applications, especially when the failure of these applications may result in
catastrophic events with impacts affecting safety, security, the economy and
society at large. The objective of this project is to develop practical
techniques for building trustworthy and resilient sensor networks as well as
instructional materials that facilitate the education of these techniques. The
research activities are focused on practical broadcast authentication,
trustworthy and resilient clock synchronization, and light-weight and
collaborative intrusion detection in sensor networks. To handle the unique
challenges (e.g., resource constraints, threat of node compromises) in sensor
network security, this project seeks effective integration of cryptographic
