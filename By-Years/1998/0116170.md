With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Saginaw Valley State University will acquire a liquid
chromatograph with mass spectrometric detection. The research to be carried out
using this instrument will define and follow the health of the Saginaw Bay
Watershed in response to an EPA Superfund cleanup of a toxic waste site on the
Pine River. The scientific objectives to be addressed include a) measurement of
toxics in the sediment and water column; b) bioaccumulation of pollutants; c)
impact of the pollutants on genetic diversity; d) methods for remediation; and
e) methods for characterization of types of microorganisms. Students from this
primarily undergraduate institution will be heavily involved in the research
effort. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric
detection (LC-MS) is an extremely powerful technique used for the separation and
analysis of complex mixtures. This instrument will substantially strengthen
scientific research within the Earth Sciences discipline at Saginaw Valley State
University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
