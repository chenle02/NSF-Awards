This research involves a study of seismic sequences in basins in the
Northwestern Australian Margin and in the East Coast of the United States, areas
which have contrasting rifting histories. The study will evaluate Vail's Sea
Level fluctuation curve which is the present standard and has been used by many
earlier investigators for evaluation and comparison of global seismic sequences.
This study will apply this curve to a unique data set of two contrasting areas
to which this curve has not previously been applied. Vail's curve was defined on
the basis of an Exxon Corporation stratigraphic data base, most of which is
proprietary in nature and not available to other scientists for scrutiny. The
proposed independent verification of the Vail curve is long overdue and will
have a substantial impact on future research concerning the seismic stratigraphy
of continental margins and the use of models to understand development of
seismic sequences.
