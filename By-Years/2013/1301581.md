The Carolina Dynamics Symposium will run in early April 2013; itis a two day
conference that has rotated among colleges and universities in North and South
Carolina for the past 10 years. The 2013 conference will be hosted by the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a special emphasis in symbolic
dynamics and coding theory, a branch of mathematics with many applications. Each
year a few speakers from outside the region will be invited to give plenary
talks on the theme chosen for the year by the host institution, and regional
speakers will also address a broad spectrum of topics in areas of dynamical
systems, pure and applied. The meetings are aimed to attract prominent
mathematical scientists in the region, as well as graduate students and junior
faculty from higher educational institutions in the Carolinas.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A primary purpose of the Carolina Dynamics
Symposium is to allow mathematicians in the broad field of dynamical systems, at
all career stages and types of institutions, to come together for several days
to strengthen professional relationships and interactions. We plan to build on a
successful format by enlarging participation to include several outside experts
while maintaining the open invitation to participate fully to the regional
mathematicians. From its inception participants and speakers in the Carolina
Dynamics meetings have included graduate students, junior and senior faculty, as
well as undergraduates. The organizers invite and advertise to a demographically
diverse group, and often half the speakers are women. The meetings are designed
to strengthen and invigorate the dynamics community in the southeast. By working
together its members can achieve more than by working alone; many fruitful
collaborations have resulted from past meetings and we expect the activity to
increase with this grant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.devio.us/~ppunosevac/c
