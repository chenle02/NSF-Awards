This is a Small Business Innovative Research Phase II award to research and
develop a decision support software tool utilizing the theory of perturbation
analysis (PA) and its extensions for the design and simulation of discrete parts
manufacturing systems. In particular, it is expected that the tool will have the
following features: It can be adapted to any existing discrete event simulation
languages to enhance their outputs with additional performance sensitivity
information without the need for brute force repeated simulations. It will be
data driven and transparent to the user. It will be applicable to a sufficiently
general class of manufacturing systems. It can also be integrated with existing
queueing network models of such systems wherever appropriate to avoid
duplication of data entry. This proposal demonstrates that the PA theory and its
extensions to multiclass situations will make the above objectives attainable.
