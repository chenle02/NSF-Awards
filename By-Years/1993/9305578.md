The investigator intends developing his recent generalization of the
Duistermaat-Heckman formula which is an integral formula for the exponential of
the square of the moment map on symplectic manifolds. The generalization is to
the case of non-abelian groups. Using the method of stationary phase,
applications of this formula to quantum field theory are envisaged.
