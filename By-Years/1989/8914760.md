This project will support the dissertation research of an anthropology graduate
student from Brown University in the Basque region of Spain. The project will
study the causes of ethnic conflict by trying to separate the effects of
economic from political competition in local communities. Methods include
archival and survey research as well as participant observation and in-depth
interviewing. This research is important because ethnic conflict is prevalent in
many societies in the world. Understanding the causes of such conflict in one
case study adds to our comparative literature and helps build theory to explain,
and potentially decrease such violence in other situations in the future.
