This is a proposal to hold a workshop involving about a dozen leading
researchers from academia and industry to discuss: 1. The type of part
description for use in SFF definition; 2. the nature of design tools to support
SFF fabrication; and, 3. the formats for data interchange in solid free-form
fabrication.
