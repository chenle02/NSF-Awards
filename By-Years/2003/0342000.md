This project seeks to initiate collaborative relationships among engineering and
educational faculty at Virginia Tech. The goals are to develop a new degree
program in education to enable engineering graduates to earn a master's degree
while also qualifying for licensure as technology teachers in the Commonwealth
of Virginia, to strengthen pedagogy in freshman engineering courses, and to
initiate a collaborative aligning the university's activities with those of
corporate stakeholders, K-12 educators, and policy makers to strengthen the
infusion of engineering content in K-12 programs in Virginia schools.
