Much of animal development involves the growth and patterning of cell layers
called epithelia. Normal epithelial development requires that epithelial cells
are able to sense where they are within the layer and can orient, or polarize,
themselves correctly in response to this information. How genetic signals
control epithelial cell polarization has been most effectively addressed using
the fruit fly Drosophila as a model organism. To date, however, studies in
Drosophila have only addressed how cells are polarized in a single direction or
along one axis of the epithelium. Recent work using Drosophila in Dr Collier's
lab has begun to identify genetic mechanisms that polarize cells along both
epithelial axes. This research project will further characterize these
mechanisms resulting in a more complete understanding of normal epithelial
development. Dr Collier's research lab is in Marshall University, the second
largest state institution for higher learning in West Virginia. A large majority
of Marshall students are first generation students from Appalachia, a region
with considerable educational challenges. Dr Collier's lab has a strong history
of providing opportunities for undergraduate, graduate and K-12 students to
participate in genetics research. This activity will continue to develop
throughout the course of this research project.
