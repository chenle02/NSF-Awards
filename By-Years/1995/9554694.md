The goals of this project are to present faculty members with an integrated
methodology for teaching undergraduate control theory and its application to a
wide variety of mechatronic systems. The program combines the insight and
understanding of classical control (frequency domain) theory with the
computational power of modern control (time domain) theory. Often, the tools of
these two domains are taught in separate sections of a course, or in separate
courses. This need not be the case, as is demonstrated in our undergraduate and
graduate courses at Georgia institute of Technology. The GA Tech classroom
approach will be integrated into the mechatronics laboratory curriculum
developed at RPI to provide the students with the ability to realize their
control designs on inexpensive controllers. Through this course we will provide
faculty with the means to educate students such that they will develop an
excellent intuitive understanding of control theory, a firm grasp on powerful
computational tools currently available, and the ability to physically implement
these systems. The integration of theory, computer tools and laboratory
experiences will yield an educational opportunity for the students that far
exceeds any standard classroom experience currently taught.
