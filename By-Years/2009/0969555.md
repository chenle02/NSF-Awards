This three-year award provides support for an ongoing program of research at the
University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) in experimental high energy physics
(HEP). The program is centered on the DØ experiment currently running at the
Fermilab Tevatron and on the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. The UIC group consists of
four faculty, four postdoctoral research associates, and seven graduate
students. For the period covered in this award, the UIC program will include
continued involvement in the DØ physics program, concentrating on Tevatron
"legacy" measurements using the entire Run II dataset; participation in the
operation and commissioning of the CMS Silicon Tracker and High Level Trigger;
continuing ongoing object identification and calibration activities at CMS, and
build on UIC areas of expertise and focus on studies of QCD, associated
production of W and Z bosons with jets and b-jets, and top quark
physics.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposed activities are multiple
and diverse. The challenges faced in successfully building and commissioning
complicated trigger and silicon systems enhance the disciplinary knowledge in
engineering fields. The physics analyses and hardware projects provide valuable
experience and knowledge for UIC HEP students and postdocs, enabling them to
pursue successful careers in academia or private sectors. The mature QuarkNet
and CLASA (Chicago Large Area Shower Array) outreach activities of the UIC HEP
group fosters collaboration between high school teachers and students and UIC
HEP group members, strengthening teaching and learning in Chicago-area high
schools. As Chicago high schools serve predominantly minority students, this
project may lead to a larger number of minority students majoring in a science
discipline.
