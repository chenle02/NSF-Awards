A modular system for ocean data assimilation has recently been developed. It has
already been implemented in an unsophisticated way, with a variety of models of
the ocean and the coupled ocean-atmosphere. This project will enhance the system
using Information Technology, including modern software engineering concepts,
new visualization techniques and interactive web-based training. Together with
effective outreach and advanced optimization algorithms, these elements of IT
will be linked through the modular system to a wide range of coastal, basin-
scale and global ocean models. Variational data assimilation is also coming into
use in operational weather forecasting and ocean forecasting, in ocean
biogeochemistry, in groundwater hydrology and in solid-earth geophysics. The new
modular system will thus be of immediate benefit throughout the geosciences. The
team includes 14 physical oceanographers, civil engineers and computer
scientists in six universities, a national laboratory, and private industry. The
project is funded under the Information Technology Research Initiative
