The proposal deals with models and experiments to study microporosity in
casting. The goal is to understand how microstructure formation is influenced by
microporosity growth and convective flow of an alloy liquid phase. Three
distinct tasks have been laid out. The first is to use a phase field method to
simulate the interaction among dendritic growth, microporosity formation and
melt flow. These results will be coupled into a macroscopic model for predicting
microporosity nucleation, growth, agglomeration, and migration. Finally,
experiments will be conducted at Oak Ridge National Laboratory to provide data
for validation of the predictions. If successful, the research will contribute
to the fundamental understanding of microporosity formation. The computer codes
to be developed could be used by commercial casting code developers to improve
the modeling capability with respect to this important element of solidification
processing. The present award will concentrate on the microscale modeling of
microporosity formation and on developing the methodology for coupling this
model with a macroscopic model. Planning for validation experiments will also be
carried out, in anticipation of a future extensive collaboration with ORNL.
