This project is developing ScienceTutor, a new on-line tutoring model designed
to improve student performance in gateway science courses. ScienceTutor offers
urban commuter students access to much-needed tutoring support around the clock.
The college is developing ScienceTutor resources for three gateway courses in
biology, mathematics, and computer science. ScienceTutor includes interactive,
graphics-oriented content, including summaries of key concepts, overviews, and
solutions to problems, ScienceFAQ, answers to questions often asked by students,
TutorTips, advice on how to handle assignments, and e-mail your tutor, real-time
chat rooms where students can discuss issues. ScienceTutor differs from
conventional distance learning in that it is designed to be used by students
outside of class, it responds to students most pressing learning issues, and
revised so that it truly serves the needs of users. Formative evaluation of the
two-year project employs expert reviewers from Brooklyn College faculty
knowledgeable in website design, student responses to questionnaires, focus
groups, and field tests. Summative evaluation examines whether students
continually choose to use ScienceTutor and whether it supports their
performance. College support for the project includes the work of its three
directors, experts in collaborative learning and computer science, who work with
science faculty designing and perfecting the on-line program so that it serves
students. Dissemination is taking place on the web and through presentations at
conferences devoted to technology and science education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
