The College of the Holy Cross is supported to continue a Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) SITE. The purpose of this SITE is to provide meaningful
hands-on research opportunities in contemporary chemistry for outstanding
undergraduate students under the supervision of experienced research chemists.
For summer of 1988, the program will support 9-10 students recruited from Holy
Cross and other institutions. Research activities will include studies in the
following areas: o Immobilized analytical reagents o Photochemically generated
organometallic transients o Solid polymers o Metalloproteins o Organic synthesis
and photochemistry o Metal ion complexes of organic compounds
