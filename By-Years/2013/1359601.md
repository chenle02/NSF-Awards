A safe and productive society increasingly depends on a safe and trustworthy
cyberspace. However, extensive research has repeatedly shown that the human
factor is often the weakest part in cyberspace, and that users of information
systems are often exposed to great risks when they respond to credible-looking
emails. Thus, spear phishing attacks - which attempt to get personal or
confidential information from users through well-targeted deceptive emails -
represent a particularly severe security threat.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Addressing this threat, in this project we use a
combination of surveys and experiments to examine the psychological, educational
and cultural factors that contribute to the users' vulnerability and response to
spear phishing attacks, and their ability to detect deception. An important
aspect of the project is an in vivo, multi-site setting: studies are conducted
in university and commercial enterprise setting, as well as across different
cultures - in all cases using realistic spear phishing email attacks. Using a
three-dimensional experimental design, in this cross-disciplinary research
project we (i) identify the underlying factors for the success of different
spear phishing attack strategies; (ii) develop novel types of cyber-defenses
that are tailored to users' idiosyncratic characteristics; (iii) validate the
usefulness of personality-targeted defense in a comparative, multi-
organizational, real-world settings; and (iv) develop a new, collaborative
avenue for cross-disciplinary research of social scientists and computer
scientists.
