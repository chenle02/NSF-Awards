The Consortium for Scientific Computing proposes a Supercomputer Summer
Institute for 20 young researchers to be held in August at the John von Neumann
Center near Princeton New Jersey. Students will be trained in the mechanics of
using the Cyber 205 and ETA-10 vector supercomputers, and will also be exposed
to lectures from distinguished computational researchers. The students will be
expected to optimize their own research codes during the Institute. The
Institute will be organized so that each day provides an opportunity for
lectures and hands-on work sessions using the advanced workstations at the JVNC.
Special disciplinary topics will include computational chemistry, computational
fluid dynamics, molecular modelling, and plasma phyics, with an overall emphasis
on scientific visualization. It is important that student begin familiarization
with the ETA-10 supercomputer. The proposed Institute will accomplish that while
exposing students to the broader world of computational science. An award in the
amount of $30,000 is recommended.
