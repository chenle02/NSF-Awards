This grant permits the continuation of the Technology Leaders Scholarship
Program&lt;br/&gt;at Youngstown State University. The program makes available
$3,125 per year over a four-&lt;br/&gt;year period for up to 29 undergraduate
and graduate students. The relative number of&lt;br/&gt;scholarships to be
distributed at each degree level is approximately 25% A.S., 60% B.S.,
and&lt;br/&gt;15% M.S, although flexibility is built into the program with a
minimum recruitment goal in&lt;br/&gt;each area. The scholarships are disbursed
to students majoring in computer science,&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, and
engineering, with the ratio of disbursement reflecting the relative
population&lt;br/&gt;of students currently in those disciplines. Entering
students are required to have a minimum&lt;br/&gt;ACT score of 23 or be in the
top 20% of their academic class. Continuing students are&lt;br/&gt;required to
maintain at least a 3.0/4.0 GPA. Recruitment efforts are focused on the local
&lt;br/&gt;service area of YSU, with particular emphasis placed on recruitment
of minority populations &lt;br/&gt;and women. Retention of students through
completion of their degree is to be achieved &lt;br/&gt;through careful
selection of candidates, student/student and student/faculty mentoring,
&lt;br/&gt;tracking, career guidance, and selecting programming aimed at keeping
each student &lt;br/&gt;focused and maintaining their interest.
