9618657 Scott Support is provided for Russian and US scientists to discuss their
research on rhenium alloys at the TMS conference in Orlando, FL, in the spring
of 1997. This symposium commemorates the 70th anniversary of the discovery of
rhenium. The last symposium on the metal was held in 1960. The current state of
the science, technology, and application of rhenium alloys is discussed by USSR
scientists and engineers and their counterparts in the U.S. and elsewhere. The
conference has 83 technical papers, in 8 sessions, covering history of the
metal, availability, extraction, recycling, powder processing, sintering, vacuum
melting, physical metallurgy, thermomechanical treatments, near-net shape
manufacturing, and welding. %%% The information developed at the conference is
important to the development of cost-effective processing, application, and
recycling of rhenium alloys. ***
