The principal investigator will study fluid flow in a giant regional metamorphic
hydrothermal system of northern New England, integrating field, mineralogic,
petrologic, geochemical, and isotopic techniques. Data will be interpreted with
a model for fluid-rock interaction that rigorously couples fluid flow with
chemical reaction in porous media. Overall the study will help geologists
understand the role of fluids during the metamorphism of rocks in the Earth's
crust.
