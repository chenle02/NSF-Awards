9601619 Es-Said This Academic Research Infrastructure Award (ARI) provides
partial funding for an x-ray diffraction system that will be used to conduct
research on controlling the mechanical anisotropy of sheet metal. In particular
the effect of varying the amounts of cold rolling on the crystallographic
texture in aluminum lithium alloys and rhenium metal will be investigated. These
materials are used in the aerospace and electronics industries. Undergraduate
students will be part of the research effort which is also correlated with
efforts at several specific companies. ***
