The Gaseous Electronics conference is recognized as the principal annual
meeting place for those working in a broad range of atomic physics. It is unique
in that it spans the range from the most basic studies to applications. The
topics discussed include basic processes important to discharges, arcs, and gas
lasers, and will involve physicists, chemists, and engineers.
