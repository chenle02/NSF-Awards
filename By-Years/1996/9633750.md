9633750 Buck The intent of this proposal is to seek funding for the support of
the Nuclear/High Energy Physics (NuHEP) Research Center of Excellence of Hampton
University for the next five years. The long range goal is to maintain an
internationally competitive research program in nuclear and high energy physics.
The Center was established in September 1991 through a cooperative agreement
with the National Science Foundation. The Center has met or exceeded all of its
original goals of that time and enjoys additional funding from the Continuous
Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) and the U.S. Department of Energy
(DOE). One of the original goals was to establish a Ph.D. Degree program at
Hampton; this goal has been met and the University is now in its fourth year of
that program, boasting a total of 45 graduate students in the Department. The
NuHEP Center has established solid collaborative programs with a variety of
academic institutions and laboratories in the United States and abroad. The
NuHEP Center has been used as a model for the establishment of similar programs
at other Historically Black Colleges/Universities (HBCUs), as well as major
institutions. The nuclear physics program has grown rapidly over the past 12
years. It has been demonstrated that high quality work in nuclear physics can be
performed at Hampton. NSF renewed funding of the Center offers the opportunity
for the Center to maintain and grow intellectually as a quality program.
