Professors Paul J. Chirik of Princeton University, and Elizabeth Jarvo of the
University of California-Irvine, are supported by the Chemical Catalysis Program
in the Division of Chemistry to chair a workshop to discuss the opportunities
and difficulties in seeking abundant, relatively non-toxic, and inexpensive
alternatives for precious metal catalysts. The workshop brings together a
diverse group of established and emerging leaders in order to address the lack
of readily available synthetic precursors, the suppression of deleterious
radical chemistry, the identification and optimization of unique mechanistic
pathways and metal properties, and the implementation of spectroscopic and
theoretical/computational methods for characterizing open shell transition metal
compounds serving as catalysts in homogeneous reactions. Each of these critical
topics must be addressed for base metal catalysts to attain or surpass the
success of their precious metal (e.g. platinum, palladium, gold, etc.)
counterparts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Catalysts plays a critical for the
commercial production of renewable energy as well as for the manufacture of
polymers and building materials, and the synthesis of chemicals and
pharmaceuticals. This workshop focuses on fundamental research in which rare,
expensive, and/or toxic metals are replaced with earth-abundant, inexpensive,
and benign chemicals. Industrial participation underscores the practical
challenges associated with base metal catalysis in the commercial economy.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to broaden dissemination, this workshop is
coupled with the Fall American Chemical Society National Meeting in
Indianapolis, Indiana (Sept. 8-12, 2013). Additionally, the workshop proceedings
and conclusions are disseminated to the scientific community through websites
and a workshop report.
