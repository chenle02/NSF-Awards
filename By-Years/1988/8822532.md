The field associated with organic charge transfer salts has virtually exploded
within the past several years. From a single material which was superconducting
at - 1K under pressure, there are now several families of compounds with Tc's up
to 12K at ambient pressure. In addition, these are beautiful model systems for
studying a wealth of new physical phenomena which result from a combination of
reduced dimensionality, relatively small bandwidths and strong electron-electron
interactions. They have been most active in the past grant period in the
investigations of the remarkable properties of these materials in high magnetic
fields. The (TMTSF)2X compounds show a unique cascade of magnetic field induced
spin density wave transitions involving aspects of the integer and fractional
Quantum Hall Effect, commensurability of the SDW wavelength with the magnetic
length and the underlying lattice, Landau bands and subbands, and new types of
quantum oscillations. Although there has been rapid theoretical development in
this area, some of the more recent experiments and new theories suggest that
there are still more interesting phenomena to be observed. They therefore
propose a further study of the magnetic field effects using different compounds
and additional probes. They also plan a series of experiments on the new organic
superconductors to elucidate the nature of the superconductivity, and the roles
played by correlations, dimensionality and disorder. A vital part of this work
is the synthesis of high quality single crystals. Our past research was only
made possible by the synthetic effort at Exxon under the direction of Dr. L.Y.
Chaing. This effort will continue and be expanded to develop and characterize
new materials as well as prepare established ones.
