A PC-Compatible lab anda Macintosh lab are being developed to conduct courses
inintroductory mathematics using the computer algebra systems ofDerive and
Maple, and the already purchased, HP 48SX calculators. The goals are to expose
undergraduates in mathematics, mathematics education, engineering, computer
science, physics, and chemistry to the use of state-of-the-art technology in
calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations courses; to compare
computer algebra systems software and hardware to determine which system is best
suited for classroom use; and to conduct short- and long-term educational
studies comparing the performance of students among those in the computer
algebra classes, and comparing the performance to those in traditional classes.
