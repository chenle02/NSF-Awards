The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program is designed to
increase the participation of minorities in scientific and engineering research.
The program provides support to strengthen the research environments and
capabilities of institutions that have substantial minority student enrollments.
Eligible institutions must also have graduate programs in science or programs in
engineering. Researchers at Chicago State University will use RIMI support to
acquire a state of the art microscope to investigate banding of two species of
mosquitoes to compare differences between them. The studies will investigate the
evolution, development, and population dynmacis of the species and will increase
our knowledge about mechanisms of adaptation. The principal investigator is a
relatively young scientist with three years of postdoctoral study at Johns
Hopkins University and is well qualified to conduct this study. The type of
intellectual vigor and techniques involved in this project provide an excellent
opportunity for minority students to be attracted and trained in the biological
sciences.
