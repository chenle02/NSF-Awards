This project is being supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and
Organometallic Chemistry Program under the Research in Undergraduate
Institutions (RUI) activity, which is part of the Foundation's effort to help
assure a broad base for scientific research through enhancing the scientific and
technical training of students in undergraduate institutions by involving them
in high quality research. This project will involve the synthesis of
electronically conducting organometallic polymers, some of which may change
their electrical properties upon binding small molecules and so serve as sensors
for these molecules. Metallocenes with attached pyrrole groups will be used to
form conducting polymers of varying lengths. A variety of analytical techniques
will be used to characterize the polymers and molecular modelling methods will
be used to correlate physical and electronic properties. A particular goal is to
determine whether these polymers can undergo ring slippage to coordinate small
molecules, such as CO, in a reversible fashion that will cause a change in
conductance and so would allow these materials to be used as sensors.
Undergraduates will perform multidisciplinary research supported under the RUI
activity with the goal of developing new conducting materials as sensors for
small molecules, such as carbon monoxide. ?%¢ /&gt;┤ ?╝À/&gt;╣│ /│╣┤¢ ?&gt;
