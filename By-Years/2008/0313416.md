Recent progress in understanding the structure of String theory has come from
understanding the web of duality symmetries relating nonperturbative effects to
perturbative ones. This proposal focuses on developing a better understanding of
these various dualities and their implication to the nonperturbative theory
underlying string theory. The PI will study the interrelationships among the web
of gauged and ungauged supergravities in various dimensions. The PI will also
investigate the phenomenological implications of string theory to gravitational
physics, particle physics and cosmology. A related topic the PI will investigate
is the noncommutative nature of space-time at very high energies.
