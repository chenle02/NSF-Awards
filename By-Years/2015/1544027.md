This award will provide support for junior and under-represented researchers to
participate in the Fifth Low Radioactivity Techniques (LRT) Workshop at the
University of Washington's Husky Union Building (HUB) on March 18-20, 2015.

This workshop has a particular focus on early career scientists, graduate
students and under-represented researchers. The workshop is important in the
education of such young scientists not only because of the lectures they listen
to, but also because they can directly communicate with the more experienced
scientists who are the lecturers.

The LRT Workshop is focused on methods and techniques to enhance and extend
radiometric measurement techniques and rare event searches that could be limited
in sensitivity due to the presence of interfering background radioactivity that
is ubiquitous and/or naturally occurring. The workshop science topics include
dark matter, solar neutrinos, double-beta decay, and long half-life phenomena.
