Accurate cross section data are essential for detailed modeling of the behavior
of the upper atmosphere. This directly addresses this need by seeking to provide
data for atmospheric species at the relevant energies. Experiments will be
continued on collisions of keV-energy oxygen and hydrogen atoms and ions with
atomic oxygen and atomic hydrogen and on electron-impact ionization of
molecules. A new experiment to measure charge transfer cross sections for oxygen
ions with atmospheric species at energies down to a few electron-volts is also
proposed.
