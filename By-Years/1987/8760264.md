An evaluation of the feasibility of a new method of oxidation reduction of
hazardous organics by the use of a sacrificial metal in a spontaneous process
triggered by cementation of a noble method will be performed. Effects associated
with major process parameters such as pH, mixing, atmosphere, etc. on the
efficiency and rates of oxidation reduction of various classes of hazardous
organics will be evaluated. The understanding of fundamental relationships
between the process variables and the destruction efficiency of hazardous
organics established during this study will be used for an intelligent design
and application of the new method for various waste types. Accordingly, this
project will establish the basis for a large scale demonstration of the proposed
new method. The main benefit of the project to the public is in that, that a new
destructive treatment method of hazardous organics will be available to
alleviate the national hazardous waste problem. Benefits to the industry include
cost savings and risk reduction in handling hazardous wastes.
