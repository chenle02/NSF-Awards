Helton will work to extend the classical theory of interpolation of matrix-
valued functions, and the branch of operator theory called the commutant
lifting, in several different ways: to extend the basic linear theory, to
develop such a theory for nonlinear generalizations of multiplication operators
and operator models, and to develop function theoretic extensions and their
numerics. Another major effort will be to extend this type of mathematics to
nonlinear operators, control systems, and circuits. Operator theory is that part
of mathematics that studies the infinite dimensional generalizations of
matrices. In particular, when restricted to finite dimensional subspaces, an
operator has the usual linear properties, and thus can be represented by a
matrix. The central problem in operator theory is to classify operators
satisfying additional conditions given in terms of associated operators (e.g.
the adjoint) or in terms of the underlying space. Operator theory underlies much
of mathematics, and many of the applications of mathematics to other sciences.
