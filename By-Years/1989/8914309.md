In this project ("Single Electron Transfer. A Major Reaction Pathway in Organic
Chemistry") in the Organic Dynamics Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor
Eugene C. Ashby will study single electron transfer reactions. The main thrust
of the work is the gathering of experimental evidence to support the proposition
that single electron transfer is a major pathway in organic chemistry. Professor
Ashby will perform experiments with various alkyl halide model substrates in an
attempt to discern the electron transfer nature of nucleophilic aliphatic
substitution reactions. These studies will involve comparison of rate and
stereochemistry as a function of leaving group. Competing radical, carbanion,
and carbene intermediates in the reactions of primary alkyl halides with lithium
diisopropylamide are also being investigated. Professor Ashby is also studying
the mechanism of conjugate addition of metal alkyls to enones under a wide
variety of experimental conditions using the probe of isomerization of the cis
enone to the trans enone.
