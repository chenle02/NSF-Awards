The investigators intend to study the superconvergence properties of
Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) for partial differential equations. These methods
are becoming important techniques for the computational solution of large scale
problems modeled by partial differential equations. With discontinuous finite
element bases, they capture discontinuities in, e.g., hyperbolic systems with
high accuracy and efficiency; simplify adaptive h-, p-, r-, refinement and
produce efficient parallel solution procedures. The investigators will study the
superconvergence properties of DG solutions of hyperbolic problems and local
discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) solutions of convection-diffusion problems in one
and multiple space dimensions. Several aspects of the superconvergence
phenomena, including the effects of numerical fluxes, stabilization schemes,
mesh structure, and order variation on superconvergence properties will be
investigated. They will also develop a framework for flexible
continuous/discontinuous finite element methods. A knowledge of superconvergence
properties will be used to construct simple and asymptotically exact a
posteriori estimates of discretization errors and very accurate functions of
interest. Both of these provide valuable accuracy appraisals and guidance for an
adaptive solution strategy. Indeed, superconvergence properties of DG and LDG
solutions in two and three spatial dimensions will be used to develop new a
posteriori estimates of discretization errors. The investigators will explore
various strategies to construct very simple and computationally efficient error
estimates.

Many practical computer simulations such as flow around a car or a plane or
weather forcasting still require a very long time on the the fastest computers.
The investigators will develop very efficient reliable and accurate methods.
This work will lead to more accurate computer simulations, better product and
shorter design cycles.
