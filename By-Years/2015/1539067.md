Non-technical description&lt;br/&gt;This Research Infrastructure Improvement
Track-2 Focused EPSCoR* Collaborations (RII Track-2 FEC) project has The MIND
Research Network in New Mexico as the lead and Tulane University, the University
of Nebraska Medical Center, and the University of Nebraska, Omaha as partners in
a collaboration between 3 jurisdictions. The overarching goal is to understand
the rapid development of human brain connectivity that occurs during late
childhood and early adolescence. Researchers will use multiple imaging
modalities over multiple time scales, and develop novel mathematical algorithms
for modeling and data analysis. The project will involve five early career
faculty and will engage students from middle school through graduate school in
outreach and research activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical
Description&lt;br/&gt;The neuroscience research has four integrated components:
(1) acquisition of neuroimaging and genetic data across this developmental time
period, using magneto-encephalography (MEG), functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI), diffusion MRI (dMRI) and genotyping; (2) unimodal analysis to
advance understanding of time-varying brain connectivity by modeling neural
oscillations measured with MEG, computing instantaneous whole brain connectivity
networks via MEG and fMRI, and quantifying the evolution of whole brain
connectivity patterns over time; (3) data fusion focused on the development and
application of algorithms for bringing together multiple imaging and genetics
parameters, behavior, and longitudinal components; and, (4) a workforce
development and education program that includes outreach to middle, high school
and community college students, research experiences for undergraduates,
graduate-level interdisciplinary training, and faculty training workshops in
neuroimaging and data modeling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*Experimental Program to
