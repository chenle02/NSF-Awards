This award supports a new, multidisciplinary research training program focused
on discovery and characterization of novel enzymes and proteins from diverse
microbes. A group of 11 faculty from the Departments of Chemistry and of
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology have developed an innovative program that
will provide microbiology students a level of chemical and biochemical training
not available in traditional programs and, conversely, chemistry and
biochemistry students with unprecedented training in microbial biology. A
central feature of the program is trainee participation in a "research team"
consisting of two faculty members and undergraduate, graduate, postdoctoral
students. Following lab rotations in their first year, graduate students will
join one of the teams and will have two mentors, one with molecular/biochemical
expertise, the other with expertise in microbiology. Postdoctoral trainees will
enter these groups directly, and will also have two mentors, a novel arrangement
at this training level. In addition, graduate students will have the opportunity
to spend up to four months as an intern in an industrial or other non-academic
setting. Thus the training is designed to prepare students for diverse
opportunities in a variety of employment sectors. ***
