Principal Investigator: Shuhong Gao &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
0302549&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Clemson University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:
Algorithms for polynomial systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research
belongs to the interface between mathematics and computer science. Professor Gao
will investigate efficient algorithms for polynomial systems. Topics include
large systems of linear equations, polynomial factorization, primary
decomposition, and Hilbert irreducibility theorems. These topics are closely
interrelated and are fundamentally important in algebra, number theory, and
symbolic computation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebra and number theory are the
oldest branches of mathematics, and polynomial systems play an important role
throughout the history of mathematics. With the increasing use of computers in
science and engineering, efficient solution of various problems related to
polynomials are of vital importance. In addition, many cryptographic schemes for
protecting sensitive digital information (from cellular phone communications,
bank transactions, e-commerce to national security) are based on algebraic
structures, and their security relies on various hard problems in algebra and
number theory. The current research studies a sample of problems related to
these applicati&lt;br/&gt;
