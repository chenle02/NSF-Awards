Healthcare workers routinely make fast life-saving decisions. Failures in
decision-making can threaten the welfare of the patient and the worker. High-
performing, expert nurses utilize decision-making strategies such as
prioritizing important information, maintaining a big-picture view of the
situation, and executing effective clinical skills to provide safe patient care.
New or inexperienced nurses often lack the experiences to support expert
decision-making. This project is developing sensing technology and algorithms
that can be used in real-time decision-support for training nursing students.
The technology could improve the skills and real-time decision making of these
students, especially in distracting and risky situations. The project is also
creating teaching modules for high school students and inter-disciplinary
university courses that integrate fields such as computer science, human factors
engineering, and nursing.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project vision is to augment
the nursing workforce with technology that will support nurse decision-making in
real time while nurses actively care for patients, work with other caregivers,
and carry out their diverse responsibilities. To achieve this goal, the project
is developing real-time biometrics that can assess the cognitive state of
workers during their complex, dynamic healthcare work. The project will also
study expert nurse behaviors to learn efficient decision-making patterns that
could be used to guide novice nurses. Imitation (computer) learning of expert
behavior will be used to train the guides. In the future, the developed system
could also support rapid recognition of patient risk by integrating user sensing
and decision-support behaviors with just-in-time wearables designed for
healthcare workplaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
