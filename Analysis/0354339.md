The main theoretical component of this project is to study Fredholm differential
operators with unbounded operator coefficients and their Fredholm index in terms
of dynamical properties of linear differential equations on Banach spaces. This
includes an operator-theoretical treatment of Evans function as a Fredholm
determinant. New methods will be developed in spectral analysis of weighted
composition (evolution) semigroups and related abstract differential operators
on Sobolev and Lebesgue spaces of Banach space-valued functions. Also, we will
study connections between the weighted composition operators and associated
differential operators, and topics such as maximal regularity of solutions of
evolution problems, Atiyah-Patodi-Singer Spectral Flow and Index Theorem,
infinite dimensional Morse Theory, Krein-Birman spectral shift function, and
Fredholm determinants for operators with semi-separable kernels. The main
applied component of this project is to use these methods to study the point and
essential spectrum of the classical linearized Euler operator in dimensions two
and three obtained by linearizing the Euler equations of hydrodynamics about a
steady state.

This project lies at the intersection of the theory of complex dynamical
systems, the mathematical theory of equations containing many parameters, and
stability theory of hydrodynamics describing the behavior of a fluid in
equilibria. We will develop new methods of study of the weighted composition
semigroups, the mathematical models describing various effects of transport
along trajectories of the given complex system. These methods will be applied to
the study of a linear approximation of the Euler equations governing the motion
of an ideal incompressible fluid in dimensions two and three, which will add to
our understanding of fluid dynamics near equilibria.
