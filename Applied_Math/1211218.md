In this project, the PI will study large scale atmospheric and oceanic flows,
with the goal of understanding their structure, robustness and stability in
order to improve their predictability, in particular with respect to their low-
frequency variability. The project will continue to develop the PI's dynamic
transition theory for both deterministic and random dissipative systems, and
apply this to the study of dynamic transitions and pattern formations in
atmospheric and oceanic geophysical flows. Such flows include the wind driven
ocean circulation, the meridional overturning oceanic circulation, and the
tropical atmosphere-ocean modes associated with the El Nino Southern
Oscillations (ENSO). Their variability, independently and interactively, may
play a significant role in climate changes, past and future. A combination of
physical modeling, asymptotic methods, rigorous mathematical theory, and large
scale computing will be used to yield new insights into physical phenomena. The
mathematical models in the project are based on partial differential equations,
which can be put into the perspective of dissipative systems. The dynamic
transitions of such dissipative systems are then classified as continuous,
catastrophic or random. The project involves specific collaborations with active
atmosphere/ocean scientists in different institutions. Graduate students will be
involved in the project as well.

In this project, the PI and his collaborators will work on mathematical models
for large scale climate phenomena such as the El Nino Southern Oscillations
(ENSO), with the goal of understanding their long term variability. A recently
developed dynamic transition theory will be employed for this purpose. The
approach allows one to look at the full set of transition states, e.g. the onset
of an El Nino or a La Nina episode. By identifying such transition states and
classifying them both mathematically and physically, possible physical
mechanisms for such phenomena can be identified or perhaps ruled out. The
proposed research involves specific collaborations with active atmosphere/ocean
scientists in different institutions, and it is expected that the proposed
studies will lead to improved predictions and new insights of weather, climate,
and environmental phenomena of central importance to our economy. Also, graduate
students are partially involved in the proposed project.
