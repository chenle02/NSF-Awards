Thermoacoustic tomography is a hybrid method of biomedical imaging. It combines
heating the tissues by microwave energy with detecting the induced ultrasound
signals to achieve simultaneously high contrast and high resolution.
Photoacoustic tomography is a sibling method, which uses laser light instead of
microwaves to heat up the tissues. The two modalities have the same mathematical
model, the observability problem of wave equation. The project is aimed to study
several important mathematical issues relevant to these modalities. Firstly, it
deals with the case of constant acoustic speed, addressing the range
description, inversion formulas, and injectivity of the restricted spherical
mean transform. Secondly, it studies the case of variable ultrasound speed.
Topics include limited data, generalized spherical transform, and layered
acoustic medium. Lastly, it considers the problem of finding the unknown
ultrasound speed.

The results from this project will contribute to the developments of new
promising techniques in biomedical imaging. These developments will greatly
impact the life science research, as they will help to provide better diagnostic
information of non-transparent biological objects, e.g. patients' bodies. It is
planned to distribute the results through publications in high quality journals
as well as conference and colloquium/seminar presentations. It is also planned
to attract students to work in the exciting area of mathematics of biomedical
imaging.
