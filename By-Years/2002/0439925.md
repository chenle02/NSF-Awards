Clayton&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0439925&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-mass-dependent (NMD)
isotope effects in sulfur and oxygen will be used to study two topics in the
geochemistry and evolution of Earth's atmosphere. It has been proposed by others
that the observed NMD effects in sulfur in Archean rocks are due to ultraviolet
photochemistry in the stratosphere before the existence of an effective ozone
shield. The underlying photochemistry will be studied in systematic laboratory
experiments involving photolysis of sulfur dioxide. Determination of the timing
and mechanism for the development of an oxygen-rich atmosphere is an important
factor in biological evolution. The second study deals with the modern
atmosphere, and consists of a search for NMD signals in tropospheric oxygen-
bearing molecules, acquired from stratospheric ozone, and transported across the
tropopause. Samples to be analyzed include ice cores from low-latitude, high-
altitude glaciers, which may provide a millennial record of atmospheric
dynamics. Both of these studies are of practical importance in understanding the
chemical workings of our atmosphere. This work will constitute the doctoral
theses of two graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;
