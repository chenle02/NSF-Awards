The project will address the need for taxonomic research and training on one of
the dominant faunal groups in the marine environment, the polychaete annelid
worms. Four families will form the core of taxonomic work, the Cirratulidae,
Orbiniidae, Scalibregmatidae, and Spionidae. The primary monographic focus will
be on the Cirratulidae in which homology of characters is controversial and
genera currently poorly defined. Data base activities will focus on making as
much information as possible accessible for these four polychaete families.
Comparative studies will use a wide range of techniques and characters including
light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, reproductive biology, larval
morphology and development, and development, and molecular techniques where
appropriate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This work will make many common and important
components of marine environments accurately identifiable and will train a
doctoral student in modern systematic methods. This student will develop a
dissertation based upon a portion of the monograph of Cirratulidae, thereby
acquiring the special knowledge and skills needed for a career in polychaete
taxonomy. Conclusions will be made accessible to a wide user community via the
World Wide Web.&lt;br/&gt;
