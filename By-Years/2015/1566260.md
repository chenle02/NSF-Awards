Mobile traffic is soon poised to exceed non-mobile traffic across the world.
Already, for many users, mobile phones are the only 'computer' they own. As a
result, mobile Web pages are fast becoming the primary portal for content.
However, loading a Web page on the mobile phone is exceedingly slow. There have
been several optimizations designed to speed up Web pages, but there is no
silver bullet: an optimization that speeds up one page can, and often does, slow
down another page. One of the goals of this project is to shed light on why Web
pages load slower on the phone as compared to a desktop. The project will use
this bottleneck analysis to design algorithms, techniques, and tools, to
accurately estimate if any given optimization will help or further slow down the
page load time. The end goal of the project is a comprehensive analysis
framework called ProfX that will help Web developers, network providers, browser
vendors, and researchers design and choose the right set of optimizations to
significantly speed up the mobile Web.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problem is that
the mobile Web ecosystem is fairly complex. This makes understanding the page
load bottlenecks and analyzing optimizations challenging. Second, the time it
takes to load a page depends on various factors. Isolating the effect of an
optimization under such variability is non-trivial. To address these challenges,
the project proposes two key ideas: (1) Piecemeal analysis: Web page loading is
not an atomic activity. The page load process is made up of several smaller
activities that form a complex dependency structure. The project proposes to
decompose the Web page process and analyze each sub activity to identify the
bottlenecks. Further, the effect of an optimization will be studied on each of
these sub activities. This piecemeal analysis addresses the complexity challenge
in the Web ecosystem, and (2) Isolation: The project proposes to develop
techniques and experimental tools to control the variability of the page load
process. The goal is to isolate the effect of a given optimization by forcing
the effect of other unrelated parameters to be a near constant. The techniques
developed in this project will be more broadly applicable to studying other
mobile applications such as video.
