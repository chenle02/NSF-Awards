9408798 Chichilnisky Recent developments have deepened the connection between
topology and the economics of markets. This workshop will allow the presentation
and discussion of original mathematical results, which have or could lead to
useful applications in the economics of markets. The first three days of the
workshop will be devoted to a series of mini-courses in mathematics aimed at
providing the basic background. The remaining time will allow the presentation
of new theorems, along with their applications to the theory of markets. Topics
discussed will include: new topological invariants for existence,
characterization and computation of market equilibria and their relation to
social choice and to other forms of resource allocation, competitive and
cooperative systems, algebraic geometry and markets with increasing returns,
computational complexity, and stochastic processes and financial markets.
