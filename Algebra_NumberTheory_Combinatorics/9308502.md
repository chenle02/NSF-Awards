The proposed research will extend the decomposition theory of 3-connected
graphs in three areas. First, classes of well-structured graphs related to a
Coullard-Gardner-Wagner decomposition will be characterized by simple, well-
defined replacements and excluded minor theorems. Second, algorithmic results
will be obtained on these classes. Third, the decomposition theory of
3-connected graphs will be extended to 3-connected matroids.
