9202458 Brennan This is the third year of a three-year continuing award. The
goal of this research is to better understand the interactive process of human
language use with a computer system. The theory underlying this research is that
human-computer interaction, like human communication, falls into a class of
coordinated actions that proceeds by the systematic exchange of evidence of
understanding. Two processes are examined: a) entrainment, which is hypothesized
to influence lexical choice, and b) grounding, which is hypothesized to set the
level and placement of appropriate feedback. Psychological experiments will use
simulated language and voice interfaces to examine 1) what variables influence
the lexical choice people make and how such a system might adapt to
idiosyncratic language input, 2) what kind of text output should the system
generate to present itself as a coherent dialog partner, and 3) what kinds of
context-sensitive feedback should a speech or language interface provide. The
goals are to contribute to the design of adaptive user interfaces, to enable
more robust error handling, and to make natural language, command, and voice
interfaces easier for people to use.
