Protein kinases are an important class of regulatory enzymes in all cells but
are particularly important in the nervous system. When these enzymes are
activated within cells in response to extracellular signals, they transfer
phosphate to serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues on other proteins. This
transfer may alter protein folding and function. In this way, protein kinases
regulate cellular function. In the studies proposed here, a brain protein kinase
that is activated by transient high calcium concentrations will be studied in
the genetic organism, Drosophila melanogaster (the fruit fly). Mammalian genes
for this enzyme have been sequenced. The genes encoding this important brain
enzyme in the fly will be sequenced and mapped within the Drosophila genome.
This approach will facilitate the generation of mutants in the kinase and will
allow studies of the behavior of flies with mutant kinase genes. These studies
will significantly advance our understanding of the basic molecular mechanisms
that underlie information processing and storage in nervous systems.
