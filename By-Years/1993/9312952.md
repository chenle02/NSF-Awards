9312952 Rodriguez In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division Prof. Art Rodriguez of East Carolina University will carry
out a series of NMR measurements of the carbon-13 spin-relaxation time of
buckminsterfullerene in a number of organic solvents having different molecular
properties. The measurements will be made as function of temperature and
magnetic field strength for each of the solvents. %%% Research on the properties
of fullerenes is at the forefront of chemistry. Most of the attention has been
given so far to the synthesis and properties of individual fullerene molecules
and the data base for fullerene properties in solution is very sparse. The
special fullerene to be studied is buckminsterfullerene, a nearly spherical
compound composed of 60 carbon atoms. The experimental data obtained will be
used to test a simplified model for molecular reorientation in liquid solutions.
