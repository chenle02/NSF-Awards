ECS-9711590 Bose Robustness property is crucial in the performance evaluation
spatio-temporal systems used to process analog video signals, multidimensional
transform-based coding and in multidimensional filtering for picture quality
improvement. This project will promote collaboration between the scientists in
Mexico who are developing constructive methods for the robust stability analysis
of nonaffine families of multivariate polynomials and their counterparts in
U.S.A. who will be involved in, first, obtaining generalizations to the
multidimensional case of their deterministic and probabilistic approaches to,
respectively, the robust wavenumber response and worst-case robust stability
analysis problems and, second, the application of these results in image
filtering based on classical as well as neurocomputing.
