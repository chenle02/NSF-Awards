This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop a
multi-coil surface NMR imaging for 3-D groundwater imaging and characterization.
Surface NMR techniques are generating interest in the groundwater exploration
community because of their unique ability to directly detect groundwater, and to
distinguish between bound and unbound groundwater. Present surface NMR
techniques can produce, at best, an estimate of the 1-dimensional groundwater
density profile directly beneath the coil. These 1-D profile estimates are
subject to a variety of errors stemming from the use of a single surface coil,
and inaccurate 1- D models of the coil fields and water density profiles. The
goal of this project is to develop a 3-D surface NMR groundwater imaging system
based on coherent multi- coil array processing. &lt;br/&gt; The commercial
impact of this technology will be an inexpensive, low-energy and non-invasive
groundwater exploration method. This technology could have significant positive
impacts on both world health and natural resource management. &lt;br/&gt;
