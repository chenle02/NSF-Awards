This project provides 40 scholarships per year to first or second year computer
science and mathematics majors who are financially needy and academically
talented. The program aggressively advertises from underrepresented groups,
including women, racial and ethnic minorities, and persons with disabilities.
Current university programs are used to provide additional academic support,
which include study skills training, tutoring, and professional mentoring. The
program also includes interviewing skills, peer support, and professional
mentoring through internships and industry contacts.
