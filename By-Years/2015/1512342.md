This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating III-V
Nitride piezoresistive microcantilever based neutron detector technology to fill
the critical technology gap in the neutron detection area arising out of severe
worldwide shortage of He-3. The translated technology has the following unique
features: (i) vacuum enclosure of the microcantilever sensors, which will result
in highly sensitive detection of nuclear radiation, as well as protection of the
sensor from environment and unwanted radiation enhancing sensor reliability;
(ii) possibility of using arrays of sensors realized through microfabrication
techniques, which can offer imaging capabilities and directionality information;
(iii) the usage of bimodal detection technique and two functionalization layers
to perform highly efficient and unique detection of neutrons. Thus, it provides
exemplary performance, cost savings and efficiency when compared to the leading
competing neutron detection technology based on Boron-10 in this market space.
The project accomplishes this goal by using a relatively inexpensive material
with unique material properties and adopting a design strategy involving the
design features mentioned above, resulting in a novel neutron detector
prototype. The partnership engages Savannah River National Laboratory to provide
guidance in the He-detection market space and other aspects including prototype
testing and technology commercialization, as they pertain to the potential to
translate the technology along a path that may result in a competitive
commercial reality. The potential economic impact is expected to be in several
tens of millions of dollars in the next eight years, which will contribute to
the U.S. competitiveness in this highly critical neutron detection market space.
The societal impact, long term, will be in the creation of high-tech workforce
and a safer society with vastly mitigated nuclear related threats.
