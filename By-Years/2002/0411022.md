Engineering-Engineering Technology (58) Valencia Community College is developing
coursework for a new Robotics and Simulation specialization within its
Electronics Engineering Technology Associate Degree program. The new
specialization is incorporating best practices in curriculum and instruction
from other institutional models while addressing local industry needs. Site
visits are providing information about textbooks and laboratory manuals to be
used in the specialization courses, course syllabi, equipment and equipment
maintenance, facility modifications to house equipment, lab safety practices,
assessment practices, expected competencies, enrollment, faculty training
resources, and course scheduling. An independent evaluator and representatives
from the program's business advisory committee are providing continuous feedback
to achieve maximum effectiveness of the project.

The PI and Co-PIs are integrating research on measuring learning outcomes and
diversity of learning styles with examples of best curriculum practices to
enhance learning among Valencia's underrepresented significantly-minority and
economically disadvantaged student population. Project activities include (1)
identification of specific assessment practices that are designed to help
students develop the skills, dispositions, and knowledge needed to be actively
engaged in their academic work; (2) set and maintain realistically high
expectations and goals; (3) seek and find connections to and real-world
applications of what they're learning; (4) understand and value the criteria,
standards, and methods by which they are assessed and evaluated; and (5) work
regularly and productively with academic staff and students to help students
attain a high quality academic performance.
