An engineering study has revealed that the pier and wharf of the Scripps
Institution of Oceanography, Nimitz Marine Facility are in need of immediate
repair. Saltwater penetration into concrete of the support beams has corroded
reinforcing steel, resulting in decreased loading capacity and restricted use by
ship loading equipment. The Facility is a major regional port providing docking
for four Scripps-operated research vessels, the MELVILLE, THOMAS WASHINGTON, NEW
HORIZON, and ROBERT GORDON SPROUL as well as the Scripps-operated research
platforms FLIP and ORB, the NOAA fisheries research vessel DAVID STARR JORDAN,
and other visiting research vessels. This grant will contribute funds for the
repair of the pier and wharf. Additional support is being sort from the state of
California and other federal agencies. The Project Director, Dr George Shor, is
Associate Director, Scripps Institution of Oceanography. He is fully qualified
to direct this project having had considerable experience in overseeing marine
facility operations.
