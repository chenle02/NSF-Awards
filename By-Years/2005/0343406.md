The goal of this project is to expand our understanding of the effects of
various magnetic cloud configuration on the magnetosphere - ionosphere system by
analyzing simulations for a set of idealized magnetic clouds occur in variety of
different configurations. The polarity of the magnetic field orientation appears
to be ordered by solar cycle and may have a determining role on the
geoeffectiveness of a given magnetic cloud. Furthermore, magnetic clouds are
often accompanied by interplanetary shocks, high-speed streams and trailing
density enhancements. The development of an understanding of fundamental physics
involved in these interactions has been hampered by an inability to separate
these potentially synergistic features. The Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry (LFM) global MHD
code will be used to simulate the magnetosphere - ionosphere system under a
variety of magnetic cloud conditions. In addition, a 2-D relativistic guiding
center particle code will be used to mode the evolution of the radiation belts.

The study will focus on 1) varying the polarity of the magnetic cloud, 2)
changing the duration of the IMF rotation interval, 3) changing the energy input
into the magnetosphere, and 4) including trailing density enhancements. A
baseline set of parameters derived from the simulation will be used to assess
which features control the geoeffectiveness of a given configuration.
