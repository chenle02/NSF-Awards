0137347/Julien&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main aims of this proposal are to
develop a better understanding of mixing during the active phase of deep open-
ocean convection and to obtain parameterizations of temperature and salinity
changes occurring during convection. Its physical novelty is that it includes
the study of physical processes not previously examined in detail, including:
(a) vortical interactions between plumes and (b) slant-wise convection. The
study will use ambitious numerical simulations to examine the dynamics of
turbulent ensembles of convective plumes and will include the effect of the
horizontal component of the Earth's rotation vector. Simulations will use both
the full Boussinesq equations as well as less stiff, asymptotically reduced sets
of dynamical equations developed by the PIs. The information on the lateral
stirring and penetration of strong convective events in the upper ocean that
will be developed in this project will be used to improve parameterizations of
open-ocean convection in large-scale ocean models of the sort used to study
global ocean circulation and climate. &lt;br/&gt;
