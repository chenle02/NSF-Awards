With this award, the Chemical Structure Dynamics and Mechanisms B Program is
supporting the fundamental research of Professor Arthur Winter at Iowa State
University. Professor Winter will investigate the structure-reactivity
principles for photoheterolysis reactions of carbon-leaving group (C-LG) bonds.
Photoheterolysis reactions generate ionic initial products and are important in
biological processes, materials science, and environmental chemistry
applications. The long-term goal of this research is to generate a predictive
theoretical framework that relates chemical structure to excited state
reactivity for heterolytic bond scission. Understanding the mechanistic
principles for simple archetypal photoreactions will contribute to the broader
challenge of understanding the guiding mechanistic principles in photochemistry.
As part of his Broader Impacts effort, Professor Winter will further develop a
"Chats with Eminent Female Scientists Initiative" that involves video interviews
with eminent female scientists. These interviews will be posted online to
provide insights and advice for students who are interested in an academic
career. He will also continue to recruit undergraduates and members of groups
underrepresented in the STEM disciplines into his lab.

To study these photoheterolysis reactions, the PI will employ a joint
theoretical/experimental approach. High-level quantum mechanical methods will be
used to map the excited state transition states and surface crossing topologies
in model systems. Experimentally, spectroscopy will determine the effect of
structure on the rates and mechanisms of photorelease in model systems.
