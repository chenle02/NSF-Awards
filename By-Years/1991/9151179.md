The Department of Chemistry and Physics is purchasing an FT-IR for use in all
chemistry courses from the freshman level through senior independent research.
The instrument is being used for product characterization, determination of the
extent of a reaction, study of reaction mechanisms, and equilibrium bond
distances and force constants.
