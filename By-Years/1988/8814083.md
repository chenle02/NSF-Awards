In a cooperative venture, Duke University and the North Carolina School of
Science and Mathematics - a high school - will develop a detailed syllabus for a
new calculus curriculum. Both schools will experiment with the use of computer
algebra systems and prepare sample modules. Duke University will run a small
prototype calculus laboratory for the development and testing of interactive
experiments and writing as a learning tool in mathematics. Central themes will
include appropriate use of mathematical and physical tools, identification of a
concept and its inverse, use of transformations, and relationships between
calculus and real world problems.
