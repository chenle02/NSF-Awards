This proposal is for a Workshop that will bring together well-known
investigators in the theory of computer networks and world-class applied
mathematicians in the area of queues and more general stochastic processes, with
the intent of generating new classes of simple, tractable mathematical models
for computer networks. It is generally felt that currently accepted models and
methodologies have reached the point of sharply diminishing returns just when
practical networks have begun to severely outgrow theoretical understanding.
