The PI will explore and apply logic, set-theoretic and combinatorial methods to
the geometry of Banach spaces. The isomorphic classification of the complemented
subspaces of the spaces of p-power integrable functions, especially those
contained in some nice subspaces, will be considered. Necessary and sufficient
conditions for bounded linear operators from these spaces to factor through
spaces with simpler and better structures will be studied. The investigator will
also study operators from spaces with certain asymptotic structures.
Characterizations of subspaces and quotients of separable Banach spaces with
shrinking unconditional basis and subsequences of unconditional sequences will
be investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Banach space theory is about vector spaces
in which there is a very natural notion of distance. These spaces are of
fundamental importance in many areas, including mathematical models in quantum
mechanics. The understanding of the geometry of Banach spaces has been and will
continue to be useful in many areas of mathematics and engineering. In
particular, the use of logic, set-theoretic and combinatorial methods will
provide rich information about the geometric structure of Banach
spaces.&lt;br/&gt;
