9315041 Knuepfer The active oblique arc-continent collision of the Eurasian and
Philippine Sea plates is well exposed in Taiwan. This is a geomorphic study of
regional terraces and streams to determine whether geomorphic domains change
along and across strike and to place the results in a tectonic context to
address along and across strike variations in the tectonic style and perhaps
uplift rates.
