This is a collaborative NUE in Engineering program entitled, "Collaborative
Research: Cross-institutional Nano-technology Education and Workforce Training
Project", at the University of Dayton and Sinclair Community College, under the
direction of Dr. Andrew W. Sarangan and Dr. Surinder M. Jain. The program will
focus on: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Connecting high schools, a community college,
a university and selected industries. &lt;br/&gt;2) Developing alternative
methods for delivering interactive nanotechnology laboratory experiences.
&lt;br/&gt;3) Creating nanotechnology internship opportunities. &lt;br/&gt;4)
Developing high school nanotechnology learning and awareness activities.
&lt;br/&gt;5) Developing nanotechnology workshops for secondary school
teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will increase awareness of
nanotechnology concepts and careers in the nanoscience industry. The multi-
institutional longitudinal model, connecting high schools, a community college,
a university and industry partners, will offer a model for adoption by other
institutions seeking to connect secondary school students and undergraduates to
an effective and affordable pathway for nanotechnology education and employment.
