The problem addressed by this project is the outdated limiting experiences
students receive in animal and human learning, animal cognition, and comparative
psychology. The problem is pedagogical in the sense that students' exposure to
animal research, a benchmark in psychological science, is not contemporary. The
problem is theoretical because research involving complex visual and auditory
stimuli cannot be conducted. It is methodological because human studies of
operant phenomena, a source of controversy in the literature, are not easily
conducted. It is academic because the proper methods, statistics, and design
issues pertinent to a contribution to laboratory sciences are not possible. The
objective is to provide flexible, powerful learning stations to study a range of
species, a variety of visual and auditory stimuli, and a range of responses
including ones directed toward the stimuli. Restructuring solves the
pedagogical, theoretical, methodological, and academic problems the old
laboratory faces. Special audiences targeted for the project include students in
Introductory Psychology and in a variety of midlevel and advanced courses and
independent studies in Biological and Behavioral Processes.
