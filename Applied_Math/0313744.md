University Title: Mathematical Problems from Materials Science

ABSTRACT

This project addresses topics at the interface between mathematics, physics, and
materials science, particularly (a) energy-driven pattern formation in
crystalline grain boundaries, and (b) energy-driven coarsening of phase mixtures
and defects. Concerning the former: the PI will investigate pattern formation in
twist grain boundaries, using a new viewpoint based on minimization of
incoherence energy. Concerning the latter: the PI will investigate problems from
phase separation, grain growth, and vortex annihilation, using a new viewpoint
based on dissipation and isoperimetric inequalities.

Energy-driven pattern formation occurs in many different physical systems;
examples include vortex lattices in type-II superconductors, dislocation
patterns in grain boundaries, and labyrinthine structures created by phase
separation. This project seeks an understanding -- for specific, widely studied
systems -- why certain patterns form rather than others. Such understanding is
crucial for interpreting experimental observations, i.e. for drawing inferences
about the physics of a system from observations of the patterns it forms.
