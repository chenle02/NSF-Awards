Electromagnetics, as traditionally taught, often concentrates on rigorous
preparation for further work without emphasizing applications. This approach
fails to meet the needs of the majority of electrical engineering students who
are not going to be fields and waves specialists. The project is adding a
laboratory component to first-semester electromagnetics that directly
establishes its relevance to modern electronic systems, including digital
systems. Seven sets of apparatus are being constructed, which will (1)
demonstrate transmission of digital signals over long transmission lines; (2)
allow the study of pulse propagation, reflection, and distortion; and (3) permit
the study of crosstalk and other forms of unintended coupling in printed
circuits. Most importantly, the apparatus is being designed so that students can
analyze these effects using ordinary benchtop instruments (function generators
and oscilloscopes) with which they are already familiar. They are also able to
design solutions to electromagnetic-oriented problems using standard electronic
components. Equipment for electromagnetic interference (EMI) measurements is
also included. This equipment allows measurements of field strength, radiation
patterns, and spurious emissions. Students can make compliance measurements on
personal computers, and design shielding solutions to interference problems.
This project is affecting every student in the electrical engineering program.
The result should be graduating engineers who are better able to apply
electromagnetics principles in modern high-speed electronic systems. *
