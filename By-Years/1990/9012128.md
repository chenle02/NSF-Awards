This project examines a variety of dynamic problems in public finance,
macroeconomics and industrial organization. In tax theory the project determines
the characteristics of optimal taxation of capital and labor income, using
nonlinear numerical techniques, and incorporating reasonable restrictions on
government behavior. It also computes the political outcomes if governments
cannot precommit to optimal policies. In industrial organization the project
examines a dynamic model of oligopoly which allows firms to choose both
quantities and prices, essentially merging the Bertrand and Cournot models. The
dynamic model is used to examine the strategic importance of investment,
learning, signalling and the incentives for merger. The project also develops
numerical techniques which are necessary to examines these dynamic problems with
general specifications of demand and supply. The research on tax policy is
especially timely and important. The investigator's past work demonstrated that
there are substantial differences between the results obtained from standard tax
analysis and results from truly dynamic and stochastic models. This project
establishes the robustness of the theoretical results by developing more
realistic models. The loss due to nonoptimal rules is determined by comparing
the optimal policy with alternatives.
