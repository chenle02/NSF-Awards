Recognizing the problems of attracting women into science related careers and
the critical nature of the middle school years in career decisions, this project
will develop and test several unique strategies for creating and sustaining an
interest in science among young women. First, all the science activities will be
built from personal interest of female students of the age to counter the often
heard complaint by girls that science is boring. Second, the science activities
will take place in a variety of settings -- traditional school environments, on
weekends, at home, in after-school clubs, and at the Boston Museum of Science --
to demonstrate that science knowledge and activities relate to all aspects of
life. Third, the activities will be led by women who are models for the young
girls -- women scientists, women relatives, women teachers, and girls from older
peer groups -- to counter the male dominant atmosphere of most formal scientific
environments. Finally, the whole project will be planned and implemented by a
team of people representing school and college faculty, business and industry,
and the Museum of Science. The hypothesis that the diversity in the people and
programs involved in this project will significantly improve the probability of
creating an interest in science in young women will be tested. Cost sharing by
the partners will total 25% of the NSF funding.
