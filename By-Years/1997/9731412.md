9731412 Cook The WV-Handle On Science Project is a local systemic change project
(LSC) that involves a collaboration of local school systems, informal science
centers, colleges, and business and industry (e.g., Bayer Corp.). This project
is offering a comprehensive five-year science education reform initiative for 49
schools in the five West Virginia Northern Panhandle counties (i.e., Brooke,
Hancock, Marshall, Ohio, and Wetzel). All of the approximately 625 K-6 teachers
will receive professional development focusing on inquiry-based teaching
strategies, science content, and alternative assessment relating to exemplary
instructional materials. These materials will consist of a combination of units
from Science and Technology for Children (STC), Full Option Science System
(FOSS), and Insights. The modules that the teachers will be using as their
instructional science program will be refurbished at the Materials Resource
Center of West Liberty State College's SMART-Center. It is expected that the WV-
Handle on Science Project will serve as a model program for k-6 science
education reform for the entire state of West Virginia.
