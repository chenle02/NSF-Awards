This study seeks to improve the understanding of reaction mechanisms on the
surface of solid catalysts. A technique called "solid electrolyte potentiometry"
is being used to learn more about several oxidation reactions. The method gives
several kinds of information relating to intermediate compounds and products
including reaction rates. The results from this research can help to elucidate
the particular reactions, as well as demonstrate the value of the analytical
method which could have application to other systems of interest. Results from
research of this type could find later application in the synthesis of new
compounds, corrosion prevention, and the custom design of catalysis.
