There is much interaction between numerical optimization and the areas of
differential equations and control. Examples include new methods for parameter
identification; special purpose, mesh- independent, quasi-Newton methods for
discretizations of integral equations, differential equations and control
problems; new iterative methods for the large linear problems that are
discretizations of partial differential equations; and effective projection
methods for inequality constrained problems from optimal control. This grant
will partially support a conference on these numerical optimization methods in
differential equations and control, to be held at North Carolina State
University in July, 1991. This conference is scheduled immediately after the
International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics in order that as
many international mathematicians can attend as possible. This will provide the
US participants an opportunity to keep abreast of recent advances in the area
which have occurred in other countries as well as their own.
