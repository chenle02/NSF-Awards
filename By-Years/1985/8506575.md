This research is concerned with fundamental device physical electronics to
understand the basic limitations of solid-state microstructures which rely on
quantum mechanical tunneling of carriers into deep storage traps. These traps
provide the basis for non-volatile memory structures in a new multi-insulator
device structure--the Metal-blocking oxide-nitride-tunneling oxide-silicon
(MONOS) microstructure. This research explores the physical mechanisms through
which charge injection, transport, and storage is achieved in these devices. The
experimental approach focuses on "scaled" microstructures to understand the
fundamental mechanisms which determine the erase/write, retention, and endurance
properties of these devices. An objective of this research is to develop an
analytical model of the MONOS operation in terms of the nature and distribution
of traps within the nitride storage layer. The research also seeks to explore
the origin and control of these traps through a model of the process technology
for multi-insulator film preparation. The results of this research impact the
design of high density, non-volatile, silicon microstructures for high-speed,
long retention, memories with greatly improved endurance to cycling.
