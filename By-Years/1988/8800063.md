This is a proposal from the American Society of Cell Biology requesting support
for young investigators in the U.S.A. to attend The International Congress of
Cell Biology in Montreal, Canada in August, 1988. The Congress would offer an
excellent opportunity for young investigators not only to present their
scientific work, but also to draw inspiration from an excellent group of
scientrist and speakers who have been invited to participate in the proceedings.
