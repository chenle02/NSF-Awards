The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project lies in the
broad field of electrically-safe, cold plasma technology. The specific
application are quite broad in scope. One potential commercial application area
involves sterilization of medical instruments, food, and pharmaceutical
products. The system developed here is electrically safe for personnel and
sensitive equipment used in manufacturing environments. Another potential
application involves utilization of the cold plasma technology for medical
treatment subject to strict electromagnetic interference requirements of other
medical equipment in same surgical procedure. This project will explore the
commercial potential of the core technology and will inform further technical
developments and possible commercialization paths.

This I-Corps project further develops a novel cold plasma technology, namely DC
voltage driven cold plasma technology. Recent work has demonstrated that cold
plasmas can be generated in self-oscillatory regime, when sequence of streamer-
type breakdowns in gas flow is driven by purely DC high voltage. This approach
differs from the traditional AC and pulsed-DC, where breakdown repetition rate
is governed by the frequency of discharge driving voltage. The repetition
frequency of the breakdowns in this innovative approach can be controlled by the
geometry of discharge electrodes and surroundings. DC voltage driven cold plasma
technology has tremendous fundamental advantages over the traditional AC and
pulsed-DC systems including very effective mitigation of unwanted breakdowns and
corona, elimination of electromagnetic interference, significant improvement of
breakdown and electric shock safety, and overall simplicity of the system and
enables multiple commercial applications.
