This action is for the support of a workshop to discuss the simulation of
earthquake strong ground motions using geotechnical centrifuges. Geotechnical
centrifuge modeling is a means of testing physical models of earth structures -
such as embankments and dams - in the laboratory: it does this by correctly
simulating the effect of gravity-induced stresses on the strength and stiffness
properties of soil. These stresses increase with depth, just as water pressure
increases with depth below the surface. Subjecting an N-th scale earth model to
N times the acceleration due to gravity yields the correct gravity-induced
stresses. The state-of-the-art in geotechnical centrifuge modeling has
progressed rapidly during the last decade. Especially important is the fact that
during this decade, a new generation of geotechnical engineers has been trained
with an appreciation of, and experience in using, this method. An exciting
development has been the recent use of geotechnical centrifuges to simulate
earthquake-induced strong ground motions. This development has the potential to
make a dramatic contribution to earthquake hazard mitigation. The objective of
this workshop is to explore the issues involved in adding an earthquake
simulation capability to the three large national geotechnical centrifuges at
the University of California at Davis, the University of Colorado at Boulder and
at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. Participants include
representatives from academe, federal and state agencies, industry, and from
major geotechnical centrifuge installations in foreign countries. The workshop
is to be held at the University of Colorado at Boulder on 12-13 February 1990: a
report summarizing the discussions, conclusions and recommendations will be
distributed following the workshop.
