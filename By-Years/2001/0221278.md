This dissertation investigates the effects of non-governmental organizations
(NGOs) on economic development. Among the studies planned are a cross-national
analysis of the effects of the extent of international NGOs in a country in 1978
on economic growth over the next twenty years. This effect is expected to vary
by regime type: NGOs may be more important in more authoritarian countries where
they compensate for the weak civil society. Other measures of institutional
development may also determine the size of the NGO effect: data from the World
Bank on the legal environment and on local administrative capacities will be
tested as possible factors moderating the effectiveness of NGOs in promoting
development. A survey of World Bank development experts will be developed to
assess the variation in state - NGO ties (e.g., state contracting with NGOs);
measures of state-civil synergy based on these ties are expected to be
associated with higher economic growth and social development.
