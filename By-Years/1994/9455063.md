Faculty from two-year colleges across the United States will be trained on the
theory, techniques, and laboratory use of state-of- the-art chemical
instrumentation in a series of one-week workshops. For each of two summers, 11
workshops will be offered: four on the East Coast, sponsored by Northern
Virginia Community College and George Mason University; four in the Midwest,
sponsored by Sinclair Community College and the University of Dayton; and three
on the West Coast, sponsored by Shoreline Community College and Western
Washington University. A total of 144 two-year college faculty will be involved
as participants. They will select instruction from among atomic absorption,
flame emission, nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier-transform infrared,
ultraviolet/visible diode array and gas chromatograph/mass spectroscopies, vapor
phase and high performance liquid chromatography, computerized data acquisition
and treatment, and electrochemical methods.
