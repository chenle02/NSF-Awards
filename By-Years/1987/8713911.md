This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfields of spectroscopy and separation science. Electronic spectroscopy
affords a sensitive means of quantifying solutes. Because faster time scales are
now accessible to electronic spectroscopy, this tool can be more readily used to
obtain structural information. In particular, the size and shape of a solute
determine its rotational diffusion behavior. Rotational diffusion studies of
medium-sized organic molecules in common solvents require both picosecond
spectroscopy and the resolution of multiple exponentially decreasing response
signals. Professor Wirth and her students will measure the three components of
the rotational diffusion constant of the solute tetracene which will enable an
assessment of the extent to which structural information can be derived from
this approach. However, if the solvent has short-range structural order, the
presence of the solvent could potentially limit the solute information that is
obtained. To address this issue, Professor Wirth will also study the effect of
solvent structure on solute rotational diffusion. The results of these studies
are expected to be valuable both to analytical spectroscopy and to an enhanced
fundamental understanding of liquids.
