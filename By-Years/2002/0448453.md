Carnegie-Mellon University is awarded a grant to model dynamic systems in the
cell. Gene expression is a temporal process and most systems in the cell are
continuously regulated. New high-throughput biological techniques can generate
large quantities of static and time series data. Time series experiments can be
used to identify pathways and networks that are activated as a part of a
biological system or in response to external stimulus. These methods hold the
promise of revolutionizing molecular biology by providing a large-scale view of
cellular activity. However, time series datasets also introduce many new
computational challenges. In this project algorithms specifically designed for
such experiments will be developed to take advantage of unique features in such
data and address the unique problems they raise. This will be achieved by
developing computational methods for the analysis of gene expression data and by
combining different data sources using a variety of computational techniques.
The educational component of this proposal will develop ways to teach and
supervise computer science, biology and medical students by developing new
classes at the graduate and undergraduate levels, by fostering close
interactions with biologists in both research and training, and by helping
develop and execute a joint PhD program in computational biology between
Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh.
