9360677 Lin The nonlinearity and uncertainty inherent in a complex dynamic
system have been a great challenge to the autopilot design that is required to
have satisfactory performance for all flight conditions in probable engagements.
Several advanced robust nonlinear approaches, namely, inversion- based control
laws, analytical gain scheduling, and nonlinear servo-regulator are proposed to
design a high performance autopilot. The unique features of these approaches
include that (1) they incorporate the nonlinear dynamics due to severe kinematic
and inertial coupling as well as aerodynamics into the design process; (2) they
furnish robust scheme to account for model uncertainties due to aerodynamics and
bending motion, etc.; and (3) they provide adaptive mechanism to handle
parameter variations of the mass and inertia, etc. Each of these features works
to enhance the performance of complex dynamic system. The deliverables include a
comprehensive nonlinear design/analysis tool together with detailed
documentations and training courses.
