The miniaturization of electronics has had, and is continuing to have, a
profound influence on society. A similar miniaturization in mechanical systems
appears to be underway with potentially equal significance to society. Initially
used to fabricate solid-state sensors, anisotropic etching of silicon provides
the ability to fabricate complete micromechanical systems--actuators,
components, and sensors--in the same way microelectronic devices are
manufactured. Further development of micromechanical systems will require the
skills from and interaction amongst a number of disciplines. This proposal
covers the conduct of a series of workshops on micromechanical systems, bringing
together experts from different disciplines to recommend fruitful areas for
research and to provide a focus for future developments and applications. The
first meeting of the workshop series will prepare a preliminary report by
August, 1987, with a final report following the third and final meeting in
January, 1988.
