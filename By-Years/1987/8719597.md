This research will develop theory for food webs that pertains to the
terrestrial communities on small islands in the eastern Caribbean. A prominent
feature to the animal component of the communities on these islands are the
Anolis lizards. These animals largely replace the ground-feeding insectivorous
birds so familiar in the woods of North America. As a result, the abundance of
anoles in natural habitat is typically 1/4 to 1 lizard per m2, making them
conspicuous even to a casual observer, and inviting the suspicion that they play
a large role in community dynamics. Previous research focussed on these lizards,
primarily with respect to learning how lizard species interact with one another,
and to learning how these interactions in turn affect the evolution and
biogeography of lizards. The new research will reach out from the level of the
lizards within the food web to the species above and below them. It is proposed
to analyze models for food webs that take account of scale differences, in space
and time, that are natural to the different levels in a web. It is also proposed
to continue the census of the Anolis lizard populations on St. Maarten into a
second decade, in anticipation of proposing new experimental field studies as
the theoretical research nears completion.
