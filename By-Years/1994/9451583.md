9451583 Clark A laser laboratory will be developed to complement the Lasers
lecture course currently taught. Upper-level undergraduate physics and
engineering physics students are the primary target for the Lasers course and
this quarter-long (10-week) laboratory. Students working in groups of 2 to 3
will rotate through laboratory experiments. These experiments will be developed
to reinforce the concepts and models discussed in lecture. The Laser Laboratory
experiments will cover three basic components. First, the experiments will
provide introductory investigations to basic laser parameters, such as laser
power, beam divergence and cavity mode structure. Second, the students will
learn current optical techniques for probing matter, in particular potential
laser media. Finally, the students will receive hands on experience in the
assembling and evaluation of modern laser systems. We will acquire state-of-the-
art light detection and laser systems which will be utilized in essentially all
laboratory components. The acquired instrumentation will also be used in
upgrading experiments for the upper level Applied Optics Laboratory and provide
further opportunities for senior projects.
