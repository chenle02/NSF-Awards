The principal investigator proposes to study the destruction of chaos and the
concurrent creation of structures (such as stable orbits and tori) in multi-
dimensional (three or more dimensions) volume-preserving and symplectic maps.
Both analytical and computational techniques will be employed. One approach is
based on the "anti-integrable" (AI) limit, introduced by Aubry in 1992. This
principle yields analytical bounds for the existence of chaotic dynamics, as
well as an efficient numerical technique for continuation of families of
periodic orbits. By extrapolation one can also follow quasiperiodic and
heteroclinic orbits as well. The destruction of chaos is signaled by the first
bifurcations in the system and the creation of order by the bifurcations that
create stable orbits and tori. A second project is to classify the heteroclinic
orbits and their bifurcations for a multi-dimensional version of the quadratic
Henon map. Classification will be given through construction of "primary
intersection manifolds," and by determining their homology on the "fundamental
annuli." A topological classification of structures in dynamical systems is
important both in the analysis of data, and in the interpretation of numerical
experiments. It is well known that chaotic systems often have fractal invariant
sets with various topological properties. These will be studied in this proposal
through the "disconnectedness" and "discreteness" of compact sets. The PI will
develop techniques for computational homology, yielding a definition for
"lacunarity" and computational methods for Betti numbers of resolution dependent
approximations to these sets.
