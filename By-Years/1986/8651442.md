This program will promote the benefits of using underutilized and often misused
education resources of zoological parks. The project will involve the University
of California at Irvine, Santa Ana and Irvine School Districts, San Diego and
Santa Ana Zoos, and other members of the recently formed Consortium of
Aquariums, Universities, and Zoos (CAUZ). Thirty-five Orange County inter-
mediate local teachers will have the opportunity to enhance their understanding
of science content and their professional experience through this unique
cooperative effort. The four-week summer workshop will approach natural science
through tropical forest and biological concepts. The proposed result will be the
development of a model classroom science program that will be easy to use and
feature exciting dimensions of teaching and learning.
