The proposed research focuses on using genetically-engineered microorganisms to
efficiently decontaminate hazardous waste sites. The natural ability of
bacterial cells to degrade organic compounds will be enhanced using the
techniques of genetic engineering. The goal will be to alter the genetic
information of the cell such that the genes that code for the enzymes
responsible for the degradation of 3-chlorocatechol will be uncoupled from their
wild-type regulator machinery. By replacing the wild-type promoter with one that
can be controlled externally, the bacteria can be engineered to degrade the
recalcitrant compound at faster rates. In addition, modifying the enzymatic
pathway will enable the bacteria to reduce the final residual concentration of
toxic wastes in the soil below the level that is currently achievable.
