This award is for partial support of a U.S.-China Workshop on the Climate-Energy
Nexus. The funds will be used primarily to support the travel and lodging of
invited U.S. scientists to participate in the workshop, and also for publication
costs. ORNL and the University of Tennessee Knoxville (UTK) will host the
workshop, which is to be held in November 2009 near UTK. Leading researchers
from China have agreed to participate in this workshop. The workshop is targeted
to facilitate the development of a U.S.-China partnership by establishing joint
research and education programs that will explore (a) critical research and
collaborative opportunities in global climate change, bioenergy sustainability,
ecosystem management, and technologies and strategies for mitigating carbon
dioxide emissions, (b) mechanisms for engaging students and junior researchers
in cross-cultural international research on global climate change and renewable
energy, and (c) preparation of a joint white paper to help guide future efforts
to mitigate climate change and develop bioenergy resources.
