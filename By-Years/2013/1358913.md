The underrepresentation of minorities in STEM fields is one of the major
challenges facing the United States workforce. Recognizing this problem, the
"New Worlds, New Horizons in Astronomy and Astrophysics" Decadal Survey,
published by the National Academies, noted that a promising way to address this
problem is to encourage strategic partnerships between minority-serving
institutions and research universities, national centers, and national
laboratories. This award will continue support for one such partnership: a
multi-faceted collaboration between South Carolina State University (SCSU), a
Historically Black College and University (HBCU) with a 94% African-American
student body, together with Clemson University (CU) and other individual
investigators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mission of the partnership is to
increase diversity in astronomy by (1) strengthening the recruitment and
retention of underrepresented minorities into graduate programs in astronomy in
general and into CU in particular, (2) providing a strong mentoring program that
includes enhancing students? research skills, and (3) boosting faculty
involvement in astronomy research at SCSU. By the end of this program, it is
expected that a long-term partnership between SCSU, CU, and others will be
formed, which will provide a sustainable pipeline for minority students in
astronomy.
