9315728 Meyer Dr. Meyer will utilize the latest generation of charge-coupled-
devices (CCDs) at the NSF supported National Optical Astronomy Observatories to
push the sensitivity of interstellar absorption line studies. The principal
goals in this research are to: (1) measure an isotope ratio of lithium in
several interstellar clouds and determine if there is a global value for the
solar neighborhood; (2) obtain a better understanding of the apparent NH
overabundance in diffuse clouds; and (3) investigate the possibility that metal-
bearing high velocity clouds of low column density could be common throughout
the halo of our Galaxy. The techniques being developed will be applicable to
future studies involving quasar absorption lines and the large ground-based
telescopes coming on line this decade.
