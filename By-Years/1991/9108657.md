A seismometer based on high-temperature superconductivity (HTSC) is proposed.
The seismometers will remain on scale during ground accelerations as great as 1
g, and will resolve ground noise over a frequency range extending approximately
from 10-4 hertz to 200 hertz. This performance regime may ultimately be extended
to include periods of months and frequencies up to one kilohertz. The HTSC
seismometer will be the first single instrument capable of detecting virtually
the entire spectrum of seismic phenomena. This full-range seismometer will have
broad applications in seismic observatories and networks, as well as special
applications in nuclear test monitoring and high-frequency seismometry. By
playing the roles of several conventional instruments, the HTSC seismometer will
reduce the overall cost of many seismic installations. The performance
advantages of the HTSC seismometer will be achieved by exploiting the inherent
sensitivity and stability of a displacement transducer based on modulations of
the resonance frequency a high-Q superconducting tan circuit. The use of this
transducer will simplify and miniaturize the suspension system of the proof
mass, as well as allowing the seismometer to resolve ground noise at increased
frequencies. The displacement transducer will require no advances in HTSC
technology. The use of high-temperature superconductors will allow the HTSC
seismometer to operate downhole for periods of weeks or months without
replenishment of cryogens.
