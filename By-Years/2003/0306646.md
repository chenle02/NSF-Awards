Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Over the last twenty years digital system design has gone
from LSI circuits of about 10,000 gates to current designs with 10-20M gates.
During this time the basic design abstraction has gone from graph based to
language based using RT-level specifications. Despite numerous attempts, high
level representations have not provided a practical mechanism for system level
design abstraction. In this work, we are side stepping conventional behavioral
approaches and are creating a new synthesis abstraction at the transaction
architectural level. Fundamentally, transactions have constrained sequential and
functional behavior but allow alternative construction and communication
freedom. Using techniques developed for formal verification as a basis, the
proposed framework promises to link architectural level modeling with
sequentially constrained RT-level design. Thus, difficult trade-offs at the
system level which require detailed sequential modeling can be represented
within an optimization framework. The project will construct prototype tools
producing RT-level output suitable for conventional synthesis as both driver and
evaluation of the techniques. &lt;br/&gt;
