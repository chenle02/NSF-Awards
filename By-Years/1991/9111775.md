This research employs the atomically flat grain-boundary facets which form as
the result of solute segregation in bismuth-doped copper as a model system with
which to study the relationship between grain boundary composition and structure
and the evolution of structure in a two component alloy. The principal
experimental tools are conventional and high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HREM). The approach is to identify crystallographic orientations of
the facet planes in each of two abutting grains for a grain pair of specific
misorientation, and then determine the location of the bismuth atoms in the
facets by HREM. These results are compared to atomistic calculations. Evolution
of facet types is examined as a function of time and annealing temperature. %%%
This research provides important information about the atomic-scale structure
and chemistry of segregation at grain boundaries. Grain boundaries play an
important role in determining the physical properties of polycrystalline
materials.
