9413022 Jordan University of Iowa Dr. Richard F. Jordan, Chemistry Department,
University of Iowa, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division for studies of the
design, reactivity, and catalytic applications of electrophilic early transition
metallocene complexes. Utilizing chiral, cationic complexes stereoselective
olefin polymerization will be accomplished and a detailed investigation of the
process will be undertaken. This phase of the study will also involve the
development of catalytic, stereoselective C-H activation. To more fully
delineate the interaction of these cations with unsaturated molecules, an olefin
complex will be characterized and the chemistry will be extended to carbon
monoxide. In order to modify the behavior of the metallocenes, carborane analogs
of the cations will be prepared. Olefin polymerization is one of the
industrially most important processes and is used in the production of such
polymers as polyethylene, polypropylene, and many others. The goal of this
research is to design new catalysts which can efficiently induce the formation
of well defined polymers which possess very regular arrangements of atoms.
