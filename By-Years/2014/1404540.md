A major topic under study in this project is mean curvature flow. Mean curvature
flow (MCF) has been used and studied in materials science for almost a century
to model phenomena such as cell, grain, and bubble growth. MCF's computational
and theoretical study, as well as that of other similar flows, have had enormous
impact in diverse areas of pure and applied mathematics, theoretical physics,
materials science, and engineering. A particular emphasis of this project is to
understand the evolution of a typical (or generic) surface. Are the
singularities of flow and the structure of the set where the singularities occur
simpler and nicer in the typical case than in bad
examples?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project is divided into four parts.
The first part concerns what happens to a hypersurface under the mean curvature
flow. This part is mostly concerned with hypersurfaces that are in general or
generic position before the flow starts. The mean curvature flow (MCF) is the
negative gradient flow of volume, so any hypersurface flows through
hypersurfaces in the direction of steepest descent for volume and eventually
becomes extinct in finite time. The project further develops the theory of
generic MCF, extending recent results to other flows. A second part of the
project concerns Ricci curvature. Previously estimates with applications have
been obtained by the PI and Naber, and recently monotonicity formulas have been
proved by the PI and used with Minicozzi to settle a long standing open problem
about uniqueness of tangent cones of Einstein metrics. This part of the project
discusses possible extensions and related conjectures. The third part of the
project concerns the longstanding classification problem in the theory of
Heegaard splittings of 3-manifolds: to exhibit for each closed 3-manifold a
complete list, without duplication, of all its irreducible Heegaard splittings,
up to isotopy. The final and smaller part of the proposal is about bounds for
nodal sets (or zero sets) of eigenfunctions.
