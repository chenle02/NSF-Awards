This project aims to build proxy records of speleothem stable isotopes to
discern decadal to centennial scale variability in eastern African hydroclimate.
The study site is sensitive to large- scale features of the global atmospheric
circulation (El nino Southern Oscillation, Walker circulation, monsoon system)
and new hydroclimate records will improve the understanding of the drivers of
decadal to millennial hydroclimate change in this key region and beyond.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the researchers will: 1) Establish a
highâ€“resolution multi-cave geochronology using extensive Uranium-Thorium (U-Th)
dating to determine the duration and magnitude of hydroclimate changes in East
Africa. These high-resolution dates will allow identification of active growth
intervals vs dry intervals as expressed across the network of caves; 2)
Characterize the role of different processes (e.g. large-scale atmospheric
circulations and convective processes, local land-atmospheric processes such as
re-evaporation etc, and karst hydrological processes such as mixing, recharge)
on modern rainwater and dripwater oxygen stable isotopes via the monitoring of
cave modern hydrology, analysis of instrumental climate data, and isotope-
enabled climate model output; 3) Carry out high-resolution reconstructions of
relatively short intervals at ~ 9000 years that are shared across several
stalagmites as identified through the U-Th dating targeting.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential Broader Impacts include generating a
detailed knowledge of the nature, timing, and local/regional extent of climatic
and environmental changes in Eastern Africa over the last 11,500 years and links
to large- scale features of the global atmospheric circulation. The project will
provide training for undergraduate and graduate students and will contribute to
training of next generation climate scientists particularly from
underrepresented groups. Focus will be on cross training in analytical
techniques, data analysis, and modeling. This project will facilitate knowledge-
based international cooperation with Ethiopian
universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
