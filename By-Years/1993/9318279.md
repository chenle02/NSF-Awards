9318279 Jansen The phylogeny or genealogical tree for a group of organisms
provides the framework for investigating all other aspects of their biology:
direction and degree of change in morphological features, physiological
adaptations, historical biogeography, modes of speciation, and coevolution with
ecologically associated organisms. Dr. Robert Jansen of the University of Texas
is studying the phylogeny of the sunflower family of plants, the Asteraceae, and
in particular the basal lineages of Mutisioid taxa with emphasis on acquiring
new molecular data from chloroplast and nuclear DNA. Between 80 and 120 genera,
mostly from the southern hemisphere, are to be sampled, and the molecular data
will be complemented with traditional morphological data as well as new
characters from the study of pollen and anthers. Chloroplast DNA data, much of
it from Dr. Jansen's laboratory over the last several years, have revolutionized
the study of phylogeny in the Asteraceae, and the addition of nuclear DNA data
and their integration with morphological characters should lead to a rigorous
phylogeny for this large and ecologically important family of flowering plants.
The Asteraceae, the largest family of dicots in the world, are phylogenetically
well studied, due in large part to efforts by Dr. Robert Jansen to apply modern
molecular methods of DNA analysis to these plants. Additional research will add
data from nuclear genes and also integrate these data with accumulating
knowledge of morphology, both traditional taxonomic features and new characters
from pollen and anther studies.
