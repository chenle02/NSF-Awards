A continuing series of grants since 1988 has made it possible for CIRES of the
University of Colorado, in collaboration with the NOAA Aeronomy Laboratory, to
construct, operate, and maintain VHF wind-profiling radars at four sites
stretching across the equatorial Pacific: Biak, Indonesia; Pohnpei, Micronesia;
Christmas Island, Kiribati; and Piura, Peru. Observations from the profiler at
Christmas Island are now assimilated into operational forecast models on a
routine basis. Ongoing research activities based on data from the network
include: (1) documentation of seasonal and interannual variability of winds over
the Tropical Pacific; (2) investigation of the structure of atmospheric Kelvin
waves, Rossby waves, and gravity waves; (3) measurement of the vertical
structure and amount of rainfall at the profiler sites; (4) obtaining data for
the validation of atmospheric models. The network fills both research and
operational needs for data on winds and precipitation in the Tropical Pacific -
a region important for the global climate, but where other sources of data are
scarce.
