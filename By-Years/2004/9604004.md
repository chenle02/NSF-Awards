9604004 Dawson Heme-containing peroxidases catalyze organic substrate oxidation
with concomitant reduction of hydrogen peroxide to water. Two novel heme-
containing peroxidases, one able to incorporate halogens into aromatic
substrates and the other able to remove them, have recently been isolated from
marine organisms and initially characterized. The properties of these enzymes
challenge the current dogma of how peroxidases function: one chlorinates
substrates without having a thiolate proximal ligand and the other both
oxygenates and dehalogenates haloaromatics including the defluorination of
fluoroaromatics. To better understand the unusual properties of these two heme
peroxidases, spectroscopic, structural and mechanistic investigations will be
carried out. These studies will involve the use of magnetic circular dichroism,
EPR, and resonance Raman spectroscopy as well as high resolution crystallography
to fully characterize the metal coordination structure and complete three
dimensional structures of these two enzymes. Their mechanisms of action will be
extensively examined including the use of isotopically labelled hydrogen
peroxide to compare and contrast their mechanisms of hydrogen peroxide
activation with those of the well studied plant peroxidases. Two novel enzymes
from marine sources which are capable of generating and/or handling halogen-
containing aromatic compounds have been isolated and will be thoroughly
investigated including the determination of their mechanism of action and three
dimensional structure. The first enzyme is able to incorporate halogens into
aromatic substrates and may find applications as an industrial biocatalyst in
the synthesis of halogen-containing aromatics. The second enzyme is able to
remove halogens from aromatic compounds and is likely to have applications in
bioremediation of water or soil contaminated with haloaromatics.
