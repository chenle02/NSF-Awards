This is a study of the evolutionary history of a group of South american
passerine birds,t he subfamily Furnariinae or ovenbirds. During geological
history, when South America was isolated from the other continents by water
barriers, this group underwent a remarkable adaptive radiation into a variety of
ecological roles which, in other parts of the world, are filled by members of
many other families. The comparative anatomy of the hindlimb musculature and
external morphology, including the bill, nostrils, feet, and tail, will be
studied by dissection and observation of museum specimens. anatomical variations
will be described and illustrated, and the direction in which characters evolved
will be determined. Using this information the phylogeny of pattern of common
descent will be generated by computer. This will reveal how different groups,
evolving separately, have developed adaptation for similar ways of life in
parallel. From the conclusions reached, the evolutionary history of the
ovenbirds will be clarified, the classification will be revised, and the insight
will be gained into the mechanisms and limitations of the evolutionary process.
