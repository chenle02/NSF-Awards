The objective of this research activity is to explore and further advance the
use of multiresolution algorithms for modeling, simulation, and visualization in
the semi-immersive 3D stereoscopic display environment provided by the
Responsive Workbench. This large scale (1.8 by 1.35m) horizontal display allows
users to interact naturally with virtual objects and datasets. It also places
heavy demands on rapid display and manipulation algorithms, requiring new
methodologies, which will be developed for 1) construction of subdivision
representations, 2) their compression for progressive transmission over
networks, 3) adaptive, level-of-detail display and 4) advanced manipulation
tools. This research will be able to leverage a strong ongoing program in
multiresolution modeling which has already demonstrated the power of the basic
multiresolution algorithms for geometric modeling tasks.
