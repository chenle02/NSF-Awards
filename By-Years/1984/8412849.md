Experimental and theoretical studies of wave propagation and discontinuities in
fluids undergoing phase change will be performed for fluids with large enough
molar heat capacity so that so-called retrograde behavior occurs. The phenomena
to be studied are rarefaction shocks, evaporation waves, and shock liquefaction
of vapor. These events involve unusual and so far neglected basic aspects of
gasdynamics and wave propagation, and may find application in fuel injection,
flow behavior in liquified natural gas, and nuclear reactor safety.
