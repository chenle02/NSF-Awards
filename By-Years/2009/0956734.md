This proposal requests funds for a three year commitment (2010 through 2012) to
support up to 18 UNOLS ships and 2 Polar Program Vessels with Inmarsat satellite
internet services via Fleet Broadband systems. This represents services for up
to 20 vessels. This proposal is a follow on to a successful pilot program funded
by NSF in 2008-09. This service will serve as a backup to the HiSeasNet and as
the primary communications system for vessels without HiSeasNet. WHOI proposes
that this Fleet Broadband (FBB) program include commercial support from the FBB
service provider for system maintenance and technical support for each of the 20
users in the system. Also included are support costs for management of the
program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The acquisition, maintenance and
operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any
US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their
research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of
potential researchers.
