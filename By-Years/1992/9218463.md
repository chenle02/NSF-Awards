This is a study of dolomite from Enewetak Atoll that employs new fluid
inclusion techniques and standard techniques to develop a new model for
dolomitization and to better understand the geochemical triggers responsible for
dolomitization. Thorough study of Enewetak dolomite using traditional indirect
techniques has proven less than adequate in constraining the model and
geochemical triggers of dolomitization. Alternatively, fluid inclusions provide
a direct record of the chemical composition of ancient dolomitizing fluids.
Freezing techniques will be applied to the Enewetak fluid inclusions to
determine the salinity of dolomitizing fluids. Reconnaissance data indicate that
the dolomite precipitated from a brine that was twice the salinity of
dolomitizing fluids. Reconnaissance data indicate that the dolomite precipitated
from a brine that was twice the salinity of seawater. Thus, a new model for
dolomitization involving reflux of brines that have not precipitated evaporites
is one of several hypotheses to be tested. Laser Raman microprobe work will
provide the first analyses of sulfate in an ancient fluid of low-temperature
dolomitization. Extracts from fluid inclusions will be analyzed for cations and
ions by DCP and IC to further characterize fluids of dolomitization. This new
approach will provide new insight into fluid evolution and geochemical triggers
of dolomitization. Such information cannot be gleaned by standard techniques.
Lastly, the dolomite will be analyzed by standard carbon, oxygen, and strontium
isotopic techniques to make the work directly comparable to other dolomite
studies and to further evaluate conditions of dolomitization.
