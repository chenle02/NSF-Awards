The School of Engineering at Morgan State University will enhance its
undergraduate, lower-level, electrical engineering laboratories by the addition
of GPIB instrumentation. This will enable the student to either manually control
an experiment or to develop a computer program to control the instrumentation
and take measurements with a computer. The computer control will also allow the
student to reconfigure the circuit under test rapidly, analyze the data with the
full power of the computer, and finally, display the data on a digital
oscilloscope.
