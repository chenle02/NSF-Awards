During the summer of 1995, a joint US-Norwegian-Russian Expedition in the
Norwegian-Greenland and Barents Sea discovered a warm gas vent located on an
ancient fracture zone known as the Hornsund Fault, at great distance from known
present-day plate boundaries in the region. The vent was characterized by high
heat flow, clathrates, H2S, and an unknown species of Pogonophore worm. This
award is to return rapidly back to the site, to map in detail, the extent of the
vent domain using a Russian vessel equipped with side-looking sonar and ROV. In
addition, it is to investigate likely sites along the Knipovich Ridge for recent
hydrothermal activity. It is believed that the examination of the warm gas vents
along the margin of the Barents Sea may shed new light on the degree of thermal
rejuvenation of ancient plate boundaries in the region, and the possible role
that warn vents in the Arctic region may play on deglaciation events, either in
modern settings on land (such as Spitsbergen) or in ancient glaciated regions,
such as the Bear Island Fan.
