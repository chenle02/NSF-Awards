This is a study of the influence of oxide supports (alumina and titania) and
acidic or basic promoters upon the molecular structures of supported vanadium-
oxide catalysts and their corresponding catalytic chemistry. Information on
molecular structure is provided by Raman spectroscopy, solid-state nuclear
magnetic resonance, and X- ray adsorption near-edge spectroscopy. In situ
spectroscopic studies reveal the influence of the reaction environment upon the
molecular structures of surface vanadium oxide. Reactivity of the catalysts is
determined from studies of catalytic oxidation of methane and methanol. The
objective of this work is to develop structure-activity relationships for
supported metal-oxide catalysts; such an achievement would make feasible the
design of catalysts for specific applications. Supported vanadium oxide is
chosen as the initial model because it has unusually diverse catalytic
chemistry, its inorganic and structural chemistry has been studied by others,
and it gives strong signals for powerful characterization techniques.
