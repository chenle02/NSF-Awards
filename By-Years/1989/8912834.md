This award will support in part the International Sym- posium on Lepton and
Photon Interactions at High Energies to be held at Stanford University on August
6-12, 1989. This is a biennial conference sponsored by the International Union
of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP). The topic of the conference is rather broad
and includes a large part of frontier work in the field of High Energy Physics.
The program will consists of invited talks on particular experiments from around
the world Ä±Mark II, CDF, UA1, UA2, ARGUS, CLEO...! and also review talks on a
particular area covering the results of a number of experimental or theoretical
developments.
