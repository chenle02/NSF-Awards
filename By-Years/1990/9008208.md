This project investigates techniques that allow programs written in the
Production System (PS) paradigm to reason correctly and efficiently with large
databases located on secondary storage. A class of stratified PS programs are
identified. For this class of programs, an operational semantics and a model
theoretic semantics are developed. The correct semantics ensure that a
stratified PS program will correspond to a consistent theory, the execution of
the program will not produce incorrect, inconsistent answers and execution of
the program will terminate. Implementation techniques for stratified PS programs
using relational data structures and relational queries are developed as well as
strategies for the concurrent execution of productions in stratified PS
programs. The results of this research will provide a foundation for expert
systems, written as stratified PS programs, to reason correctly and efficiently
with data in relational databases.
