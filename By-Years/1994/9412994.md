9412994 Jewell This award is supported through the Small Grants for Exploratory
Research Mechanism. This project investigates preprimary gubernatorial endorsing
conventions to be held by political parties in seven states in 1994, a year when
most governors are elected. These states are unique because party leaders are
trying to influence the outcome of the nominating process. The study of state
political parties has seldom emphasized the nominating process, and often it has
been limited to single-state case studies. This research project, by replicating
a cross- state study conducted in 1982, will permit comparative analysis both
across states and across time. The study will determine whether there have been
changes in the endorsement process, in the electoral success of endorsees, and
in the evaluations of the endorsement system by delegates attending the
conventions. ***
