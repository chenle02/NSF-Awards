9520375 Schmitt A compilation of the ocean water cycle will be assembled from
the modern evaporation, precipitation and river discharge data sets, making use
of new insights into how the ocean transports freshwater. The composite global
description of the ocean water budget will be compared with the output of
operational forecast models, new satellite precipitation products, and oceanic
freshwater flux divergence estimates to help refine the climatology and identify
areas where new measurements are particularly needed. This study will also
explore the dynamical and thermodynamical consequences of surface freshwater
fluxes on circulation and mixing in the ocean.
