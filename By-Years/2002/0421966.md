This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a
carbon dioxide sensor, using polymer modified carbon nanotudes, for patients
receiving anesthesia. The sensor technology relies on two important areas of
expertise : the nanotube transducer platform and gas analyte recognition layers.
The Phase II project objectives will include optimizing the platform and
recognition chemistries that were developed in Phase I. Once a technically
suitable recipe is known, sensor chips will be fabricated at the wafer level for
large scale testing. The capnography sensors will be packaged and embedded in
disposable adapters that fits directly into the patient airway. Hardware and
software systems will be designed and integrated with the adapter to deliver
sensor information to the end user. At the culmination of Phase II, the
capnography sensor system will be validated in a clinical environment and
positioned for FDA approval and subsequent market
introduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application of this project
will be in the area of healthcare. The proposed sensor will have the attributes
of low power, small size and low cost. &lt;br/&gt;
