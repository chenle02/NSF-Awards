Automated calls (often called "robocalls"), which may range in purpose from
telemarketing to outright fraud, have reached epidemic proportions. While some
robocalls are societally useful, there are plenty that are used for malicious
purposes. This is particularly concerning because some scam calls steal millions
of dollars annually, often from vulnerable populations including the elderly and
recent immigrants. Policy mechanisms like the National Do Not Call Registry have
failed to meaningfully stop these calls. Despite a clear need, the network
security community currently lacks the infrastructure and techniques needed to
provide insight into the scope of this problem, which prevents the development
and scientific validation of effective solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project is aimed at developing techniques to characterize and measure robocalls,
which will lead to better defenses against scam calls for end users. The project
will develop a new infrastructure to collect robocalls. This infrastructure will
facilitate the development of new techniques to measure the impact of victim
behaviors on robocallers, as well as comprehensive and systematic measurements
of robocalling trends including geographic, network and temporal
characteristics; common abuse trends; measurements of spoofing rates; and
characterization of robocall campaigns. Such insights will lead to better
detection and prevention of these calls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
