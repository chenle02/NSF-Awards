An interdisciplinary research group established at New York University devoted
to the development of new numerical methods for the study of quantum field
theory (primarily lattice gauge theories) and critical phenomena will continue
its operation. A special strength of the group will be the cross- fertilization
between the three disciplines represented by statistical mechanics. This
collaboration has led to the development of the multi-grid Monte Carlo method,
which shows great promise for radically improving the efficiency of Monte Carlo
method. The major project of the group will be to continue the investigation of
this method. A second project will be to develop new algorithms for computing
the fermion propagator in a backgroup gauge field; this is a key step in
numerical studies of lattice gauge theory with fermions. In addition, the group
plans to continue its investigations of algorithms for dynamical fermions, for
the random-resistor problem, and for the self- avoiding random walk.
