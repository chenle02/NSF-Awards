North Carolina State University's Tropical Soils Research Program and Colorado
State University's Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory continue to investigate
the determinants and consequences of soil organic matter (SOM) in the humid
tropics. Main activities consist of 1) determining the relative effects of soil
texture and clay mineralogy on total SOM content, 2) estimating the size of
different SOM functional pools, 3) relating their N and P supplying capacity to
texture and mineralogy, 4) determining the relative importance of physical
protection, chemical recalcitrance and nutrient availability on the SOM pools,
and 5) quantifying the effects of different land use practices on SOM pools. The
CENTURY model will be modified for use in tropical conditions. The results will
provide a deeper understanding of organic matter dynamics in soils with variable
charge which will serve as a base for improved agricultural sustainability in
the humic tropics and more realistic estimates of CO2 emissions to the
atmosphere upon deforestation. This is an excellent research team that pioneered
the development and calibration of the CENTURY model. The model has been used
extensively for studying soil development. The facilities available for this
research are excellent.
