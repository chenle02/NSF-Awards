Most synthetic colorants are coal tar derivatives many of which have been shown
to be potential causative agents of hyperactivity in children, cancer,
embryotoxicity and allergenicity. On the other hand, natural colors do not
exhibit these undesirable attributees and may, in fact, have a positive effect
on human health, presumably due to their activity as antioxidants and traps of
toxic metabolic intermediates. As sources of natural colorants, microalgae are
greatly underutilized. This award will support research needed to evaluate algal
pigments as potential colorants for food, cosmetic abd pharmaceutical products.
Initially carotenoid producing strains will be studied. Cultures of several
algal species which produce high levels of carotenoids will be established.
Conditions for optimum growth and carotenoid production will be determined.
Preparative amounts of the pigments will be extracted and tested. Finally a cost
analysis of the process will be performed. If the project is successful a safe
and useful souce of colorants will be made available to the food, cosmetic and
phamaceutical industry.
