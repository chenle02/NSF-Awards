This research will focus on the design, implementation and test of the
feasibility of a software module to translate spiral CT scan data sets of
discrete objects into solid mathematical models. This will prove the concept and
demonstrate the feasibility of direct input from discrete objects (and object
assemblies) into a state-of-the-art CAD/CAM/CAE system. It will automate the
process and prove the equivalence of mathematical models, replica objects
(created with stereolithography from the mathematical representations), and
original objects. The feasibility of Spiral CT for imaging object assemblies
will be demonstrated using phantom test fixtures. The images will be
automatically analyzed using a specially designed software system. The
researchers will develop and test methods for converting voxel data sets to
solid models and finally into stereolithography format. The solid models will be
compared with the original objects and the errors quantified. It is predicted
that the flexibility and data quality of object modeling by Spiral CT will prove
adequate for custom manufacturing applications.
