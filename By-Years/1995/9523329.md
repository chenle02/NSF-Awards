The PI plans to investigate the linear/nonlinear character of the geomagnetic
variation response at high, middle and low latitudes on the changing conditions
in near-Earth space, and study their global behavior within the 20-22nd solar
activity cycles. Moreover, he will obtain and study the global spatial
distribution of geomagnetic variations caused by the interplanetary magnetic
field (IMF) and solar wind changes. Next, he will apply spherical harmonic
expansions to the results and create a primary set of coefficients for the
Global Geomagnetic Variation Reference Field model. Finally, this model and its
global changes will be exploited on a scale of three decades for implications
into the Earth's interacting physical, biological, and human system models.***
