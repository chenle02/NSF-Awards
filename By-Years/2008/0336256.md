As knowledge-based innovation assumes an ever more important role in
contemporary societies there is a developing need to understand the role of
research policy as an agent of change and to incorporate this understanding into
social science research and public policy. On March 5, 2003, four investigators
held a planning meeting in Washington, D.C. at the National Science Foundation
(NSF) to explore the potential of this topic. This interdisciplinary group
thought about different approaches and held discussions with NSF program
officers. The deliberations resulted in a workshop plan, to consider ways to
develop a research program. The goal of the workshop is to identify research
priorities, infrastructure requirements, groups and organizations, including
international organizations, which would invest in a program to study research
policy as an agent of national and global change, as well as groups and
organizations that would use the research stemming from it. The workshop will
bring together scholars who study research policy from a variety of disciplines
and perspectives, and constitute new networks that will study research policy as
an agent of change. The workshop will also outline a series of small, follow-up
workshops that will follow from and flesh out the core ideas and areas of the
research initiative. This proposal is tied into a publishing program in which
the "deliverables" from the workshops reach scholarly communities through such
international, peer-reviewed journals as Research Policy, Science &amp; Public
Policy and the Journal of Technology Transfer and academic publishers with
organized lists in science and technology studies (potentially including SUNY,
Wisconsin, or Columbia). As the community of scholars who work on research
policy problems evolves, its members will develop planning documents for NSF
investment in this research area.
