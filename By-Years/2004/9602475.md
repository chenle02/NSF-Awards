9602475 Frankel This proposal for a workshop is to bring together workers in the
rapidly changing field of mouse molecular neurogenetics. The emphasis will be on
developmental mechanisms, and will bring together workers experienced in the
field, new researchers, and students. The laboratory mouse is one of the premier
experimental animals for molecular studies of the processes of neural
development . This will be the second such biennial meeting and will provide the
latest information concerning targeted mutation, genetic fine-mapping,
positional cloning, quantitative trait analysis, and sequencing and expression
of cloned genes.
