This program will develop a better understanding of the way in which fuel for
star formation settles into the galactic disk of the Milky Way from the
intergalactic medium. This goal will be accomplished through the use of survey
data from the Arecibo Observatory that helps trace the location of gas in and
near our Milky Way galaxy. Broader impacts of the work include training of
undergraduate and graduate students. The project will have a direct impact on
society through a program that brings astronomers into diverse middle schools
throughout New York City. The goal is to inspire students at a juncture where
they often choose to turn towards or away from science.

Dr. Putman and her students will construct a multiphase map of the interface
between the disk and halo of the Milky Way through the combination of a catalog
of clouds from the GALFA-HI Survey, examination of their dust content, and
comparisons to models and multi-wavelength observational data. The process of
cooling at the disk-halo interface will be explored, as well as the interplay
between accretion and feedback in controlling the star formation rate.
