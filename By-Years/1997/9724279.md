9724279 Narayan A field emission, atomic resolution, transmission electron
microscope will be acquired at North Carolina State University. The instrument
will support research in semiconductors, solidstate electronics, photonic
materials, ceramics, intermetallics and high temperature superconductors. The
microscope will also serve in the training of graduate students, both through
regular courses and through summer courses, and for establishing research and
training links with other institutions in the Research Triangle area. %%% The
high resolution electron microscope will impact the research of many
investigators working in problems that require such capability. The instrument
will also impact the education and research training activities of students both
at N.C. State and at other universities in the area. ***
