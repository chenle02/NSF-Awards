A FOURIER TRANSFORM INFRARED (FT-IR) Spectrometer with Attenuated Total
Reflectance (ATR) capabilities is being purchased for the dedicated use of
faculty within the Center for Biochemical Engineering. No such instrument exists
within the School of Engineering. The nearest FT-IR spectrometer resides in the
Chemistry Department at Duke and its use is dedicated to non-biological samples.
On-going and future projects of the principal investigators currently requiring
an ATR/FT-IR spectrometer include: In-Situ ATR/FT-IR SPECTROSCOPY OF BACTERIAL
ADHESION AND BIOFILM FORMATION 1. Molecular Chemistry of Bacterial Adhesion and
Immobilized Cell Physiology 2. Macromolecule Mass Transport Through Bacterial
Biofilms 3. Mechanisms Governing Bacterial Biofilm Sloughing ATR/FT-IR
SPECTROSCOPY OF ADSORBED PROTEIN FILMS 1. Protein Denaturation Upon Adsorption
2. Effects of Physiochemical Nature of Substratum on Adsorbed Protein Films 3.
Mechanisms of Ligand binding to Adsorbed Proteins ATR/FT-IR SPECTROSCOPY OF
ANCHORAGE-DEPENDENT MAMMALIAN CELL PROCESSES 1. Substratum Pretreatment Effects
on Anchorage-Dependent Mammalian Cell Adhesion 2. Shear Stress and Growth Factor
Effects on Anchorage- Dependent Mammalian Cell Physiology
