The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to advance long-form panoramic content
capture at reduced cost. While content creators and producers seek panoramic
content capture to create immersive viewing experiences, current approaches
integrate many shots that consequently require expensive and time-intensive
post-production. This project will save costs and labor by enabling seamless
real-time capture of cinematic-quality panoramic content. Potential applications
include security, risk and asset management, robotics, mapping, and live event
capture; sectors that can benefit include navigation, aviation, tourism,
construction, manufacturing, and entertainment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small
Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an innovative
camera system that fuses images captured through a camera array at the level of
the lenses, rendering a perfect 360Â° image instantaneously. Minimizing
overlapping image capture reduces the problems of parallax error and perspective
errors, while valuable camera resolution is not lost on redundancy. This project
will: 1) develop software; and 2) validate opto-mechanical alignment and
assembly concepts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
