The overall objective of this proposal is to characterize the morphology,
structure, geometry, and rheological properties of two representative hybridoma
cell lines in order to evaluate the effects of well defined hydrodynamic forces
on such cells, and to establish membrane failure criteria that result in cell
damage and cell death. A range of experimental techniques (electron, light and
fluorescence microscopy, micropipet manipulation, rheoscopy, and micro-
rheometry) will be used to evaluate the aforementioned properties, and to
determine the influence of hydrodynamic forces on the cells in simple (laminar
and turbulent) flow, and in complex turbulent flows that model more closely the
fluid environment in bioreactors. Mechanisms of membrane and cell damage will be
evaluated by combining experimental measurements with fluid flow studies and
theoretical calculations. These studies are essential to improve and/or
simplifiy bioreactor design, and to promote the optimal growth conditions, for
the mass production of monoclonal antibodies.
