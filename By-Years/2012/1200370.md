The principal investigator will investigate the geometry of Banach spaces and
its applications to many other areas of mathematics, especially logic and set
theory. The techniques of Banach space theory provide strong tools for the study
of operator theory, Fourier analysis and frame theory. More specifically, the
investigator will study the factorizations of operators between classical Banach
spaces such as the space of p-power integrable functions and p-power summable
sequences. Intrinsic classifications of commutators of operators on Banach
spaces with Pelczynski decomposition will be explored. The theory of Lipschitz
p-summing, Lispchitz p-integral and Lipschits p-nuclear operators between metric
spaces will be developed. Metric spaces with the Lipschitz lifting property will
also be investigated. Necessary and sufficient conditions for Schauder frames to
contain a subsequence that is a Schauder basis will be studied as well.

Banach spaces provide a framework for linear and non-linear functional analysis,
probability, and optimization and are of fundamental importance in partial
differential equations and mathematical models in quantum mechanics. Hence, the
impact of advances in this branch of pure mathematics is far-reaching, extending
across many areas of mathematics as well as to theoretical physics and multiple
applications related to computer science and engineering. For instance, the
study of Lipschitz mappings between metrics spaces has shown great impact on
theoretical computer science and the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics
is ultimately a theorem about commutators of operators. The principal
investigator will also support one graduate student on this project, and
priority will be placed on selecting a qualified student from historically
underrepresented background.
