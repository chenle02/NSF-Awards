9416248 Elgamal Earthquake acceleration histories were recorded on and around
eight well instrumented earth dams within a 50 mile radius of the 1994
Northridge earthquake epicenter. These dams were also subjected to strong ground
shaking during the 1971 San Fernando, and the 1987 Whittier earthquakes. A large
data set of valuable input and response acceleration histories is currently
available (Northridge, Whittier, and San Fernando earthquakes) for calibration
and verification of simplified as well as elaborate computational analysis
procedures. Past analyses of the San Fernando and Whittier recorded
accelerations have significantly contributed to our understanding of earth dam
seismic response mechanisms; contributions which were possible only through
analyses of actual full-scale seismic response. The recently recovered
Northridge acceleration histories offer a unique opportunity to build on the
results of thorough studies conducted earlier for the Santa Felicia,
Puddingstone, Cogswell and Brea dams. The objective of this project is to: (i)
conduct a predictive (Class A/B) computational analysis for each dam using the
dynamic properties identified earlier from the San Fernando and/or Whittier
earthquakes, (ii) critically assess the previously identified earth dam
characteristics in view of the newly acquired Northridge data set (of different
shaking amplitudes and frequency contents), (iii) define simplified
analysis/design procedures, and clearly identify any associated limitations
and/or strengths, and (iv) document the identified properties in a database form
that includes a large number of modern earth/rockfill dams in Northern
California (Lexington, Anderson and Long Valley dams), Southern California
(Santa Felicia, Puddingstone, and Brea dams), and Mexico (La Vilita and El
Infiernillo dams). ***
