9322807 Kazerooni This research investigates the use of extenders to support
material handling functions in situations where weight lifting by workers is
involved. Extenders are computer-controlled material handling device that are
worn by workers to maneuver loads in work places to minimize the weight
intensity and exaction level felt by the worker. It is hypothesized that these
devices, when worn by workers to maneuver loads, do prevent back injuries. The
research includes the analysis of maneuvers needed to lift, move, and transfer
loads, quantify the performance of extenders in terms of workers, physiological
characteristics, design a lightweight electromagnetic actuator that behaves like
Hill's model of extenders, and develop adaptive control rules which will prevent
human induced instability in the presence of variation in human arm dynamics.
This research focuses on providing a solution to a real and practical problem
that is felt in various sectors of our economy. If the research goals are
realized, the outcome will have a significant impact on cost savings, especially
in those industrial segments of the economy in which significant weight lifting
by workers is involved. Annual cost and losses in productivity due to back
injury cases in industry is staggering. This research does offer some potential
to minimize these losses and improve employees' working conditions and morale.
