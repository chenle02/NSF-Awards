This research is joint work of Sergei Nirenburg at Carnegie Mellon University
and Victor Raskin at Purdue University. Their goal is to advance the state of
the art in knowledge bases for natural language processing. They are building
knowledge bases about words, word meanings and word relationships, extended
beyond "toy" domains to be comprehensive enough for natural language processing
in realistic situations. These kinds of "computational lexicography" knowledge
bases are fundamental to automatic computer systems for analyzing natural
language and for generating natural language output. The significance of this
research is that automatic processing of natural language is a major component
in developing computer systems interface. Computerized knowledge bases about
word meanings and world knowledge are indispensable to natural language
processing systems. This work begins to build the framework for such knowledge
bases and the tools for acquiring their content, in a way which will be useful
to many research groups and suitable for diverse applications.
