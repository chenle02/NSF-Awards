This project teams elementary school teachers with middle and high school
teachers who are veterans of a previous project (ASSIST: TPE-8751767) in a
summer institute for science teachers to be held at the University of Michigan
Biological Station. The summer program will be characterized by flexibility and
options to meet the varying needs of veteran and new participants. During the
first year following the summer session, participants will implement in their
classrooms one or more of the units introduced during the summer session. During
the second summer, secondary and elementary teacher teams will work with their
respective administrators to develop a program of professional development to be
implemented in their schools. Project staff will provide support and site visits
during the first year of implementation. Formative and summative evaluations, a
Winter Reunion, site visits by staff, and assessments when units are implemented
are means by which the project's effectiveness will be evaluated. This project
is appropriate for the Teacher Enhancement Program because it (1) is designed to
enhance the science knowledge and teaching of elementary school teachers through
a emersion in a nature setting as they explore biological concepts and phenomena
and learn appropriate methodology and materials to use in their elementary
school classrooms; (2) provides veterans (high school teachers) of a previous
enhancement program the opportunity to deepen and build upon knowledge acquired
during participation in that program; and (3) contains an amplification plan
which will be developed and implemented by teams composed of veteran (high
school), and elementary teachers, and their school administrators. Non-NSF cost
sharing is $61,524 or approximately 11% of the amount requested from NSF.
