The western Banda arc is a natural laboratory where plate collision is in
progress. This study will construct a series of balanced cross-sections across
the orogen using newly available map and geophysical data, and field data to be
acquired during the project. Because the Banda orogen is a good example of
oblique collisional processes, it offers an opportunity to analyze the sections
in 3D space plus time. The results will help resolve existing hypotheses for the
evolution of the Banda orogen and will be applicable to collisional orogenic
processes in general.
