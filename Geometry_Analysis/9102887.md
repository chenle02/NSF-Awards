Professor Pesin will study the stochastic behavior of trajectories in smooth
dissipative dynamical systems with singularities having attractors which are
close to classical hyperbolic attractors. The object will be to describe the
geometric structure of the attractors by calculating their dimension like
characteristics. The principal investigator will also consider the appearance of
space-time chaos in the lattice models which are constructed as a chain of
strongly hyperbolic dynamical systems. This research involves random dynamical
systems. These systems are used to model the behavior of large numbers of
interacting particles and therefore the potential applications are significant.
Previous work of Professor Pesin has recently become important because it gave
considerable information on the dimension parameters of the attractors of the
system. There is an indication that the current research will also find
immediate application.
