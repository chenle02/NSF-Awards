The subject of this proposal is to study the topology,
geometry,&lt;br/&gt;combinatorics, and statistics of such spatial configurations
as knots,&lt;br/&gt;links, braids, and polygonal simple spatial curves. Five
specific topics&lt;br/&gt;and related research projects are proposed. They range
from the knot&lt;br/&gt;classfication problem, a folding problem of polygonal
simple curves in the&lt;br/&gt;3-space, a possible statistic pattern of the
roots of the Jones&lt;br/&gt;polynomial, some problems about representations of
braid groups, and the&lt;br/&gt;study of higher order knot signatures. Some of
the problems addressed in&lt;br/&gt;this proposal are major open problems in the
field of low dimensional&lt;br/&gt;topology. The folding problem of polygonal
simple spatial curves addressed&lt;br/&gt;in this proposal aims at showing that
there is essentially no topological&lt;br/&gt;obstruction for the protein
folding problem in molecular biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The phenomena of
knotting and braiding are fundamental in 3-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;spatial
structure. A mathematical description and understanding of
such&lt;br/&gt;phenomena is essential to our knowledge of the natural world, and
is the&lt;br/&gt;major goal of the study of low dimensional topology. The
discrete methods&lt;br/&gt;of analyzing 3-dimensional spatial structures
developed in the study of&lt;br/&gt;low dimensional topology are proven to be
significant to many other&lt;br/&gt;branches of science and applied research,
particularly physics, molecular&lt;br/&gt;biology, and computer graphics. In
this proposal, a major effort will be&lt;br/&gt;spent on solving an abstract
version of the protein folding problem, which&lt;br/&gt;is a central problem in
modern molecular biology, using these methods.&lt;br/&gt;These methods are also
fundamental in the development of a student's&lt;br/&gt;ability to visualize and
analyze 3-dimensional configurations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
