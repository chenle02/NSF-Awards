PI: Fran B.M. deWaal Proposal # 9603923 Reciprocal exchange of goods and
services is a universal human economic activity. In animals, so called
reciprocal altruism is a much-discussed yet much less investigated issue. Data
accumulated over the past two decades are largely based on observational
research; there is little agreement about the strength of the evidence. Food-
sharing among capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) - one of the few nonhuman primate
species in which such behavior is well - developed - may yield a handle on
exchange: this behavioral lends itself uniquely to experimentation. After first
having studied sharing behavior itself, and the degree to which it occurs
reciprocally, the purpose the present study is to investigate to what extent, if
at all, it is used by capuchins as a payment for cooperation. For reciprocal
exchange to occur it would seem necessary that individuals not only assist
conspecifics, but also take notice of received assistance. The central question
here is whether rewards obtained through cooperation are more readily shared
than rewards obtained through individual effort. Trained for temporary
separation from their group, our capuchin monkeys have shown high rates of food
transfer to each other through a mesh partition. Pairs of monkeys will be
presented with tasks in which one subject cannot obtain food unless assisted by
the other. Food will be placed outside a test chamber on a tray too heavy for a
signal monkey to pull close. If both monkeys pull together, however, one of them
will obtain food subsequently can be shared with the other. Variation on this
task, and control procedures will be performed as well. If cooperative efforts
do indeed promote sharing, this would suggest that the principle of one good
turn deserve another is not limited to our own species.
