This research program will involve theoretical, computational, and experimental
studies of various problems in fluid mechanics. The problems have as a common
theme consideration of viscous flows with free boundaries. Numerical predictions
of free surface shapes will be compared with experimental measurements.
Stability of free surface flows, and possible time-dependent flow states, will
be examined. This work should lead to an improved understanding of travelling
waves, the propogation of bores, the development of edge waves, and the movement
of sand bars under the action of water waves.
