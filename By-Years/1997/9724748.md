9724748 Fraumeni This three-year award supports US-UK cooperative research in
education economics between Barbara Fraumeni at Northeastern University and
Nicholas Oulton at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research in
London. The objective of their project is to generate improved measures of
investment in education and human capital in the United Kingdom from the 1950s
up to the present. The US and UK investigators will apply a methodology for
valuing investment in education developed by Dr. Fraumeni and her research
partner Dale Jorgenson of Harvard University. The estimates of education output
and investment in the UK will then be compared to estimates for the US and
Sweden and used to determine the efficiency of the education sector and the
impact of investment in human capital to economic growth. The US investigator
brings to this collaboration expertise on the theoretical approach and knowledge
of the US and Swedish systems. This is complemented by the British
investigators' expertise on the UK economy and education system and their access
to education data in the UK. ***
