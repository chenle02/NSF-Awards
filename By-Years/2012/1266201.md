The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanism B (CSDM-B) program supports
Professor Michael R. Wasielewski of Northwestern University to carry out
fundamental studies on controlling the spin dynamics of complex multi-spin
molecular systems that target spintronics and quantum information processing.
Fast photo-initiated electron transfer within covalently-linked organic donor-
acceptor molecules having specific donor-acceptor (D-A) distances and
orientations results in the formation of spin-entangled electron-hole pairs
(i.e. spin-correlated radical ion pairs, SCRPs) having well-defined initial spin
configurations and magnetic spin-spin interactions. The project focuses on the
demanding task of controlling spin coherence within organic molecular arrays
using SCRPs in tailored covalent structures. The specific goals are to
investigate: 1) What is the scope of spin coherence transfer by optical
excitation of an SCRP? 2) What factors determine coherence dephasing in SCRPs?
3) Can coherent spin states be transported ("teleported") over long distances
using SCRPs? 4) Can nuclear spins be used to store and retrieve coherent
electron spin states produced by an SCRP? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developing a
fundamental understanding of how to control charge and spin transport through
organized arrays of organic molecules is critical to the development of new
electronics and spintronics especially with regard to their potential impact on
computers and information processing. Taking advantage of the quantum nature of
electron spin may lead to advanced computer technologies with broad applications
throughout society. The use of organic materials and bio-inspired approaches to
these problems offers the possibility of developing solutions that are not only
versatile, but are cost effective and environmentally benign as well.
