The award will continue this important line of research on the dynamics of wages
and unemployment in labor markets characterized by the disappearance of old jobs
and creation of new ones. This is a dimension of labor market dynamics that has
not received much attention in macroeconomics; yet, it is essential to analyzing
a number of central issues in macroeconomics such as inflation and price setting
and the dynamics of aggregate employment. The authors have already developed an
explicit model of the flows of workers in labor markets with continual job
creation and job destruction; derived the implied behavior of the major
aggregates, unemployment, and job vacancies; and begun constructing a wage
determination model in decentralized markets. This continued research will
extend the theoretical models of labor dynamics and will involve additional
empirical work using Canadian employment data which tends to be of higher
quality than available US data. The authors will also continue to analyze the US
employment data. This research is important because it will provide a better
basis for understanding the persistance of high unemployment rates which have
plagued the US and other developed economies to various degrees over the past
twenty years.
