This project seeks to develop techniques that reduce the cost of developing
program execution monitors for systems programming languages. These techniques
include automated instrumentation of the application, a shared-memory coroutine
relationship between the monitor and target program, and dynamic loading and
binding of monitors to target programs. The resulting monitoring framework is
expected to be used to explore a particular problem in execution monitoring: the
control of execution by graphic specification. Execution monitors that use
visualization techniques would provide execution controls using the same visual
metaphors for graphic input as are employed for output.
