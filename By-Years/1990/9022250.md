Symposium, "Scientific Frontiers and International Issues," an international and
multidisciplinary group of about 50, will consider the future role of science in
international concerns by examining the prospects in three areas--materials
science, communications and information, and biology--and the implications of
each for such global issues as basic human needs, natural resource use, military
and economic security, and education and training.
