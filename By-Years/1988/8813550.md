Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectroscopy is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The Department of Chemistry
of the University of Wisconsin will use this award from the Chemistry Shared
Instrumentation program to help acquire a high-field NMR spectrometer. Among the
areas of chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition are the
following: 1) Small to large transition metal clusters 2) Boron cluster
chemistry 3) Hydrazine derivatives 4) Biopolymer interactions 5)
Organophosphorous chemistry 6) Organosilicon chemistry.
