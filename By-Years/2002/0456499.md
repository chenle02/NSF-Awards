It is intended to undertake several related investigations into processes of
high energy atomic&lt;br/&gt;physics, including their extension toward lower
energies. This involves studying the interactions&lt;br/&gt;of photons and
electrons with correlated atomic structures, including circumstances in
which&lt;br/&gt;there are several interacting continuum particles in the final
state. These studies can yield&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the role of
relativistic, retardation and higher multipole effects in
regimes&lt;br/&gt;where they become comparable to or dominate the many electron
correlation effects, and it can&lt;br/&gt;lead to an identification of the
nature of the correlation effects which persist at high
energies.&lt;br/&gt;Specific studies include: examining high energy behaviors of
atomic processes, the extent to&lt;br/&gt;which these behaviors follow from the
singularities of photon and electron interactions, and the&lt;br/&gt;extent to
which they depend on correlations; understanding other global features of
processes,&lt;br/&gt;such as analyticity, also the trajectories of zeroes which
serve as a surrogate for structural&lt;br/&gt;information; clarifying the
relations and transitions between classical and quantum behavior;
and&lt;br/&gt;studying the relationships among observables, partitioning, and
entanglement. Other projects&lt;br/&gt;include considerations of deficiencies in
the description of basic processes, such as Delbruck&lt;br/&gt;scattering and
bremsstrahlung, and characterization of atomic processes (such
as&lt;br/&gt;photoionization, Rayleigh and Compton scattering and
bremsstrahlung) and the independent&lt;br/&gt;atomic information they
contain.&lt;br/&gt;
