This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop an
optimized manufacturing process for new robust, high efficiency, polymer piezo
actuators and transducers based on polyvinylidene di-fluoride (PVDF) - carbon
nanotube nanocomposites. These new actuators and transducers have recently been
demonstrated in the laboratory and have shown a remarkable 300-500 % performance
improvement over current technology. It appears they can be made with the same
or lower cost using existing extrusion manufacturing techniques. In the proposed
project scale-up strategies for low cost manufacture and commercialization will
be examined particularly in terms of how they impact the performance of the
actuator or transducer. Comparisons will be made to commercially relevant
standards to identify the optimal process. &lt;br/&gt; Commercially, these
materials are used in a variety of applications, such as switches, computer
graphics, infrared detectors, ultrasonic medical imaging, musical instrument
pickup, hydrophones, and transducers for military and civilian sonar
applications. The transducer composite and polymer film market equaled $222
million in 2000, and is expected to grow to $340 million by 2005.
