ABSTRACT CTS-9402911 Grigoropoulos The proposed research focuses on the
application of pulsed laser sputtering for selective removal of material from a
surface and for the deposition of thin films. The physical mechanisms of laser-
induced ablative material removal, as a function of their dependence on the
laser fluence, wavelength, pulse duration, the target material properties, and
the properties of the background fluid environment will be studied. In addition,
the mechanisms of ablative material removal and the speed and motion of the
ejected particles will be determined through modeling and numerical simulations.
Finally, the practical aspects of laser sputtering will be investigated and
optimized by controlling and redirecting the induced flow and rejecting heavy
clusters. As a result of this work, the use of novel applications will be
enhanced through a better understanding of laser ablation, especially for thin
film materials.
