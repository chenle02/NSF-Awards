The G-machine is a language-directed architecture for evaluation of functional-
language programs by graph reduction. This grant focuses on novel compiler
optimization needed to make the full power of declarative programming in lazy
functional languages available without paying a large performance penalty.
Utilizing the compiler and simulator already developed, the following topics are
being explored; 1. Vector Nodes, 2. Narrowing, 3. Detection of non-terminating
computations, 4. Wrapped and Unwrapped Functions, 5. Design of a fast P-stack,
and 6. Efficiency of higher-order function applications.
