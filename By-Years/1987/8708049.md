Recent studies carried out by the applicants and other investigators
established that nerve growth factor (NGF) acts as a neurotrophic factor for
cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain. We found that NGF elevates choline
acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity and growth of cholinergic fibers in cultures
of dissociated forebrain neurons. We now propose to study the regulation of NGF
receptor expression by cultured cholinergic neurons and the influence of NGF
receptor protein and NGF receptor mRNA will be measured. We furthermore plan to
investigate whether the NGF-mediated increase in ChAT activity reflects elevated
levels of ChAT protein and mRNA and whether thyroid hormones, which elevate ChAT
activity of cultured cholinergic neurons in a similar way as NGF, act by
affecting NGF-reflected mechanism. In studies on adult rats, we earlier found
that NGF prevents the retrograde degeneration of cholinergic septohippocampal
neurons after axonal transection. It is now proposed to investigate the temporal
requirements for cholinergic neurons, to study whether NGF treatment stimulates
fiber growth from remaining cholinergic neurons into the partly denervated
hippocampus, and to test whether NGF treatment is effective in lesioned, aged
animals. The studies will further elucidate the role of NGF in development and
aging of forebrain cholinergic neurons and in their response to injury and might
help to understand the decline of cholinergic functions in aging and
neurological diseases.
