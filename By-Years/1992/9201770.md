This study entails processing of Antarctic-Pacific East Pacific Rise (EPR)
gravity data with the objective of further developing existing procedures to
generate maps of free-air gravity anomalies, Bouguer anomalies and residual
gravity anomalies. A profile of gravity anomalies along the entire Pacific-
Antarctic EPR will be generated to investigate their relationship to ridge
segmentation processes. The availability of swath-mapping data will enhance the
subsurface interpretation and lead to a better understanding of accretionary
plate boundary at the EPR.
