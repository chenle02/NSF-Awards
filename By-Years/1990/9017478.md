This award provides two-thirds of the funding for acquiring a computerized
control and analysis system for specialized microscopy of rock deformation
experiments. The equipment is to be installed and used in the Department of
Geological Sciences at the State University of New York in Albany. The SUNY
system is committed to providing the remaining one-third funding for the
acquisition of the equipment. Rocks and minerals subjected to mechanical stress
and chemical changes deform very slowly over geologically significant periods of
time. Much insight on the processes of recrystallization, diffusive transfer of
material, phase transformations and other processes that influence the
mechanical-chemical behavior and the microstructure of deformed rocks can be
harvested from studying, under the microscope, the deformation of synthetic
analogs during much shorter time scales. The acquisition of this equipment will
allow one of the leading research groups performing this type of research to
automate the control, recording, and analysis of the microstructural evolution
of rock deformation.
