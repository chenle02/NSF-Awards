This project comprises a systematic evaluation of the catalytic properties and
potential applications of a new class of materials. These thin-shell catalysts
have been the subject of much speculation, but until now proper study has not
been possible. The situation has been altered by the development of a reliable
and reproducible method for making these materials. They are sufficiently
different from classical catalysts to make prediction of their properties
uncertain, but their utility should be more apparent at the completion of this
project.
