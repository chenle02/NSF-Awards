John Frederick is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to continue his studies of the dynamics of photoisomerization
and nonadiabatic relaxation processes. The objective of this work is to develop
detailed models for the electronic and vibrational dynamics of the photoinduced
processes in the hexatriene and octatetraene systems. Quantitatively accurate
potential energy surfaces for the lowest three singlet states of these systems
and the nonadiabatic coupling between them will be derived using a combination
of high-level ab initio calculations and spectroscopic data. Ultrafast internal
conversion and isomerization processes in these systems will be studied using
both quasiclassical and quantum dynamics. A number of specific questions
regarding the photochemistry and photophysics of these systems will be
elucidated. The photochemistry of polyenes is of central importance in a number
of natural processes, such as vision and photosynthesis, and in the development
of organic materials with conducting and photochromic properties. The proposed
work has a potential for significant scientific impact in providing a molecular
level interpretation of these phenomena.
