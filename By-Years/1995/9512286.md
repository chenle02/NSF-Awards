ABSTRACT Gary L. Leal University of Cal Santa Barbara Proposal No. CTS-9512286
The Department of Chemical and Nuclear Engineering at UCSB has become world
renowned for experimental and theoretical studies of the dynamics of microscale
flow systems relevant to understanding and controlling interfacial and
tribological phenomena at the molecular scale, as well as the dynamics and
coalescence of microbubbles and drops. The studies of interfacial and
tribological phenomena are carried out in the Surface Forces Apparatus,
developed in the laboratory of Professor J. Israelachvili. The dynamics and
coalescence of very small gas bubbles is being studied by Professor L. G. Leal
in collaboration with scientists at JPL-NASA, using state of the art acoustic
Levitation techniques.
