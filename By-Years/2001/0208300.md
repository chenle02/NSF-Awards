This project will focus on developing methods for analysis and retrieval of
human activities in video databases that also can facilitate efficient means for
highly compressed storage. For this purpose, it is proposed to develop a novel
representation method for human activities. Such a representation is termed as
action script and it includes a detailed sequence of human actions that fully
describe the 3D motions of all the major body parts. Action scripts can be
extended to describe actions of multiple persons as well and could also become
an innovative means for highly efficient summarization, retrieval and
recognition of complex human activities in video
databases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another objective of this proposal is to develop
innovative querying tools that facilitate efficient definition and retrieval of
single/multi person activities in video databases. The approach proposed is
founded on an extension of an innovative method, recently developed by the PI,
for&lt;br/&gt;Recognition of human activity by Indexing and Sequencing (RISq).
The RISq requires only few video samples and provides fast and robust
recognition even in conditions of partial occlusion and varying speeds. It is
proposed to further extend the RISq method for the proposed generation and
recognition of action scripts of individuals and groups. This is an entirely
unexplored domain that could lead to significant scientific contributions in
analysis and management of video databases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
