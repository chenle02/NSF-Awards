This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a
targeted combined imaging and therapeutic agent for lung cancer. A near-infrared
absorbing nanoparticle will be linked with a ligand for a cell surface protein
expressed in many cancers, the folate receptor and a radionuclide commonly used
in single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). After infusion into the
blood stream, the targeting ligand will cause the particle to bind to tumor
cells, enabling both tumor detection as well as therapy. The radiolabel attached
to the particle will be used to identify accumulation of the particles within
the tumor or micro-metastases by instrumentation currently available for SPECT.
The tumor cells can then be thermally ablated by applying near-infrared laser
illumination to the identified area.

The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to provide a
technology for the detection and treatment of the regional or distal metastases,
which may significantly improve the outcomes of lung cancer therapy. The
sensitivity of the radiolabel and the selectivity of the targeting ligand will
allow the detection of early disease. There were an estimated 159,390 deaths due
to lung cancer in the US in 2008. In 2009, the incidence of lung cancer in the
US is estimated to be 219,440 cases. Lung cancer is also highly prevalent
outside the US. Most patients are diagnosed after the cancer has metastasized
which significantly decreases the chance of survival. This technology may
provide a possibility to image and target early disease or regional or distal
spread and allow more effective treatment of lung cancer.
