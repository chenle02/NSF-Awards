9406263 Brantley PI will investigate rates of weathering reactions and mineral-
derived nutrient cycling within a well-instrumented site in a humid-tropical
climate in the Luquillo Mountains of Puerto Rico. This project is in
collaboration with the U.S. Geological Survey and takes place on a (USGS) WEBB
and (NSF) LTER site in the Icacos watershed. Understanding rates and mechanisms
of chemical weathering is a key to developing global carbon dioxide budgets and
resulting global change. Results will also provide new insights into weathering
and biogeochemical cycles in tropical environments, which, though comprising
only 25% of the Earth's surface, contribute almost 40% of the river ionic load
to the world's oceans.
