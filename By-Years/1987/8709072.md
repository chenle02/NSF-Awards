This research, funded as an Engineering Research Initiation Award, develops
methods of logic inference for parallel computers. The proposed scheme is based
on maintaining logical data in related clusters. Reasoning (resolutions) on
these clusters can be performed concurrently on multiple processors. This
approach will utilize existing multicomputers; no special-purpose architecture
is assumed. Optimal methods of of partitioning clause sets and managing clause
migrations will be studied analytically and experimentally. Knowledge based
systems cannot effectively use logical inference unless reasoning can be carried
out at high speed. The importance of this research is that parallel processing
offers one promising route to the necessary speedup; logical clustering is a
method to "divide and conquer" a logical inference problem, spreading the
computation effectively among many separate processors.
