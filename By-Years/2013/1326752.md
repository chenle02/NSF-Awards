This award funds the participation of undergraduate students in the American
Economic Association Summer Training Program. The goal of the AEASTP is to help
talented undergraduate students learn skills and conduct research in economics
in preparation for studies at the doctoral level. The program is in open to all
qualified students regardless of race, ethnicity, or gender. Organizers make
special efforts to recruit students from groups under-represented in the
economics profession. The program combines a research experience with intensive
coursework and career mentoring. The program is currently conducted by the
University of New Mexico.

The road to successful Ph.D. study in economics can be a rocky one, especially
for students coming from minority-serving institutions and institutions that do
not have a strong research focus. Obstacles include undergraduate economics
curricula that are often oriented towards the most popular student career goal -
business - than Ph.D. study, a lack of familiarity with the application process,
and financial limitations. One consequence is that several important demographic
groups are under-represented on economics faculties in the U.S. . AEASTP
addresses these roadblocks in a direct way.
