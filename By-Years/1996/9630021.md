The research will explore mechanisms to mitigate shortcomings of traditional
meeting and negotiation processes that take place during software development.
Requirements for collaborative design meeting environments will be identified
and mechanisms to satisfy these requirements will be explored. This research is
part of the CAIRO (Collaborative Agent Interaction Control and Synchronization)
effort which is the core of the DaVinci change management project at the
Intelligent Systems Engineering Laboratory. The project aims to test a
distributed communication infrastructure, automated coordination and
facilitation mechanisms, and a design-rationale capture (group-memory)
framework. The CONACYT collaboration with the Centro de Investigacion
(Cientifica y de Educacion Superior de Ensenada (CICESE) in Mexico includes both
research and educational thrusts. The design rationale capture (group memory)
system developed at CICESE will be integrated with the CAIRO environment, and
the CICESE effort will focus on the design of intelligent-agent representatives
that will automatically determine user preferences within CAIRO. Coupling and
MIT systems will provide an effective environment for exploring distributed
collaboration.
