Rosaceous stone fruits (Prunus spp.) are among many commercially important crops
causing cyanide poisoning in humans and livestock through their release of
hydrogen cyanide from cyanogenic glycosides by endogenous enzymes. To understand
better the biochemistry and physiology of plant cyanogenesis, the metobolism of
the cyanoglycosides (R)-prunasin and (R)-amygdalin will be investigated in black
cherry (Prunus serotina) using biochemical, immunocytochemical and molecular
approaches. Levels of prunasin, amygdalin, two biosynthetic enzymes
(UDPG:mandelonitrile glucosyltransferase (GT I) and UDPG:prunasin
glucosyltransferase (GT II), and three catabolic enzymes (amygdalin hydrolase
(AH), prunasin hydrolase (PH) and mandelonitrile lyase (MDL)) will be assayed
during embryogenesis. The distribution of GT I and II and of amygdalin within
seeds will be determined by immunocytochemistry and FT-IR microspectroscopy,
respectively. Using previously raised polyclonal antibodies, an existing black
cherry cDNA library will be screened to obtain AH, PH and MDL cDNA clones. These
clones will be utilized to begin examining the temporal and spatial expression
of these genes during embryogenesis by Northern blot analysis and in situ
hybridization techniques. Whether germinating seedlings utilize amygdalin as a
nitrogen source will be examined by measuring the levels and localization of the
aforementioned cyanoglycosides and enzymes, along with the HCN detoxification
enzyme Beta-cyanoalanine synthase, in various seedling parts.
