Biochemical engineering research projects are underway which span the range from
basic studies of the mechanisms by which biological systems function to the
application of traditional chemical engineering principles to the design,
optimization and control of the unit operations used in the production, recovery
and purification of biologically synthesized substances. Research programs in
two new areas are initiated: the production and utilization of microbially
produced polyphosphates and the application of Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy to the monitoring and control of fermentation systems.
