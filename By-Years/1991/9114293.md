This proposal is part of an integrated scientific investigation to study the
properties of the Arctic ocean, atmosphere, and sea-ice on a transect between
Murmansk, USSR and Nome, Alaska. There are few published measurements of biomass
or production from most shelf and basin regions of the Arctic Ocean. This
project is one of four that will evaluate biological processes in the Arctic
Ocean during the Trans-Arctic cruise of the SOVETSKIY SOYUZ. It will investigate
role of microzooplankton in the Arctic Ocean. Specific studies will determine
the abundance and distributions of microheterotrophs in the Arctic Basin and
several marginal seas; measure grazing rates of these organisms and; contribute
to a collaborative program that will evaluate the flux of carbon in the Arctic
Ocean.
