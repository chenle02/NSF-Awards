Rapid and coordinated response to environmental fluctuations and the ability to
maintain function in a broad range of conditions is a key to survival in the
biological world. Therefore, organisms employ complex regulatory strategies that
combine sensitivity and robustness in response to environmental changes. One
potential mechanism for such responsiveness that has emerged through recent
studies of enzymatic networks is a queueing effect in protein abundances. The
phenomenon appears to be widespread in biology. This research project employs
mathematical modeling and synthetic biology to explore and better understand
this mechanism and its role in biological functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project investigates a queueing effect in intracellular networks. As processing
enzymes transition from underloaded to overloaded conditions, the corresponding
protein abundances (queues) increase drastically, and in a highly coordinated
fashion. A number of recent observations suggest that enzymatic networks are
often poised near the balance point between underloaded and overloaded regimes
where it makes them highly sensitive and responsive to transient environmental
fluctuations. This phenomenon appears to be widespread in biology; furthermore
it should be highly optimized to a broad range of environmental conditions by
adaptive regulatory mechanisms. In this project, the investigators combine
rigorous mathematical analysis with quantitative computational modeling and
synthetic biology to pinpoint the mechanisms and probe the role of adaptive
queueing in the dynamics of small gene circuits as well as large intracellular
enzymatic networks in bacteria and yeast. The investigators make use of their
combined expertise in queueing theory, stochastic kinetic modeling, design of
robust synthetic gene circuits and microfluidic technology to elucidate and
characterize the role of adaptive queueing as a fast and flexible signal
transduction and regulatory mechanism in bacteria and higher organisms.
