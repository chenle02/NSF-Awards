9515347 Rothenberg This project investigates theoretically and empirically the
nature of the interactions that govern the relationship between politicians and
organizations. Theoretically, the researchers develop a dynamic framework that
specifies how the motivations on each side impact each other given the
institutional structure under which groups and politicians transact their
business. Empirically, they test hypotheses derived from this game theoretic
perspective using an extensive data set and more general econometric techniques
than previously employed in the relevant literature. The results permit the
researchers to draw inferences about the interplay of interest group motivations
and whether the institutional framework that structures the connections between
external organizational actors and elected politicians makes long-term alliances
a realistic possibility. This research promises to substantially enhance our
understanding of the topic. ***
