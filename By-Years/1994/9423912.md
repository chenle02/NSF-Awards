9423912 Ramakrishna This REU Site award provides an opportunity for twelve
undergraduate students to work with faculty members in the Departments of
Chemistry/Biochemistry, Chemical/Bio/Materials Engineering, Electrical
Engineering, Physics/Astronomy and Mechanical Engineering on multidisciplinary
materials research projects involving the use of scanning probe microscopy (SPM)
during a ten week summer period. *** This program is designed to serve as a
magnet to bring together undergraduate students from different disciplines,
ethnic backgrounds and from institutions where research programs are limited. It
will not only provide students with an opportunity to get involved in various
aspects of SPM in material research, but also to get acquainted with present and
future needs of the high technology industry and thus help prepare them for the
imminent revolution in nano science, engineering and technology. This program is
built on the unique strengths of Arizona State University in SPM
interdisciplinary research, commitment to excellence in undergraduate education
through federally sponsored programs such as the interdisciplinary undergraduate
program in Materials Science, the undergraduate SPM laboratory course initiative
and Coalition to Increase Minority Degrees, intimate contact with industry via
the SPM Industrial Associates Program and a close working relationship with the
Maricopa Community College System. The SPM REU site program is expected to have
a positive impact on the quality of science and engineering research experience,
in particular, and education in general at the local, regional and national
levels.
