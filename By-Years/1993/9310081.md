The focus of this research is twofold. The first goal is the development of
better enzymes for the synthesis of peptides and their isosteric and
glycosylated derivatives and for the oxidation and halohydration of olefins. The
second goal is the development of chemical/enzymatic strategies for the
synthesis and use of sugar nucleotide and oligosaccharide mimetics. The project
will advance our understanding of biomolecular recognition and catalysis and
provide new methodologies and strategies for asymmetric synthesis that
complement abiological approaches. %%% With this Accomplishment Based Award, the
Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Chi-Huey Wong of the
Department of Chemistry at Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation. Professor
Wong will focus his work on the development of novel enzymatic catalysts for use
in the key-step synthesis of designed molecules with biological significance.
