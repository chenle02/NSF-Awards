These Engineering Foundation Conferences, to be held annually, are a response to
the need for forums for interaction and exchange about innovation in
undergraduate engineering education. Each of the conferences will bring
engineering educators together to exchange ideas, problems and solutions about
engineering education and is expected to stimulate more and better innovation. A
proceedings of each conference will be published and given broad distribution
within the engineering education community. The format for planning and holding
the conference is designed to encourage presentation and discussion of recent
developments to reduce the time required to include new ideas in undergraduate
offerings. The grantee and the institutions of the conference participants are
expected to provide support for the conferences that is several times the funds
requested from NSF for this project.
