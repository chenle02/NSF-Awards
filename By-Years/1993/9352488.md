9352488 DeHart This project has established a new developmental psychology
laboratory, making it possible for students to gain active experience with
laboratory- and field-based research techniques. This also provides
opportunities for student research projects. Equipment includes audio and video
recording instruments for use in the laboratory and in the field. Computers are
also used for analyzing and writing up the results of student research projects.
The project is expected to enhance instruction in our developmental psychology
courses. In particular, it will produce audio- and videotaped examples of infant
and child behavior for use in class, expand students' opportunities to carry out
structured laboratory exercises, and increase opportunities for students to
carry out original research current in the field. ***
