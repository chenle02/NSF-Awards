ABSTRACT E. Macagno, PI Proposal # IOB-0446346&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
will address an important question about the development of the nervous system,
specifically, what is the role of certain types of interactions among nerve
cells in defining how the nervous system is assembled. Members of the laboratory
have identified and are characterizing the group of molecules that are thought
to mediate these types of interactions, and will use cutting-edge techniques to
affect whether these molecules are present at the right time and place where
they are thought to function. The ideas they will test relate to the formation
of specific patterns of connections that are critical for proper function of
neuronal circuits The neuroscientists will use a very simple nervous system to
answer these questions, that of the medicinal leech. In this animal, nerve cells
are large and easily identified, which greatly facilitates these experiments.
Since the same types of molecules are thought to exist in and affect how human
nerve cells interact as they develop, the findings expected from this research
project with non-human tissues will have a strong impact on our understanding of
the normal assembly of the both invertebrate and vertebrate nervous systems.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will serve as an excellent training
experience for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers.
The leech embryo and nervous system are easy for beginners to master and the
laboratory will provide training in biology at various levels, including
molecular biology, cellular biology, and physiology. UC San Diego serves a
diverse student population, from which researchers will be recruited.
