9318524 Reid This award provides funding for the first year of a three-year
continuing award for the "Self-Sufficient Partnership for Research" Program at
the Oklahoma State University's Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
for Web Handling. The Center has demonstrated successful research support from
industrial members and has met the review criteria of I/UCRC Program. Funding is
also provided to support an evaluator at the Center to continue the evaluation
responsibility on monitoring the industry/university interaction in the Center.
The U.S. Department of Energy's Environmental Restoration and Waste Management
Office is providing funding to obtain a non-voting membership in the Center.
Additional funding is provided for a woman undergraduate student to aid the
Center in its's ongoing research activities. The Program Manager recommends the
Oklahoma State University be awarded: $33,000 for the first year of a three-year
continuing award (includes $8,000 for evaluator support); $5,000 for one year to
support an undergraduate student; and $10,000 for one year with funds provided
by the U.S. Department of Energy. This continuing grant should be processed as a
unilateral action with $10,000 funded in FY93 with funds provided by the
Department of Energy and $38,000 funded with FY94 funds with no other action
required. Near the end of each 12-month period the Program Manager and/or the
Division Director of the Engineering Education Centers Division will review the
progress of the Center on a number of renewal criteria requirements, including
the following: 1) the extent to which the university/industry interaction is
developing; 2) the extent to which the support base is developing; and 3) the
extent to which a robust research program is developing. If the review is
satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend support for the next period of
this continuing award.
