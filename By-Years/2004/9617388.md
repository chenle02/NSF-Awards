9617388 Coyle, Edward J. Purdue University CISE Research Instrumentation:
Storage and I/O Devices for the Support of Research in Imaging Systems,
Networks, and Video and Speech Processing This award enables the School of
Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University to purchase equipment
for the support of research projects:- Quality Improvement in the Imaging
Pipeline- Modeling, Analysis, and Control of Broadband Networks-Multiscale
Search of Very Large Image and Video Databases- Scalable Video Compression,
Video Servers, and Error Concealment - Speech Processing Algorithms. These areas
of research are critical to the success of future imaging and networked
multimedia systems. The equipment to be purchased includes RAID arrays, real-
time video codecs, a high-resolution digital still camera, digital video
cameras, audio equipment, and networking hardware. This equipment is to be
shared amongst the five research laboratories connected to our VIADuct ATM/HiPPI
Networking Research Testbed: the Computer Vision and Image Processing
Laboratory; the Electronic Imaging Systems Laboratory; the Multispectral Imaging
Laboratory; the Parallel Processing Laboratory; and the Speech Processing
Laboratory. This equipment will enable us to acquire, store and share the video,
audio, and high-resolution images needed for our research projects in the
following areas: quality improvement in the imaging pipeline; modeling, analysis
and control of broadband networks carrying multimedia traffic; multiscale search
of very large image and video databases; scalable video compression;
architecture and management of video servers; and speech processing algorithms.
