The development of earthquake engineering and seismic safety policy is a long-
term, continuing process by which California has made substantial progress in
responding to the state's seismic hazard. While some of the main trends are
generally known, no concerted effort has been made to capture and record
information on the way the process has worked, and especially on the careers and
activities of key individuals who have played leadership roles. Accordingly this
project attempts to acquire and organize such information, using the established
methodology of oral history interviewing, recording and indexing. The interviews
focus on (1) the development and application of earthquake engineering in
California, and (2) the formulation and implementation of seismic safety policy,
with particular attention to California's Seismic Safety Commission. The
principal objectives are collecting information on leadership development and
effective problem-solving in earthquake engineering and seismic safety policy.
California's experience has a potential for wider utility and application
elsewhere, especially in other states that are sure to be developing future
programs of earthquake engineering and seismic safety policy. This can be
facilitated by a better understanding of how these processes have worked in
California, and of what can be adapted from California's experience.
