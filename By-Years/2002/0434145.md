Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DEB-0122445&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although methyl
halides catalyze atmospheric ozone depletion, a significant portion of their
sources remains undescribed. Ectomycorrhizal fungi may account for much of the
"missing" source. This research will test the hypothesis that anthropogenic
nitrogen deposition will alter production of methyl halides by ectomycorrhizal
fungi, because nitrogen additions frequently reduce ectomycorrhizal growth.
Nitrogen experiments will be conducted at three scales: on laboratory-grown
cultures, on excised root tips with fungi, and on undisturbed soils in the
field. This research will lead to refinements in estimates of current global
methyl halide production, and consideration of consequences of nitrogen
deposition for future methyl halide emission.&lt;br/&gt;
