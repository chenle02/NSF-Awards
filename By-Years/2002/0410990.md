&lt;br/&gt;Geography (88)&lt;br/&gt;The project is incorporating new
instrumentation for particle size analysis and X-ray diffraction into the
undergraduate environmental geography curriculum, enabling field and laboratory
experiences to be fully integrated with traditional lecture-based learning. A
Beckman-Coulter laser diffraction particle size analyzer, a Rigaku XRD system,
and a computer system used to run them, are being used in six courses -- Soil
Geography, Soils Lab Methods, Environmental Geography, Field Studies, Rivers,
and Undergraduate Research -- that form the core of the Environmental Geography
curriculum. Each instructor is emphasizing a different aspect of particle size
analysis and X-ray diffraction, and, using this equipment, students are, for the
first time, performing sophisticated analyses in a reasonable amount of time.
Thus, projects involving the use of the instruments are being more easily
integrated into existing courses. By widening the scope of student field
experiences and involving students in local and regional environmental issues,
these courses are leading to a more intuitive understanding of the principles of
science and technology that are involved in real world environmental problem-
solving. &lt;br/&gt;
