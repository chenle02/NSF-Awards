9321915 Givental The research entails studies of the mirror symmetry conjecture
for Calabi-Yau manifolds and related problems. The conjecture is viewed in terms
of classes of differential equations having hypergeometric solutions. Techniques
from conformal field theory, topology and symplectic geometry will be
implemented approaching these problems. The research has potential applications
to string theory in mathematical physics. ***
