9405078 Johnson During a rapid-response cruise in October 1993 the principal
investigators conducted preliminary magnetic, gravity, and rock sampling of the
newly erupted flow and adjacent regions on the Juan de Fuca ridge. A
continuation of the time-series investigation of the new lava flow is proposed
with 12 ALVIN dives in 1994 and six dives in 1995. This project would: (1)
repeat the 1993 survey lines over the new flow, (2) remeasure the fluid vents to
establish a cooling rate, (3) conduct a complete magnetic and gravity survey of
the lava flow and dike area, (4) place bottom magnetometers on the newly erupted
flow area to determine the cooling/alteration rates, and (5) conduct laboratory
experiments on the returned rock samples. ***
