9361762 Maruska Spire proposes to directly synthesize thiogallate phosphor films
and use ion implantation to provide red, green, and blue color centers for
display applications. Due to their smaller size, weight, and power requirements,
flat panel displays (FPDs) based on AC thin film electroluminescence (TFEL) are
a highly desirable alternative to cathode ray tubes, but at present, no phosphor
host has been identified which can support all three colors. To produce full-
color displays at relatively low cost, Spire proposes a greatly simplified
manufacturing process mad possible by producing thin film ternary sulfide
electroluminescent materials by direct evaporation of CaS, ZnS, MgS, and Ga2S3
to form the ternary thiogallates MGa2S4. Recently, TFEL FPDs based upon multiple
stacks of ZnS (filtered red and green) and a new calcium thiogallate (blue)
phosphor have been demonstrated. We propose to eliminate the need for multiple
phosphor layers, hence multiple deposition steps, by obtaining red, green and
blue electroluminescence form multiple rare-earth activators ion-implanted into
a signal thiogallate host. Spire has already shown that multi-color TFEL
displays can be fabricated in ZnS hosts using this process. Because it
eliminates the need for multiple phosphor deposition and patterning steps, the
proposed fabrication process will lead to a significant reduction in FPD
Manufacturing costs. ***
