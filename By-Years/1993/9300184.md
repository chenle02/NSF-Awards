This action will continue support for an REU Site at the University of Nevada-
Las Vegas. The attendees will be involved in research efforts in the areas of
atomic, molecular, and optical physics, astronomy, and condensed matter physics.
Students will have the opportunity to obtain hands-on laboratory experience
using lasers, to analyze astronomical data on a workstation using image analysis
software, and to perform numerical computation and simulation using the UNLV
Cray supercomputer. Students will be recruited from UNLV undergraduates and from
schools in the western part of the United States.
