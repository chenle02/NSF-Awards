With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes program is supporting the
research of Professor Katherine Franz at Duke University to develop copper
binding agents that change their ability to complex copper in response to
different stimuli. Copper is an essential micronutrient across most forms of
life, but it can also be toxic if not appropriately managed by a complex network
of copper trafficking proteins. The researchers will prepare two classes of
agents: those that respond to UV light by converting high-affinity chelators
into products with weak copper affinity, and conversely those that respond to
enzymatic processing to convert non-binders into effective copper sequestering
agents. The intellectual merits of the proposal are the creation of new chemical
agents with complementary function to increase or decrease bioavailable copper
as chemical biological tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this
project are to support the education and training of graduate, undergraduate,
and high school students in an interdisciplinary lab environment. High school
students from disadvantaged backgrounds will be recruited through the NC Project
SEED program, while undergraduate students, particularly female and
underrepresented minority students from schools with less extensive research
opportunities, will be recruited through the Duke Chemistry REU program.
Building upon past efforts, the Franz group will work to mentor these students
and expose them to frontline research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is being
co-funded by the Cellular Processes Cluster in the Molecular and Cellular
Biosciences (MCB) Division of the BIO Directorate.
