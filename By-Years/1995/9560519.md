This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a high
speed, high accuracy pointing mechanism for active machine vision systems. Space
system applications place demanding spatial and temporal resolution, and wide
field-of-view (FOV) requirements on machine vision. Foveal active vision
features imaging sensors and signal processing with graded acuity, coupled with
context sensitive sensor gaze control, analogous to that prevalent throughout
vertebrate vision. Foveal systems operate more efficiently than uniform acuity
systems because resolution is treated as a dynamically allocatable resource.
Wide FOV and localized high acuity are simultaneously supported while limiting
sensor data to that which is relevant. The development of high performance
foveal systems is hampered by the need for pan-tilt pointing mechanisms, which
must be faster and more accurate than those used in uniform acuity active
vision. This program will investigate two novel designs for servo pointing
actuators that implement pan-tilt motion using orthogonal torsional magnetic
fields; they act simultaneously on the foveal imager. One of these approaches
uses two crossing coils surrounding the sensor, and the other uses two non-
overlapping coil ring pairs that bracket the sensor. The performance of these
two approaches will be evaluated experimentally, and control strategies that
minimize settling time will be investigated. A controller implementing the most
promising strategy on the most promising actuator design will e built and
tested. The actuators will be faster and feature an order of magnitude less
size, weight, and power requirements than conventional motion-on-motion pan-tilt
mechanisms (cascaded turntables). They will also feature better settling time
and calibration than other multi-axis electromagnetic configurations. Foveal
systems offer space vision systems improved performance at lower system cost.
They interrogate targets with high resolution to reduce classification errors,
while supporting a wide FOV that improves multi-target detection and tracking.
Foveal systems feature orders of magnitude less computational latency and
hardware than conventional systems with the same maximum resolution and FOV. The
spherical pointing actuators developed under this program will maximize gazing
performance and support other optical applications, including beam steering.
