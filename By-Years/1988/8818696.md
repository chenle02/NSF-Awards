In this project funded by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic
Chemistry Program, Fred Basolo of Northwestern University will investigate the
factors that affect the rates of ligand substitution in organometallic
compounds. A great need exists to know as much as possible about the fundamental
and quantitative aspects of the rates and mechanisms of these reactions, which
are an essential step in all homogeneous catalytic cycles making use of
organometallic compounds as catalysts. The project will include the synthesis
and detailed kinetic and mechanistic studies of several series of compounds
including the following general types: the metal nitrosyl carbonyls of chromium,
molybdenum and tungsten; "open" pentadienyl complexes of the same metals; pi-
heteroatom metal carbonyls of cobalt, rhodium and iridium; the early transition
cyclopentadienyl metal carbonyls of vanadium, niobium and tantalum; and metal
sulfur dioxide complexes of, for example, molybdenum.
