The Jicamarca Radio Observatory near Lima, Peru serves as the equatorial anchor
of the 75th meridian chain of incoherent scatter observatories. Its operation is
crucial to a number of joint experiments which trace the flow of energy,
momentum and mass from the polar to the equatorial regions of the earth's upper
atmosphere. The global responses to the high latitude interactions of the
magnetosphere with the polar ionosphere and thermosphere are a subject of great
scientific interest and a key area of study in the 1980's and 1990's. The
Jicamarca Radio Observatory, for example, is critical to the new NSF initiative
CEDAR (Coupling, Energetics and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions). The project
will help support the operation of the Jicamarca Radio Observatory and provide
funds for a program of experimental research to be conducted at that facility.
Jicamarca is one of four radars, forming a meridional chain from Greenland to
Peru that are particularly well sited to examine the global energy questions
indicated above. It will observe, alone and in combination with the other radars
and optical instruments the atmospheric response (i.e., changes in densities,
temperatures, winds, and electric fields to high-latitude energy inputs. In
addition to the radar chain experiments, research will continue in the following
major areas: (1) the dynamics of the neutral atmosphere (winds, waves, and
turbulence in the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere); (2) plasma
turbulence in the equatorial electroject; (3) the 150km echoing region: (4)
equatorial spread F (ESF) irregularities; (5) electric fields in the E and F
region during quiet and disturbed periods; and (6) the artificial generation of
VLF waves by heating the equatorial electrojet.
