9360149 Ballance In this research we propose to develop and demonstrate a model
for scalable high performance computing software. Our approach combines two
existing computing paradigms. The first is a model for dynamic load balancing
that has been tested on Multiple- Instruction Multiple-Data (MIMD) machines. The
second is a reusable software design called a "framework." The framework is an
object-based software architecture that assists the programmer in modifying
existing and in building new scientific codes. It also improves programmer
productivity by assisting program component and design reuse.
