The project will investigate various properties of random networks and random
fields indexed by graphs. A number of long range properties of stochastic
processes are closely related with the natural orderings of the indexing set.
Indexing by graphs, along with the imposed dependence structure on the process
result in many diverse interesting properties such as phase transition, symmetry
breakdowns, and chaotic behaviors at infinity. The resulting models find
applications in cellular automata, neural networks, magnetic and electrical
properties of materials, socio- economic planning etc.
