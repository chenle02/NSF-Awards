The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a lifesaving hemorrhage control device designed based on surgeon
feedback on current methods for hemorrhage control. Current methods for
addressing some hemorrhages include can involve interrupting blood supply to
large portions of the abdomen and all of the lower extremities. Complications
can result from the removal of these occlusion methods. This proposed device has
the potential to improve the associated morbidity and mortality of hemorrhage in
the US (and globally), and reduce the costs associated with complications while
impacting the success of hemorrhage intervention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
I-Corps project is based on the development of a resuscitative endovascular
bypass, which is a temporary stent that rapidly and effectively occludes vessels
and controls hemorrhage in a specific region while allowing blood flow to the
remainder of the body. Compared to all current methods of occlusion, this
proposed device increases the time frame within which physicians may address
injuries and save a patient, while reducing risk of perfusion related
complications. The proposed technology is designed to effectively address the
reduction of blood volume without compromising blood supply to vital organs and
tissues necessary for the patientâ€™s survival. The device may be used seamlessly
in an active trauma situation without compromising the outcome of the patient,
as compared with current methods. In addition, this device also has the
potential to be utilized in a number of other applications, including localized
extremity hemorrhage, as well as in additional care settings including field and
military trauma.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
