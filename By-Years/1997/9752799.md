This project works to develop case study teaching in the sciences. Although case
study instruction is standard practice in business, law, and medicine, it is not
common in science. Yet the use of case studies holds great promise as a
pedagogical technique for teaching science to undergraduates because it
humanizes science and illustrates well scientific methodology and values. This
project involves faculty in a five-day workshop instructing them how to teach
with cases, how to develop cases, and how to access a large body of existing
case studies. Undergraduate students work with the program critiquing faculty
instruction and the case study method. Developed case studies will be placed and
maintained on a Web site which, in turn, also serves as a national clearinghouse
and repository for cases.
