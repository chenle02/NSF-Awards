This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is focused on enhancing
performance of soil and ground water remediation systems at petroleum
hydrocarbon impacted sites. Presently accepted remediation technologies are
ineffective, time consuming and expensive. As a result, the cost and resources
needed to remediate impacted underground storage tank (UST) sites are
prohibitive. Surfactant enhanced subsurface remediation is proposed as an
alternative remediation technology. The goal of this research is to demonstrate
the effectiveness of surfactant enhanced remediation technology and the
technical feasibility of a pilot scale field application. An economic analysis
will be conducted and compared to existing technology. Surfactants can increase
the solubility and mobility of organic chemicals trapped in the subsurface,
resulting in significantly increased removal efficiencies and reduced costs.
Although a number of laboratory studies and a few field studies have
investigated surfactant enhanced remediation, a comprehensive field application
has not yet been attempted. Future utilization of this technology could result
in significant savings in remediation costs for companies employing it.
