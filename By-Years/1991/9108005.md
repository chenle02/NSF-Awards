This project is to study the genetic and molecular basis of regulatory
interactions termed cross talk between the phosphate (PHO) regulon and genes in
the creABCD, formerly called phoM, operon and to define the biological role of
the creABCD operon in Escherichia coli. The project focuses entirely on
regulatory interactions involving the creABCD operon. The PHO regulon encodes
genes for the acquisition of environmental phosphorus (P) and is induced when
the external (ext) inorganic phosphate (Pi) level is growth limiting. The
creABCD operon, whose expression is unaffected by Pi(ext), seems to respond to
the level of an internal (int) organophosphate formed in central metabolism,
which may be formed in substrate-level phosphorylation (in glycolysis or the TCA
cycle) at a step where Pi(int) is incorporated into organophosphate. Regulatory
interactions are expected between genes in a metabolic pathway; Pi(ext) to
Pi(int) to organophosphate (int) in which Pi(ext) regulates the PHO regulon and
organophosphate(int) may regulate both the PHO regulon and the creABCD operon.
Such cross talk may be an example of an underlying control mechanisms essential
for general (global) control of cell metabolism and growth; this is especially
apparent in the control of gene expression in bacteria, but may quite possibly
play the same role in eucaryotic cells too.
