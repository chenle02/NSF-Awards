TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Field emission and field evaporation
behavior provides the underpinning physics of several technically relevant
applications and characterization techniques. Field evaporation or emission
nominally requires a sharp point, typically of the diameter of a tens of
nanometers, where a few thousand volts is sufficient for the tip to either emit
electrons or evaporate ions, depending on the potential. Many applications and
developments in modern microscopy and materials characterization techniques
depend upon these phenomena. To stimulate technical discussions on these and
other relevant topics, The University of Alabama will host The 53rd
International Field Emission Society (IFES) Conference and Pre-meeting
Tutorial.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
University of Alabama will host The 53rd International Field Emission Society
(IFES) Conference and Pre-meeting Tutorial to address training and knowledge
dissemination in the theory and practical use of field emission and field
evaporation for advanced materials research.
