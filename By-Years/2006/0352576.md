ABSTRACT DMS - 0203979.

This project deals with three areas of Riemannian geometry, namely, nonnegative
sectional curvature, negative sectional curvature, and almost nonnegative Ricci
curvature. Specifically, we continue the search of new examples of metrics of
nonnegative sectional curvature and obstructions to their existence, especially
in the simply-connected case, we plan to analyze the structure of open pinched
negatively curved manifolds with nilpotent fundamental groups, and to study the
difference between nonnegative and almost nonnegative Ricci curvatures.

One of the main goals of modern geometry is to obtain global qualitative
information about a space by measuring its local quantitative properties. Say,
it has been known since the nineteenth century that a space that locally looks
like an egg must globally look like an egg, not like a doughnut or a jungle gym.
This project deals with similar matters for higher dimensional spaces, some of
which occur naturally in physics and engineering.
