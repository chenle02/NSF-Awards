This project is a collaborative research effort between the University of
Minnesota, the University of Texas at Austin, and the University of Washington
for an experimental and analytical investigation of beam-column connections in
precast concrete ductile-joint frames under the PRESSS Phase II Coordinated
Research Program. The experimental research is divided into three phases of
tests: (1) connection components, (2) beam-column subassemblages, and (3)
multibay subassemblages. The first phase of testing investigates a series of
components or connecting elements that are common among many of the connections
currently under consideration by the PRESSS Phase I Program. Beam-column
connection subassemblage tests will be used to investigate at least three types
of beam-column frame connections to be detailed by PRESSS Phase I researchers.
Results of the tests will be used to develop analytical models to represent
connection behavior. The end result of this project will be the development of
recommendations for the design of precast concrete ductile beam- column-floor
panel connections and detailing guidelines for shear transfer at the interface
of and through joint regions.
