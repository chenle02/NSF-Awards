This award will support US-based graduate student, postdoctoral and early career
investigator attendance at the Federation of American Societies for Experimental
Biology (FASEB) meeting at Snowmass, CO on June 30 - July 5, 2019. The meeting
focuses on RNA localization and local translation and is co-organized by Ruth
Lehmann, Fulvia Bono, Simon Bullock and Antonella Riccio. The format of the
meeting is a combination of 28 invited talks, 22 talks selected from submitted
abstracts and several poster sessions. Three keynote lectures by leaders in the
field of RNA structure and localization will be given throughout the meeting.
There is a dedicated 2-hour session for trainees to interact with leading
experts at the meeting and two different career-workshops will be held focusing
on "Big ideas for the RNA field" and "Entrepreneurial opportunities for RNA
biology and therapeutics." This meeting affords many opportunities (both formal
and informal) for sharing recent research findings and exploring collaborations.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a unique biannual meeting focusing on RNA
localization and regulation that began in 1994. Recent advances on how the
spatial and often developmentally-programmed localization of RNA impacts cell
development and function will be highlighted in this conference. The session
topics include RNA transport, translation control, RNA localization,
developmental processes, RNA in disease, RNA processing and RNP structure. The
conference primarily highlights unpublished research findings and provides many
experiences for young researchers to learn about the field and devise future
avenues for research. The meeting will bring together diverse scientists and
encourage career development of a new generation of researchers, including those
who are underrepresented in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
