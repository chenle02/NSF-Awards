The project aims to construct quantum invariants of 4-dimensional objects. It is
based on the author's recent discovery of a doubly-graded cohomology theory of
links in the 3-sphere. The Euler characteristic of the cohomology groups is
equal to the Jones polynomial. We would like to extend this theory to link
cobordisms. The invariant of a cobordism will be a homomorphism between
cohomology groups assigned to the boundaries of the cobordism. Furthermore, the
theory should extend to tangles and tangle cobordisms. To a tangle we'll
associate a functor between triangulated categories associated to the boundaries
of the tangle, and to a tangle cobordism a natural transformation between
functors. These triangulated categories will be related to highest weight
categories of modules over simple Lie algebras, as well as categories of modules
over certain Frobenius algebras, such as cyclotomic Hecke algebras. In addition,
we will look for cohomology theories lifts of other quantum invariants of links
and 3-manifolds, including the Alexander and HOMFLY polynomials and Witten-
Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants.

An n-dimensional manifold is an object that locally looks like an n-dimensional
space. A circle can be approximated by a tangent line in the neighbourhood of a
point, and is a one-dimensional manifold (n-manifold, for short). The global
structure distinguishes the circle from the line, though. Surfaces provide
examples of two-manifolds. It turns out that one and two-manifolds are easy to
classify, while in higher dimensions classification is hard. It is a theorem
that in dimensions greater than three there can be no satisfactory
classification, and topologists seem to be fairly close to finding one for
three-manifolds. Given a pair of manifolds, it is a tough question to decide
whether or not they are isomorphic. One approach is to extract some tangible
invariant out of a manifold, such as a number, or a polynomial, and then compare
these numbers. Most of the times the numbers are different and tell us that the
manifolds are different, too. Dimension three is special in that there is a
wealth of such invariants. These invariants, moreover, link three-manifold
topology with deep algebraic structures. There are indications that the
invariants can be lifted to the next dimension, to invariants of four-manifolds,
and my goal is to find them and compare to analytical invariants of 4-manifolds
that arise from solutions of certain partial differential equations.
