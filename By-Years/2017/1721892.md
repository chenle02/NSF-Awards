The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to make solar
generation more efficient and more affordable. Consequently, it promotes a safer
and greener environment. The proposed approach is novel and has the potential to
revolutionize solar generation. Therefore, it gives the U.S. a technological and
commercial competitive edge in the global renewable energy market. Also, this
project will expose interns to discovery-based exercises and will train them to
work on the design and development of solar PV energy systems. In an attempt to
diversify the workforce in the solar energy market, students from minority and
underrepresented groups will be encouraged to engage in the research activities
of this project. This project also fosters potential research collaborations and
communications between small businesses, universities, and research
institutions. Consequently, the project will enhance infrastructure for research
and education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR) Phase I project proposes using GaN devices in string solar inverters. The
innovative aspect of this work is threefold. i) Wide-bandgap (WBG) semiconductor
devices will be used in this effort. ii) The proposed circuit topology is a
novel inverter which utilizes coupled inductors to cancel the current ripples
induced on the input and output sides of the converter. iii) The proposed
inverter acts as a synthetic frequency response reserve to improve the frequency
stability of its local grid. The proposed circuit topology is creative and
allows for significant reduction in the size of the filtering elements. Hence,
the overall weight, volume, and cost of this solar inverter are lower than its
predecessors.
