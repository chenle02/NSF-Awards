9309169 Dayhoff This Career Advancement Award is made to Judith Dayhoff to study
neural computations on ensembles and intercellular signaling. Extracellular
multiunit signals contain significant temporal structure, such as multiunit
synchronies, and the PI plans to extend and apply methods for identification of
timing relationships in multiunit recordings. On identification of timing
relationships in multiunit recording, the PI plans to implement and characterize
a new analysis technique that detects synchronous activity in ensembles of
neurons. This will focus on nerve impulse trains and the temporal placement of
nerve impulses with respect to one another. The time relationships to be
identified are important because synchronously firing groups are candidate
mechanisms for neural coding, representation, and processing. The project
includes the implementation of a new fast calculation method for the detection
of synchronous firing in simultaneous nerve impulse trains, and validation of
the new computation methods and characterization of its sensitivity to temporal
structure in simulated data. The techniques will then be exported to
laboratories actively engaged in mulitunit neural recording. As follow-on work,
this project will stimulate collaborations between the PI and experimental
laboratories where mulitunit recording is taking place. ***
