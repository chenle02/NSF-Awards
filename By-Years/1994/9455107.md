This project aims to acquaint faculty, general chemistry coordinators, and lab
directors with the theory and practice of cooperative learning in the general
chemistry laboratory. Participants are invited from all institutional settings
including two-year and four-year public and private colleges and universities.
Cooperative modes of instruction that have proven to produce remarkable
improvements in student attitudes toward chemistry, persistence, and success in
learning have been developed at Clemson University. The method uses a new set of
laboratory software, SuperChemLab, for the project-style laboratory exercises,
which will be available to participants for their own applications. The workshop
assumes that participants will adapt and adopt the cooperative learning mode for
their own laboratories, and several features of the program including hands-on
experience are aimed at facilitating this process. Instructor's manuals, texts,
and background materials will be provided and considered in small groups during
the workshop.
