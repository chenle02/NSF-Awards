A new computer lab will help students develop abilities to understand
mathematical concepts, apply statistical reasoning, and process and interpret
data through the use of computers. The equipment includes 17 microcomputers
networked together plus software packages for specific classroom exercises.
Courses that utilize the computers include Genetics, Microbial Ecology, General
Ecology, Biometry, Population Genetics, Population Ecology, Honors Botany, and
the University Honors Seminar. Computer-assisted exercises are being developed
for each of these courses that will improve understanding of fundamental
biological principles, improve understanding of the scientific method in
general, or improve specific quantitative skills of particular importance to
biologists. The university will contribute an amount equal to the award.
