The results of this project will help to reduce the uncertainties in long-term
climate prediction of the global-scale surface temperature and circulation
patterns. Two high school teachers with backgrounds in advanced earth science
and computer science, and two high school students will engage with the team to
use and analyze climate science data sets. The scientific objectives of this
project are to advance knowledge of (1) how mid latitude waves and jets are
linked to tropical and high-latitude processes, and (2) how the atmospheric jet
variability influences Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), jets, eddies, and
jet-scale overturning circulations. For the first objective, the investigation
will be focused on how poleward heat transport by atmospheric waves is
influenced by tropical heating and the background state of the atmosphere. The
improved knowledge of the underlying physical processes can enhance
understanding of the general circulation of both the atmosphere and the Southern
Ocean. In addition, this knowledge can help us to evaluate how high-latitude
surface temperatures and the Southern Ocean circulation, two of the most
sensitive aspects of climate variability, respond to external forcings.
