The Social Web has become an important medium for social interaction and
potentially a powerful new computational tool. As people create and share
information online, their collective activity shapes the structure and
usefulness of the Social Web and can even be used to address a range of problems
from collective decision-making to trend prediction. Understanding how the
aggregate activity of many interconnected people evolves is crucial to our
ability to transform the Social Web into a platform for social
computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical modeling is a powerful tool for
studying collective human activity. In previous work, the PI and collaborators
developed a framework for mathematically modeling emergent behavior of groups of
users on the Social Web. This framework allowed the modeler to relate aggregate
behavior of a group of users to simple descriptions of their individual
behavior. However, it failed to take into account key aspects of the Social Web:
user diversity and the extent to which social links indicate a commonality of
users' interests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop a
methodology for modeling diverse groups of users on the Social Web and to
understand how user heterogeneity affects group behavior. Mathematical modeling
and analysis will lead to better, more effective Web sites by identifying
productive ways to display information to users, as well as techniques for
promoting collaboration and enhancing participation. Analysis will also lead to
new insights into how to use human activity for computation, and eventually a
programming toolkit for social computing.
