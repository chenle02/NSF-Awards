Mellet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The twin aims of the workshops in each of these
areas to share the latest developments from the leading experts, and of
providing overviews of the state-of-the-art (especially for young researchers).
Each workshop, in addition to talks from invited speakers, includes at least two
mini-courses, given by international leaders in the field, and aimed at advanced
graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Taken together, the mini-courses of
the various workshops comprise a summer school for these young researchers.
&lt;br/&gt;The plan for the ?summer school? is to have graduate students come
for several (4-6) workshops, rather than just for one specific one. All
participants will be encouraged to invite their students, and the PIMS institute
will be providing staff to assist with advertising the program to the
mathematics community. The funds requested to NSF will be used to support the
travel expenses and local accommodation of US-based graduate students and young
mathematicians (especially those who do not have their own grants). We are
particularly dedicated to the participation of women and other under represented
groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
