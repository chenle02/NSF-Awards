9415250 Pak This Industry-University Research Project (IUCRP) type grant is to
conduct fundamental studies in the fatigue and fracture behavior of
piezoelectric materials and to characterize their performance as multistack
actuators. The main emphasis in this project will be to link the macroscopic
material behavior with the microstructural influences when coupled
electromechanical loads are cyclically imposed. This interdisciplinary program
will involve a university, a materials manufacturer and an aerospace systems
integrator. ***
