This project involves the collaboration of a biophysicist, a synthetic organic
chemist, a molecular geneticist and an X-ray crystallographer in a study of
guanine nucleotide binding to so called G proteins using novel techniques of
Raman vibrational spectroscopy that have recently been developed. G proteins
bind either GDP or GTP, which act as allosteric effectors to control protein
conformation and activity, and are involved in a large number of fundamental
regulatory processes. It is planned to characterize the molecular properties of
the bound nucleotides, their interactions with surrounding protein residues at
the active site and contrast this to their solution properties. Within the past
few years there has been considerable effort and excitement on understanding a
family of quanine nucleotide binding regulatory proteins, the so-called G
proteins. There are several members of this family, and sub families, that are
involved in a rather diverse set of biological functions. A large number are
involved as intermediaries in a variety of transmembrane processes. In addition
to their functional similarities, the G protein family also share common
structural motifs; their sequence homology and tertiary structure similarities
are one of the strongest found in biology.
