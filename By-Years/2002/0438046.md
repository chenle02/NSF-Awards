Objective of this Proposal: The objective of this proposal is to develop general
methods for the fabrication of patterned electrically conducting organic domains
at the nanoscale. This will be accomplished by using dip pen nanolithography
(DPN) to prepare patterned structures of two-component (organic donor/acceptor)
charge transfer (CT) monolayers on silicon. The electrical properties of CT
monolayers on silicon will be measured by scanning probe microscopies to
determine suitability for electronic device applications such as transistors and
resonant tunneling diodes, as well as more complex circuitry built from these
device functionalities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit and Broader
Impact: The fabrication of logic and memory devices from molecular components is
a challenging goal that could enable special purpose electronic circuits that
are orders of magnitude smaller, faster, and less expensive than those made by
existing silicon (CMOS) technology. Fabricating molecular components at the
nanometer scale also brings enormous challenges in synthesis (chemistry),
characterizing unequivocally (physics), and adapting functional behavior into
useful devices. Dip pen nanolithography (DPN) will be used for the first time to
deliver with nanoscale precision electron acceptors over monolayers of electron
donors to define patterned conducting regions made from molecules.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If electronic devices are one day assembled from
molecules, a new era in device technology would be born. While the consequences
of such a revolutionary shift in technology cannot accurately be assessed today,
the impact to manufacturing and the national and global economy could be
significant. This program will engage the participation of graduate and
undergraduate students. The PI's both actively participate in their
institutions' educational outreach programs, which seek to integrate the
insights and approaches of the research, and to inform and inspire pre-college
through graduate students, as well as the general public. &lt;br/&gt;
