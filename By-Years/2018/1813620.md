This award provides funding to support a workshop that will focus on getting
community input on long-term deployments of Resident-Autonomous Undersea
vehicles. (R-AUVs). The workshop will look at the technical challenges and
potential benefits of deploying a highly capable, next-generation R-AUV on the
Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) Cabled Array at Axial Seamount on the Juan
de Fuca Ridge off Washington-Oregon. The workshop will serve as a forum for the
open exploration of operational concepts and application spaces uniquely suited
to R-AUV systems, with a goal of defining a roadmap leading to the deployment of
such systems for a broad range of users. The proposed 2.5 day workshop will be
held at the University of Washington in April 2018.
