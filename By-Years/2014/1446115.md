The goal of this activity is to contribute to the training of graduate students,
to promote the exchange of ideas among scientists broadly located in the
Midwest, and to advance research in Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry
through a series of conferences at Purdue University (August 10-14, 2015), at
the University of Kentucky (May 2016), and at the University of Notre Dame (May
2017). The other institutions that are actively involved in these events are the
University of Illinois at Chicago and the University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign. The various research groups at these institutions have compatible
interests, but at the same time complementary expertise, and collaborations are
already ongoing. Many of the national and international experts in commutative
algebra and algebraic geometry will be brought together, but there will also be
ample opportunities for young researchers to present and discuss their work. In
addition, every meeting will include a panel discussion about professional
issues. This will help guide junior researchers through the critical transition
from graduate school to academic employment.

Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry are vibrant fields with rich and ever
evolving connections among them and to other areas of mathematics: Intriguing
parallels between algebraic phenomena in prime characteristic and birational
geometry are being explored, and maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules have found
applications in physics. There have been important advances in the minimal model
program, and in the study of free resolutions through the solution of the Boij-
Soderberg conjecture. The central Midwest has a long tradition of excellence in
these areas and a high concentration of commutative algebraists and algebraic
geometers. Areas of common interests among our groups include birational
geometry, Rees algebras, multiplier ideals, liaison theory, the homological
conjectures, Hilbert functions, local cohomology, and combinatorial methods. The
topic of the conference at Purdue will be Recent Advances in Commutative Algebra
and its Interaction with Algebraic Geometry, with particular emphasis on
multiplier ideals, characteristic p methods, and the homological conjectures.
The meeting in Kentucky will focus on Free Resolutions and Representation
Theoretic Methods. The emphasis of the conference at the Center for Mathematics
at the University of Notre Dame will be Multiplicity Theory and Implicitization
Problems.
