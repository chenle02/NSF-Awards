The aim of this project is to convene a three-day working conference to design
an undergraduate curriculum for the 21st century. The conference will serve as a
forum for consensus-building on the guiding principles for undergraduate
education in the next century. Representatives from business/industry,
mathematics, science, engineering, and technology disciplines will share their
expertise and experiences and exchange ideas on curriculum design and delivery
through plenary sessions, working groups, and other activities. The primary
outcome of the project, a comprehensive model for undergraduate education in the
form of a conference report, will serve as a curriculum-building resource and
model for the new Florida Gulf Coast University and other institutions across
the nation. By synthesizing new ideas in one place at one time, the conference
report is likely to have a significant impact on existing structures of
institutions and their curricula.
