This project is developing and validating rigorous models of several central
problems in the design of the Internet and its applications, which can be viewed
as evolving distributed systems composed of software agents employing some
algorithmic process. In these systems, one can predict the outcome of a
particular task as a function of a set of input variables: the agent
communication pattern, individual incentives, and algorithmic strategy---aspects
that have previously been studied in isolation, but rarely in concert. The PIs
are developing an analytic framework that explicitly accounts for both network
structure and agent incentives. By considering simple tasks like information
diffusion, search, and leader election, they will construct a theory that can be
applied to practical problems such as Internet routing, congestion control, and
reputation systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;This
project brings together a team of researchers with backgrounds spanning
economics, algorithms, and networking to develop a unified approach to complex
social networking that captures both network structure and agent incentives
through a rigorous algorithmic framework. This project employs several research
methodologies including human-subject experimentation, algorithm design,
economic analysis, and large-scale simulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impact:&lt;br/&gt;The multidisciplinary approach of this project promises to
lead to a comprehensive understanding of the effect of network structure and
agent incentives in networks. The project is training graduate and undergraduate
students in the skills necessary to deal with social networks, which are
emerging as a fundamental underpinning of many applications. The PIs are
designing two new courses based upon the research conducted in the
project.&lt;br/&gt;
