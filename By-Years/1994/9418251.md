9418251 Knapp This award supports US collaboration with European and Russian
colleagues in the acquisition and analysis of a 500km seismic reflection profile
across the Uralian orogen in central Russia. The proposed transect through the
southern Urals extends from the East European platform in the Uralian foreland
to the West Siberian basin, crossing the Bashkirian foreland fold and thrust
belt, the Kraka ophiolite, the Main Uralian fault (suture zone), a collage of
oceanic and microcontinental terranes in the hinterland, and the main axis of
orogenic magmatism. The data to be acquired will provide the first complete
seismic image of the crustal and upper mantle architecture of an intact
Paleozoic orogen, and contribute potentially fundamental new insight into the
processes of continental collision and subsequent orogenic evolution. Project
URSEIS (Urals Reflection Seismic Experiment and Integrated Studies) represents
an international collaboration of unprecedentd scale in deep seismic profiling.
The US contribution leverages a larger EUROPROBE outlay, principally from DEKORP
(Germany) and ROSCOMNEDRA (Russian Committee for Geophysics and Deep Drilling).
The program derives from two years of planning, including evaluation of existing
Russian geophysical and geological data for the Urals, and follows a successful
multi-national pilot survey in 1993. ***
