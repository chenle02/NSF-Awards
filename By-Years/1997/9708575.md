Hyung Kim is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to continue his research in chemical reaction dynamics and
electronic spectroscopy in solution. Kim will implement the Born-Oppenheimer
reaction field theory with quantum chemical techniques to make a detailed
comparison with existing self-consistent methods for treating solvation. The
solute-solvent electronic correlation effects on solvation of small molecules
and reaction free energetics of charge shift processes will be investigated.
This approach should clarify some of the shortcomings associated with the self-
consistent approach with regard to overestimation of activation barriers for 2+2
cycloadditions. Furthermore, a reaction field approach involving quadrupolar
polarization will also be developed for treating solvent systems such as benzene
and carbon dioxide. Solvents to be studied include alcohols, amines, alkanes,
cycloalkanes and aromatic systems. An effort will also be made to understand and
quantify the solvation properties of normal and supercritical water. Excellent
theories are available for understanding gas phase chemical reactions involving
binary encounters between molecules. However, most chemical reactions of
technological importance occur in condensed phases consisting of reacting
solutes dissolved in non-reacting solvents. The effect which the solvent has on
chemical reactions, and theoretical methods for dealing with this complex
interaction are still in early stages of development. Nevertheless, progress in
this area of research can have an important long range impact on our fundamental
understanding of chemical reactions of industrial significance. Kim's research
is helping to provide a theoretical basis for the interpretation of solvent
effects on chemical reactions in condensed phase systems.
