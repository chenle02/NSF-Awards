9728184 Kennedy Acetobacter diazotrophicus is a nitrogen-fixing bacterium
isolated from sugarcane grown throughout the world. It inhabits the interior
spaces of sugarcane but not its outside surfaces or nearby soils. Evidence that
this bacterium supplies fixed nitrogen for plant growth was obtained in the PI's
laboratory: sugarcane plants inoculated with A. diazotrophicus grew better than
did uninoculated plants or plants inoculated with mutants unable to fix
nitrogen. This symbiosis provides a model system for studying the potential
benefit of bacterial nitrogen fixation in grasses and cereals. The objectives
are 1) to determine how much fixed N is supplied to the plants: 2) to learn
whether production of growth hormones by A. diazotrophicus also benefits plant
growth; and 3) to characterize how A. diazotrophicus colonizes sugarcane using
bacteria tagged with fluorescent markers. The results will provide insight into
how other monocots, such as corn, wheat or rice might benefit from nitrogen-
fixing bacteria.
