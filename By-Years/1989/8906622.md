This project investigates the power of the synchronous, data- parallel approach
to parallel algorithms development. Many numerical and nonnumerical algorithms
can be expressed in an elegant fashion using this methodology. This project
focuses on C*, a data parallel language development by Thinking Machines
Corporation. If C* compilers can be written that allow for the efficient
execution of parallel algorithms on the Connection Machine, multicomputers, and
shared memory multiprocessors, then there would be a whole class of algorithms
for which no reprogramming would be necessary in order to move an application
from one parallel architecture to another. Preliminary results are encouraging,
and the PIs are in the process of implementing an optimizing C* compiler for
hypercube multicomputers. The focus of this project is to build upon earlier
successes by improving the efficiency of the compiled programs, implementing an
interactive debugger, exploring more data parallel algorithms and the
optimization they require, and porting the C* programming environment to
different architectures.
