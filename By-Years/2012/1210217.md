This action funds Natalie Juda of Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the
University of California, San Diego to conduct a research project, entitled
"Evaluating the mantle source composition of Antarctic oceanic and continental
lavas" during the summer of 2012 at the Chinese Academy of Sciences Guangzhou
Institute of Geochemistry in Guangzhou, Guangdong, China. The host scientist is
Jifeng Xu.

The Intellectual Merit lies in isotopic analysis of samples collected along a
transect from oceanic to continental crust in the northern Ross Sea, Antarctica.
Combining petrographic, geochronologic, geochemical, and isotopic analyses of
samples provides estimates of age and composition of intraplate magmatism in the
Adare basin of the northern Ross Sea.

These geochemical data are fundamental to a full appreciation of regional and
local scale patterns in mantle composition, mantle geodynamics and crustal
production in Antarctica. The proposed characterization of the Adare Basin
Seamount lavas is a necessary first-order constraint for modeling the mantle
source and origin of Cenozoic magmatism in West Antarctica and SW Pacific
region, as well as the tectono-magmatic processes associated with continental
rifting as a whole.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
