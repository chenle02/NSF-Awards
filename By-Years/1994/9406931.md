This research explores test methods for manufacturing test of CMOS integrated
circuit (IC) chips based on monitoring of the dynamic portion of the power
supply current (iDDT). Since an iDDT pulse is created any time a CMOS circuit
switches states, the monitoring of iDDT provides observability into the
switching behavior of the circuit. This, combined with standard test methods,
can provide improved testability of manufactured IC chips. New accurate fault
models based on actual physical tests as opposed to simulation alone, and new
design methods for enhancing iDDT-testability are being investigated. The
methods are being incorporated into a design-for-testability tool, and are being
evaluated on real designs.
