The objectives of this work involve a detailed experimental and theoretical
analysis of the atmospheric oxidation chemistry of isoprene. Isoprene is the
major unsaturated organic compound emitted into the atmosphere by vegetation.
Product analysis and kinetic studies will be performed on reactions of isoprene
with oxygen and nitrogen radicals. These experimental results will be compared
to theoretical predictions of yields and rates for these same reactions. Oxygen
and nitrogen radical competititve reactions with isoprene will also be studied
and the combined results used to develop a mechanistic understanding of isoprene
oxidation reactions. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program and the Atmospheric Chemistry Program are
supporting the research of Dr. Simon W. North and Dr. Renyi Zhang of the
Department of Chemistry at Texas A &amp; M University. Drs. North and Zhang will
work on a detailed study of the atmospheric oxidation chemistry of isoprene.
Isoprene is the major unsaturated organic compound emitted into the atmosphere
by vegetation. A better understanding of how isoprene interacts with reactive
oxygen and nitrogen species in our atmosphere could help future efforts to model
and predict: 1) the role isoprene levels play in ozone formation; 2) long range
transport of organic nitrates; and 3) carbon cycling in the atmosphere. Students
trained during the course of this work will gain experience in environmental,
atmospheric and organic chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
