9526248 Klemperer This award provides partial support for the 7th International
Symposium on Deep Seismic Profiling of the Continents. This is a biannual
meeting of the international community of controlled-source seismologists
specializing in near-vertical reflection methods, together with specialists in
wide-angle refraction methods, and experts in tectonics, composition and
evolution of the continental crust. The 7th Symposium will be jointly hosted by
Stanford University and by the USGS, Branch of Seismology. About 250
international delegates are anticipated to attend the five-day meeting, and a
peer-reviewed conference volume will be published in Tectonophysics one year
after the meeting. ***
