This proposal requests support to study the composition and dynamics of
intermediate layers. The PIs will measure these layers using incoherent scatter
radar, optical techniques, and HF Radar sounders. Two opposing models of
intermediate layers will be evaluated to determine their composition. Secondly,
the PIs will focus on the tidal control of the low-altitude limit of the layer.
The study's aim is to increase capability in modeling the valley region between
E and F regions in the ionosphere through a greater understanding of ionization
sources and tidal control of the descending plasma layers.
