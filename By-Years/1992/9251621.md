Fiber and integrated optical technologies have witnessed rapid development over
the last decade and are finding extensive commercial applications in optical
communications, sensor signal processing, and distributed control. This project
will develop an instructional senior level undergraduate laboratory providing
students with hands-on experience in the design, fabrication, and testing of
integrated optical devices. The laboratory will serve as a model which can be
easily and relatively inexpensively emulated by other universities across the
country.
