The OPUS program (Opportunities for Promoting Understanding through Synthesis)
supports the efforts of late-career scientists to synthesize a large body of
work. The goal of this OPUS project is to make available on the Internet all
known information on the biology of species in the Brazil nut family
(Lecythidaceae). This involves providing electronic descriptions (called species
pages) that include: descriptions of species, distribution maps, lists of museum
specimens, images, ecological information, lists of characters that facilitate
identification, and conservation status. In addition, the web site will include
electronic keys for identifying species and essays on the anatomy, cytology,
fossil record, evolutionary relationships, pollination biology, and dispersal
biology. The synthesis will also highlight needs and opportunities for future
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Brazil nut family comprises an ecologically
dominant and economically important group of rain forest trees, as much a symbol
of tropical plants as the jaguar is an icon of tropical animals. This synthesis,
at The Lecythidaceae Pages (http://sweetgum.nybg.org/lp/index.php), will be an
important reference for both scientists and non-scientists, providing
information that bears directly on forest conservation and tropical ecology, and
that will be valuable for the development of curricula dealing with the
complexity of tropical ecosystems.
