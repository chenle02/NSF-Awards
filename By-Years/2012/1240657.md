This workshop activity supports US participation and leadership in an
international collaborative event around global federation development in
support of collaboration in the research community. The workshop centers on
Virtual Organizations (VO?s) in research and education, their needs in identity
management (IdM), sharing of best practices and current deployments of federated
identity systems, how to leverage global networking infrastructure in support of
these federated systems, how to leverage recent cybersecurity advances, and
issues in integrating some of these concepts and approaches in federated
identity with distributed scientific applications and collaboration software.
The event is to be held in the Netherlands in September, 2012.
