9452265 Dwyer The Chemistry and Physics Departments are purchasing a high field
FT-NMR and Mossbauer spectrometers to develop a modern magnetic resonance
laboratory for use in undergraduate laboratory instruction and research. The
laboratory already equipped with an EPR spectrometer is being used in integrated
chemistry and physics undergraduate laboratory courses to allow students to
employ multiple modern magnetic resonance techniques used in industry, medicine
and university research to investigate complex systems. The magnetic resonance
facility also is enhancing undergraduate research projects in chemistry and
physics.
