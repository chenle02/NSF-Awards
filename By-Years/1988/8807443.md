The unique length and time scales characteristic of aqueous suspensions of
charged polymer spheres are exploited to study the basic equilibrium and
nonequilibrium properties of strongly interacting spherical particle systems.
Experiments will include optical microscopy, light scattering intensity
fluctuation spectroscopy, laser trapping of particles, and neutron scattering,
techniques which have already been developed, as well as novel applications of
other methods including digital image processing and optical total internal
reflection. Nonequilibrium studies will focus on shear induced structure changes
in suspension samples which form liquid-like and solid-like structures in
equilibrium. Equilibrium studies will investigate local order, dynamics and
phase transitions in one, two and three dimensions. Theoretical studies
including analog and molecular dynamic computer simulation will support and
extend work on local liquid structure, laser trapping and nonequilibrium
behavior.
