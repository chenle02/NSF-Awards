This project is to adapt and implement use of a video game for improved student
learning of engineering digital systems concepts at the undergraduate level and
for use in motivating pre-college students (grade 8-12) to pursue electrical
engineering, computer engineering, or computer science degrees in college. The
objectives include (1) Create new student learning materials and strategies by
expanding the digital systems video game, PlanetK, to include more advanced
levels that address circuit minimization and sequential system design, and to
vertically integrate a conceptual or pedagogical approach on digital system
design into sequences of courses in electrical and computer engineering (ECE)
and computer science (CS) curricula; (2) Enhance the understanding of digital
systems by diverse populations through adaptation and implementation of the
video game, PlanetK, beyond a single institution through crowdsourcing to the
ECE and CS programs at minority-serving institutions; (3) Contribute to the
knowledge base on university and precollege student attitudes toward the use of
video games as a motivator for pursuing an ECE or CS major, and determine the
effect on student performance, especially on students from underrepresented
groups; (4) Implement PlanetK in pre-college outreach efforts for middle and
high schools; and (5) Synthesize and disseminate findings across the TAMU System
engineering programs, and programs across the nation and the world.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will advance discovery and understanding of
the impact of video games to improve student learning in ECE and CS disciplines,
broaden participation by under-represented minorities and benefit society by
improving the understanding of digital systems and engineering for those who do
not choose engineering careers, but are part of the non-technically degreed US
population.
