9310477 Harris The research entails the study of spacelike hypersurfaces in
general relativity theory. These are surfaces which can represent the physical
universe at a given instant of time according to a given class of observers. The
investigator wishes to investigate whether all such surfaces in tempered
spacetimes are topologically the same and are observer-time invariant. Also, he
he intends studying singular points where the spacetime geometry collapses in
terms of curvature singularities. Techniques from pseudo-Riemannian geometry
will be exploited. This research is very pertinent to the theoretical
understanding of `black-hole' phenomena.
