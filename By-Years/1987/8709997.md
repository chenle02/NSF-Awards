Multiprocessor supercomputers presently available on the market are oriented
towards high-speed numerical computation. However, there is more tendency to use
computers for computations that are symbolic in nature. Nonnumerical algorithms
for multiprocessors are more difficult to design and evaluate than numerical
algorithms. This research is aimed at developing a new and integrated
methodology for the design and performance prediction of nonnumerical parallel
and distributed algorithms for multiprocessors. Because of the unpredictable
behavior of such algorithms, and the dependency of algorithm performance on data
values, simulation is a fundamental ingredient of the methodology. The facility
developed for simulating the execution of multiprocessor algorithms on
uniprocessors will be expanded, improved and tuned to the purpose of this
research. This simulator is trace-driven. Simulation results will be used to
validate existing or new analytical or hybrid modeling techniques.
