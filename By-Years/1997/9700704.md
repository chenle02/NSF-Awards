Harrison 9700704 Pheromones are used by a large number of insects to attract
mates. In the Lepidoptera pheromone binding proteins (PBPs) play a role in the
binding and transpmrting of pheromones in the male antennae. PBPs should be
subject to directional selection to bind new pheromones efficiently when a
pheromone changes, but this prediction has not been tested rigorously. Three
different methods will be used to detect selection; each method involves
comparison of PBP gene sequences obtained from a set of moth species. The first
approach uses population genetic test that detect excess nonsynonymous
substitutions that may occur in response to a change in pheromone. A second
method uses relative rates test to look for increases in nonsynonymous
substitution along branches along which a change in pheromone has occurred.
Several different classes of changes in pheromones will be examined. The final
method for detecting selection involves analysis of PBPs in species which have
independently evolved to use the same pheromone; the goal is identify
convergence in the amino acid sequences of these PBPs. Demonstration of
selection acting upon these PBPs would be important for the study of protein
evolution and pheromone communication.
