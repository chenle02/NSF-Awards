This award supports participation in the 2016 KUMUNUJr meeting to be held at the
University of Nebraska-Lincoln during April 23-24, 2016. KUMUNUJr is an annual
conference series designed to promote interaction among junior researchers in
commutative algebra and related disciplines (including homological algebra,
algebraic geometry, K-theory, and coding theory) at Midwestern schools. The
conference series is anchored by the Universities of Kansas (KU), Missouri -
Columbia (MU), and Nebraska - Lincoln (NU). The gathering will provide an
opportunity for young algebraists to interact and establish research connections
with each other. This interaction will help to lay a foundation for fruitful
research collaborations as the participants advance in the field.

The goals of the conference are to foster collaboration among junior researchers
in commutative algebra from Midwestern institutions, and to expose commutative
algebra students and postdocs from Midwestern institutions to the current work
being done in their fields at neighboring institutions. The conference will last
for two days and will feature six talks by post-docs or senior graduate students
and five talks by junior graduate students. The conference will be open to all
interested graduate students and post-docs. Special efforts will be made to
recruit women and underrepresented minorities. More information can be found at
