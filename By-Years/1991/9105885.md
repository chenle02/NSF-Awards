Understanding the function of proteins requires knowledge of their structures,
conformations, and internal motions. While the existence of motions in proteins
on a broad time scale is generally acknowledged, computer simulations of those
motions are confined primarily to the subnanosecond regime. Experimental
quantification of both the rates and amplitudes of molecular motions on this
time scale is difficult, but necessary in order to give credence to implications
of the simulations. The overall goals of this project are to validate and to
further develop NMR and fluorescence methods for measuring internal motions in
peptides and proteins, to apply those methods to specially synthesized,
isotopically labeled peptides and genetically engineered proteins, and to
correlate the experimental results with computer simulations of the molecular
dynamics. NMR and fluorescence data will be acquired on the same residues in the
same peptides and proteins to confirm the experimental values for the motional
parameters. The peptides examined will include the cytolytic peptide melittin,
which is especially suited for this work because of the solvent-dependent nature
of its conformation and its propensity to interact with proteins and with
lipids. The proteins to be investigated, RNAse-T1, thioredoxin, and barnase, are
of low molecular weight and have known crystal and/or solution structures.
