0830856&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The American
Astronomical Society (AAS) will administer a three-year international travel
grant program that will support the participation of U.S. astronomers at
international scientific meetings. Astronomy is a fully international endeavor,
and the attendance of U.S. astronomers at scientific meetings worldwide is
critical to their continued activity in the field. The AAS will receive
applications for travel support, appoint a committee to review applications and
make award decisions, and distribute travel funds. The program makes particular
effort to provide travel funds for early career astronomers and those from
smaller or less-endowed institutions. During 2009, the year of the 27th General
Assembly of the International Astronomical Union in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the
program will accommodate a larger number of grants, considered separately from
normal scientific meetings, to enable a strong U.S. presence. &lt;br/&gt;
