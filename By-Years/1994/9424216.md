9424216 Yen This experimental project studies of the optical properties of
luminescent materials with emphasis on the dynamical properties of the optically
excited states; these properties arise from interactions between the active
centers and with the elementary excitations of the solid. New optically active
materials will be synthesized, engineered, and characterized through the Laser
Heated Pedestal Growth method in which non-linear optical processes can be
accurately controlled through compositional changes in the samples. In addition,
the dynamical processes of excited states induced by narrow band non-
equilibrium phonons and magnons in ordered materials will be investigated. These
studies will provide better insights into relaxation and transport properties in
solids. %%% Studies of the optical spectroscopic properties of materials which
are luminescent or emit light are being carried out. The materials being studied
are employed in a wide variety of communications and display technologies. The
project involves methods whereby new materials with better properties can be
synthesized and improved as a result of their optical characterization. In order
to improve these materials a fundamental understanding of the interactions
between the atomic centers responsible for emitting light and their surroundings
in the solid host must be arrived at; these processes often lead to dissipation
and relaxation of the optically excited atomic state and need to be suppressed
to improve material efficiencies. The optical studies proposed here are expected
to provide basic insights on these interactions. ***
