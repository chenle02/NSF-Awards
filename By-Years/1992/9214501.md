A new approach to the physics of open quantum systems emitting photons to the
environment is developed using a quantum trajectories method. The averages from
this ensemble of trajectories reproduce the results of conventional quantum
mechanics. The approach has the advantage that it can simulate real time signals
and throws new light on the problems of quantum measurement. Another strength of
the trajectory approach is that it is a wavefunction based method, which avoids
the problems of the more traditional density matrix techniques. The method will
be applied to problems in cavity quantum electrodynamics and the interaction of
atoms with nonclassical light. The ultimate hope is a self- consistent theory of
quantum measurements in optics.
