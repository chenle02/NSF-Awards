The Principal Investigator (PI) will study CME-CME interactions and CME
cannibalism in the context of space weather, focusing on more accurate
prediction of space environment conditions at 1 AU during complex events and
during the formation and evolution of CME-driven shock waves. The PI is
motivated by the observation that the interaction of successive Earthbound
Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) is associated with large, long-lived geomagnetic
storms and large gradual solar energetic particle (SEP) events.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will perform detailed 3D MHD numerical studies of
past CME events in order to address fundamental science questions. Such
questions include the importance of preceding CMEs for preconditioning the
heliosphere and modifying the Sun-to-L1 magnetic connection, how in situ
measurements at L1 relate to the interactions a CME encounters on its way to
Earth, and whether the association of successive CMEs with large SEP events is
merely statistical, or can be understood in terms of shocks' characteristics and
related to the disruption of the corona by the initial CMEs. The team will
compute directly observable quantities from their 3D MHD simulations, and then
compare this model output with spacecraft observations.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will result in improvements to the numerical
models being used and thus enable the space weather community to tackle problems
related to some of the largest and longest lived disruptions in geospace. The
improved models will ultimately be delivered to the Community Coordinated
Modeling Center (CCMC), via the Space Weather Modeling Framework, for broader
use by the solar and heliospheric community. The team will also generate 3D
visualizations and animations of solar phenomena for use in public outreach and
education programs within the University of Hawaii's Institute for Astronomy
(IfA).
