Spaeth 9614000 Since 1989, the investigator has produced two major data bases
on the U.S. Supreme Court. The first, which is updated annually, relies
exclusively on the published Reports of the Court's decisions. The second
includes unpublished conference votes and opinion assignments of the justices
who served during the Vinson (1946-1952) and Warren (1953-1968) Courts. This
project will update and extend the previous work to encompass the Burger Court
(1969-1986). Inclusion of the Burger Court conference vote data will provide
investigators with the complete voting record of each justice in every case in
which a conference vote was cast during a 40-term period,. 1945-1986. Analysts
will have access to a standardized, highly reliable data file with which they
may compare individual and Court voting across vote types, as well as voting
changes of individual justices from one type of vote to another. Because a raft
of background, chronological, substantive, outcome, and opinion variables are
associated with these votes, the richness of the resulting data will enhance the
formulation of theory and the testing of hypotheses. %%% Since 1989, the
