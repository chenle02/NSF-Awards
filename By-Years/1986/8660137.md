Although sufficient quantities of primary metals (such as aluminum) are
presently available at low enough prices, recycling and recovery of metal
resources, in an environmentally-acceptable manner, are topics of national
importance. This proposal outlines a study to examine certain fundamental
parameters (such as oxidation rates) in the electrochemical separation of
magnesium from molten aluminum. The proposed method of separation is novel, and
the parameters proposed for examination are key factors in the design and
evaluation of the proposed method. In addition, it appears that the proposed
research might lead to information of more generic utility. The principal
investigator and his employer, EMEC Consultants, have the expertise and the
resources to conduct the proposed work and qualify for support under the Small
Business Innovation Research Program. Support at the requested level of $40,000
for six months (from FY87 funds) is recommended.
