EPA and other federal agencies are exploring methods for better public
involvement in environmental decision making. This project will compare
conventional surveys, iterative surveys (Delphi method), a web-based survey, and
a web-based "discussion" to explore the strengths and weakness of each method of
public involvement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work will also enhance
understanding of policy preferences regarding climate change, and how those
preferences vary between high and low impact areas, and how they are related to
values, beliefs, trust, political ideology, and position in social structure.
