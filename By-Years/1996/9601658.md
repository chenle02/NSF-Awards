9601658 Chamberlin University of California Irvine This award from the Academic
Research Infrastructure (ARI) Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at
the University of California at Irvine upgrade the existing 500 MHz and 300 MHz
NMRs. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the
following: (1) signaling mechanisms in the central nervous system (2) new models
for monodisperse silica-supported catalysts (3) strategies for the formation of
peptide b-sheets (4) new reactions and strategies that allow the efficient
assembling of complex molecules with high stereo- and enantiocontrol (5) polyene
macrolide antibiotics (6) synthetic methodology/natural product synthesis and
polymer syntheses/materials chemistry (7) research of compounds which contain
indole rings coupled at the 2 position, and (8) new reactions of
silacyclopropanes. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most
powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific
arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR
spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such as polymers,
catalysis, and in biology.
