The Chemical, Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanism program supports work by
Professor Gerald Meyer at Johns Hopkins University to carry out fundamental
studies on the mechanisms of photo-initiated bond-breaking and bond-forming
reactions at molecular-semiconductor interfaces relevant to solar fuels
generation. Proposed studies will specifically focus on quantification of the
electron transfer behavior of molecules at semiconductor interfaces and
correlation of this behavior with charge transfer kinetics relevant to the
formation of metal-ligand and carbon-carbon bonds. The proposed studies are
fundamental in nature, but are directly relevant to the development of efficient
photocatalytic materials. The molecules and materials proposed will enable one
to address long-standing fundamental interfacial science questions relevant to
solar energy conversion in molecular detail that was not possible even twenty
years ago. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through participation in this fundamental
research, students at the undergraduate and graduate level will receive
intensive training in characterization of the kinetics and thermodynamics of
molecular-semiconductor interfaces. This proposal will train students in
interdisciplinary areas with particular focus on molecular coordination
chemistry, catalysis, photochemistry, and photoelectrochemistry. Results from
these studies are envisioned to one day enable the rational molecular-level
design of integrated materials capable of harvesting sunlight, vectorial charge
separation, and multi-electron transfer catalysis to form useful fuels.
