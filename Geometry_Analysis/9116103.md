Professor Kapouleas will study several topics in differential geometry:
constant mean curvature surfaces, harmonic maps, real Einstein manifolds, and
the classification of surfaces. He will use a method of "patching" to construct
constant mean curvature surfaces with prescribed topological properties. The
"patching" process will also be used to try to construct new examples of real
Einstein manifolds. The full extent of the usefulness of the patching process is
not known and one of the goals of the research is to explore other areas in
which this tool might be useful. The research supported by this proposal should
result in a new method of obtaining global information from local information.
The standard method up to this point for obtaining global solutions to partial
differential equations on surfaces involved working with the abstract space of
possible global solutions to the equation. The method to be used in this
research involves putting small parts of solutions together much like one puts
together a jigsaw puzzle. The method has already been successful on one class of
problems and the principal investigator will now try to extend the method to
other classes.
