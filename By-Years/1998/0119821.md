This planning grant supports activities that will lead to a full research
proposal on the interactions between land use change, land cover change, and
climate change at the regional scale in East Africa. Plans include a workshop in
East Africa, concept development for modeling, and a concept paper. The grant
will enable team members from the U.S., Africa, and the U.K. to collaborate
effectively in these activities and to establish modalities for collaborative
preparation of the full proposal and implementation of the research project.
Foreign partner institutions include the University of East Anglia, U.K., and
the International Livestock Research Institute, located in Nairobi, Kenya. The
research proposes application of methods, models, and analytical frameworks used
in Climate Change analysis and Land Use/Cover Change studies for integrated
assessment of climate and its interactions with land use. The scientific focus
will be on examination of the linkages between climate and land-use change,
between land-use change and land-cover change, and between land-cover change and
regional climate modeling. Important issues fundamental to an understanding of
these linkages include interactions between spational and temporal scales,
indirect and non-linear affects, and uncertainty and complexity. A more
effective understanding of these linkages will have societal benefits under
climate change, providing guidance for land and resource managers in East Africa
and elsehwere. The project will facilitate development of international
interdisciplinary collaborations, with education and training opportunities for
U.S. and African graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is an
award emanating from the FY 2001 special competition in Biocomplexity in the
Environment focusing on the Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human
Systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***
