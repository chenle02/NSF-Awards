For years archaeologists have focused on agricultural origins. This study goes
beyond this endeavor by analyzing the effects of intensification, the next stage
of development in socio-cultural evolution. The researcher will provide
important new information for understanding the development and intensification
of prehistoric and historic agricultural systems in Southeast Asia. This study
specifically deals with the problem of surplus products generated by
agricultural intensification and how these were used by chiefdoms. The
researcher will test economic models of the use of prestige goods through
archaeological data obtained from excavations in southeastern Negros,
Philippines. Many chiefdom level societies around the world are currently
experiencing the effects of agricultural intensification. This study will enable
us to better understand how economic and social organizations have been affected
by intensification in Southeast Asia.
