This is a project from the University of Delaware that extends their I-Corps
Site funding for scale up to their next phase of support for innovation and
entrepreneurship. Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities
established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple,
local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites
provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training
and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the
marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also
strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National
Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Delaware's (UD's) I-Corps Site,
established in 2014, resulted in "fostering a spirit of innovation and
entrepreneurship" as one of the University's five strategic goals;
instutionalizing Lean Launchpad methods as the cornerstone for academic
offerings in entrepreneurship; increased enrollments in entrepreneurship
courses; and, resources for supporting entrepreneurship activities increased by
more than 500%, enabling the launch of additional support programs like a
venture mentoring service based on MIT's VMS model. Advancing into the next
stage, they will create a seamless pathway for participants to engage in
commercialization, engage in continuous improvement of the curriculum, advance
additional teams to the I-Corps National Program and directly to startups, and
offer follow-on services as team projects mature and have potential to attract
investors. The Site will also continue to engage in inclusiveness activities to
attract underrepresented participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
