9355798 Watson This project supports a conference sponsored by the Association
of State Supervisors of Mathematics for those state officers who are involved in
the selection of candidates for the Presidential Awards for Excellence in
Science and Mathematics Teaching (PAESMT). These people will discuss the
following issues: (1) implementing the new state award program; (2) planning for
the decade year of the program; (3) establishing a data base on the awardees;
(4) exploring the use of video-taping in the selection process; (5) developing
an electronic networking system for the awardees; (6) generating leadership
capability among the awardees; (7) seeking consistency among states and
jurisdictions in the application and nomination process; and (8) expansion of
the pool of candidates for the program especially to encourage more applications
from minority, urban and rural teachers. Based upon the recommendations of the
conference participants, the state PAESMT coordinators will implement the
necessary changes to improve the effectiveness of the Program for their state.
