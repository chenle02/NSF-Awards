In this project managed by the Chemistry Division, Professor Merg and his
students at the University of California, Merced aim to establish new approaches
to the design and construction of peptide-based nanomaterials. The development
of strategies that afford the ability to precisely control the physical and
chemical properties of nanomaterials is a critical step in furthering their
deployment for a broad range of applications in nanotechnology. The project
aligns with the mission of UC Merced in serving the San Joaquin Valley, an
ethnically diverse and underserved region of California. This research will
support local high school and college students, a majority of whom come from
underrepresented groups in STEM, through participation in immersive summer
research programs and through recruiting activities at nearby high schools,
minority serving institutions, and conferences.

Professor Merg is developing synthetic protocols for fabricating large peptide
macrocycles that comprise multiple de novo coiled coil peptide sequences. These
multivalent biomolecules will be assessed for their ability to associate via
specific, orthogonal coiled coil-based interactions to form various
predetermined multimeric complexes. Success of the project could yield a new
peptide design and assembly strategy with the potential for creating fully
synthetic protein-mimetic constructs with applications in catalysis,
therapeutics, and sensing. The project will leverage the role of Professor Merg
as the campus coordinator of ACS Project SEED (Summer Experiences for the
Economically Disadvantaged) by supporting the high school student participants
with STEM workshops, invitations to conferences, and the establishment of a
formal awards ceremony at the conclusion of the summer research program.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
