The expanded Ebola Testing Unit will allow health care workers to reduce their
exposure to highly contagious pathogens, such as Ebola Virus Disease, by
creating a physical separation between them and the pathogen. The remote-
controlled robot system will allow the health care worker to perform some tasks
without having the be physically close to sources of potential infection and
will, as a result, dramatically reduce their risks of contracting the disease
they are treating. The proposed system will both reduce the risk of infection to
health care workers, and will increase the quality of care that patients
receive: by reducing the time requirements of donning and doffing protective
clothing, health care professionals can concentrate on patient care. Ultimately,
the work proposed here will save lives, both in the current Ebola outbreak, and
also in future outbreaks of highly-infectious diseases.

The approach will focus on three elements: tele-operated mobile manipulation,
protective equipment for easy decontamination of the robot, and a person
tracking system for Ebola treatment facilities. A simulated Ebola testing unit
will be demonstrated within six months. It will integrate new hardware, address
the issues of operation over wireless and identify the robot tasks in
consultation with health care professionals. Protection and decontamination
systems will be evaluated and the effectiveness of the complete system
evaluation. The system will then be integrated in a broader facility in
collaboration with WPI.
