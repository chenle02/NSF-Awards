9314422 Gold This three-year award, which supports U.S.-France-German
cooperative research in inorganic chemistry, involves four laboratories in the
U.S. and Europe. The principal investigators are: Avram Gold of the University
of North Carolina; James Terner of Virginia Commonwealth University; Raymond
Weiss of the Universite Louis Pasteur in Strasbourg, France; and A. X.
Trautwein, Director of the Institute of Physics, University of Lubeck in
Germany. The objective of their research is to study the effects of peripheral
substituents on the molecular and electronic structure of synthetic, high valent
iron porphyrin. The laboratories will contribute complementary techniques
towards characterizing the starting complexes and the high-valent species. The
U.S. investigators are experts in the synthesis, generation, and
characterizations of these compounds using NMR and resonance Raman spectroscopy.
This is complemented by French expertise in synthesis and German expertise in
x-ray crystallography and electrochemical studies. The project will advance
understanding of high valent iron porphyrin, which is an important intermediary
in the catalysis of enzymatic systems. ***
