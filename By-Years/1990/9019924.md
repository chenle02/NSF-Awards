This Special Minority Award provides a year of support for Jennifer D. Frank, a
graduate student at the University of Arizona. The award will allow Ms. Frank to
finish her course work expeditiously and reach the research participation phase
sooner. This award is an integral part of the strategy of the National Science
Foundation to strengthen and increase minority participation in the field of
physics.
