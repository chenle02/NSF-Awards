Side chain polymer and elastomer liquid crystals are new classes of materials
which uniquely combine two competing phenomena; isotropic fluctuations of
polymers and anisotropic orientational and translational order fluctuations of
liquid crystals. They exhibit novel nematic liquid crystalline structures and
phase transitions, and offer a new perspective on the unsolved nematic-
smectic-A problem. A change in the number of spatial dimensions explored by the
polymer chain should occur with the establishment of smectic order in these
systems accompanied by an interesting cross-over behavior among four relevent
length scales. This provides an opportunity to experimentally study the
statistical mechanics of a random coil in two dimensions. The synthesis and
preliminary studies in this area have been performed mostly outside the United
States. They propose here a combination of two powerful techniques, high-
resolution x-ray diffraction and small-angle neutron scattering, to study subtle
aspects of the structure and critical phenomena in these materials. They
proposed research should help bring this interesting area into the main stream
of condensed matter research in this country.
