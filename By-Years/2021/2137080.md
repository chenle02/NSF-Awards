The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the reduction
of the economic and technical barriers preventing the adoption of current and
future advancements in machine learning technologies. Advances in artificial
intelligence (AI) have pushed machine learning models to be computationally
larger and larger. Relatively few organizations currently have access to the
most sophisticated models due to the necessary computational and memory
requirements required to train and deploy such models. This lack of access
results in high costs for researchers and businesses attempting to apply AI in
applications such as robotics, natural language processing, drug discovery, and
computer vision. The technology developed here reduces the size of the models
and optimizes hardware so that large-scale models can be used on existing
systems. Improved access to state-of-the-art models will accelerate adoption of
AI in the economy and potentially drive more rapid improvements in cutting edge
AI-based discoveries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project develops a
combination of several innovations in the field of machine learning
acceleration. The innovation is aimed at simultaneous optimization at the
hardware and software levels. By targeting both levels simultaneously, the
technology enables speeds which are not possible by combining existing
technologies individually. The core technology combines model compression
techniques, custom kernels and hardware utilization designs for acceleration,
and cloud orchestration algorithms. Prior results have shown capabilities to
significantly reduce model sizes and speed inference
results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
