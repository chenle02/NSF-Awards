This award supports an integrated research project to develop
chronostratigraphic and paleoenvironmental records of the continental shelves of
the Chukchi and Bering Seas, off northwestern Alaska. The project will focus on
the paleontology of peat layers in late Pleistocene terrestrial and marginal
marine (marsh) sediments from existing cores. Development of these records will
involve an integrated study of insects, pollen, plant macrofossils, ostracods,
and foraminifera. The goal of this project is to understand the Pleistocene
paleoecology and the inundation history of the Bering land bridge. In addition
to providing a better understanding of Pleistocene paleoenvironmental
conditions, the results of this work have implications for paleoclimatology,
through improved records of sea level change, and anthropology, through a better
chronology and understanding of the Bering land bridge.
