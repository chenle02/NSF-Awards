In this research project supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, the diffusion of H on Re surfaces will be investigated using field
emission fluctuation methods. This experimental information will be supplemented
by Monte Carlo simulations of the surface diffusion process, in order to extract
microscopic diffusion parameters for this system. Tunneling diffusion on stiff
lattices will form the focus of this aspect of the research work. These studies
will be extended to the diffusion of H and O and CO on Ta surfaces as well. A
second aspect of the work to be carried out in this project addresses the
question of metallicity in metal monolayers. Gold and iron overlayers deposited
on refractory metal substrates, with chemisorbed molecular spacers, will be
investigated. Electron energy loss measurements, work function measurements, and
ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopy will be combined to probe the
metallicity of these monolayers. Understanding the microscopic mechanism of
diffusion of atomic and molecular species on transition metal surfaces is
crucial to the understanding of a number of important technologies, ranging from
heterogeneous catalysis to electronic materials processing. The present research
project focusses on experimental and calculational studies of this important
physical process. In addition, the question of the metallic nature of thin film
overlayers is important to the understanding of thin film growth and electronic
device fabrication. The second aspect of this project addresses questions
related to the metallic nature of metal overlayers.
