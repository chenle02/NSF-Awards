The investigator will pursue research on various questions concerned with
topological properties of algebraic spaces. He intends to study the topology of
algebraic varieties, especially invariants of families of plane algebraic
curves, invariants of smooth structure on algebraic varieties, and the behavior
of complex polynomials near infinity. Relating algebraic to topological
structure of spaces is a source of some of the most basic and important
questions in mathematics. It calls upon a wide variety of techniques and has
challenged major figures in topology and algebra both here and abroad.
