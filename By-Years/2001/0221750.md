Funds are recommended for assessment of average and seasonal sea-surface
temperature and seawater delta O-18 at annual to decadal scales from monthly
sub-samples in select intervals of the Holocene on samples from the Dry
Tortugas. The study also includes a calibration effort for the past century. It
aims to reconstruct Holocene (selected time-slices over the last 8.2 Ka) changes
in western Tropical Atlantic SSTs and salinity using Sr/Ca and stable isotope
analyses of fossil corals. The approach takes advantage of the fact that corals
record temperature and (salinity) histories over a narrow depth range of the
tropical ocean, and that fossil corals provide a means to reconstruct ocean
properties for discrete short (multi-century) time slices throughout the
Holocene. Coral paleoclimate reconstructions from the tropics will improve our
understanding of the mechanisms driving the climate changes in the Holocene.
