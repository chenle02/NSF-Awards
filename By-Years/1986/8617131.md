Abstract narrative After an initial burst of activity in the 1960s, when it was
founded, the field of mathematical linguistics has been comparatively quiescent
in the past decade or so. Nonetheless, a few researchers have kept active in the
field, and have periodically produced results which have had a major impact on
general concerns of linguistic theory, such as the demon- stration that the
generative power of transformational grammars, without special constraints, is
greater than supposed, and the proof of the basic learnability theorem. The
Principal Investigator of this proposal is one of those researchers who have
continued to explore the mathe- matical properties of grammatical systems. He is
a leading authority on the theory of computational complexity as it applies to
formal grammars and parsing systems. He has now formulated the outlines of a new
approach to the formal des- cription of syntactic structures, which incorporates
as key elements a novel notation which combines the expressions of first-order
logic with the the expressions of conventional phrase-structure grammars, and a
view of languages as families of finite approximations, in place of the
conventional mathe- matical view of a language as an infinite set of finite
strings. The aim of the project is to develop the investigator's approach into a
formal system which can be used as a tool for linguistic description, and which
can be studied for its mathematical properties in new and potentially revealing
ways. The investigator is being assisted in this endeavor by a collaborator who
is an accomplished descriptive and theoretical linguist. The project has the
potential to make significant new contributions to linguistic theory and also to
computational linguistics.
