This research project studies the feasibility of digital, programmable,
software-based control of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS). MEMS are
extremely small physical structures capable of movement, lithographically
combined with similarly-scaled electrical circuits to produce micron-scale
mechanical devices. Examples of MEMS are tunneling accelerometers, gyroscopes,
and micro-mirrors. Currently, analog controllers are used to control MEMS
because of the very small time constants required to control devices at this
scale. This project has the goal of developing a new style of embedded, software
feedback controllers that communicate to sigma-delta over-sampled analog
interfaces via high sample rate delta encoding. These designs are the result of
research in metric-based controller decomposition that specifically seeks to
achieve the potential of multi-rate, over-sampled signal processing. Direct
benefits of this work are digital controllers suitable for MEMS integration that
match the requirements and potential of these designs, delivering
performance/power ratios that are not possible currently. Although the chosen
implementation strategy is FPGA based, the decomposition strategy should lead to
very small designs, competitive in power to current low-end microprocessors,
with dozens to hundreds of times the performance achieved by current software
based control using digital signal processing (DSP) platforms. The broader
impact of this research project is the development of practical techniques for
the design and modeling of over-sampled controllers for MEMS devices that will
have direct impact in medical prosthetics, distributed sensing, and the vast
range of applications that can benefit from battery-operated sensor array
devices. The project seeks educational impact in the form of graduate curriculum
development and of efforts to enable substantive undergraduate involvement in
research.
