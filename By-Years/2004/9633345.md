9633345 Gans Over the past decades, the growth of immigrant entrepreneurs has
made a distinct and consequential presence in most large U.S. cities. The self-
employment rate for some of these immigrants now exceeds that of the native
born, particularly blacks. Immigrant groups such as Jews and Koreans have been
touted as "model minorities" who have become successful simply through hard
work. This Dissertation Improvement project investigates three areas: (1) the
ways in which immigrant entrepreneurs affect the employment opportunity
structure for blacks by examining their hiring practices; (2) the ways in which
social structures and processes help explain the greater success of self-
employment among immigrants as compared to blacks; (3) the interracial and
inter-ethnic relations between Jews, Koreans, and black. The sample population
consists of 75 entrepreneurs and 75 customers from five largely black
neighborhoods in two cities, New York and Philadelphia. A comparative analysis
will be conducted of Jewish, Korean and black entrepreneurs as well as black
customers in low-income and middle-income neighborhoods to illuminate the
interplay between the structural relationship of merchant and customer, race,
ethnicity, class, culture and economic organization. ***** ??
