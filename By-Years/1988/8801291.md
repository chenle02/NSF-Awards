New methods on the design of a coprocessor to Motorola 68020 for executing
fetch-and-op instructions are being studied. The goal of this research is to
show that the fetch-and-op network can support all synchronization and global
access primitives that earlier networks supported at a lower cost in hardware
and can operate faster, or comparable in time, in software. A Macintosh- II
computer is being used for the development processor, and a coprocessor will be
designed and fabricated on a Nu-bus board to be plugged into it, using McCAD on
the Macintosh, and printed circuit layout subcontracted out to local industry. A
wire-wrap board is being built and connected to the Macintosh-II coprocessor to
simulate external signals that would be supplied to the coprocessor by other
coprocessors in a large parallel system.
