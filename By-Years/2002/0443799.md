This project will design, build and calibrate a collector to obtain time-
sequenced records of micrometeorites and terrestrial dust during hot-water
drilling through polar ice caps. Micrometeorites are extraterrestrial dust
particles less than a millimeter in diameter. Knowledge of the Earth's
micrometeorite flux is critical to understanding its chemical evolution.
Furthermore, micrometeorites provide important information on the formation and
evolution of stars, solar systems, and planets. The prototype collector will
serve as a one third scale model of one proposed for use during large scale
drilling projects. It will also be operational in its own right for use with
small hot-water drills. The collector functions as a replacement to an existing
hot-water drill head. It extracts particles from ice onto a self-contained
scrolling filter. This project will focus on two critical proof-of-concept
issues: (1) collection efficiency and time resolution of the scrolling filter
and (2) performance of the shaped drill head. The broader impacts of this work
include development of new research infrastructure and support for the
participation of two undergraduate students.
