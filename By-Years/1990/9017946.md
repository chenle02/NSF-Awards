Benthic fluxes of inorganic nutrients are known to play important roles in
carbon and nitrogen cycling in the marine environment. At the same time fluxes
of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from marine sediments represent a poorly
quantified component of sedimentary organic matter remineralization that may be
significant when compared to these inorganic benthic fluxes. The long-term goals
of studies in this area are to examine benthic fluxes of DOM in terms of their
quantitative relationship to processes associated with the early diagenesis of
sedimentary organic matter. This research initially will address these goals
using the following approach: 1. development of the high temperature catalytic
oxidation techniques for DOC and DON analyses at Old Dominion University; 2.
development of procedures for the determination of benthic fluxes of DOM in
studies of Chesapeake Bay sediments; and 3. preliminary studies characterizing
DOM in marine sediments.
