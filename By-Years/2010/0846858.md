The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project
is to investigate the interplay between size, structure and composition for
alloy nanowires with diameters of several nanometers and below. Nanowires can
exhibit high mechanical strength and ballistic conductance, which makes them
appealing as connectors in nanoscale circuits or as elements in nano-
electromechanical devices. Practical use in nanodevices requires a rational
control of the structural, electronic, and mechanical properties of the
nanowires. Alloying and doping are direct means to exert such control. This
research will employ genetic algorithms and molecular dynamics simulations to
study the structure and properties of alloy nanowires, and in particular to
examine the parameter regimes in which these wires exhibit structural helicity.
Deliverables include conditions of stability for various size and composition
regimes, simulations of electron microscopy signatures for comparison with
experiments, studies of mechanical properties of nanowires especially those
associated with helical structures, and conductance signatures of the nanowire
alloys. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will help determine
the limits in which alloying persists in specific nanowire systems, and will
give insight into the opportunities offered by alloying to improve material
properties at nanoscale. The results can be useful in the design of various
nano-electromechanical systems that exploit the helical structure to improve
their sensitivity and functionality. Graduate student training will be provided
during this project, and research results will be incorporate into graduate
classes taught by the PI. In addition, opportunities for undergraduate research
will be created. One new course will be developed in which students will become
familiar with advanced numerical and simulation techniques in nanomechanics and
materials science. The PI will participate in several international
collaborations, and in ample activities of training and outreach with the
Society of Women Engineers and the Minority Engineering Program at Colorado
School of Mines.&lt;br/&gt;
