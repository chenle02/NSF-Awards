The novel properties of He (2.3S) metastable atoms will form the theme of this
research program. Electron spin labelling techniques will be used to explore the
dynamics of Penning ionization reactions involving He(2.3S) atoms in an
optically pumped flowing helium afterglow apparatus, which will also be used to
investigate spin exchange in collisions between polarized electrons and open
shell targets such as 0.2. The performance of the flowing helium afterglow as a
source of polarized electrons will also be investigated utilizing newly
developed lasers to optically orient the He(2.3S) electron spins. Conservation
of spin angular momentum in He(2.3S). Penning reactions with closed shell
partners will be exploited in a crossed beam apparatus to provide a new
technique for absolute calibration of electron spin polarimeters. The
interactions of He(2.3S) atoms at a liquid helium surface will be investigated,
with expectation that the He(2.3S) atoms will be trapped there. Attempts will be
made to modify these interactions by spin polarizing the He(2.3S) atoms.
