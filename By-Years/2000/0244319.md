&lt;br/&gt;ALAN T. WATERMAN AWARD&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Jennifer A.
Doudna&lt;br/&gt;(0003240)&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jennifer A.
Doudna, a Professor at Yale University in the Department of Molecular Biophysics
and Biochemistry is the recipient of the 2000 Alan T. Waterman award. She has
conducted innovative research that led to the development of a technique that
facilitates crystallization of large RNA molecules, has determined the crystal
structure of catalytic RNA molecules and a RNA molecule that forms the
ribonucleoprotein core of the signal recognition particle, and has deciphered
structural features of those molecules that permit a greater understanding of
the mechanistic basis of RNA function in both catalysis and in protein
synthesis. &lt;br/&gt;Her current research is reshaping basic theories regarding
the roles of metal ions in ribozyme function. No longer viewed as strict
metalloenzymes, some ribozymes can access alternative catalytic mechanisms
depending on the identity and availability of metal ions. Similarly, reaction
conditions can allow different folding pathways to predominate, with divalent
cations sometimes playing opposing
roles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
