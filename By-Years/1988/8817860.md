This research, part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, is designed
to study the state-resolved vibrational dynamics of large polyatomic molecules.
It is expected that studies such as this one will form the basis for
understanding of vibrational intramolecular energy transfer. The methods of
laser-excited fluorescence as well as field-free time-of-flight ion spectroscopy
will be used to study the vibrational dynamics of polyatomic molecules.
Supersonic jet expansions will be used to monitor the dynamics of electronically
excited dissociating van der Waals complexes of large molecules. The interaction
of methyl internal rotators and vibrations will be studied in both static and
dynamic systems.
