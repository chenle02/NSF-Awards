Dr. Alexander Ramm of Kansas State University will visit Dr. Vesselin Petkov of
the Institute of Mathematics, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, to prepare a
cooperative research project on inverse scattering problems. The resulting
proposal is intended for consideration under the U.S.-Bulgaria Cooperative
Science Program and if successful, should contribute to our knowledge of an open
theoretical problem in mathematics concerning scattering amplitude.
