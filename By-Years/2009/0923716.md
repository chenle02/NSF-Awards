This award will help to help support student attendance at the ACM Annual
Symposium on the Theory of Computing (STOC) in Bethesda, Maryland, May 31
through June 2, 2009. STOC and its sister conference, the IEEE FOCS meeting, are
the premier broad-based conferences on the Theory of Computing in North America.
In recent years the attendance at STOC has been roughly 275 plus or minus 25.
40% or more of the attendees have been students, for whom the conference serves
as a valuable educational experience, both as regards the technical content of
the talks and the opportunities for networking that it provides. This award will
provide partial support to as many as thirty student attendees, covering
registration fees, shared hotel rooms, and travel.
