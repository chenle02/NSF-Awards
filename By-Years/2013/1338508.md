The goal of this project is to develop a research community and infrastructure
for learning analytics in digital games for learning. The project will convene a
series of meetings that will: 1) establish standards for capturing and storing
click-stream data from learning games and other sources; 2) define analytic
methods for organizing and querying data to facilitate a variety of analytic
processes; and 3) defining a set of APIs that will guide developers to build
games that can contribute data to a national database. The project is a
partnership of researchers from academia, private non-profit research
institutions and for-profit entities
