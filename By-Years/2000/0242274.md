The changing nature of engineering and the newest technologies emerging from it
require the engineering profession to expand its approach to addressing ethical
and technical issues. The objective of this workshop project is to create a
research agenda aimed at including contemporary contextual ethics, exhibiting
concern with effects on the entire ecology of life, and integrating "micro-
ethics" (individual and professional ethics), "meso-ethics" (the ethics of
business and government), and "macro-ethics" (societal ethics). The approach
brings together scholars, practitioners and professionals from diverse fields in
a facilitated planning session and a workshop to develop a research agenda for
advancing knowledge and understanding in the field of engineering ethics and
helping to incorporate contemporary contextual ethical theories into the
education and practice of the engineering profession. The three-step process
requires a planning session to crystallize the issues to be addressed in the
research agenda-setting workshop, to consider how they might fit together and to
finalize the list of invitees. The second step is the workshop itself, a two-day
event that will be based on four main themes: (a) emerging ethical issues in
technology, (b) current understanding of contemporary ethics as it applies to
the development of technology, (c) research needs for addressing these
contemporary ethical issues, and (d) research needs for the design and
implementation of courses, seminars and curricula nation-wide, as well as the
harmonization of professional codes of conduct with this curriculum. The third
step will be the development and dissemination of the workshop proceedings. A
Workshop Web Site will publicize the progress of the workshop, including the
planning, the agenda, the participation, and the final proceedings.
