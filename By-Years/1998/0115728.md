The Jackson Public School District (JPS) proposes to significantly advance the
science, mathematics, and technology education (SMT) of all K-12 students
through the Jackson Urban Systemic Program (JUSP). The District plans to
accomplish this task by building on the existing infrastructure developed
primarily through the Comprehensive Partnership for Mathematics and Science
Achievement, the Center for Research in Teaching and Learning funded by the
National Science Foundation (NSF), and the K-12 Higher Education Partnership
funded by NSF in partnership with the National Institutes of Health. This
infrastructure is characterized by an exemplary leadership team, content
standards for science and mathematics, policies in support of SMT education for
all, the convergence of fiscal and intellectual resources, and a shared vision
for improving the capacity of principals, teachers, and students.

To accomplish the goals and objectives of the USP, the District intends to
provide all of its students with the fundamentals of mathematics and science so
that their understanding, ability, and academic achievement will enable them to
perform at or above their peers from around the world. The major goals are: (1)
to increase student achievement in science and mathematics; (2) to increase
competency in the science and mathematics instructional workforce; and (3) to
strengthen the District's capacity to sustain SMT reform. Hence, JPS will use
the USP to improve its capacity to enhance student achievement via an
articulated K-12 science and mathematics curriculum, a more diverse and highly
qualified instructional workforce, and stronger and more focused partnerships.
