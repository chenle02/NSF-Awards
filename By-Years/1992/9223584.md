Under an SGER award an attempt will be made to produce polycrystalline silicon
nitride compacts with grain boundary material which has been engineered to
produce compressive stresses during cooling from the sintering temperature. It
is expected that the resultant material will have improved wear resistance. The
approach involves coating of submicron powders in solution, followed by
calcination to form a thin, uniform layer of SiAlON which will become the grain
boundary material in solid components compacted from the powder.
