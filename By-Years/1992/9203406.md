Algorithms will be constructed to calculate generalized solutions of problems
arising in the calculus of variations that involve non-convex bulk energy
functionals and which have no classical minima. The generalized solutions,
consisting of a parameterized Young measure and a weak limit (of a minimizing
sequence) do exist and will be calculated numerically by these algorithms. The
proposed approach offers considerable economy over direct simulation of the
oscillatory minimizing sequences since the weak limit and Young measure are
slowly varying quantities in general, which may be well approximated using
coarse meshes. In many physical problems, the observed macroscopic properties
are averages of fine-scale quantities visible only through optical or possibly
electron microscopes. For example, many common metals consist of layers of
several distinctly different component metals. The problem of determining the
properties of such a materials by direct averaging over the fine layers is
beyond the scope of current computers. The Young measure characterizes the
averaged properties very succinctly. In this project, the theory of Young
measures will be utilized to develop computer codes capable of determining both
the microscopic and macroscopic properties of such materials.
