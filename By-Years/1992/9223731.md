Modern organizations operate under increasing levels of time pressure: While
the volume of information increases due to advanced communication and
information processing technologies, the time allowed for deliberation and
decisions is growing shorter. It is a commonly held belief, supported by many
empirical studies, that decisions made under time pressure are inferior, in many
respects, to those made under more benign circumstances. While advances in
information technology are a major contributor to time pressure, appropriate
design of information systems could improve decision making under time pressure.
This project involves an experiment designed to study how decision support
systems can remedy some of the detrimental effects of time pressure on decision
making. This can be achieved by designing a decision support system that either
structures the decision process for the decision maker or that guides the
decision maker to use a more structured decision process. Results are expected
to provide both practical guidelines for the design of decision aids to be used
in time pressure environments, and theoretical insights into decision behavior
under time pressure. The study is viewed also as a springboard for a research
program on the incorporation of decision aids in individual and group decision
making under time pressure.
