This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will aid in the purchase of mass spectrometry data systems in the Chemistry
Department at Montana State University. The research to be performed with this
instrumentation include the following: Studies of various high pressure gas
phase ionic processes; the identification of the neutral products formed in gas
phase ionic processes; fundamental studies of desorption ionization processes
associated with FAB and Electrospray mass spectrometry; the detection of
environmentally interesting atmospheric components at the low- and sub- parts
per trillion level; organic transformations facilitated by platinum(II) and
other transition metals; biological control and signalling mechanisms involving
macromolecular receptors in visual and neutrophil systems; the production of
Taxol and Taxanes from microbiological sources; and the identification of lipid
peroxidation products generated by environmental toxins. Mass Spectrometry (MS)
is a technique used to probe intimate structural details and to obtain the
molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic and organometallic
molecules. The computer data systems allow state-of-the-art control of research
grade mass spectrometers which gives the chemist one of the most powerful tools
available for the characterization of compounds. The acquisition of this
capability in mass spectrometry is essential for the prosecution of frontier
research in many fields of chemistry.
