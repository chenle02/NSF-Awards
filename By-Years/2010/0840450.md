This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award from the Chemistry
Research Instrumentation and Facilities Multiuser Program (CRIF:MU), the
Chemistry Department at Jackson State University (JSU) will acquire a multi-user
GC-triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The spectrometer will enable/enhance
research activities such as: (1) stereochemistry of biosynthesis and metabolism
of tetrahydroisoquinoline-derived neurotoxins; (2) photochemical reaction
mechanism of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; (3) atmospheric chemistry of
alkoxy radicals; (4) synthesis of 11-deoxyfistularin-3 and synthetic analogues;
(5) light-induced nucleic acid base excitation, oxidation and release from
nucleotides; and (6) supramolecular complexes of anions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe
intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast
array of organic, bioorganic, and organometallic molecules. This research is
also expected to have a positive effect on the environment. MS is one of the
fastest growing and most widely used analytical instrumentation techniques.
Because of this, it is important for graduate and undergraduate students at this
HBCU, one of three with a PhD program, to be exposed to the technique. This
instrument will support many researchers and students at JSU and others in the
metro Jackson MS area. It will be an integral part of teaching as well as
research.
