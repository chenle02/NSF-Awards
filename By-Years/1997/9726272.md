9726272 Hodges Two species of the columbine genus Aquilegia, A. formosa and A.
pubescens, have very different floral morphologies and are predominantly
pollinated by different animals. A. formosa has red, pendent, short-spurred
flowers pollinated by hummingbirds and A. pubescens has white, upright, long-
spurred flowers pollinated by hawkmoths. While these two species are fully
compatible in controlled crosses, they rarely crossbreed in nature due to the
differences in their flowers. The two species' distributions overlap in the
southern Sierra Nevada mountains of California where narrow hybrid zones form.
We will determine the number of genes responsible for the differences in floral
morphology by utilizing techniques developed for animal and plant breeding.
Because hybrid zones do occur where these species overlap, genes from one
species that are not affected by natural selection can penetrate beyond the
hybrid zone into the other species. However, genes that are affected by natural
selection are prevented from penetrating the alternate species. We will
determine how natural selection acts on each segment of the genome by measuring
the degree it is able to penetrate beyond the hybrid zone. A major goal of
evolutionary biology is to understand the genetic basis of traits conferring
reproductive isolation. These traits are responsible for the generation and
maintenance of biological diversity. Many scientists believe that most adaptive
differences between species arise from the accumulation of many small genetic
changes while others believe that they arise from a few changes with large
effects. This issue has remained unresolved because detailed genetic studies
have been limited to only a few model organisms. In addition, the number of
traits and the proportion of the genome important for species isolation is
unknown. By synthesizing genome mapping techniques with hybrid zone analyses a
detailed examination of the genetics of specie s isolation will be possible.
