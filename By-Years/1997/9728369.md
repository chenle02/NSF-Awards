This project has two aims. First and foremost is the aim of collecting data on
four previously undocumented or poorly documented languages of Nepal. There are
at least 130 languages spoken in Nepal and, of these languages, only about 25
have grammatical descriptions of any sort and many of these are rudimentary.
Since no more than about three dozen of Nepal's language are spoken by more than
5000 people, since bilingualism in the national language, Nepali, is now almost
universal for adults, and since economic factors typical of many undeveloped
countries are operative in Nepal resulting in increasing migration to the
cities, it seems unlikely that the majority of Nepalese languages can survive
for more than a generation or two. It is imperative that linguistic fieldwork be
conducted now while the majority of Nepal's languages are still spoken by whole
communities. The second aim of the project is to provide training in fieldwork
and TibetoBurman linguistics for four graduate students.
