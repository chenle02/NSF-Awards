1551591&lt;br/&gt;Neimark, Alexander V.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Travel
funds are requested to partially support approximately 25 graduate students and
young faculty to participate in the 12 International Conference on Fundamentals
of Adsorption (FOA12) in Germany from May 29-June 3, 2016. In order to encourage
US participation in this critical conference,funding is requested to partially
defray the travel costs of US participants from academia and nonprofit research
institutions. The goal is to provide partial support to about 25 US researchers
from this grant &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technological advances in energy,
biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and environmental applications of adsorption will
be facilitated by FOA12 through sharing of new adsorption-related scientific
information at the highest level. Additional broader impacts will be associated
with the participation of young faculty and graduate students (facilitated by
the proposed travel funds), and their exposure to the frontiers of adsorption
science and technology in a truly interdisciplinary and international scientific
gathering.
