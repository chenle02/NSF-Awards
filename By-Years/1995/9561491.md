This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a
technology for vacuum deposited high temperature SMA thin film for micro-
electro-mechanical (MEM) systems. These films exhibit physical and mechanical
characteristics identical and even better than those of conventional forms of
TiNi. Perhaps most importantly, the process of thin film deposition is
compatible with that for Si micromachining and offers a unique possibility for
the mass production of highly integrated microdevices using SMA actuators. This
Phase I research effort will take advantage of the benefits of sputtering
technique to obtain high temperature SMA actuators. Foils with a wide range of
thickness (I to 20 microns) and composition will be produced for testing
purposes and for use as actuators for fluid and gas microvalves designed by Ti-
Ni Alloy Company. Reliable and fast acting latching/release mechanisms,
miniature resetable circuit breakers, safety devices, strip and membrane valve
actuators are just some of potential uses for this material.
