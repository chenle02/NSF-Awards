In this project, which is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and
Organometallic Chemistry Program, Dr. Richard D. Adams of the University of
South Carolina will continue his studies of heterometallic polynuclear clusters.
These recently discovered compounds contain triangular layers of platinum and
ruthenium or osmium atoms and carbonyl ligands. Preliminary results suggest
metal selectivity in reactions with organic compounds. Major objectives of the
research are the development of systematic methods for preparation of these
novel metal clusters and a comprehensive investigation of selectivity effects in
coordination of substrates, and cooperativity in their activation, by the
different metal layers. A combination of infrared, polynuclear NMR and single
crystal x-ray diffraction coupled with reactivity studies, including kinetics,
will be used to explore these new cluster compounds. A number of significant
industrial heterogeneous catalysts contain more than one type of metal. These
mixed metal, heterometallic catalysts are more active and/or selective in their
reactions than are catalysts generated from the individual metals. The reasons
for this synergistic action are not well understood. This project will utilize
novel heterometallic cluster compounds to investigate reactions in homogeneous
systems that may then be related to heterogeneous situations. The information
obtained may allow for the development of a better understanding of the reasons
why mixed metal, heterogeneous catalysts have unique properties and ultimately
for the rational design of new catalysts.
