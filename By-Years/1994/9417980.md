This project involves the ethnographic research of two cultural
anthropologists, one from Amherst and one from Trinity College. The project will
take place in Papua New Guinea and is a continuation of a long-term study of the
Chambri ethnic group in East Sepik province. This is an area of traditional
tribal society which has recently urbanized. The researchers will interview
people in the traditional rural communities that they have studied for the past
25 years, as well as in the urban slum to which some have moved. The focus of
the study is changes in ethnic identity, from a `tribal` affiliation as
`Chambri` to a residence-based identity as `urban-resident` vs. `rural-
resident`. As a result of recent global processes of change involving increased
urbanization and mass culture (clothing and music styles) these formerly
traditional people are changing to become more individualistic and more
capitalistically inclined. Using ethnographic participant-observation and
structured interviews the researchers will assess the flows of resources between
urban and rural places, to see whether a remittance economy has developed with
urban cash and whether the rural communities subsidize the urban communities
through cheap reproduction. The changes in knowledge of traditional culture will
be assessed by interviewing young people, and the emergence of a national
identity over the traditional tribal one will be assessed. This research is
important because it studies in depth a continuing process of global change that
has changed personal identity along ethnic, class and residential lines.
Advances in our understanding of the changes in the actual lived situations of
traditional, tribal peoples will be valuable for decision-makers and planners
who must cope with the continuing movement of peoples between rural and urban
places.
