This research program examines mechanisms of dealloying, or selective removal
(SR), of a component from metal alloys. Several experimental techniques, atom
probe field ion microscopy (AP-FIM), scanning tunneling microscopy/atomic force
microscopy (STM/AFM), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, are employed
that are state-of-the-art to characterize the SR process at the nanometer level
in real time. A model of SR mechanism has been developed, and the research
involves testing and improving the model. The relationships between alloy
composition, environment, reaction rate, temperature, time, and pore formation
and size are examined. %%% The subject is of wide ranging technological
importance from catalysis to stress corrosion cracking to high temperature
oxidation.
