The notion that social, cultural, and economic differences between immigrants
and natives fade over the course of a few generations is the essence of the
assimilation hypothesis. Recent sociological and historical research rejects the
hypothesis that full assimilation is an unavoidable outcome of the ethnic
experience. This literature stresses the fact that the United states remains a
multicultural, pluralistic society and cites as evidence the social, cultural,
and economic differences that exist and persist among ethnic groups. The purpose
of this project is to develop a theoretical and empirical analysis of why and
how these ethnic differences in skills and earnings persist across generations.
The operational hypothesis of the study is that ethnicity acts as an externality
in the human capital accumulation process. The simplest version of this
hypothesis states that the skills of the next generation depend not only
parental inputs, but also on the average quality of the ethnic environment in
which these investments are made. The introduction of ethnic capital into an
economic model of intergenerational mobility has an important, fundamental
implication: ethnic differences and skills and earning observed in this
generation are likely to persist for many generations and these difference may
not be amenable to easy eradication. This hypothesis will be tested using a
number of data sets, including the General Social Surveys, the National
Longitudinal Surveys of Youth, and Public Use Samples of the U.S. Census.
