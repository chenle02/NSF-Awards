9351291 Vrudhula The aim of this project is to establish an undergraduate
digital systems design laboratory with emphasis on VLSI. This laboratory is part
of a new two- course sequence offered to seniors in computer engineering. The
primary objectives of this project are: (1) to expose the students to all
aspects of systems design, starting from the behavioral level down to the layout
level; and (2) to teach the fundamental engineering discipline involved in
evaluation, testing and redesign. These primary objectives are being achieved by
addressing the following important aspects of systems design: (1) use of
multiple levels of abstraction; (2) methods of evaluating a design in terms of
performance, area, design time and cost at each level; (3) examining tradeoffs
among the possible choices that are available at each level; (4) understanding
the limits of fabrication technology, causes and effects of failures and fault
models; and (5) understanding that design and test cannot be separate activities
by introducing design for testability. The purpose of the laboratory is to
provide hands on experience through the use of the latest CAD tools and a
computing environment that reflects the state-of-the-art in industry. The tools
eliminate much of the mundane aspects of the design and allow the students to
focus on the important high level design issues. Theoretical knowledge and
practical design experience are carefully balanced through a set of realistic
design projects that involve the students in all aspects of systems design. In
addition, the laboratory provides for rapid prototyping of the designs through
the use of Field Programmable Gate Arrays. This allows students to build,
exercise, and re-evaluate designs. ***
