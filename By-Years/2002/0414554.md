With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor
Richard Van Duyne of Northwestern University is investigating the optical
properties of individual metal nanoparticles. Strategies are being developed for
tailoring particles with optimized characteristics for use in ultra-sensitive
chemical sensing platforms. Optical microscope techniques with integrated probe
microscopy are applied to perform localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)
scattering spectroscopy experiments on individual particles. Particles with
controlled and well-defined size, shape and composition are prepared by casting
materials inside nanowell templates through reactive ion etching and electron
beam deposition. Strategies are also being pursued for the study of single
molecule properties through surface enhanced Raman scattering and tip-enhanced
Raman spectroscopy (TERS) measurements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The synthetic and
detection strategies are improving sensitivity in chemical sensing and enabling
new insights into localized chemical reaction sites with potential for
application in catalysis and cell biology.&lt;br/&gt;
