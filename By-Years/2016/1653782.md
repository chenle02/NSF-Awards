Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Huang; 1653782&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;T-cells are a type of
white blood cell that circulate around our bodies, scanning for cellular
abnormalities and infections. The research goal is to understand the molecular
mechanism of T cell recognition and signaling, which determines the selection,
development, fate, and function of a T cell. Existing T-cell studies cannot
directly visualize and measure the dynamic interactions and signaling events
with enough spatiotemporal resolution. The PI proposes to use single-molecule
resonance energy transfer and light-sheet microscopy to address this immunology
problem by measuring early T cell intracellular signaling kinetics.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The PI will integrate research within teaching and create a research-
intensive learning environment to educate students at the interface of
immunology and engineering through a new emerging discipline called immune-
engineering. In addition, the PI will develop educational materials,
demonstrations, and web tutorials to inspire students to explore new research
areas, and develop novel technologies to drive the booming field of immune-
engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research project will use Forster's
resonance energy transfer (FRET) to study molecular mechanisms of T cell
recognition and signaling. The PI will attach fluorescent markers to the
membrane receptors of T cells responsible for recognition and signaling.
Furthermore, the PI will visualize T-cell receptor conformational changes,
quantify the role of CD4, and measure early T-cell intracellular signaling
kinetics in-situ. Also, he will observe T-cell receptor (TCR) and CD4 binding to
peptide bound histocompatibility complexes. This initiates T-cell recognition
and signaling at the cell membrane; antigen recognition will trigger proximal
TCR signal transduction.
