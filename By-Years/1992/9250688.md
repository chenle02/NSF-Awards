The Morehead Radio Telescope (MRT) is being assembled to enhance the curricula
in undergraduate physical science and science education programs. It provides an
instrument for undergraduate research projects in astronomy and astrophysics,
and a laboratory in astronomy, physics, electrical engineering, and computer
science. In addition, the MRT is used in science teacher education and in-
service programs. The telescope incorporates a modular design in which
components may be easily removed for use in laboratory investigations and for
student research and design projects. The sensitivity and versatility of the
telescope design facilitate the investigation of a wide variety of astrophysical
phenomena.
