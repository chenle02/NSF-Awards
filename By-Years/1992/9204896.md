This project will organize, convene and report on an NSF regionally- based
workshop on architectural research needs in earthquake hazard mitigation. The
workshop will review and analyze the current state-of-the art in relation to a
range of earthquake hazard mitigation research issues in architectural and
nonstructural systems, and in relation to broader land-use planning issues and
physical urban design issues. Future research needs will be identified and
prioritized for these same systems under the goals of the Architectural and
Mechanical Systems (AMS) program element. As one of three regional workshops on
the topic subject, this workshop will focus on Mid-West issues. A Final Report
on Workshop results will be issued for distribution to the architectural and
urban design research community and for NSF use in program assessment and
development.
