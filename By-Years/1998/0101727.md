This project (Minority Engineering Transfer and Articulation Program - META) is
a joint effort by Santa Fe Community College, New Mexico State University, the
New Mexico State Highway and Transportation Department, and three civil
engineering firms. It supplements the New Mexico Alliance for Minority
Participation (AMP). META's goals are to provide a connected and coordinated
educational pathway from associate's degree programs in engineering technology
to bachelor's degree programs in civil engineering and to create instructional
materials that emphasize technology applications in civil engineering. The
summer bridge program includes an industry-sponsored design project, a new
technology course, guidance workshops and seminars. There are also summer
internships, industry sponsored tuition and book scholarships, faculty
development seminars and workshops, comprehensive student advising, and multi-
level recruitment strategy. It addresses minority issues and updates an outdated
Civil Engineering curriculum.
