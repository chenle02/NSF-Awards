Twenty-five sophmore and junior high school students will participate in
research at laboratories affiliated with Boston University, for six weeks during
the summer. These high ability secondary school students will live on the campus
of Boston University for the duration of the project. The coordinating staff of
two Program Directors and Resident Assistants will also live in the dormitories
with the participants. The objective of this Research Internship Program (RIP)
is to sensitize students to scientific careers through involvement in research,
exposure to questions at the frontiers of knowledge and exposure to the methods
and ideas used to answer them. Each student will be paired with a Preceptor, a
person actively engaged in research, and will work with him or her on on-going
research problems. A series of weekly seminars will provide a more global view
of research in science. These sessions will provide coherence to the program and
give the students an opportunity to learn from each other as well as from the
research community at the university.
