9528584 Blumenthal This project will convene an interdisciplinary workshop to
explore key determinants of the impacts of computing and communications,
identify the routes by which these new technologies influence our work and
lives, and determine critical next research steps for building interdisciplinary
understanding of the social and economic impacts of computing and
communications. To expedite and focus discussions at the workshop, at least two
background papers will be prepared that would (1) array relevant technology
trends and pose issues and (2) summarize what existing evidence does or does not
say about the routes, nature, and distribution of impacts. There will also be a
workshop report. ***
