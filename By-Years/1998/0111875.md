0111875&lt;br/&gt;Reiners&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides partial
support for acquisition of a laser extraction system for (U-Th)/He chronometry.
Laser heating and gas extraction from crystals for (U-Th)/He thermochronometry
and geochronometry provides significantly lower He blanks, allows very small
aliquots (single crystals) and very young samples to be dated, dramatically
increases sample throughput, and allows dating of refractory minerals such as
titanite, zircon, and garnet. The laser extraction system will be incorporated
into a He mass spectrometry line and (U-Th)/He dating lab at Yale University,
which is supported by a new geochemistry lab manager position in the Department
of Geology and Geophysics, and a new HR-ICP-MS for U-Th determinations. The lab
will focus on both experimental development of new (U-Th)/He approaches and
applications, as well as routinely providing low-temperature cooling ages for
establishing the timing and rates of tectonic and geomorphologic processes and
dating of volcanic rocks. The laser extraction system will be a critical
component of this lab, both because of its ability to provide relatively rapid,
low-blank, He extraction from a wide variety of minerals for experimental and
methodological studies, as well as its ability to process large numbers of
routine samples for collaborative research projects (primarily apatite,
titanite, and zircon He ages for tectonic
studies).&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
