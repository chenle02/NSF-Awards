Using results from the now-operational Large Hadron Collider, this project will
probe the physics of electroweak symmetry breaking and test the twin theoretical
ideas of the Higgs mechanism and supersymmetry. By examining extensions of the
Higgs sector, the group will find ways to test the minimal models of
supersymmetry and to distinguish among various models using data. This will also
tie into tests of lepton flavor violation through Higgs decays, a phenomenon
deeply connected to the ongoing efforts to study neutrino masses and mixings.
Finally, connections will be explored between the physics of the Higgs boson,
supersymmetry and the astrophysical problems of dark matter and the baryon
asymmetry of the universe. In so doing, the group seeks to increase our
understanding of physics which is not readily measured in experiment, such as
the source of the neutrino masses and the properties of the dark matter
correlated with experimental signatures for SUSY at the LHC.

Simultaneously, this project includes continued outreach to the Notre Dame
academic community through new and innovative courses in modern physics for non-
science majors, work on improving academic advising throughout the university,
and programs designed to increase the number of Notre Dame students pursuing
graduate studies in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. This is
coupled to continued outreach to the greater Northern Indiana community through
public lectures and planetarium shows on the Notre Dame campus, and interactions
with local high schools through the QuarkNet program.
