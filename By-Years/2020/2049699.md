Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By the late 19th century, the United States
achieved very strong school enrollment rates. This project examines the role of
internal migration in the spread of education, using novel historical data that
covers many aspects of American economic and social life before and after the
Civil War. The information recorded in the dataset includes the value of the
taxed property and the amounts of tax revenue raised the number of public and
private schools, teachers, and pupils in those schools; their finances by
revenue source; the number of libraries and newspapers printed; and the
prevailing wages paid to different kinds of labor. Utilizing this data, the
project considers potential mechanisms to understand how internal migration
affected local schooling choices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project explores how
migration from more educated states affect school enrollment rates for the local
population. The project builds on the notion that inequality in school
enrollments can be explained by the origins of migrants who chose to live in a
given county. Accordingly, internal migration was an important channel in the
spread of schools in the US. Using detailed historical data, the project
examines specific channels through which migrants from more educated states
improved the schooling outcomes of the locals. The project particularly focuses
on the funding of schools through property taxes to consider that migrants from
states with functioning public systems can be instrumental for more public
funding for schools in their destinations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
