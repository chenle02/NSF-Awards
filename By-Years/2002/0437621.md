Abstract

Proposal Title: The Transport-model-independent Description of Membrane
Transport: Optical and Thermo-optical Spectroscopic Experiments and Analysis
Proposal Number: CTS-0437621 Principal Investigator: Sankar Nair Institution: GA

Reflectance and photoacoustic FTIR spectroscopy will be developed for probing
the concentration profiles of the diffusing species in membranes. This technique
complements the existing experimentation in this field in that it provides sub-
micron information about both the chemistry of the membrane and the
concentration profile of the diffusing species. The proposed research plan
includes a comprehensive modeling component, primarily with regard to
interpreting the experimental data. The software package developed is expected
to provide a useful visualization tool of transport through membranes. The PI
has previously demonstrated the strengths of the technique and published on its
principles in the literature. Separate TGA experiments will be used to determine
the solubility (partition coefficient) of the diffusing species in the membrane.
Once the concentration profile, species flux, and solubility are known, one can
match the experimental data to simple transport models. The proposed research is
expected to have broader impact in the field of separations by offering a new
and powerful method for studying the transport of fluids through membranes. The
new insights and methods from this research will be incorporated into the
undergraduate and graduate course curriculum as a module within courses on
transport phenomena in confined and nanoscale environments. The educational and
outreach plans outlined in the proposal are well articulated and feasible.
Assessment mechanisms proposed are very important and represent strong points of
the proposal. Many fields of technology would directly benefit from this
research including sensor membranes, fuel-cell membranes, and membrane reactors.
