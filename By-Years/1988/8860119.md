A powerful Automatic Generation Control (AGC)-type power- systems
model/simulator will be developed under this proposed project. The simulator
development will require structuring the model components using time-scale
separation methodology, development of appropriate transmission plant thermal
models and of bus voltage control device models, and developments in network
processing techniques. The result will be a PC-based AGC-type simulator that not
only will combine the major advantages of the engineering-class and training-
class simulators, without disadvantages of each, but will go beyond the state of
the art in providing a tool for across-the-board analysis of all relevant
phenomena in the AGC frequency range. The extended AGC simulator will provide
unparalleled capabilities for the study of power system operation and the
effectiveness of potential AGC and voltage control algorithms. It will be useful
to power system engineers, to universities for teaching and research, to power
system operators, and to utilities and vendors for evaluation of AGC offerings.
