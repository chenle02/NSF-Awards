The Stabilized Explicit-Implicit Domain Decomposition (SEIDD) is a class of
globally non-iterative and non-overlapping Domain Decomposition (DD) algorithms
for solving parabolic equations on parallel computers. These algorithms do not
use large amounts of memory and are inherently parallel, which makes them useful
for large scale parallel processing. The SEIDD approach aims to provide
algorithmic solutions that can better utilize parallel/distributed computing
resources, thereby improving the accessibility of high performance computing
power for researchers and educators from abroad range of science and engineering
disciplines. Through integration with education and curriculum development, this
research project promises to provide better education opportunities in high
performance computing for a wide range of students while offering immediate
training for computer science students in parallel algorithm design and
programming.
