Traditionally, design and analysis parameters for stiff clays are selected more
on the basis of educated guesswork and past experience than from direct test
results. This is particularly true for values of modulus and coefficients of
lateral earth pressure. In an attempt to reduce the subjectivity in the
parameter definition process, there is a growing trend to use one or other forms
of pressuremeter in characterizing stiff clays. This research is a multi-phased
effort involving field, laboratory, and analytical approaches designed to
provide insight into pressuremeter testing of stiff clays. A near ideal stiff
clay medium has been located in Richmond, VA, for testing, and preliminary
laboratory work has been performed. The results of the research should enhance
the understanding of stiff clay response to pressuremeter loading and help
define the proper techniques for pressuremeter testing in stiff clays.
