Combettes The goal of this research is to lay a theoretical and computational
foundation for the use of parallel projection methods in set theoretic
signal/image restoration and reconstruction. Its main motivation is to overcome
the shortcomings of the Method of Successive Projections (MOSP, POCS in the
Convex case) that currently prevail in the field: MOSP is not well suited for
implementation on parallel processors due to its serial structure; it provides
poor solutions if the sets do not intersect (inconsistent formulations); and it
converges slowly and there is no general rule for adapting the relaxation
coefficients to speed up the iterations. A general Method Of Parallel
Projections (MOPP) is being developed in which the current iterate is projected
simultaneously onto selected sets and the update is a relaxed convex combination
of the projections. Research objectives include, a formal study of the
convergence properties of MOPP for convex and nonconvex, as well as for the
consistent and inconsistent formulations; development of iteration-dependent,
extrapolated overrelaxations to achieve very fast convergence; and investigation
of the practical and computational issues pertaining to signal/image recovery
applications.
