Roswell Park Memorial Institute will initiate an 8-week combined residential
and commuter Young Scholars project for 20 students in grade l2 in molecular
biology. The Roswell Park Summer Research Program will be entering its 37th
continuous year of operation in l990. Twenty high ability high school students
completing their junior year will be selected from across the country to
participate. Students will spend one day a week in the classroom and four days a
week in the laboratory. In the classroom, students will receive lectures in
molecular and cell biology, science and ethics, career exploration and a special
NSF Distinguished Lecture Series. Program evaluation will be conducted in a
variety of ways and assess both program and student. Students will be followed-
up several months to one year after participation to gauge success and to
identify problems and/or provide counseling. Periodic newsletters will also be
sent.
