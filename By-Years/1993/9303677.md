This award will provide one-half the funding required to purchase a modern
X-ray powder diffractometer to be housed, operated, and maintained in the
Department of Earth Resources at the Colorado State University. The University
is committed to providing the remaining funds needed for the acquisition. Powder
X-ray diffractometry is an essential tool in earth science research and
teaching. Several research and teaching programs at Colorado State University in
chemical weathering, soil production, groundwater alteration processes, climatic
and vegetation controls on soils development, economic geology, sedimentary
geology, and geotechnical engineering will benefit directly from this
acquisition.
