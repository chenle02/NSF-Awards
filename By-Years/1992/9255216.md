Founded in 1979, the Science Skills Center (SSC) is a non-profit community based
program which encourages young minority and female students to pursue careers in
science, mathematics, and technology. At its current two sites in Brooklyn,
N.Y., approximately 400 students, ages six to eighteen, are enrolled in programs
where they take accelerated courses in biology, chemistry, physical science,
rocketry, oceanography, botany, and mathematics. This summer science camp
expands two of the existing sites to include an additional total of one hundred
and fifty African-American and Hispanic middle school students. At one site, the
Summer Science Institute, a group of students spend one week in each of six
areas (i.e. chemistry, biochemistry, biology, botany, computers,electronics and
chess/mathematics). Students also take weekly field trips to museums or
engineering firms. At another site, the Science Skills Center and IBM have
developed an engineering BASE (Building Access to Science Enrichment) program, a
program whose goal is to expose talented minority youth to careers in
engineering. Students get to observe first-hand science principles at IBM's
Brooklyn facility and receive instruction from IBM engineers in several courses
including systems architecture, chemical and electrical engineering and computer
science.
