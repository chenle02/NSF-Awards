As more compute, memory, and storage resources continue to be integrated within
multicore chips and multiprocessor systems built from multicores, significant
advancements in the interconnect architecture that enable efficient connectivity
and sharing among multiple heterogeneous system resources (including caches)
across multiple hierarchy levels are needed. Escalating energy and reliability
problems with nanometer technology scaling are making over-provisioning and
static allocation of resources less viable for meeting increasing performance
demands. This exploratory research investigates new and innovative on-chip
network designs and network-driven shared resource management techniques that
have the broader impact of laying important groundwork for realizing adaptive,
fault-resilient, low-cost, energy- and performance-efficient multicore parallel
computing systems with hundreds to thousnads of nodes.
