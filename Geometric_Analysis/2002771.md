This project will study the behavior of solutions to certain systems of partial
differential equations that are thought to give information about the underlying
structures of four dimensional spaces. The equations of interest came from high
energy physics where they were introduced as very symmetric models for
elementary particle interactions. Basic question to address with regards to
solutions are these: Are there finitely many or infinitely many solutions for
the specific applications? In either case, what do the solutions look like? And
what are their implications with regards to four dimensional spaces? By way of
background: The equations are far too complicated for a computer to solve (let
alone to solve by hand). Because of this, almost all information about the
solutions must be obtained via a detailed analysis of the equations themselves.
With regards to questions about four dimensional spaces, the central issue here
is to understand the list of possible four dimensional spaces. This last
question is also relevant to physics by virtue of the fact that the observable
universe has four dimensions--three spatial dimensions and then the time
direction. Since the equations of interest come from high energy physics theory
and are close cousins to others used there and in condensed matter physics, the
analysis tools developed in this project may also find applications to questions
in these other fields. There is also an important educational support aspect of
this project that is meant to bring graduate students up to speed on the
relevant geometry, topology and analysis.

The research in this prject has three primary focus points. The first concerns
the behavior of the solutions to the Kapustin-Witten equations on the product of
a three-dimensional manifold and the half-line with singular boundary conditions
at one end given by a knot in the three-manifold. The goal for this focus point
is to see whether non-convergent sequences of solutions have pathologies that
prevent solution counting definitions of knot invariants for knots in the three
dimensional manifold. Two sources of trouble likely arise, one is a novel
pathology from the boundary conditions, and the other due to the presence of Z/2
harmonic 1-forms. The second focus point concerns the algebraic implications of
the structure of the solution space for these same Kapustin-Witten equations and
for the Kapustin-Witten equations on the product of the three-manifold with the
line: Can an algebraic invariant be defined from these spaces given the non-
compactness issues and with the novelty of formally zero dimensional solution
spaces? The third focus point concerns the significance of the afore-mentioned
Z/2 harmonic 1-forms and, more generally, Z/2 harmonic sections of a spin
bundle. Such Z/2 harmonic sections appear as renormalized limits of sequences of
solutions to the Vafa-Witten equations on four dimensional manifolds and the
multi-spinor Seiberg-Witten equations on manifolds of dimensions three and four.
Specific topics and questions not withstanding, the long term goal of this
project is to understand the structure of smooth, four dimensional manifolds.
