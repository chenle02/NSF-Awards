9310551 Eckelbarger The Darling Marine Center is the marine laboratory of the
University of Maine System. Strategically located on the Gulf of Maine, the
Center offers unparalleled research and teaching opportunities for resident and
visiting faculty and students who require ready access to a wide variety of
inshore and subtidal habitats including salt marshes, beaches, seagrass beds,
soft bottoms of all grain size types, and rocky hard bottoms. Over the last two
years, the University has made an unprecedented financial commitment to
modernize the facility and to expand teaching and research programs to benefit
both University and visiting faculty and researchers. During 1992, additional
lab and office space was created for visiting scientists, two-thirds of the
existing buildings were renovated or improved, visitor housing was increased by
65%, a new dining wall was built, a shoreside Dive & Field Staging Building was
constructed, a small wet classroom was created, a new boat was added to the
research fleet, and the research library was expanded. In 1993, the number of
summer courses and workshops offered will be doubled over 1992 and a unique
Marine Biodiversity Program will be inaugurated to begin building a biological
database. In the fall 1993, a newly created "Semester-by-the-Sea" program will
be initiated for UM undergraduates. Because the Center has experienced an abrupt
upturn in use by resident and visiting faculty, the University requests funds to
construct a small shoreside Visiting Investigator Lab/Classroom building to help
reduce crowding and to efficiently consolidate all teaching and visiting
investigator activities near the waterfront. The building would contain: 1) day
lab/office space for summer visitors that can be converted to a classroom during
the academic year, 2) a running seawater lab, 3) a small voucher specimen
museum, and 4) a chemical/radioactive tracer lab. ***
