This research is to invert near-source waveforms of the Loma Prieta earthquake
to determine the temporal and spatial behavior of fault slip. These data will be
supplemented with records from intermediate and teleseismic distances. The
methodology proposed here is a frequency domain inversion method using a new
norm minimization constraint that produces slip models characterized by having
the most nearly constant rupture velocity, and spatial slip amplitude
distribution, that are consistent with the data. Source parameters such as
hypocenter location, source time function, rupture front geometry and direction
of propagation are not predetermined, but solved for. This research is a
component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
