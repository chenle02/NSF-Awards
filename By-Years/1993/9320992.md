9320992 Tai Concurrent software systems are becoming more common and generally
require very high reliability. Software analysis and testing techniques are
critical for reducing software development cost and improving software quality.
This project will investigate efficient techniques for reachability analysis of
concurrent information not only for the verification of safety and liveness
properties, but also for the generation of tests. The proposed approach to
reachability analysis is a combination of incremental and partial-order
analysis. For a concurrent program, sequences of synchronization events will be
generated from the specification and implementation of this program and will be
used to force deterministic executions of this program. This project will
implement analysis and testing tools for concurrent software and will carry out
experimental studies. ***
