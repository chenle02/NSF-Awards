Computational simulations have become an indispensible tool in a wide variety of
science and engineering investigations. Quick and effective assessments of the
resulting data are necessary for efficient use of researcher time and
computation resources, but this process is complicated when a large
collaborating team is geographically dispersed and/or some team members do not
have direct access to the computation resource and output data. Current methods
for sharing and assessing transient data and preliminary results are cumbersome
and labor intensive; each research team must create their own scripts and ad hoc
procedures to push data from system to system and user to user. Better tools and
cyberinfrastructure are needed to support preliminary results sharing for
collaborating computational science teams. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
develops web-based building blocks and cyberinfrastructure to enable easy
sharing and streaming of transient data and preliminary results from computing
resources to a variety of platforms, from mobile devices to workstations, making
it possible to quickly and conveniently view and assess results and provide an
essential missing component in High Performance Computing and cloud computing
infrastructure.
