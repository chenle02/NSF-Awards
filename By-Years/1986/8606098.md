This research develops constitutive relations and carries out a parametric study
of internal forces generated in bulk material storage in large silos. A three-
dimensional nonlinear finite element discretization analysis will be made with
proper material characterization for loading and for unloading and material
failure criteria and with a realistic representation of interface interaction
(slip-stick) between the stored bulk material and silo wall. Verification of the
analysis algorithm will be accomplished by comparing data obtained from
analyzing pressure developed during symmetric and asymmetric flow initiation in
the model silo, and from tests performed by varying the hopper angle, hopper
configuration, discharge opening width, wall friction, bulk material
constitutive relations, and segregation effects.
