This REU site award provides support for six undergraduate researchers in
mathematics each summer for two years. The research at this site will be on
topics in analysis, probability, and finite mathematics. The program will run
for ten weeks. Participants will be expected to provide regular reports on their
work at informal meetings which will include all of the participants and
appropriate faculty members.
