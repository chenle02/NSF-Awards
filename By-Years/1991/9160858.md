Two new tunable laser materials discovered at Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory have shown intrinsic efficiency comparable to alexandrite; however,
their full potential laser performance is limited by the quality of crystals
available. The major impediment to the commercialization of the new laser
materials is the high optical scatter loss, and cracking of crystals. The
proposed program is to adapt the Heat Exchanger Method (HEMtm) for growth of the
new materials. Low temperature gradients will be utilized to minimize defects
and scattering losses due to variations in stoichiometry. The cracking problem
is attributed to a negative thermal expansion coefficient along the C axis and
stress in the crystal after growth. The shape of the solid- liquid interface
during growth will be controlled such that solidification occurs off the
interface in preference to off the crucible wall. In situ annealing will be
carried out to minimize stress and temperature gradients on the crystal during
cooldown.
