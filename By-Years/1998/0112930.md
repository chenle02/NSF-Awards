This project will develop a new generation of numerical simulation systems using
advanced parallel computers, mathematical models, and real-time data. Modern
sensor technology and the Internet have made it possible to monitor closely the
performance of structures such as highway bridges. However, there are often
limits on the possible number of embedded sensors, and accurate prediction the
overall structural performance therefore requires other technologies, such as
computer modeling, at the same time. This project will merge the two
technologies, creating a computer modeling system that incorporates the live
data in the numerical simulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using measured data as an
integrated part of a numerical simulation is a challenging research project.
Because data collected by the sensors must be moved continuously into the
numerical simulation, the traditional paradigm of reading control parameters at
the start of the computation is not possible. Instead, this project will use the
ALICE memory snooper from Argonne National Laboratory to allow the constant
interruption introduced by the transmission of the measured data. This will in
turn allow a parallel computer to exchange information with remote sites without
going through slow disk I/O. To fully integrate the sensor data with the
computation, the project will develop new numerical schemes based on classical
multigrid methods, but using the measured data to build the coarse space. The
measured data will also be used as a basis for calibrating and validating the
parameters in the mathematical model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new simulation
system will be used in a high cycle fatigue test of bridge decks, which will be
conducted in the Structures Laboratory at the University of Colorado at Boulder.
Field tests will also be scheduled on new bridges to be constructed with a
variety of installed sensors. These tests are part of ongoing projects sponsored
by other agencies. The synergy of these projects will help develop and validate
the proposed simulation system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
