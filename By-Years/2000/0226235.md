This is a project to implement and exploit a novel means of measuring plasma
density profiles in the ionosphere using low-power, ground-based radar. The
technique utilizes the Faraday rotation of radar signals coherently scattered by
plasma irregularities. Measurements are made with a bistatic radar system
located in this case at the Jicamarca Radio Observatory and at a remote site in
Paracas, Peru. The Faraday rotation technique was demonstrated recently by the
PI of this project, who was supported by a CEDAR grant for one year to
investigate its feasibility. The objective of the current project is to measure
electron density profiles in the equatorial E region in the latitude sector
where the electrojet flows. Such profiles cannot be measured with the Jicamarca
incoherent scatter radar because, paradoxically, of clutter generated by small-
scale irregularities in the electrojet. Density profiles in the equatorial E
region have been measured on a few occasions with sounding rockets but never
before by remote sensing. Consequently, there is a poorly developed picture of
the structure of the equatorial E region, particularly at night, and several
experimental, theoretical, and modeling efforts in low latitude ionospheric
physics are suffering as a result.
