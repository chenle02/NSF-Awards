The research component of this CAREER project involves global three-dimensional
(3-D) modeling of the tropospheric chemistry of ozone and mercury. Specifically,
the PI will address long-range transport of ozone and its precursors across the
North Pacific and will compare modeling results with data from various ground-
based and airborne field campaigns. This work will provide a systematic
examination of meteorological/chemical mechanisms leading to long-range
transport events, as well as case studies of trans-Pacific pollution transport
events. The second project will apply the same model, augmented by a newly
developed mercury module, to study sources, chemical transformation, and long-
range transport of mercury.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational activities will
include the development of web based course material, the design of a new
project-based graduate class in atmospheric chemistry modeling, mentoring of
graduate and undergraduate students, and participation in mentoring programs at
the PI's institution for women graduate students in science and engineering.
