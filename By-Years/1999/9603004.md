This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research involves the
research group of Shahriar Mobashery of Wayne State University and the
crystallography group of Jean- Pierre Samama at the Institut de Pharmacologie et
de Biologie Structurale, French National Center for Scientific Research,
Toulouse, France. The objective of the research is to investigate the function
and mechanism of the bacterial enzyme TEM-1 Beta- lactamase. The U.S.
investigators bring to this collaboration expertise in protein chemistry,
kinetics and enzymology. This is complemented by French expertise in crystal
structures of biomolecules. The project will advance understanding of the
mechanisms of these bacterial enzymes and their vulnerability to certain
bacteria.
