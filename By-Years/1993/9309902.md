9309902 Yuan Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will include
two areas of vital importance in understanding the basic interactions. The first
concerns the origins of masses of the fundamental particles. The second concerns
the interactions of the heaviest of these particles. Phenomenological
implications of various scenarios relevant to these two questions are clarified.
The research is important for experiments at existing facilities, and those
planned for upcoming facilities. It is crucial for testing our understanding of
the forces that exist among elementary particles. ***
