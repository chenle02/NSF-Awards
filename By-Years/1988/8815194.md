This project will support the William H. Roever Lectures in Geometry and
Algebraic Geometry to be held June 12-17, 1989 at Washington University in St.
Louis, Missouri. Professor William Fulton of the University of Chicago will be
the principal speaker and will deliver five lectures in algebraic geometry. In
addition, ten other speakers will give one-hour talks on a variety of other
topics in the field of algebraic geometry, including algebraic threefolds,
algebraic cycles and arithmetic, vector bundles in the study of linear series,
and resolution of singularities. The conference organizer hopes to attract
algebraic geometers from across the country so that researchers may be updated
on the latest developments in the field. Participant support will be available.
