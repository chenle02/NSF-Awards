This project investigates how information processing within firms influences
their internal organization and their economies of scale. Information processing
in a firm takes time; delay is costly because old information is not as valuable
as new information. It is possible, up to a point, to reduce the delay in
information processing by using more resources. This project will determine what
delay is attainable for given resources. It will be done by modelling the
managers of a firm as processing elements in a parallel processing computer. The
investigators have obtained results for non-stochastic arrivals of data, and
these indicate that the hierarchial organization of information processing is
effective. They will consider explicitly the firm's decision problems in which
the processed information is used, in order to calculate the cost of delay. The
researchers will next determine how the need to process information affects
returns to scale, given that the amount of information that must be processed in
a firm increases with the size of the firm. Then they will study information
processing when data arrives stochastically, as is most commonly the case except
for periodic accounting data. This pioneering research promises to provide new
insights concerning the role of information in the organization of firms. It
will also fill an important void in our understanding of organizations and
markets.
