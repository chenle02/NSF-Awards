This project provides scholarships to approximately 50-65 full-time,
academically talented and financially disadvantaged STEM students in Biological
Sciences, Computer Sciences, Engineering, Mathematical Sciences or Physical
Sciences at Los Medanos College. Project objectives include: (1) increasing the
number of underrepresented minority students in STEM majors who meet their
degree and transfer requirements; (2) graduating or transferring at least 75% of
STEM scholars within three years; (3) providing robust programmatic
infrastructure to ensure increasing success rates within the STEM scholars
cohort; and (4) expanding and enriching learning and career placement
opportunities by requiring STEM Scholars to participate in professional
development activities such as career exploration, job shadowing, mentorships,
internships, and research activities. The project is collaborating with the
existing MESA program to provide the necessary student support services for the
scholars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project increases the numbers of
traditionally underserved, low-income STEM students who obtain STEM degrees
and/or transfer to four-year universities as STEM majors. Results from a number
of project components could be informative for the larger academic community in
its efforts to ensure student success. Project findings are also advancing the
understanding and knowledge of innovative teaching and learning practices for
working with motivated, academically talented, low-income STEM students.
Finally, the project is contributing to local economic development by providing
a skilled STEM workforce.
