The gigabytes to terabytes of data now being produced by scientific and medical
applications on a routine basis create a pressing demand for capable
visualization tools. One of the key problems hindering the development of such
tools is the growing disparity between the available system bandwidth and the
total need of data access during interactive rendering of these large data sets.
Unfortunately, such scarcity of physical bandwidth persists in spite of repeated
efforts to accelerate I/O subsystems. Complementary to those continued efforts
in increasing I/O performance, this project focuses on intelligently decreasing
the need of data access using a unique, coarse-grained method of visibility
culling.

Visibility culling aims at eliminating unnecessary visualization computation by
focusing on parts of the data that are visible from a specific view, culling
occluded portions, which may be substantial, in the early stages of the
visualization pipeline. Although visibility culling has previously been done as
a by-product of the rendering process, it has yet to be explored as an
independent technique for attacking the bandwidth bottleneck. For that purpose,
the project we propose here will focus on the discovery and development of new
visibility culling algorithms that are generic, scalable and efficient. Our key
concept is to encode meta-opacity via precomputation. In any volume each voxel
has a predetermined value of opacity. During rendering, a sequence of voxels is
composited in depth order to form a view-dependent opacity value, called meta-
opacity, for each ray segment. We hypothesize that there exists a way to
conservatively and efficiently encode meta-opacity of a convex-shaped volume
block for a range of views under a family of transfer functions via a one-time
pre-computation. We call such encoding the Plenoptic Opacity Function (POF).
Using POF for conservative run-time opacity estimation, great accelerations by
visibility culling in volume rendering can be accomplished while the transfer
function can be modified within the same family on the fly. Here we test this
hypothesis and apply POF to volume rendering in large-scale parallelism, as well
as out-of-core visualization.
