9308912 Tai In many real-time distributed systems where both performance and
dependability are critical, the conditions affecting these two attributes in the
system itself as well as its environment may change dynamically. In order to
assure high performance dependable computing, a computer/communication system's
operational strategies and requirements have to be adjusted responsively. The
research studies adaptive performability management (performability is a
combined measure of performance and dependability) for assuring performance and
dependability goals simultaneously via run-time model-based decision making. The
method will provide a computer system with the capability to determine, based on
the underlying performability model, whether it achieves its performance and
dependability goals. If not, it will select an alternative strategy. The
objectives of this research are to investigate the utility of performability
concepts and modeling techniques when the object system is in operation, and to
investigate the effectiveness of the resulting methodology in assuring high
performance dependable computing. Accordingly, the focus will be on: 1) methods
of model construction which stress the tradeoffs among performance,
dependability and other critical attributes and facilitate adaptive
performability management, 2) methods of model solution which are sufficiently
efficient to support run-time decision making, and 3) methods for evaluating the
effectiveness of an adaptive performability management scheme. ***
