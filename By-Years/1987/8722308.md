TARTAKOFF The goal of the proposed workshop is to bring plant, animal, and yeast
cell biologists together to focus on membrane trafficking in eukaryotic systems,
to (1) stimulate exchange of information beyond traditional networks; (2)
evaluate to what extent the processes involved are similar or different between
animals and plants; and (3) identify future research directions. The dynamics of
intracellular membranes are fundamental to the life of eukaryotic cells.
Considerable progress in this area has come from work on animal and yeast cells;
conferences and symposia on the subject concentrate almost exclusively on these
systems. In contrast, technical stumbling-blocks have hampered progress in the
plant kingdom. Furthermore, there is relatively little communication between the
animal cell and yeast investigators and those who are attempting to understand
these phenomena in plants. This important and timely workshop is a welcome
attempt to stimulate new ideas and approaches to an important and underdeveloped
area of cell biology.
