Professor Irving R. Epstein and other members of the Chemistry Department at
Brandeis University are being supported to continue a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. During the summer of 1990, ten (10)
undergraduate students will spend ten (10) weeks actively engaged in a variety
of research projects. Projects range from gas phase kinetics and crystallography
of rearrangement to preparation of organometallic complexes and optical studies
of liquid crystals. Students will be housed in a single complex on campus and
will be guided through the steps of writing a formal research report.
