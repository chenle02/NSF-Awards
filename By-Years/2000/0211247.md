Atmospheric models used to predict precipitation and the effects of clouds on
solar and terrestrial radiation are sensitive to variations in the types of ice
crystals in clouds and their concentration, yet the processes by which drops
freeze in clouds are not understood well enough to make reliable estimates of
the ice content. This project is an investigation of the atmospheric relevance
of several droplet freezing mechanisms that have been suggested on the basis of
laboratory observations or theory. These include homogeneous freezing of
solution drops and heterogeneous freezing as a result of evaporation that
creates either organic surface films or solid phase inclusions within drops.
Numerical modeling of these processes will be compared with existing data from
several field programs to determine the extent to which the modeling results can
be brought into accord with observations. One of the objectives is to study the
conditions under which evaporation at the edges of clouds can promote freezing
by heterogeneous nucleation. Another is to attempt to explain recent
observations indicating that the homogeneous freezing temperature of solution
drops depends only on the water activity, a measure of the reduction in
equilibrium vapor pressure of the drop compared to pure water. Results of this
research will contribute fundamentally to understanding ice formation in the
atmosphere, and thus enable the improvement of weather and climate models in
which the details of cloud composition are important.
