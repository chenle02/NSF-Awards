General statistical knowledge and hence undergraduate statistics courses play an
important role in the growing emphasis on ensuring a basic level of quantitative
literacy in the nation's post secondary school graduates. The data-driven
economic and political landscape of the 21st century places enormous demands on
an individual's ability to manipulate, organize and compare numbers and express
quantitative ideas fluently, among other things. Knowledgeable citizens should
possess the quantitative skills necessary to make informed decisions based on
data in a variety of forms. In addition, they will be required to analyze
evidence, to question assumptions and to recognize sources of error that may
lead to a misunderstanding of the problems and issues at hand. The intellectual
merit of "Stem and Tendril: Vertically Integrated Statistics Laboratory" is that
it aims to assist in the teaching of statistics and applied mathematics at
multiple levels. The objective is to develop, implement and assess a collection
of computer-based learning modules that are vertically integrated across the
undergraduate and master's level statistics curriculum. The collection of lab
materials consists of 15-20 distinct projects are developed to provide faculty
teaching statistics at a number of levels with a set of inquiry-based, student-
centered alternatives to augment traditional lecture instruction. The goal is to
create application-oriented computer laboratories employing relevant and topical
data sets, which address basic themes of the statistics curriculum.

The broader impact of " Stem and Tendril: Vertically Integrated Statistics
Laboratory" is realized through the development these modules that can be
explored from multiple levels allowing students to revisit approaches from
different perspectives as they move through the curriculum. The modular nature
of the material will allow students with different backgrounds and training to
have different yet rewarding, learning experiences. In addition, these materials
address needs of quantitative literacy, computer fluency and written expression
as appropriate for mathematics.
