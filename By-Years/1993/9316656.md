9316656 Bursik The primary hypothesis to be tested is that the manner in which
elutriated ash clouds (of which 'coignimbrite' ash clouds are a subset) are
generated is strongly dependent upon the interaction of pyroclastic flows and
surges with the topography surrounding a volcano. Our objectives are therefore
to understand ash cloud generating mechanisms and flow and surge mechanisms
especially as they are affected by topography. The proposed research will
consist of detailed sedimentological measurements, laboratory experiments and
theoretical modeling. Field work will consist of a novel sampling strategy
applied to the 1982 deposits of El Chichon volcano, Mexico, at closely spaced
sites lying along traverse that traverse that parrallel flow directions. The
sampling strategy will yield quantitative data that can be used to test
theoretical models of flow behavior. Laboratory experiments will be conducted in
conjunction with the analysis of the field data and the development of
theoretical models to provide constraints on interpretations of field data and
validation theory. The proposed activity will yield increased understanding of
the mechanisms through which ash clouds are elutriated from pyroclastic flows
and surges.
