This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project will
attempt to take agent-based simulation models being written for cell biology
research and write a new cell biology modeling framework to be used for teaching
cell biology at the undergraduate and high school level. Research models in cell
biology are too complex and computationally intensive for use in education below
the graduate level. However, the visualization and ability to perform realistic
experiments inherent in the agent-based modeling approach is ideal for
educational uses. This project will combine the scientific expertise of one of
the leading centers for cellular models with the educational expertise of one of
the leading companies producing biology education software to create a series of
simulation-based online teaching modules for undergraduate cell biology
classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cell and molecular biology are core topics in
biology classes at both high school and college levels and are some of the most
active fields of biological research, as well as being important for medical
fields. Although the topics covered in cell biology are fascinating, they are
currently often taught in very passive ways. Active learning approaches are now
widely acknowledged to improve students understanding and retention of many
scientific concepts. This project will produce a set of active teaching
materials for cell biology students, improving their understanding of cellular
processes, and thus improving their ability to become our countries future
researchers and medical personnel. The materials should be very attractive to an
$18 million/year market in cell biology teaching materials.
