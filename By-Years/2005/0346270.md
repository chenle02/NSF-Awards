Proposal: DMS-0071852&lt;br/&gt;PI: David
Gabai&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;During the last 100 years there
has been tremendous interest in&lt;br/&gt;understanding the topology and
geometry of 3-dimensional manifolds. In&lt;br/&gt;part, because a 3-manifold is
(roughly speaking) a mathematical object&lt;br/&gt;modeled on our familiar
3-dimensional environment. A 3-manifold has the&lt;br/&gt;property that
sufficiently small subsets can be parametrized by
3&lt;br/&gt;coordinates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problem of characterizing the
geometry and topology of surfaces, i.e.,&lt;br/&gt;manifolds of dimension 2, was
completely answered nearly a century ago. It&lt;br/&gt;was determined that the
only closed orientable connected surfaces are the&lt;br/&gt;sphere, torus, and
the multi-holed tori. Furthermore, such surfaces can&lt;br/&gt;be given
geometries of constant curvature, +1 for the sphere, 0 for the&lt;br/&gt;torus,
and -1 for the other surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although great progress has
been made during the last century, the&lt;br/&gt;situation for dimension-3 is
not nearly so well understood. Nevertheless a&lt;br/&gt;conjectural picture for
the structure of 3-manifolds emerged almost 25&lt;br/&gt;years ago (by Thurston)
and there has been much theoretical and&lt;br/&gt;experimental evidence
supporting his conjecture. The hyperbolic&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds, i.e. the
manifolds of constant -1 curvature, play a central&lt;br/&gt;role in this
picture. In this proposal the PI in collaboration with&lt;br/&gt;various other
mathematicians, plan to investigate the structure of&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic
manifolds and the structure of manifolds which are
conjecturally&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic. In particular they will study the structure
of the&lt;br/&gt;diffeomorphism group of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and the
structure of&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic 3-manifolds of low volume. They will also
address whether or not&lt;br/&gt;a closed aspherical, atoroidal, 3-manifold has
a Gromov negatively curved&lt;br/&gt;fundamental group. A positive resolution
would imply that a 3-manifold&lt;br/&gt;which is conjecturally hyperbolic, has
at least the coarse algebraic&lt;br/&gt;structure of a hyperbolic
3-manifold.&lt;br/&gt;
