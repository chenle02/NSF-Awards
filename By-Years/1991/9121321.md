This dissertation improvement grant project will test hypotheses regarding the
effects of the Little Ice Age cold period on Icelandic settlements using
archaeological data, animal and fish bones, as well as marine molluscs. A
baseline study will be made of stable carbon and oxygen isotopes and
cadmium/calcium ratios in shells reflective of changes in local water
temperatures and salinity in the North Atlantic. These studies are expected to
provide climatic data of direct relevance to questions of economic change on
Iceland and contribute to current research on global climate change.
