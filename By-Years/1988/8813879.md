This grant is for renewal of research by Professor John C. H. Spence, Arizona
State University, on electron microscopy for study of surfaces of ceramics and
electronic materials. During the previous grant (DMR-8512784) more than twelve
substantive publications in refereed scientific journals were produced.
Highlights of the significant accomplishments include design, construction and
testing of a scanning tunnelling microscope which operates inside a transmission
electron microscope (allowing simultaneous operation of the two techniques on
the same specimen); the technique known as convergent beam electron
microdiffraction was made quantitative to allow determination of the electron
ground state charge density of gallium arsenide (this allows determination of
the nature of the chemical bonds in this technologically important material);
advances in theory of electron channeling effect on Auger electron production in
the reflection high energy electron diffraction technique provided analytical
means to determine the atomic site of adatoms on clean surfaces; a novel method
for forming atomic lattice images in semiconductors has been developed which
allows lattice imaging of dislocation defects normal to the electron beam with a
resolution of 0.3 nanometer (ten times more sensitive than previously possible).
The current research will continue to seek novel techniques for the use of
electron beams to study the structure of ceramics and electronic materials on a
atomic scale with emphasis on the understanding the scanning tunneling
microscope, the atom location by channeling-enhanced microanalysis for study of
adatoms on semiconductor surfaces; electron energy spectra from surface states;
and quantitative electron crystallography for the study of chemical bonding in
crystals. Professor Spence has been referred to by his peers as the most
innovative scientist using electron microscopy in the U.S. He has consistently
trained students of high quality for research in the important field of electron
microscopy for materials science.
