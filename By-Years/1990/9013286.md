A continuation and expansion of previous studies of cold collision dynamics
will be performed. The present project will concentrate efforts in two major
areas: 1. Associative ionization between excited sodium atoms within a Doppler
selected velocity class one order of magnitude narrower than previous studies.
This should enable the investigators to reach a temperature less than 3
milliKelvin without recourse to optical cooling and trapping. The effects of
alignment, orientation and light will be studies in the regime where the time of
collision is long compared to the radiative lifetime. 2. Laser diodes and diode
arrays will be used to cool and collimate atomic beams of rubidium and cesium in
order to study fine structure changing collisions. The goal is to measure the
excitation function for this process from thermal to the ultracold regime.
