9301844 White Laboratory experiments will be undertaken to investigate the
formation of ice under controlled thermodynamic conditions characteristic of
atmospheric clouds. Attention will be focussed on the evaporation of supercooled
cloud that takes place in eroding turrets or at cloud edges. Experiments are
proposed to evaluate the ice nucleating capability of the evaporated residues of
cloud drops and deduce their role in the production of large numbers of ice
crystals at moderate (-5 to -15C) supercoolings. The simulation chamber will be
used to subject both laboratory-produced ammonium sulfate aerosol and natural
aerosol to a systematic succession of expansion-compression cycles that will
isolate the heterogeneous deposition portion of ice nucleation on the residues
of evaporated cloud drops. ***
