9317648 Chrispeels The Department of Biology of the University of California,
San Diego, has made a commitment to establish a research focus in plant
molecular biology. New positions have been allocated, space has been made
available in a modern building, generous start up funds have been given, and a
plant biology field station has been built. Several collaborations between the
new faculty members have already emerged, and the group will focus its research
activities along two major lines: (1) membrane proteins and signal transduction,
and (2) regulation of gene activity. The group consists of one senior faculty
(Maarten J. Chrispeels), and four recently appointed faculty (Robert J. Schmidt,
Nigel Crawford, Martin Yanofsky and Julian Schroeder). Although excellent
functional laboratories are available for the faculty, several major pieces of
equipment are required because our research groups have expanded very fast and
because several pieces of shared equipment are now too old or too heavily used
to satisfy our needs. The shared equipment we wish to purchase will promote the
interactions between the laboratories and facilitate the training of graduate
students and postdocs, besides having a vital role in research projects
discussed in this proposal. The items of equipment include a patch clamp
workstation, a luminometer and an ultracentrifuge. u ~ @ 9317648 Chrispeels The
