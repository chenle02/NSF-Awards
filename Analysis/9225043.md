This project continues mathematical research on a wide range of problems in
complex analysis and integral geometry. It divides into three main areas, the
first being concerned with residues, the division problem and applications. By
this one understands the problem of finding solutions to the Bezout problem of
finding multipliers which produce a constant sum of entire functions without
common roots. This is an algebra problem in the sense that one wants to generate
a certain ideal from a collection of functions. It may turn out that the ideal
is the entire space. This type of deconvolution is only of interest when one can
control the degree of the multipliers. Answers to such questions leads to
effective methods in arithmetic intersection theory. The second line of
investigation concerns integral geometry on the Heisenberg group. If the
integral of a function taken over translates of the same curve by an underlying
group always results in a constant value, can one make any assertion about the
function? In one complex dimension the answer is taught in undergraduate
classes. In higher dimensions the problem of deciding which are the admissible
curves remains to be determined. Finally, related work will be done on the
inverse conductivity problem which in applications refers to the problem of
determining interior characteristics of a body from boundary measurements of
conductivity. The research in this project represent a combination of deep
theoretical ideas with close ties with applications to problems in electric
impedance tomography, analysis of defects in materials, robotics and control
theory.
