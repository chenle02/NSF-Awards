West Antarctic Volcano Exploration (WAVE) is an international cooperative
program in which the U.S., U.K., and N.Z. scientists will study Marie Byrd Land
volcanoes. Geochemical, tectonic, and glacio-volcanic problems will be
investigated using detailed field work, geochemical and isotopic analyses and
dating, scanning electron microscope, studies, and paleo- and rock- magnetic
analysis. These detailed field studies will re-evaluate models of glacio-
volcanic history. Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica, one of the world's largest alkali
volcanic provinces, contains a unique record of the Late Cenozoic glacio-
volcanic history of Antarctica. However, much of this record is known only from
reconnaissance studies.
