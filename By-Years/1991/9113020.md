This grant addresses the very serious, national problem of mentoring for women
and minorities in the computer sciences. Although it is recognized that
different problems are faced by women and minorities, the PI has deliberately
designed a project which attacks the shared issues. The PI is chair of the
committee on the Status of Women and Minorities (CSWM) of the ACM and she will
direct a project team in the design of guidelines and training materials for the
mentoring of junior professionals by senior professionals in the computer
sciences. In addition to developing specific mentoring materials the PI will
conduct a mentoring workshop, initiate pilot projects, perform follow-up
analysis, and disseminate results.
