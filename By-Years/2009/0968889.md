The mass of an atom is one of its most basic properties. Precise measurements of
atomic masses have applications to many fields of physical science including
nuclear physics, high-energy (particle) physics, astrophysics, physical
chemistry, and the determination of the fundamental constants of nature.
Currently the world?s most precise measurements of atomic mass are made with the
Florida State University cryogenic "Penning Trap Mass Spectrometer". Making use
of unique system features, e.g. the trapping and manipulation of one or two
individual ions by a combination of electric and magnetic fields in an ultra-
high vacuum, and the detection of their tiny motions using superconducting
electronics, atomic mass measurements will be made with a fractional precision
approaching 10 parts-per-trillion. These measurements, when combined with the
results of other research, will impact fundamental scientific questions such as:
what is the mass of the neutrino, the lightest known fundamental particle, and
does Quantum Electrodynamics, currently the most accurately tested theory in
physics, accurately predict the magnetic moment of the
electron?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Precision Penning trap techniques also have
applications to analytical mass spectrometry, which is crucial to chemical
analysis and trace chemical detection for National Security. The award also
provides a unique research experience for post-doctoral researchers, graduate
and undergraduate students in precision mass spectrometry, encompassing a broad
range of precision measurement and experimental techniques. This prepares them
for scientific and technological careers in industry, the national laboratories
and academe, consequently benefiting the nation's economy and the solution of
pressing national problems.
