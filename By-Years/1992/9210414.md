This career Advancement Award will enable Dr. Marjatta Lyyra to establish and
develop her career in cluster research. She will construct a time of flight mass
spectrometry facility capable of gas phase cluster work. She will use the
equipment to study bound-bound spectroscopy, the dynamics of photodissociation,
and collisional energy transfer. Hydrogen cluster ion systems will be studied in
the initial work. Subsequently fullerenenes which are hosts for metal ions will
be investigated. %%% This award will enable a productive scientist to build
scientific equipment which can measure properties that will lead to a better
understanding of chemical reactions. The systems she will study are important to
the development of new kinds of materials which could have electrical and
catalytic properties of industrial importance.
