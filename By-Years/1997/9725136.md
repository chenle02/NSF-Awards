Abstract P.I. Marcia Gowing OPP97-25136 Viruses in Pack Ice Communities of the
Ross Sea, Antarctica Primary productivity of sea ice algal communities in the
Southern Ocean is significant. In lower latitudes, processes such as grazing and
lysis by viruses are thought to control algal populations, but there are few
data on grazing within ice communities and no data on viruses of ice algae. Ice
communities should be excellent sites for studying viral control of populations
of eukaryotic algae and protozoans because populations can reach high densitites
and many habitats are nearly closed for parts of the year. This study will use
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of individual eukaryotic algal and
protozoan cells and light microscopy and TEM of water samples to assess viral
infections and viral populations in a variety of pack ice communities from the
Ross Sea. The objectives are (1) to determine the extent of the occurrence of
viruses within cells of algae and protozoans in ice communities and to estimate
the percentage of infected cells, (2) to relate the extent of the occurrence of
viruses within cells to the stages of succession of sea ice communities (3) to
assess the potential for ice communities to seed viruses to the pelagial, (4) to
determine the extent of ingestion of virus- like particles by sea ice
protozooplankton, (5) to compare these features of ice communities to those of
phytoplankton and protozooplankton assemblages in the seawater directly under
the ice and (6) to describe and quantify the size structure of the free virus-
like particles in the intersitital water of ice communities and in the seawater
directly under the ice. Thus study will contribute to the understanding of sea
ice community ecology and will allow incorporation of viruses of eukaryotic
algae and protozoans into models of carbon flow for the Antarctic.
