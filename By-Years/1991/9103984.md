This project will develop a variety models of diffusion in heterogeneous media
as nonlinear systems of partial differential equations. These diffusion
processes include heat conduction with phase change, diffusion through porous or
fissured media, absorption from a flowing medium by granulated substance, and
the macroscopic description of semiconductors modelled as distributed layered
systems. These studies are motivated by the need to recognize the correct
mathematical formulation of phenomena arising in areas ranging from oil
reservoir simulation to semiconductors. The underlying theme is the
understanding of the nature of the corresponding microstructure.
