A new method for peptide sequencing will be developed involving negative ion
mass spectrometry. Negative chemical ionization mass spectrometry (NCI-MS) can
provide the dramatic enhancement in sensitivity necessary to keep pace with the
mechanical and engineering improvements in automated protein sequencing. For
molecules which are strongly electron-capturing, NCI-MS has been reported to
have detection limits in the femtomole to attomole (10-18) range. Because of the
selectivity of the ionization process, background noise is diminished, further
enhancing signal to noise ratio. The proposed research will involve exploring a
variety of electron-capturing phenylisothiocyanate (PITC) derivatives by NCI-MS
and demonstrate a highly sensitive detection method for use in protein and
peptide sequencing. protein sequencing is important for an understanding of the
roles of modified amino acids in protein structure and to provide probes for
cloning genes as well as to deliminate the boundaries of DNA segments coding for
proteins. This instrument development proposal seeks also to be able to work
with far smaller amounts of material than current efforts in microchemistry.
