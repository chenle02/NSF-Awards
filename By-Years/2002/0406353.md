Dr. Paul R. Sharp, Department of Chemistry, University of Missouri at Columbia,
is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
of the Division of Chemistry, National Science Foundation, for his work on the
organometallic chemistry at the edge of polycyclic aromatic carbon compounds.
Work will focus on the synthesis of group 10 (Ni, Pd, Pt) complexes and their
use in the derivatization and synthesis of polycyclic aromatic compounds. The
stability and reaction chemistry of 4-membered and 5-membered metallacycles will
be studied. The Ni mediated synthesis of tetraphenylenes (including chiral
tetraphenylenes) through 5-membered nickelacycles will be investigated and will
be developed into a general catalytic method. Development of coronene and
corannulene metallacycle chemistry will continue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
prevalence of polycyclic aromatic carbon compounds across many areas of
chemistry and technology supports a need for selective and general methods for
derivatization and synthesis that the work of this project will bring. Fields
where polycyclic aromatic carbon compounds are important or may play an
important future roll include but are not limited to electronics (nanotubes,
molecular wires, organic semiconductors), solar energy conversion (solar cells),
medical research (fluorescent probes, carcinogenisis), and structural materials
(composites). Thus, the chemistry described in this proposal has the potential
for a large impact on our society. In addition, the undergraduate students,
graduate students, and postdoctoral associates will benefit from training in
both organic and organometallic/inorganic chemistry. Historically, approximately
half of the graduates from the PI's laboratory have been women.&lt;br/&gt;
