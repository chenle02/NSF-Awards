Although China and South Korea share Confucian values, China has a socialist
economy while South Korea has a market economy. These different types of
economic and political systems translate into different policies regarding
gender equality, women's employment, childcare, and housework in families. Do
these different systems and policies produce differences in gender roles and
family relations in the two countries? This project addresses that question by
examining father's participation in childcare, the division of housework, and
gender attitudes in China and South Korea. To do so, it uses quantitative data
from large samples, and qualitative data from small focus groups in each nation.
The results not only provide a more detailed description of national differences
in gender and family roles in Asia, but also offer insights into the public
policy and economic sources of these differences.
