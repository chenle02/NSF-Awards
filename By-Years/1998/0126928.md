Mathematical Sciences (21). This project is adapting and implementing materials
and approaches from the ATLAST (Augmenting the Teaching and Learning of Linear
Algebra through Software Tools) project (DUE-9154149 and DUE-9455074) into two
first-year courses for prospective mathematics majors, including preservice K-12
mathematics teachers. The primary focus is on the incorporation of these
materials into an introductory course in linear algebra, with a secondary focus
on the use of specific computer-based modules and materials from ATLAST into a
course, "Principles of Mathematics," which serves to introduce proofs to future
mathematics majors.&lt;br/&gt;
