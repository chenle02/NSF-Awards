With this award, the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Division of
Chemistry is funding Professor Hongshan He of Eastern Illinois University to
develop new chemical compounds for bio-imaging and sensing. These compounds can
be used to label tissues or other target structures, and after being activated
by a light source, emit light, enablingimaging. Professor He's approach is to
develop compounds that (i) do not need to be activated by ultraviolet light as
such high energy radiation can damage biological tissues, and (ii) emit light at
characteristic wavelengths that are not present in background emissions
associated with biological systems. The project aims to provide opportunities
for undergraduates to participate in research and gain hands-on research
experience. The participation of high school students and science teachers in
summer workshops is designed to stimulate student interest in pursuing studies
in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fluorescent materials are used for a
variety of biomedical diagnostic applications, such as immunoassays. The
significant overlap of biological substrate autofluorescence and fluorescence
from commercially available probes dramatically compromises detection
sensitivity. This project is aimed to address fundamental questions and such
technical issues by developing rationally designed near-infrared emitting
lanthanide materials through synthesis, computation, and photophysical studies.
The project is focusing on BODIPY-based chromophores and aims to address a long-
standing corollary concern of poor near-infrared emission of lanthanide
materials in aqueous solutions. To meet the challenge, the lanthanide complexes
are to be transformed to metallopolymers through carbon-carbon coupling
reactions to suppress quenching and enable efficient near-infrared emission to
be retained. The metallopolymers being targeted are designed to emit in the
near-infrared region of the spectrum (900-1600 nm) under longer excitation
wavelengths,thereby reducing autofluorescence and photobleaching.
