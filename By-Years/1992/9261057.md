Nesting is the process of placing objects together with minimal void space
between them. Nesting is required in the design and manufacturing of almost
every product. This research will develop a three dimensional (3D) algorithm for
the packaging of irregular 3D objects inside target volumes. This computer
program will automatically pack the maximum number of components possible with
minimum wasted volume voids. An intelligent software driven system for use in
the design and manufacturing of any product will be developed that will enable
designers to automatically visualize nested layouts as they design; reducing
lead time for new product introductions, enhancing communications between
design/engineering and manufacturing. In the computer industry, nesting of the
various components is done manually in order to achieve minimum size of the
computer box. With this computer program, a designer will be able to quickly
assemble and define a computer geometry from prescribed components and their
location constraints.
