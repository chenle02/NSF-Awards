9522145 Kareem The Wind Engineering Research Council (WERC) is dedicated to
address wind hazard related issues with the purpose of: improving the
understanding of the extreme wind phenomena in their interactions with buildings
and structures, and of the consequences of these events; identifying and
prioritizing research areas where improved knowledge is needed; assessing the
state-of-knowledge and the results of wind engineering research; and integrating
and enhancing the interactions among research, education and practice. Some of
the activities that WERC will undertake are workshops, conferences, assessments,
publishing a newsletter and preparing special reports. The council will help the
wind engineering community by providing substantive input into the funding
activities of NSF in order to achieve rapid advances in developing a strong
knowledge base and effective mitigation measures. ***
