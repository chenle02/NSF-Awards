Proposed research in the Devonian of the western U.S. involves five areas of
endeavor. 1. Brachiopod systematics: one new brachiopod genus will be described
and illustrated. In addition, the section on Silurian and Devonian spirifers
will be prepared for the revised Brachiopod Treatise. Precise range data will be
collated for Devonian brachiopod general. 2. The Middle and Upper Devonian
faunal sequence will be studied and refined by synthesis of five measured
sections and 229 fossil samples. Zonal refinement is anticipated near the top of
the Middle Devonian. 3. The depositional history of an interval of the Late
Devonian spanning the Frasnian-Famennian boundary will be studied in central
Nevada. Quartz sands were deposited in the outer shelf basin at that time as a
result of platform emergence. 4. It is intended to analyze geology in two
critical areas along the frontal margin of the Roberts Mountains thrust from
data gathered during the last 14 years. 5. A review paper is planned for
preparation on the Paleozoic of the western U.S.
