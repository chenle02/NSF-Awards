9529453 Marks Past research by the principal investigator has shown that small
particles of silver grown on silicon (001) surfaces are not single crystals, but
instead a variety of different morphologies including multiple-twinned
particles. This project examines in more detail the structure of small particles
grown on silicon and germanium surfaces under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. The
structure, both internal and surface of these particles, is studied in the size
range of 1-20nm. The primary experimental technique is high resolution electron
microscopy under ultrahigh vacuum conditions coupled with more conventional
surface science probes. A question to be explored is the type of particles in a
statistical sense that occur in mixed morphology growth systems. %%% Small
particles play an important role in many technologically important processes,
for instance heterogeneous catalysis, the initial growth of many thin film
systems, and recently in the area of nanophase materials and quantum dots. This
program examines aspects of structure and related impurity effects. ***
