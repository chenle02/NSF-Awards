Over the past seven years, Rensselaer has developed a course sequence, Chemistry
of Materials, that combines material from traditional General Chemistry and
beginning Materials Science and Engineering courses that is taught to all
engineering freshmen. Currently, the format of this course is being changed from
the traditional lecture-recitation format to an interactive studio format, which
emphasizes the active involvement of the student in the learning process. The
connection between the laboratory and classroom material is made directly, and
the practical relevance of the classroom material is made immediately obvious. A
barrier to this integration has been the lack of experiments that can be
performed within the two-hour interactive sessions that occupy the bulk of class
time in this approach. In this project a series of laboratories will be designed
to occupy 30-50 minutes of class time, and will emphasize discovery of basic
principles, rather than verification of a previously enunciated principle.
Successful completion of this project will result in the integration of
laboratory and classroom material and will maximize the active involvement of
the students in the learning process.
