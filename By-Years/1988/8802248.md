The PI will use reflectivity and magneto-reflectivity spectroscopies for the
study of GaAs/AlAs quantum wells, grown at the U.S. Army Electronic Devices and
Technology Laboratory (EDTL), in collaboration with Dr. Mitra Dutta. A graduate
student will participate in the sample growth process, at EDTL, as well as in
some of the characterization experiments there. The objective of the proposed
work is to determine a number of parameters of GaAs/AlAs quantum wells.
Specifically we intend to measure: (a) the effect of confinement and strain on
the band structure, (b) the electron effective mass inside the wells, and (c)
exciton binding energies. These parameters are crucial for the design and
modeling of electronic devices that incorporate these heterostructures. Since no
magneto- optical set-up is available at EDTL, we hope that this joint project
will help the crystal growth and characterization effort there.
