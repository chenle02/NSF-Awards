Geysers are springs that intermittently erupt mixtures of steam and liquid
water. They are popular tourist attractions, with a few million people watching
geysers erupt in Yellowstone National Park each year. Geysers are the surface
expression of geothermal systems and provide insight into heat and fluid flow in
volcanically active areas. Geysers also provide a natural laboratory to study
eruption processes and the geophysical and hydrological signals that can be
measured before, during, and after an eruption. Because they are smaller than
volcanic eruptions, and erupt more frequently, they provide an opportunity to
collect abundant data and develop approaches for integrating and interpreting
measurements. Geysers and their deposits have been studied to understand life in
extreme environments. Geyser-like behavior of water and hydrocarbons has also
been observed on the ocean floor and at mud volcanoes. Thus improved
understanding of geyser behavior may yield understanding into other self-
organized, intermittent processes in nature that result from localized input of
energy and mass. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite two centuries of scientific
study, explanations for geysering phenomena are limited or lacking. This project
will integrate field measurements, laboratory studies, and numerical simulations
of multiphase flow in geyser systems to address the following basic questions
about the geysering process: Why are geysers so rare? How does conduit plumbing
affect eruption initiation and the interval between eruptions? Why and how do
geysers interact with each other? Which external processes (e.g., tides,
variations in barometric pressure, temperature variations, wind speed,
earthquakes) and internal dynamics (e.g., duration of preceding eruption,
plumbing geometry) influence the interval between and duration of eruptions?
Answers to these questions may offer new insight into triggered seismicity,
hydrothermal explosions, and volcanic eruptions.
