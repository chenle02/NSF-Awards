The goal of this project is to provide electrical engineering undergraduate
students with a unique, low cost and modern approach to laboratory
instrumentation, circuit and system design. A prototype computer workstation has
been created that allows the students to quickly access hardware and software
programs so they can do both analysis and design of circuits and systems. The
equipment to be purchased will extend the capabilities of the workstations and
provide an adequate number to service the entire electrical engineering
curriculum. A/D and D/A converters and software added to the personal computers
will allow real time digital control, data acquisition and signal processing.
Digital scope interfaces will make the computer a storage scope and will allow
signal analysis via computer programs. A logic interface turns the personal
computer into a powerful, menu driven logic analyzer. With powerful software
design tools and interface hardware the students can design, simulate, and test
circuits and systems from the computer workstation.
