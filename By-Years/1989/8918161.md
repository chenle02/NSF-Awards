The proposed research project is designed to recover the historical
relationships of pipid frogs of the genera Silurana and Xenopus and their fossil
relatives. Whereas living frogs of these genera are only know from sub-Saharan
Africa, fossils (dating from the Upper Cretaceous) occur in Africa and South
America, thereby suggesting that the ancestors of the Recent and fossil species
may have been widespread on these continents before they split. Silurana and
Xenopus long have been the subject of biological and biomedical research (e.g.,
developmental and genetic studies, immunobiology, gene-mapping, etc.), yet we do
not know how many species there are or their relationships to one another, nor
is there any authority to identify individual species. The goal of this study is
to integrate the information that exists for these taxa (e.g., biochemical,
cytological, behavioral) with anatomical (e.g., ostelogical , myological,
morphometric) data that will be gathered from adults and developing young in
order to (1) identify individual species, (2) determine their
interrelationships, (3) describe evolutionary pattern of chromosome, nucleic
acids, and morphological features, (4) assess levels of differentiation between
sister-species, and (5) combine the various data sets of fossil and Recent
organisms to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the group.
