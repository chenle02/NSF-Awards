This award provides partial support for three summer workshops on field methods
research. The workshop will provide training and instruction for 15 advanced
sociology graduate students or junior faculty each year. The workshop will focus
on direct field work experience and individualized session with a faculty
mentor. The participants will meet three times a week for 4 1/2 weeks in two-
hour seminar sessions. The seminars will be devoted to discussions of
epistemological, technical, and ethical issues in field work, to the teaching of
methods of analyzing qualitative data, and to ongoing discussions of the
participants experiences in their field research. There is a great deal of
interest in research using field work methods in the sociological research
community, but most graduate programs provide very little formal training in
these methods of data collection and in the analyses of qualitative data. This
workshop will provide much needed systematic training and teaching for up to 45
advanced sociology students. The workshop should greatly improve the quality of
sociological research based on field work methods.
