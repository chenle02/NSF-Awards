The research project will contribute to the basic theory of auctions of multiple
identical objects (``multi-unit auctions"). The focus of the project is on
establishing ``monotonicity" of equilibria in such auctions, i.e. that bids are
non-decreasing functions of the bidder's private information. Efforts to
establish monotonicity using standard approaches have stalled for the most part
in general environments of interest, but this research brings to bear promising
new tools from lattice theory. Existing research has applied such tools to prove
existence of monotone equilibrium in a limited model of one-sided multi-unit
auctions. This project aims to develop that approach further to apply to large
auctions with many buyers and sellers in more general environments. Since
monotonicity is a crucial ingredient for efficiency, such research may lead to
new results proving asymptotic efficiency of equilibria in uniform-price
auctions.

Multi-unit auctions provide a compelling ``micro-foundation" for markets with
many buyers and sellers. Multi-unit auction theory also models important real-
world auctions such as U.S. Treasury bond issue and regional electricity
procurement auctions. Unfortunately, the basic theory of such auctions is quite
incomplete. Worse yet, the existing single-object auction theory provides an
unreliable guide for understanding multi-unit auctions. This research will
clarify fundamental properties of bidding behavior in multi-unit auctions and
leverage its basic theory contributions to re-address the fundamental and age-
old question: ``When can we expect markets to efficiently allocate resources?"
