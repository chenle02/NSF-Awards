The Department of Chemistry will acquire three gas chromatographs and a gas
chromatograph-mass spectrometer. These instruments will be utilized in a series
of undergraduate laboratories in order to demonstrate state-of-the-art
analytical equipment for the separation and analysis of complex chemical
mixtures. The students will obtain hands-on experience in the use of this
equipment in the following laboratory courses: Freshman Chemistry Laboratory for
majors, Sophomore Organic Chemistry Laboratories for both majors and nonmajors,
Instrumental Analysis, and Advanced Synthesis Laboratory. Students taking
Undergraduate Research in the fields of organic and analytical chemistry will
make extensive use of the instrumentation.
