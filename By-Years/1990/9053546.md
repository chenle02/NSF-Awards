During each of three years this project will provide opportunities for 20
middle/junior high school science teachers. The six-week summer institutes will
be held at the University of Missouri - Rolla, beginning in 1991. Each institute
will consist of two separate courses; one will cover the concepts of earth and
environmental science, the second, atmospheric science and meteorology. The
participants may receive three graduate credits for each of these courses. The
institutes will combine lectures and discussions with extensive hands-on
laboratory and field exercises. Particular attention will be given to developing
lesson plans, teaching materials and exercises that will be applicable for
classroom use at the teachers home institutions. The modeling of the "public
hearing" format in applying earth science subject matter to real world problems
should prove to be exciting when transferred to teacher's classrooms. Two
follow-up meetings during the academic year will focus on sharing of teacher
generated activities and problems associated with their use. The project will
serve teachers from Missouri and neighboring states. Cost sharing from
participating school districts and the University of Missouri - Rolla in an
amount of $72,138 equals 25% of the NSF award.
