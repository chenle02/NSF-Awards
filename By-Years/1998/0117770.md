This award establishes a Nanoscience and Engineering Center (NSEC) for Nanoscale
Systems in Information Technologies (CNS) at Cornell University. The Center will
aim to make major advances in the ultra-high performance processing, sensing,
storage, and transmission of information. The Center will undertake three major
nanoscale science and Engineering initiatives to develop and expolit the
electronic, photonic, and magnetic properties of devices and materials at
nanoscale. The largest thrust will be in nanoelectronics where new, practical
architecture will be developed within which the physics of charge confinement
and electrostatic energy in nanostructures will provide unique benefits for
dense information-processing systems and employ embedded memory elements as
logic. The Center will collaborate with industry for expertise, unique
materials, specialized instrumentation, and critical pathways to speed results
to application. The collaboration will provide industrial experience to the
Center's graduate students. The education, human resources development, and
outreach activities include: (1) mentoring program to attract and retain a more
diverse population of young researchers; (2) interdisciplinary curriculum,
including a major laboratory component for graduate and undergraduate levels;
and (3) outreach to secondary education to enhance the teaching and student
appreciation of nanoscale science and engineering topics.
