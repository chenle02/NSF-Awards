The Forum on Engineering Education (1987) is being convened by a Consortium of
MIT, Stanford and the University of California at Berkeley with the support of
the National Science Foundation. It is the first step toward the organization of
a consortium of research universitites and primarily undergraduate institutions
to address the crucial problems of engineering education in the United States.
The Forum will proceed from the premise that better collaboration of these types
of institutions can help mitigate the problems such as faculty shortages and the
technical obsolescence of faculty and practicing engineers which presently face
engineering education in the United States. A three day workshop is planned with
participation by two persons from each of several institutions in addition to
those representing the members of the consortium.
