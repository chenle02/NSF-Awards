Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The Keystone Symposia Meeting on "Nuclear Events
in Plant Gene Expression and Signaling will be held March 6-10, 2012 at the
Sagebrush Inn and Conference Center in Taos, New Mexico. This conference aims to
stimulate the synthesis of an integrative view of nuclear dynamics in plant
biology. Keystone Symposia meetings have an excellent reputation for initiating
and fostering collaborations, and for participation by trainees and other junior
investigators. The specific objectives of the conference include: 1) Break the
confines of (often artificially defined) fields of study to broaden the vision
and resources of scientists and 2) Educate new and future scientists.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The organizers of Keystone
Symposia meetings strive to promote and ensure diversity (including women and
underrepresented groups) in the speaker lineup and in meeting participation.
There will be early career scientists, students and postdoctoral trainees
attending the meeting. Overall, the conference will provide a unique opportunity
for scientific and professional development of trainees and newer investigators.
