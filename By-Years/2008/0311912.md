Gaidos Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This project is a one-year proof-of-concept project
that is demonstrating the use of laboratory microcosm experiments to investigate
the impact of elevated atmospheric CO2 levels and higher carbonate solubility on
the microbial community and biogeochemistry of carbonate reefs. The research
program is being carried out at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology in
Kaneohe Bay. HIMB is the site of a long-term monitoring project that studies the
dynamical interaction between estuarine and reef ecosystems in the bay. For this
demonstration phase, the PIs are reconstructing the interior reef sediment and
its heterotrophic microbial community; the system is being "fed" natural
particulate organic matter from seawater. The objectives are to replicate the
geochemical gradients observed in the natural reef system and generate
preliminary data on the effect of elevated CO2 on reef hydraulics, carbonate
mineralogy, porewater chemistry, and microbiology. Measurements include the
hydraulic conductivity and changes in the bulk carbonate mineral fraction of the
sediments. The structure and mineralogy of the carbonate framework is being
studied using electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and cathodoluminescence.
Porewater analyses is measuring carbonate chemistry (pH, alkalinity, Mg2+ and
Ca2+) and redox indicators (dissolved O2 and NH4+). Variation in the sediment
microbial community along the sediment redox gradient is being monitored by
direct counts and 16S rRNA phylotypes. &lt;br/&gt;
