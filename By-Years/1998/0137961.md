This ADVANCE Fellows award, through the Divisions of Chemistry and Physics, will
support the research of Marcia O. Fenley in the Institute of Molecular
Biophysics at Florida State University. The project will use theoretical and
computational approaches to elucidate the role of electrostatics on the
structure and function of nucleic acids. Specifically, the ion atmosphere and
electrostatic potential of model structures of triple-stranded nucleic acids
will be examined using numerical counterion condensation and Poisson-Boltzmann
methods. These calculations may elucidate the role of various ions on nucleic
acid structure, conformation changes and phase transitions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is supported through the NSF ADVANCE Program.
The overall mission of the ADVANCE Program is to increase the participation of
women in the scientific and engineering workforce through the increased
representation and advancement of women in academic science and engineering
careers. &lt;br/&gt;
