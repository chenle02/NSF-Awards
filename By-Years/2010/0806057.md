The investigator and his students study the interplay between variational
analysis, intuitive, possibly randomized, general-purpose nonsmooth optimization
algorithms, and applications to concrete models, particularly in robust control.
A paradigm, originating with Demmel in the 1980's, relating conditioning, ill-
posedness, and computational speed, inspires the investigator's thinking. The
study of matrix pseudospectra powerfully illustrates the general technique:
fundamental indicators of transient dynamical behavior, pseudospectra have a
rich structure, blending complex and matrix analysis, semi-algebraic geometry,
and numerical linear algebra, all ingredients in pseudospectral optimization.
Semi-algebraic geometry in particular is developing into a fundamental tool not
just in applications such as pseudospectra, but throughout variational analysis.
The investigator uses this approach, for example, to study novel structural
tools such as "partial smoothness", thereby analyzing convergence rates observed
in computational practice. Fundamental to the investigator's approach is a
complex blend of variational analysis, classical mathematics, numerical
computation, and applied modeling.

Often the designer of a complex engineering system varies certain features in
order to optimize some aspect of system performance. A simple example is a
shock-absorber: by varying the grade of lubricant it contains, the manufacturer
can modify how stiff a suspension system feels. Finding optimal choices for
damping vibrations in such a physical, electronic, communications or information
system is "nonsmooth": choices are very sensitive to slight changes in the
system, one reason they seem hard to compute. The investigator facilitates this
important but challenging optimization process by blending mathematical modeling
and analysis with scientific computation. He disseminates his research
energetically through expository and technical publications, high-profile
lectures, and online, to diverse international scientific and engineering
audiences. As an integral part of the project, the investigator's PhD students
develop crucial skills bridging divisions between sophisticated mathematical
theory and the many practical applications of nonsmooth optimization.
