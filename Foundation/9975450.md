Abstract

Award: DMS-9975450 Principal Investigator: Carol S. Wood

This award will support outside speakers in the Connecticut Logic Seminar, which
usually meets at Wesleyan University and draws participants from New York,
Connecticut, and Massachusetts. The seminar provides a forum for recent work in
a wide range of logical topics, including model theory, set theory, recursion
theory, proof theory, and computer science.

In recent years the number of connections between logic and other parts of
mathematics has increased, as evidenced by applications of model theory in
algebra, number theory, and analytic function theory. This has resulted in
attendance at the seminar by researchers from areas outside logic, a trend which
the organizers expect to continue and plan to foster by including speakers whose
work is of broad interest. Speakers and participants include representatives of
every career stage, from graduate students through distinguished senior leaders,
and past editions of the seminar have led to new collaborations between
researchers and shaped the training and theses of graduate students.
