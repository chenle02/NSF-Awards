9317365 Zargaryan The purpose of this exploratory research is to develop a new
approach, based on the use of asymptotic expansions to generate successive
approximations, for the prediction of the macro- mechanical properties of
heterogeneous materials (e.g., composites) and for the simultaneous
determination of the global response of structural and mechanical components
fabricated from these materials. In addition, this method permits the
calculation of local states of stress and deformation at or near the various
interfaces in the material, which is essential for the prediction of failure.
