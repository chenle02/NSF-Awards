This research includes statistical inference in models in which the
multivariate observation is treated as the sum of a 'systematic part' and a
random 'error'. The systematic part, which is stochastic in the multivariate
components of variance model and may be stochastic, nonstochastic, or mixed in
the factor analysis models, is in many cases restricted to a linear space of
lower dimension than the observation and error. The covariance matrix of the
error may have many special properties; for example, in factor analysis it is
diagonal. This research is in the general area of statistics. The models studied
in the research are used extensively in psychometrics and econometrics. In the
research large-sample theory will be developed for tests of hypotheses
concerning the number of linear restrictions and procedures to determine the
number of linear restrictions, and for the estimators of the restrictions and
the covariance matrices.
