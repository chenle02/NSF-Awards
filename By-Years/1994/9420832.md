9420832 MOLLER The University-National Laboratory System (UNOLS) fleet of
research vessels, operated by academic institutions, provides support services
to those NSF sponsored researchers who require time at sea to complete their
investigations. All of these ships use oceanographic cable as part of this
research support. Arrangements have been made which allow bulk purchases of wire
rope resulting in considerable cost savings. Sisteen reels of cable will be
purchased. The cable is stored until needed at the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution (WHOI) on the east coast and at the Scripps Institution of
Oceanography on the west coast. Mr. Donald A. Moller, Marine Operations
Coordinator, WHOI, will manage this project. ***
