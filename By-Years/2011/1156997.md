This award supports the renewal of the Research Experience for Undergraduates
(REU) site in Physics at the College of William and Mary. This program provides
an opportunity for undergraduates to take part in real research and to become
deeply involved in a particular research field. Support is offered for twelve
students per year for ten weeks of summer research. Fields represented by the
potential mentors are: laser physics including work with the Jefferson Lab FEL,
laser atom interactions, condensed matter physics studied with lasers, NMR, and
a variety of other techniques, neutrino physics, nuclear and particle physics,
THz spectroscopy, polymer physics, surface physics, ultra-sonics, non-
destructive evaluation, BEC on a chip, ultrashort laser pulses, plasma physics,
non-linear dynamics, quantum computing, information and optics, bio-
informatics,and astrophysics/cosmology. The presentation skills learned
(abstract preparation, short paper presentation, long paper preparation and
presentation) are skills useful throughout productive careers.
