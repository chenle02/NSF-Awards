This research project concerns questions in differential geometry that can be
formulated in terms of nonlinear partial differential equations. One of the
research themes is the existence of canonical geometries or shapes on spaces or
manifolds, related to the original work of Riemann on curvature and Einstein's
equations of general relativity. One example is the existence of Kähler-Einstein
metrics with conic singularities; these structures turn out to be of central
importance in mathematics and physics, and their theory involves developments in
algebra, analysis, geometry, and topology. The analytic techniques to be
developed in this project are expected to be useful to researchers working in
geometry, physics, and related areas. Additionally, the project aims to develop
better understanding of the complex Legendre transform, which could be useful in
solving a range of partial differential equations, generalizing the theory for
the Legendre transform that is a classical tool in mathematics, mechanics, and
economics. The project involves research training of graduate students in
related topics.

Understanding Kähler-Einstein metrics with conic singularities will deepen
understanding of smooth Kähler-Einstein metrics on both compact and non-compact
Kähler manifolds, including Fano and Calabi-Yau spaces. These spaces are central
in a wide variety of fields, ranging from algebraic geometry and number theory
to theoretical physics where the Eguchi-Hanson metric appears. Monge-Ampère type
equations arise in a wide variety of questions in pure and applied mathematics
and have a wide range of practical applications. This project aims to develop
methods to construct and approximate such solutions and to study their
regularity, which will have applications in other instances where these
equations appear. The project also intends to develop novel connections with
algebraic geometry, convex geometry, and micro-local analysis.
