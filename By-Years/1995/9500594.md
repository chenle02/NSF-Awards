ABSTRACT OPP-9522626 This workshop will bring together Arctic indigenous people
and applied health scientists from the United States, Canada and Siberia to
discuss ethical issues in health research. Many of these issues involve social
and cultural communication and the linkages between rapid social change and
health status. This linkage is recognized by the U.S. Arctic Research Policy Act
of 1984 and the Polar Research Board of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences.
The objectives of the workshop are to significantly extend the current dialogue
between health researchers and indigenous peoples' organizations in the
circumpolar north, to exchange information on health research ethics, to adopt
principles on health research ethics which may be adopted by the circumpolar
nations, and to ensure indigenous participation in the development of these
principles. The workshop will take place in Inuvik, Canada on June 2-3, 1995.
U.S. support is being provided for Alaskan and Russian participants. Canada is
supporting Canadian, Greenlandic and European participation. *** ??
