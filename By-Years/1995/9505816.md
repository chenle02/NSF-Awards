9505816 ZANDT This research is a study of the lithospheric structure of the
Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex at the borders of Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile,
in the central volcanic zone of south America. This zone has been the site of
voluminous ignimbrite eruptions within the past 10 Ma and is one of the largest
active caldera complexes on Earth. In addition to analyzing existing data for
the region, the project will install PASCALL portable broadband instrumentation
for one year in the area for recording local and teleseismic events. The aim of
this work is to answer important questions about the deep structure of a major
silicic volcanic field with implications for lithospheric magmatic processes in
continental subduction zones, crustal thickening and melting, and the evolution
of continental crust. *** ??
