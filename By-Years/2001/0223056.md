The long range goal of this project is to develop an integrated biological and
computational approach to decipher gene regulatory networks. This project
combines discovery-based approaches to identify and characterize new regulatory
networks with hypothesis-driven approaches in which transcriptional control by
two regulatory factors important in galactose metabolism will be examined. The
specific aims of this project are: (1) to temporally profile the global genetic
and proteomic response to galactose; (2) to globally identify the elements of
transcriptional networks important for galactose utilization; (3) to develop an
advanced computational framework for integration, modeling, and prediction of
transcriptional networks; and (4) to experimentally test the networks models
predicted from these studies.
