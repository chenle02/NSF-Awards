The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will result in
higher performing polymeric photonic materials (plastics which interact with
light) which will have extensive application in consumer devices such as
computers, cell phones, lighting units, telecommunications, cameras, and
sensors. Polymeric photonic materials are finding evermore application in
devices due to their low weight, high-impact resistance, and ability to be
fabricated into unique shapes/architectures, however, have paltry optical
performance when compared to their heavier, costlier glass counterparts. The
material developed here combines the existing positive attributes of polymeric
optical materials while offering significantly higher performance without large
increases in price.

This I-Corps project will develop high optical quality crosslinked polymer
networks with the unique ability to be remolded, reshaped, and repurposed when
placed under the correct conditions without loss of mechanical integrity or
optical properties. Polymeric optical components (lenses, waveguides, etc.) are
desirable over fragile and heavy glass counterparts, however, defects and
birefringence (stresses which negatively interact with light) prevent polymers
from being used for applications requiring high optical quality materials. This
proprietary technology allows for microscopic scrambling of chemical bonds to
occur in the polymeric materials only when it is placed under certain
conditions, effectively annealing out the aforementioned defects and
birefringence in the polymer, giving high optical quality materials. Current
research is focused on taking this dynamic platform and placing it into
commercially relevant resins that fabricate tough, robust, optically clear, high
performance materials.
