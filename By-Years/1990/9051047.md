In the past, the photographic plate provided the data for most of optical
astronomy. Undergraduate students in astronomy laboratory classes were,
therefore, introduced to equipment like measuring engines and iris photometers.
Now, however, most detectors are electronic. Most astronomical data resides in
digital form and a new set of analytical tools has replaced the old. Improved
access to these new tools by our undergraduate students will be provided. The
Department has recently increased its emphasis on laboratory- based training so
that students at all levels have exposure to the trials of real data. Newly-
implemented laboratory courses concentrate not just on the analysis of data.
Rather, the students learn to collect data and to understand what the data can
yield as well as appreciate its limitations. The Astronomy Program Review
Committee, appointed by the Chancellor to conduct a five- year review, strongly
recommended that the laboratory programs of the department be continued and,
even strengthened. The Department has recently upgraded its student observing
facilities at the Leuschner Observatory, which include remote observing
capabilities. An aggressive upgrading of on campus facilities with and emphasis
on image processing as the tool of modern astronomy will be carried out.
Students will be provided with the opportunity to gather their own observational
data at the student observatory, to analyze it quantitatively, to draw their own
conclusions and to understand the uncertainties. The concentration on image
processing has many benefits: first of all, it is intuitive; people are visual
creatures and the extraction of quantitative data from pictures presents few
conceptual difficulties. Secondly, it is applicable to a wide range of
astronomical problems in all wavelength regions. Lastly, it has applications
which go far beyond astronomical uses.
