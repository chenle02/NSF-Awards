This project involves the scientific coordination and administration of the
International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Core Project of the
International Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP). This work includes: (1)
coordinating the Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) and scientific Activities
of IGAC, including meeting arrangements, travel, correspondence, and record
keeping where appropriate, (2) developing and subsequently updating descriptions
of the ongoing efforts and future plans of each of the IGAC Activities, (3)
providing an international information and communications center for IGAC, and
(4) fostering cooperation between IGAC's cosponsors (IGBP and the IAMAP
Commission on Atmospheric Chemistry Global Pollution (CACGP)) and between IGAC
and its related IGBP Core Projects, other ICSU- sponsored global change research
programs (e.g., WCRP), and other relevant international bodies (e.g., WMO).
