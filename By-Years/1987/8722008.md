This grant supports a program of experimental research in nuclear physics.
Nuclear reactions and scattering induced by neutron beams will be measured to
search for and study giant isovector resonances. These measurements will be made
at the U. C. Davis Crocker Nuclear Laboratory and at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory. In addition, experimental studies of collisions of nuclei at
relativistic energies will be carried out at the Berkeley Bevalac. The
measurements using neutron beams will provide new information concerning large-
amplitude vibrational modes of nuclei -- the so-called giant resonances -- and
will be complementary to studies carried out with proton and other beams. The
measurements of relativistic nucleus collisions will probe the behavior of
nuclear matter under conditions of unusual density and temperature.
