The investigator studies problems of wave breaking and the stability of peaked
solitary waves in mathematical models of nonlinear shallow-water waves,
particularly the Camassa-Holm (CH) equation, the Degasperis-Procesi (DP)
equation, and the two-component Camassa-Holm (CH2) systems. Shallow-water waves
are defined as waves whose wavelengths are far greater than the water depth.
Nonlinear wave interactions occur when waves, moving possibly with different
speeds and in different directions, intersect. These equations and systems have
permanent waves and breaking waves: the wave profile remains bounded, but its
slope becomes unbounded in finite time. The CH and DP equations also contain
peaked solitary waves, as these wave forms replicate a feature characteristic of
the traveling wave solutions to the governing equations for largest possible
amplitude. This project provides a greater understanding of wave breaking
phenomena and contributes to the extensive modeling of shallow-water waves.

Water waves lie at the forefront of modern applied mathematics and theoretical
physics. The study of water wave phenomena has been a rich source of
mathematical theories for over 200 years and affects a variety of issues
pertaining to the ocean and environment. Breaking waves, both whitecaps and
surf, are commonly observed in the ocean, but surprisingly, little is known
about them. Yet they are important for a variety of reasons. They place large
hydrodynamic loads on man-made structures, transfer horizontal momentum to
surface currents, provide a source of turbulent energy to mix the upper layers
of the ocean, and move sediment in shallow water. The investigator studies
mathematical models of nonlinear shallow-water waves, particularly the CH and DP
equations as well as the CH2 systems. The CH-type equations might also be
relevant to the modeling of an important shallow-water breaking wave phenomenon,
the tsunami. A tsunami wave is generated when a large body of water, such as a
region in a lake or a sea, becomes rapidly displaced on a massive scale. With
typical wavelengths of 200 km, tsunamis are governed by shallow water equations
and can be catastrophic when they reach land, as seen in the recent Indonesia
and Japan earthquakes. This project seeks further understanding of the dynamics
of shallow-water wave breaking, especially before and after breaking has
occurred when the flow is steady and more amenable to theoretical and numerical
study. In particular, the investigator conducts mathematical analysis pertinent
to the modeling of tsunami waves, which in turn helps better predict and
understand the waves' characteristics.
