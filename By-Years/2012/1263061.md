The REU Site: Arctic and Antarctic CReSIS (AaA-REU) program will involve 75
undergraduates over a three-year period with five pre-service RET students each
year. This project is a continuation of the REU Site program that has operated
at Elizabeth City State University and other CReSIS (Center for Remote Sensing
of the Ice Sheets) institutions since 2010. The site is co-funded by the
Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program. The vision for
this project is driven by the compelling need to draw on the integration of
polar research and education to attract a diverse pool of talented students into
polar-related careers. The AaA-REU project will be interdisciplinary in focus
and will make innovative, cost-effective use of cyberinfrastructure. The project
builds upon existing partnerships in polar science, engineering, education, and
cyberinfrastructure -- partnerships that provide access to extensive CReSIS
resources under the direction of an experienced team of educators and
researchers. It is expected that the demographics of the participants will
reflect the exciting minority percentages that were realized during the past
CReSIS-REU award.
