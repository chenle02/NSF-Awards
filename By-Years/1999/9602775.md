The University of Tennessee at Chattanooga is the recipient of funds from the
National Science Foundation to renovate mathematical research and research
training space. Currently, the Department of Mathematics is housed in the oldest
building on campus that was built in 1902. Research activities have been
inhibited by inadequate space configuration, faulty cabling and electrical
connections, poor ventilation, lighting, and HVAC systems, and an electrical
system that has reached its capacity. The facility is also inaccessible to the
disabled. Specifically, NSF funds will be used to replace the existing amount of
square footage of space dedicated to the mathematical sciences, which includes
creating space for a laboratory, research-based interdisciplinary approach to
training students in mathematics. The renovations will allow for the enhancement
and expansion of current research in statistics and applied probability
simulations, such as Monte Carol techniques. Activities will also be enhanced in
the area of inverse scattering, optimization, control and PDE, to include
environmental and resource modeling. New research methods will be developed in
the areas of wave propagation, industrial math, matrix theory, and statistical
finance modeling. It is anticipated with modernized facilities the department
will attract more students into the math career pipeline by providing increased
opportunities for research experiences and access to state of the art
technology. The project will increase collaborations with faculty from other
regional and national institutions, as well as provide the foundation for a
graduate program.
