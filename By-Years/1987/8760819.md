This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in the general
area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfield of spectroscopy.
The goal of this research activity is to determine the feasibility of developing
a chemical species monitor which exhibits species selectivity and a broad
dynamic range. The device incorporates frequency tunable gallium arsenide
semiconductor lasers which enable selection of species specific molecular
absorption features. Phase sensitive detection permits "locking" of the laser
radiation to the frequency of the absorption while wavelength modulation enables
quantification of the analyte species of interest. The use of fiber optics makes
this spectrometer applicable to remote sensing. Success in this Phase I activity
could lead to the development of a device with potentially widespread
application to monitoring and control of chemical processes in both laboratory
experiments and industrial processes where selective, remote sensing of broad
ranges of concentrations of chemical species, especially low levels, is
required.
