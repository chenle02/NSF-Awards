9451425 Vogt Incorporation of nuclear magnetic resonance into the undergraduate
curriculum will considerably enhance the training of undergraduates at this
institution with a high minority population. The spectroscopic aspects will be
introduced gradually. First, the students will learn the theory. Then they will
simulate the workings of the nmr with programs available for Macintosh
computers. Subsequently, a trained upper-class chemistry major (or minor) will
demonstrate the running of the instrument for the labs with nmr components
(second semester of organic Lab). Finally, nmr as part of the chemistry major
will be taught as a component of a course in spectroscopy. Following training of
one student by the PI, students will be trained by their peers and enabled to
run their own spectra.
