This research project, The Underrepresentation of Minority Women in Science and
Engineering Education, is the outgrowth of information that only 3 percent of
the doctorates awarded to U.S. citizens in science and engineering were awarded
to American Indian, Black, and Hispanic women. The study proposes to identify
and clarify the relationship between race/ethnicity, gender, and educational
outcomes by comparing the educational outcomes of non-Asian minority women with
majority women in science and engineering. Two hypothesis predicts disadvantages
for women based on the double oppression that comes from joint membership in the
two lower status groups. It is expected that the research findings will have
both practical and policy implications for minority women in S/E graduate
education.
