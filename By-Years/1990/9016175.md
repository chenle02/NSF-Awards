This award will support collaborative research by Professor James Press of the
University of California at Riverside and Professor Ruben Klein of the National
Laboratory for Scientific Computation (LNCC) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The aim
of the research is to study multivariate Bayesian classification methods in
spatial statistics. Image reconstruction and the contextual classification of
remotely sensed data using iterative Bayesian and empirical Bayesian procedures
will add an international dimension to this collaboration. The researchers, who
have coauthored a number of journal articles on this topic, plan to extend
existing models to broader contexts and to improve current models in various
ways. Both simulated and actual data will be studied. They propose to study
"nugget effect" models, various spatial correlation structures, and adaptive
starting value models using natural conjugate prior families (while using
iterative procedures for predictive classification). Results should be
applicable to satellite imagery in agricultural and geophysical contexts, image
reconstruction, and problems in pattern recognition.
