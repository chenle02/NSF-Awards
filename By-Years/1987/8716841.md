This research project will examine continuous and discrete models of phase
transition. Bifurcation theory will be a basic tool in the continuous case. In
the discrete case, the discrete-fragmentation equations will be considered with
conditions which allow for a breakdown of density conservation in finite time.
Phase transitions are an important phenomena in both fluids and solids. This
research will extend understanding of the dynamics of phase transitions.
