TECHNICAL AND NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT Funds in the amount of $5,000 are requested
for Scholarships to cover the registration fees and travel of graduate students,
postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty, attending the two day Division of
Polymer Physics of the American Physical Society workshop on ?X-ray and Neutron
Scattering for Polymer Science? to be held on March 2-3, 2019, in Boston MA in
conjunction with the annual APS March meeting (March4-8, 2019). The Course will
provide an overview of scattering techniques that probe the structure and
dynamics of polymers. It will also highlight ways to integrate scattering data
with molecular simulations and microscopy, as well as approaches to manage the
large data sets typical of scattering measurements. The majority of attendees at
the workshop are expected to be graduate students.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
