The proposal is for a Minority Research Planning Grant to initiate an
investigation to apply heat exchanger design principles to improve fuel cell
design practices. Topics to be pursued include the allocation of electroactive
area over which charge transport occurs, the use of "cathode fins" to reduce
charge transfer resistance, thermodynamic optimization via a modern Second Law
analysis of the fuel cell transport processes, and the application of
thermoeconomics analysis for cost-effective cell stack design. The planning
grant should serve to guide the PI in the development of more extensive research
proposals in this technically important area. The research activity will be
coupled to an existing educational outreach program that will help to promote
science and engineering graduate education to underrepresented minority
students.
