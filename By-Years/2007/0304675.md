0304675&lt;br/&gt;Baker&lt;br/&gt;This proposal was received in response to
Nanoscale Science and Engineering initiative, NSF 02-148, category NER. This
interdisciplinary, collaborative research project combines the expertise of the
P.I. in creating and characterizing nanostructured surfaces with the expertise
of the Co-P.I. in protein functionalization and immobilization. It involves two
institutions of the Claremont Consortium (one undergraduate, one graduate), and
will provide the opportunity to combine their research resources, enabling a
project not feasible without this collaboration. Three undergraduate students
will be able to participate in cutting-edge research, under the guidance of two
women faculty members, a postdoctoral associate and a research assistant and
will bring applications of nanoscience and nanotechnology to the students at
both institutions. The results from this project will be presented at national
conferences, and will be integrated into the senior undergraduate research
program and the bioengineering curriculum at the institution of the P.I. and
Co-P.I., respectively.
