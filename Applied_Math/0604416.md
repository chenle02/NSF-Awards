ABSTRACT

Two problems of nonlinear wave propagation in fluid media will be studied by
asymptotic and numerical methods: the unsteady dynamics of fully localized free-
surface and interfacial solitary waves, often referred to as "lumps"; and
resonant nonlinear interactions of internal gravity wavepackets with higher-mode
long waves in a density-stratified fluid. Recent theoretical work has brought
out a new class of gravity-capillary lumps, and there is experimental evidence
that these lumps can be driven by wind blowing over water. While previous
studies have focused on the existence of steady lumps, the present investigation
will tackle the question of how such lumps may arise from general initial
conditions and by external forcing. The second problem to be addressed is a
resonance mechanism by which three-dimensional internal gravity wavepackets can
transfer energy to higher-mode obliquely propagating long waves, thus
contributing to the generation of smaller vertical scales and enhancing the fine
vertical structure of the background mean flow fields (density, velocity, etc).

Gravity-capillary lumps are likely to contribute significantly to the small-
scale roughness of the ocean surface. Understanding their dynamics may thus
prove useful in interpreting satellite images of the ocean surface. Moreover,
similar lumps are expected to arise on floating ice sheets due to loads moving
on top of the ice, a problem with several applications, including the use of
vehicles on floating ice. Shedding light, on the other hand, on how internal
gravity waves in a stratified fluid contribute to the fine vertical structure of
the background flow is an important issue in understanding how mixing occurs in
the ocean, which in turn is believed to affect climate dynamics, biological
productivity and waste disposal.
