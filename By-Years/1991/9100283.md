This grant supports the group of F.K. Lamb, C.J. Pethick and D. Pines for
continuing work on a wide variety of topics involving astrophysical applications
of microscopic and many- body physics. The general area include fundamental
properties of matter under extreme conditions, the physics of neutron stars,
physics of accretion, and particle acceleration and nonthermal emission from
astrophysical sources.
