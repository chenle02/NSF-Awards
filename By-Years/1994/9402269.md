9402269 Mendillo In this proposal, the PI defines a new diagnostics capability
for the CEDAR community in which the two dimensional structures can be obtained
within the context of an all-sky spectrally monochromatic image. The CEDAR
Tomography Facility (COTIF) would thus bring, literally, the third dimension to
optical aeronomy over the full altitude domain of mesosphere to thermosphere
(80-600 km) defined by such emission features as metallic layers to SAR arcs.
The proposed effort is for two years, using a team of researchers experienced in
the design, construction and science yield of optical diagnostics. Science Team
members from other institutions provide advice and guidance on final design
goals, field test issues and full off-site campaign use. Automation, telescience
access and super-computer utilization offer extraordinary opportunities for
CEDAR post-doctoral and graduate student training in a first of its kind
tomographic facility. ***
