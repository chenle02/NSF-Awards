This award provides one-half of the funding to acquire an electron microprobe
for the University of Arizona's Earth Sciences Division and Lunar and Planetary
Laboratory. The University of Arizona is committed to providing the remaining
half. The instrument will be used for quantitative microanalysis of geological,
meteorite, and synthetic samples by several large research groups in the area of
geosciences and materials sciences at the University of Arizona.
