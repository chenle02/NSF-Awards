9733127 Martin This award is made under the NSF CAREER Program. The principal
investigator, Dr. Martin, will carry out an integrated research and teaching
program in which extensive use will be made of 4-dimensional animated output
from a numerical model. The research component is focused on an investigation of
the structural and dynamical evolution of cyclones in the relatively unstudied
late stages of the cyclone life cycle, including cyclolysis. The study will
employ the case study approach and will include simulations with a state-of-the-
art, non-hydrostatic, mesoscale model and the use of potential vorticity
diagnostics. Special attention will be given to the role of latent heat release
on the post-mature stage behavior of extratropical cyclones. The educational
component involves a variety of activities, all of which will use tailored
versions of the same 4-dimensional model animation as a means of illustrating
complex atmospheric phenomena. These activities fall into two categories: (1)
outreach education to local primary and secondary schools and (2) curriculum
enhancement, at all levels in the university classroom, through the development
of course-specific World Wide Web links to current animated forecast model data.
