EIA-0205628 Theodore B. Trafalis University of Oklahoma ITR: A Real Time Mining
of Integrated Weather Data&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mission is to build systems
and develop theory for extracting information and identifying patterns that are
useful for making decision in real-time. Funding is being requested to build
pattern recognition techniques that will exploit multisensor data in an
integrated manner to provide information such as the presence or absence of
tornados, supercells and mesocyclones; estimate precipitation; predict the
occurrence of flash floods; assimilate and display large volumes of multisensor
data and trigger the archive of selected data sets. These tasks will be
accomplished by customizing and developing techniques for real-time data mining.
The approaches used will include traditional data reduction methods such as PCA
and clustering; Procrustes analysis; Kalman filters and non-linear time series
analysis with regime switching; and, decomposition and robust optimization
methods for training support vector machines.&lt;br/&gt;
