Many organizations and individuals rely on the cloud to store their data and
process their analytical queries. But such data may contain sensitive
information. Not only do users want to conceal their data on a cloud, they may
also want to hide analytical queries over their data, results of such queries,
and data access patterns from a cloud service provider (that may be compromised
either from within or by a third party).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
designs and implements SEAL, a Secure Engine for AnaLytics over large data on a
cloud. SEAL encrypts data using secure encryption schemes, but supports
analytical operations through a new approach of building a meta-answer database.
SEAL is developed within a security framework that allows specifying different
levels of desired security. The design of SEAL in particular explores the
tradeoff between security and efficiency, providing solutions with different
provable security and efficiency features for a wide variety of analytical
operations. Users are able to continue to enjoy the benefits a cloud has to
offer, but now without the worry of losing sensitive information and with
control over the security and efficiency tradeoff.
