Recently, the microprocessor industry has moved toward multicore microprocessor
designs as a means of utilizing the increasing transistor counts in the face of
physical and micro-architectural limitations. &lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately,
providing multiple cores does not directly translate into performance for most
codes. To make use of multicore, many new languages have been proposed to ease
the burden of writing parallel programs, yet the programming effort involved in
creating correct and efficient parallel programs is still far more substantial
than writing the equivalent single-threaded version. A more attractive approach
is to rely on tools, both compilers and runtime optimizers, to automatically
extract threads from sequential applications. Unfortunately, despite decades of
research on automatic parallelization, most techniques have only been effective
in the scientific and data-parallel domains. With recently gained insight, the
investigators showed that the limits of prior thread-extraction approaches are
not fundamental. By applying known and new compilation techniques in a
systematic manner, the investigators found that SPEC CINT2000, among the most
sequential of codes, has abundant scalable parallelism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In
this project, the team of investigators is taking the initial steps toward
developing the techniques necessary to build an automatic thread extraction
framework. These techniques include developing static transformations that
extract parallelism and quantifying the opportunities for dynamic optimization.
The system will ultimately consist of a series of static transformations and
compiler-inserted hints combined with a run-time optimization component. This
framework will address the multicore challenge by reliably extracting
parallelism from a wide range of applications without burdening the programmer
with what should remain to be low-level implementation details.
