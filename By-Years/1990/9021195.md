Professor Marcus is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to perform theoretical studies of chemical kinetics. This
research will provide a more detailed understanding of various dynamical effects
which occur in the broad areas of electron and proton transfer reactions,
intramolecular dynamics, and unimolecular processes. Professor Marcus intends to
study a variety of theoretical problems in chemical kinetics and related areas.
These include unimolecular reactions, electron and proton transfer reactions,
and intramolecular dynamics. The unimolecular reactions will involve the study
of vibrational-rotational quantum state-to-state reactivities for various
molecules. The electron transfers studied will include electron transfers at
semiconductor-liquid interfaces and electron transfers in various protein
systems. In the area of intramolecular dynamics, the high-resolution and time-
resolved vibronic spectra in the quantum beats and in the "dissipative" regimes
will be investigated. The proton transfer studies at low and high energies will
be related to the studies of intramolecular dynamics in the two regimes on one
hand, and to concepts used in electron transfer on the other.
