In order to fully understand how energetic particles that precipitate into the
earth's atmosphere loose energy requires a combination of observation and
modeling. This project outlines a new method for calculating spectral features
of the terrestrial aurora in wavelength regions visible from the ground. This is
a Monte-Carlo computation of the effect of energetic electron fluxes into the
upper atmosphere and includes the effects of elastic and inelastic scattering,
electron impact ionization, production and transport of secondary electrons and
electron impact dissociation and excitation. Auroral emissions will be
calculated from the excitation rates using a time-dependent chemical model and
the most recent climatological and prognostic models of the thermosphere and
ionosphere. These models will be used to examine some of the pressing and
controversial problems in auroral emission production and for interpretation in
a number of CEDAR (Coupling,Energetics and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions)
campaigns.***
