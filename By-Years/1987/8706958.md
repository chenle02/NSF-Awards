This award will allow the PI to conduct ethnographic fieldwork in the Amazon
Basin among two groups of Indians, the Siriono and the Yuqui of lowland Bolivia.
The project will examine the long-term ecological and socioclultural
consequences of resource depletion resulting from faunal decline,
intensification of horticulture, and increased extraction of forest products.
The project will also examine the results of settler incursion into the zone of
these foraging peoples and the effect this has on resource depletion, labor,
commodity market participation, sociocultural change and ultimately cultural
survival. The two groups being studied are in an area that has been little
studied, and pertain to a type of cutlure that is practically extinct at
present. This research is important because it will add a valuable case to the
literature on native tribes' reaction to and adjustment to settler incursions
into their area. The project will contribute to the literature on appropriate
technologies that allow for rational land use to encourage long-term resource
sustainability.
