This project examines some of the mathematical foundations of self-organization
in complex systems that occur in geophysics. The approach is based on studying
the properties of a number of discrete phenomenological models of geophysical
and environmental phenomena including: the spread of forest fires, earthquakes,
and landform evolution. One goal is to identify the universal aspects of the
behavior of such nonlinear systems, extending results on universality already
seen in studies drainage networks, diffusion-limited aggregation, and forest
fire models. Questions to be addressed include the dependence of behavior on the
representation of interactions between elements, the effect of representing
unresolved physical processes as random noise, their forecastability, and
whether continuum analogues can be found. The investigators hope that the
understanding gained may have practical applications in the prediction and risk
assessment of natural hazards, including better predictive models of
earthquakes, the assessment of land-slide hazards, and the assessment of forest
fire hazards.
