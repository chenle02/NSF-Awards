Computers are integrated into large enrollment laboratory courses in order to:
(1) provide access to on-line data sampling, (2) combine simulations and/or
animation with on-line data collection programs, and (3) generate the capacity
to obtain hard copies of rapid physiological phenomena (for example, an action
potential). In the introductory laboratories, exercises are enhanced by
capturing data on computers and then generating visual images of the principle
events leading to the recorded data. Important physiological concepts are
explored by allowing students to alter selected variables in software (for
example, time, distance, or temperature) and observing a simulation of how their
recorded results might change. In the advanced systemic physiology courses,
computers collect and analyze data on-line.
