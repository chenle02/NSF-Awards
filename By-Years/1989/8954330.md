The conference addresses the need of undergraduate experimental psychology
faculty who lack first-hand experience with current neurobiology techniques and
computer programs for laboratory experiences in learning, perception and
cognition. It also permits such individuals to interact with leading experts in
the field. Participants are acquiring basic neurobiology techniques, developing
computer-based laboratory programs, participating in a network exchange of
teaching concepts, learning to establish modern computer-driven operant
laboratories at their home institutions, discussing significant research and
review articles, and interacting with leading experts in experimental psychology
and neurobiology. The twenty faculty are spending two weeks on campus studying
neurobiology techniques, computer simulation and reviewing literature followed
by a third week interacting with eight experts at the Pingree Park mountain
campus. Participants will return to their home institution with enhanced
teaching skills and subject matter content as well as insights into improving
laboratory experiences for undergraduates.
