This research is directed at understanding the nature of three transport
processes of the intestine of lepidopteran insects for potassium, chloride, and
bicarbonate, and the role of these processes in the ionic and acid-base balance
of the whole animal. An important goal is to identify the processes by which the
animal resists the potassium load presented by the plant diet and the mechanisms
of alkalinization of the contents in the anterior parts and recovery of base in
the posterior parts of the gut. The complexity of the tissue necessitates
separation of the basal and apical membranes and study of their transport
mechanisms in isolation. The immediate goals of this project are, first, to
isolate the basal membrane components responsible for potassium entry by one of
the following methods: incorporation into lipid bilayers, study in membrane
vesicles, or patch-clamping of dissociated cells in primary culture. Second,
using similar techniques, possible chloride/bicarbonate exchange will be
investigated in apical membranes of both columnar cells and goblet cells. Third,
the relationships between electrochemical driving forces and transport rates for
both chloride and hydrogen ions in isolated gut will be measured using ion-
specific intracellular electrodes. The effect of dietary potassium on acid-base,
potassium, and chloride balances will also be measured in the intact animal. The
results of these studies will provide information on the basic mechanisms by
which insects regulate the ionic composition and acid-base balance of their body
fluids. It will help to explain how butterfly and moth larvae are able to resist
the load of potassium provided by their diet of plant leaves. New knowledge of
the physiology of these transport systems may, in the future, suggest new
approaches for the control of these insects.
