The objective of this program is to develop a novel wireless surgical camera
system to enhance &lt;br/&gt;and improve surgical procedures for single incision
laparoscopic surgery. The camera system can &lt;br/&gt;be inserted into a body
cavity via an incision or a natural orifice for the operation instruments,
&lt;br/&gt;which eliminates the need for dedicated incisions for laparoscopic
cameras and the shared use of &lt;br/&gt;an incision for surgical instruments.
The key innovation of the insertable camera is the design of &lt;br/&gt;a semi-
spherical driving unit driven externally by a specially designed magnetic stator
with &lt;br/&gt;varying thickness of tissue insulation. The design addresses the
challenges in anchoring and &lt;br/&gt;manipulating single or multiple camera
systems inside body cavities during surgical operations &lt;br/&gt;by elegantly
coupling manipulation and navigation functions into the semi-spherical driving
unit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is the technological and
theoretical bases for a new class of wireless &lt;br/&gt;laparoscopic cameras
that consist of an in vivo rotor and an ex vivo stator for single incision
&lt;br/&gt;laparoscopic surgery. The innovative design enables precise
translational and rotational control &lt;br/&gt;of laparoscopic cameras, and the
estimation of critical depth information of the surgical scene &lt;br/&gt;and
instruments for hand eye coordination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts
are the societal benefits to patients by reducing unnecessary muscle cuts and
&lt;br/&gt;scars, blood loss, hospital stay duration, post-operative pain, and
recovery time. This project also &lt;br/&gt;provides education and outreach
activities to undergraduate and graduate students by innovative
&lt;br/&gt;teaching and project design modules, and demonstration activities at
local K-12 schools and &lt;br/&gt;youth summer camps.
