A system for treatment of water and/or wastewater is being developed. Pulsed
high voltage applied to electrodes immersed in a water stream creates high
potential gradients in the water volume between the electrodes. These gradients
have a bactericidal action. In addition, ozone can be generated throughout the
water volume by introducing air in fine bubbles from a sparger. The applied
gradients create ozone and chemically active radicals within the air bubbles.
The system has several advantages including: (1) No persistent chemicals are
added to the water, (2) High gradients can be employed by themselves or combined
with ozone generation, (3) Ozone is generated within the volume of the water
being treated, and (4) Chemically-active radicals are produced within the water
volume, together with ozone.
