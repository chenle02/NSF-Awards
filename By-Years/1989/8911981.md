The chloroplast phosphate-translocator catalyzes the exchange of three-carbon
organic phosphate compounds and inorganic phosphate in both C3 and C4 plants. A
major difference between the two photosynthetic types is the transport of
phosphoenolpyruvate by the C4 translocator. This process is essential for C4
photosynthesis to operate. The long term objective of this proposal is to
characterize the evolutionary changes and the molecular organization of the Pi
translocator protein in the chloroplasts and to elucidate its structure/function
relationship. The specific objectives include the direct measurement of PEP
transport in isolated chlroplasts by silicone oil centrifugation,
microautoradiography and immunofluorescence and purification of the translocator
using affinity chromatography and non- permeant covalent probes combined with
limited proteolysis. The results will enhance our knowledge of ion transport in
plant and animal cells, and may provide a potential target for genetic
improvement of crops.
