This proposal outlined an interdisciplinary research program to synthesize, with
a novel technique, functionally gradient materials (FGM), which are composites
with a spatial gradient in composition. The novel process is to use centrifugal
force to cause phase separations of fine particles in molten materials during
the combustion synthesis. Two classes of experiments are included in the
program: Combustion synthesis with centrifugation, and thermal melting of metals
with centrifugation of fine particles into the melt. Two systems with potential
commercial applications are selected for study: metal-ceramic and ceramic-
ceramic composites with favorable structural properties, and novel electro-optic
materials with compositional gradients chosen on the basis of their utility in
gradient-index (GRIN) optical technology and quantum-dot optoelectronic
structures. %%%% This study plans to synthesize functional gradient materials
(FGM) using centrifugal force to cause phase separations of fine particles in
molten materials during the combustion synthesis. Two systems with potential
commercial applications are selected for study: metal-ceramic and ceramic-
ceramic composites for structural applications, and electro-optic materials for
optical and optoelectronic applications. The ability to synthesize FGM will
increase the possibilities of commercial applications greatly.
