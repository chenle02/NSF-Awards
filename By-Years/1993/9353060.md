9353060 Florey The University of Wisconsin-Superior will initiate a 5-week,
residential, Young Scholars project in mathematics, chemistry and biology for 20
students entering grades 11 and 12. Hands-on experience and participation will
be emphasized. Participants will use techniques of exploratory data analysis and
multiple linear regression to analyze National Atmospheric Deposition Program
data and develop mathematical models of the pH of acid rain. Students learn of
the chemistry of pollutants, the chemistry of acid deposition and the effects of
acidification through field trips. Career exploration and ethics of science
activities are also included. A series of follow-up activities complete the
program. ***
