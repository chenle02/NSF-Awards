This award supports research in algebraic K-theory. The principal investigator
will work on understanding the K-groups of an exact category, as defined by
Quillen. One major goal is to build on the recent discovery of a simple
algebraic description of the first K-group by finding relations among these
elements and doing some calculations. An analog of this description for higher
K-groups will also be sought. In addition, the principal investigator will
continue to work on Gersten's conjecture. This research is concerned with
algebraic K-theory. In a broad sense algebraic K-theory concerns the evolution
of concepts from linear algebra such as basis and vector space. This work has
significant implications for number theory and algebraic geometry, and promises
to make exciting connections between a number of different areas in mathematics.
