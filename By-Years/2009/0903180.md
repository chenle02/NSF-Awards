The National Center of Excellence for Aerospace Technical Education (SpaceTEC),
a consortium of 11 partner community colleges and universities, has developed
and disseminated educational materials, established and improved associate
degree programs, and implemented an industry-endorsed, nationally-recognized
certification for aerospace technicians. As a national resource center, SpaceTEC
supports the nation's civil aerospace initiatives, Department of Defense
personnel and the fledgling commercial space industry by developing a better
educated technical workforce that can address the significant changes in
aerospace systems for research, defense and commercial purposes. A comprehensive
and accessible repository of aerospace-related technical education materials and
successful practices is established and maintained. Increased opportunities are
created for students and incumbent workers to seek and complete an aerospace
technical degree. Through industry and government support the partnership is
expanded to ensure that the aerospace technology curriculum is current and
relevant to industry and technological practices. Professional development
workshops are provided to enhance and upgrade the skills and knowledge of
educators and technicians. The Certified Aerospace Technician is established as
a national standard for the industry and expects to certify 600 technicians
nationally. Evaluation is done by local advisory committees, a National
Aerospace Technology Advisory Committee, the National Visiting Committee and an
external evaluator.
