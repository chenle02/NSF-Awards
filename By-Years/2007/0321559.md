Human activities have caused widespread changes in the availability of nutrients
such as nitrogen in many U.S. streams and rivers. Increases in nutrients can
compromise water quality, disrupt normal ecological processes, and in extreme
cases, pose serious human health risks. Thus, there is a pressing need to reduce
nutrient concentrations in these ecosystems. Our goal is to determine if and how
floodplains can act as filters for removing excess nitrogen from the Wisconsin
River. We will investigate the effectiveness of floodplains in removing nitrogen
during flooding, and how this ability is influenced by the composition of the
floodplain forest. Leaves from floodplain trees provide the fuel for nitrogen
removal from river water, so any change in the amount or type of this fuel
potentially affects nitrogen removal. Results will be published in the
scientific literature and shared with organizations involved in nutrient
management and river restoration projects.
