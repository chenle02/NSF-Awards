This award to Dr. Anthony A. Maciejewski of Purdue University is for the
development of a computer tutor designed to assist the student of technical
Japanese in acquiring proficiency in the language. The essential component of
the computer tutor is its ability to integrate feedback from the student in
providing personalized instruction. This includes the ability to select
instructional materials relevant to the student's technical discipline as well
as at the appropriate level of difficulty. In recent years, the asymmetrical
flow of technical information between the U.S. and Japan has become a subject of
concern. The scarcity of American scientists and engineers proficient in the
Japanese language is due to numerous factors including a lack of technical
Japanese curricula, course materials, and qualified instructors. Use of a
computer tutor in self study or as an integral part of traditionally structured
Japanese language courses will help alleviate some of these deficiencies.
