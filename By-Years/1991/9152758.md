The goal of this project is to improve the curriculum by providing enhanced
hands-on field and/or laboratory exercises in Introductory Biology, Ecology,
lnvertebrate Zoology, Microbiology, Developmental Biology, Cell Physiology,
Plant Systematics, Genetics and Evolution, and Marine Biology. The purchase of a
refrigerated marine aquaria and a freshwater table, environmental chambers,
incubators, a sieve shaker and sieves, a plant dryer and herbarium case, and
microvideo systems allow the incorporation of exercises such as isolation of
microorganisms from marine sediments and soils, study of the behavior of marine
invertebrates in aquaria, the culture of cells and microorganisms, observation
of developmental events in slime molds, yeasts and avian embryos, growth of
short life cycle plants, and successful preparation of herbarium specimens.
Students benefit from the addition of field- collected and cultured live
animals, plants and microorganisms to laboratory exercises, and the integration
of field work with laboratory exercises, and more organisms are available for
student research projects.
