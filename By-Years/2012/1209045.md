This workshop will bring together a group of 30 plus international scholars,
primarily anthropologist, to produce a thick description of the causes and
consequences of the meltdown of the Icelandic economy. The PI hypothesizes that
the crisis involved a complex interaction of cultural, economic, political and
ideological variables that played off each other from the 1980s surrounding the
creation of Individual Transferrable Quotas in the Icelandic fisheries; it is
this complex interaction that makes the case a very interesting one for a thick
description methodology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is scheduled for
Fall 2011 at the University Park Campus of Penn State and it is anticipated
approximately 30 scholars and graduate students will participate in the 3-day
project. The format of the workshop is a standard presentation of scholarly
papers with discussion. The attendees will be prepared to discuss specific
aspects of the organizing topic and following the workshop the individual papers
will be gathered together into a volume, for which the PI Paul Durrenburger and
co-organizer, Gisli Paulsson University of Iceland, will produce the
introduction and conclusion for the edited volume.
