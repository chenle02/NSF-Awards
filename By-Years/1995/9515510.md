9515510 Benenson This U.S.-Brazil collaborative research project combines 6 U.S.
nuclear physicists from Michigan State University, led by Walter Benenson, with
6 Brazilian collaborators from the University of Sao Paulo (Alex Szanto de
Toledo), Federal Univ. of Rio de Janeiro (Carlos Bertulani), and the Federal
Fluminense University (Nelson Carlin) to conduct 4 different collections of
experiments. The four ambitious measurements involving radioactive nuclear beams
are: coulomb disassociation of halo nuclei; astrophysical measurements of levels
near the proton drip line and reaction rates of unstable nuclei; total cross
section measurements as a function of mass and energy for several exotic nuclei;
and measurements of the nuclear temperature of fragments from the 14N + 12C
reaction. The first three experiments will be conducted at National
Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) at MSU and the last one at the
University of Sao Paulo's Pelletron facility. The projected series of tests will
make excellent use of the lower-energy facilities in Sao Paulo, where more beam
time is available than would be possible in the US laboratories. The
interactions produced by a group of leading nuclear physicists in the two
countries should benefit the scientific community in both the U.S. and Brazil.
Students and post doctoral researchers will also travel to Brazil as part of the
research effort. ***
