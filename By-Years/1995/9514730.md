The investigators will continue the development of a computational model of
phonetic structure, and employ it to help understand certain kinds of place of
articulation assimilation that occur in various languages. The model is based on
a particular dynamical systems approach called task dynamics, which abstractly
characterizes speech gestures in terms of coordinated patterns of articulator
movements during speech production. The relative timing and parameterization of
the gestures comprising a given utterance are specified by a gestural score that
is generated by the model's linguistic gestural component. To apply the model to
assimilation, the investigators plan to collect data on the variation exhibited
by the gestural structures (as defined by the model) as a function of variety of
conditions, such as speaking rate and prosodic structure, from speakers of
English, Russian, Arabic, and Spanish. They will model the observed patterns of
variation. Because the model provides an explicit, principled connection between
gestural specification and an acoustic output, it can be used to test how
patterns of variation give rise to the percept of assimilation.
