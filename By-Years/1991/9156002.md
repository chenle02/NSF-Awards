A Resource and Environmental Geology course using issues and problems of
contemporary interest as the vehicle to introduce basic scientific principles.
Class activities involve the active engagement of students in "thought
experiments" and hands-on exercises in lab and field through the emphasis on the
collection, consideration and use of scientific evidence and principles in
historical, political, economic, and cultural contexts. The products of class
assignments require clear articulation of the problem and proposed solutions via
both the written and spoken word. Collaborative learning is featured. The goals
of this approach are to a) show the connections of Science to our social
institutions, b) promote critical thinking and communication skills, and c)
recruit and mentor science students, while making science education more
accessible to all students.
