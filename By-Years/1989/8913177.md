This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing work of Dr.
Richard N. McDonald at Kansas State University. This work will provide an
improved understanding of the chemical behavior in the gas phase of negatively
charged ions formed from organic, inorganic, and organometallic molecules. The
experiments that will be carried out by Dr. McDonald will afford information on
two major photochemical reaction pathways for negatively charged ions: electron
photodetachment (to produce a neutral species plus an electron), and ligand
photodissociation (to produce two fragments, one neutral and one negatively
charged). A tunable dye laser will be used to generate the excited-state ions,
and the different negatively charged ions formed in the flowing afterglow will
be monitored by mass spectroscopy. Dr. McDonald will utilize selected ion flow
tube (SIFT) technology in tandem with the original technique to investigate the
chemical reactivity of metal cluster ions.
