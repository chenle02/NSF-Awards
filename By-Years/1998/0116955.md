ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0116955&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate
source of Os into the modern ocean is only partially constrained. At issue is
whether radiogenic Os is derived from average upper continental crust or whether
Os is the result of weathering of organic-rich sedimentary rocks. For this
reason, a PI from the University of Maryland will develop the 190Pt-186Os
isotope system as a tracer of chemical input into the oceans by carrying out the
following research: (1) constrain the 186Os/188Os of the modern ocean via
analysis of young oceanic Mn-nodules and oxidized metalliferous sediments; (2)
constrain the average 186Os/188Os of the continental crust via the analysis of
loess and freshwater Mn-concretions from a variety of locations in the United
States, Europe and Asia; and (3) constrain the average evolution of 186Os/188Os
in organic-rich sediments via the analysis black shales from the Proterozoic
Chelmsford/Onwatin and Virginia Formations, Cambrian shales from the Hunan
Province in China and Devonian shales from the Yukon Territory of Canada. Once
these analysis have been completed and if any analytically discernable
differences are confirmed between the 186Os/188Os ratio of felsic crust and
organic-rich sediments, then the PI also will determine the evolution of
186Os/188Os in Cenozoic seawater via analysis of metalliferous sediments of
known age. &lt;br/&gt;
