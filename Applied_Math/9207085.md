This research involves three components: 1) macroscopic transport properties in
heterogeneous media and in complex fluid patterns; specifically, modelling
anomalous diffusion in random velocity fields with long-range correlations, such
as the Darcy velocities as observed in large-scale groundwater reservoirs or in
space/time- dependent velocities which arise in turbulent diffusion, ii)
determination of fluid permeability of porous media from indirect measurements
and the cross-correlation of various fields (electrical, magnetic, acoustic) in
a porous solid, iii) microscopic modelling of composite materials exhibiting
strong coupling among physical properties, such as piezoelectric materials.
Mathematical analysis and computer modelling/simulation will be used to study
models of physical or engineering interest involving heterogeneous materials. An
important component of this activity is training and working with graduate
students and post-doctoral fellows as part of the general educational program of
the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University.
