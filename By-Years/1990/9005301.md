Sodium transport across the cell membrane is a basic function that plays an
important role in several physiological functions such as fertilization,
regulation of pH, volume regulation and transmembrane signalling. Dr. Dixon
plans to use mature red blood cell from the dog which serve as an excellent
model to study both sodium ion transport and sodium ion exchange. The results of
the data collected here may provide information concerning the mechanisms of
several physiological processes related to transport pathways.//
