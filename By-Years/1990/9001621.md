This award will provide supplemental support to enable Dr. Frederick Bingham of
Scripps Institute of Oceanography to conduct collaborative research for 12
months with Dr. Yoshiaki Toba of Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan. They will
investigate interannual changes in the heat content of the western North Pacific
Ocean, and the relationship of those changes to variability in the Kuroshio
Current system. The oceans store heat from and release heat to the atmosphere
depending on the season. With increasing concern about changes in the Earth's
climate, it is critical to understand the mechanisms of heat transfer between
the ocean and atmosphere. Professor Toba's research group has been studying the
dynamics of air-sea interactions in the western North Pacific for many years and
their extensive, long-term data sets will enable Dr. Bingham to quantitatively
assess interannual variability in the heat content within that complex
oceanographic region.
