Linguistics is the science of language. The breadth of the fieldâ€™s applications
makes it vital to technological and medical advancements and economic
competitiveness in a global economy, as well as U.S. national security. In
addition, recent advances in Artifical Intelligence pertain to the robust use of
human language by computers, potentially impacting many aspects of daily life.
Given the multi-faceted importance of human language for the country, it is
crucial to devote resources to the introduction of this field to high school
students and to recruit the brightest minds in the country to pursue careers in
linguistics and language technologies. Currently, worldwide, linguistics and
language technologies are taught primarily in post-secondary education. This
project raises awareness of the value and significance of linguistics and
language technologies among young people under the age of twenty from diverse
demographic backgrounds.

This project consists of two events. The first is a training workshop for US
high school students who are competing in the International Linguistics Olympiad
(IOL). The training involves honing problem-solving skills on logical puzzles
that exercise pattern recognition and analytical reasoning and take hours to
solve. It also includes the building blocks of linguistics: phonetics,
phonology, morphology, and morphosyntax, as well as special topics such as
kinship systems, number systems, and systems of poetic meter and rhyme. The
second event is a planning workshop for the United States' annual high school
competition in linguistics and computational linguistics (NACLO, North American
Computational Linguistics Open competition). It focuses on how to meet the needs
of diverse high school students throughout the US. The target of the workshop is
metrics of diversity, plans for outreach, and plans for the future of NACLO
taking diversity into account.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
