The purpose of this research is to develop a realistic time- dependent
mechanical model of collagenous chains in ligaments, based on the measured
mechanical response of a larger segment of a ligament, that can be used to
develop global models for many different ligament morphologies. The mechanical
behavior of the collagenous chain will be described by nonlinear viscoelastic
models, and a computer program, that incorporates these material models and
global ligament geometry, will be written to predict overall ligament behavior.
This tool can be used to develop synthetic polymers that mimic ligaments,
thereby contributing to the field of biomimetrics.
