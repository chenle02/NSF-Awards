The Antarctic Meteorological Research and Data Center (AMRDC) project will
create an Antarctic meteorological observational data repository and archive
system based on an open source platform to manage data from submission to end-
user retrieval. The new archival system will host both currently available
datasets and campaign meteorological datasets deposited by other Antarctic
investigators. The project will also engage undergraduate and graduate students
in order to provide them with meaningful experiences that can translate to
several science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) career
paths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project targets four main tasks as a starting
point toward meeting existing recommendations and creating a more sustainable
Antarctic meteorological enterprise: 1. Designation of the Antarctic
Meteorological Research and Data Center (AMRDC), 2. Distribution of Automatic
Weather Station (AWS) observations on GTS in WMO BUFR format, 3. Establish a
steering committee for the AMRDC, and 4. Diagnostic case studies of Antarctic
meteorological events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
