The goal of this three-year project is to develop useful and precise definitions
of ‘representation’ and ‘inference’ for attribution to the brain. Representation
and inference are central notions in neuroscience, cognitive science, and
philosophy, but there is no widely accepted definitions of these terms, and each
of these fields would benefit from definitions in terms of neural activity. For
example, neuroscientists often describe neural activity as representing and
inferring. It is their way of describing the overall function of that activity,
an abstraction away from detailed neural recordings. But, because there are no
settled definitions, there are no objective grounds for these descriptions. As a
result, they are treated as casual glosses rather than as rigorous analyses.
Just as proper definitions accelerated progress in other fields, proper
definitions of ‘representation’ and ‘inference’ have the potential to accelerate
progress in neuroscience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will describe the
challenge of defining ‘representation’ and ‘inference’ in terms of neural
activity, survey potential definitions, and develop new definitions of these
terms that link them to specific kinds of learning, each with identifiable
neural correlates. It will then be shown how to attribute specific
representations and inferences to the brain. The results of this project will
contribute substantially to the philosophical foundations of neuroscience and
cognitive science, and thereby serve to advance these fields. They will also be
used in graduate and advanced undergraduate courses, and they will be published
open source.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
