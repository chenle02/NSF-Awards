The broader impact potential of this I-Corps project is a novel approach for the
treatment of oral inflammatory and ulcerative diseases in dogs and cats. As the
biggest challenge with inflammatory dental disease treatment lies in biofilm
reduction, anti-viral mechanisms, immune system modulation, and reduction of
inflammation, our solution tackles it all with economically feasible, easy to
use, and efficient technology. This innovation will stimulate stem cells to grow
and promote wound healing of damaged tissue by maintaining gingival mesenchymal
stem cells homeostasis. This novel approach for Feline chronic gingivostomatitis
treatment with the application of Lactic Acid Bacteria-derived metabolites and
exosomes combined with organic zinc nanoparticles and hydrogel in a formulation.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of treatment of periodontal
disease, which is the most common infectious condition in adult dogs and cats.
It is a progressive, cyclical inflammatory disease of the supporting structures
of the tooth and is the main cause of dental disease and early tooth loss in
both species. It affects over 87% of dogs and 70% of cats over three years of
age. This novel approach uses a hydrogel enriched with paraprobiotics (non-
infectious microbial cell components such as peptidoglycans, teichoic acids,
surface proteins, etc.) and lactic acid bacteria probiotics derived
biomolecules, so-called postbiotics (exosomes, enzymes, secreted proteins, short
chain fatty acids, vitamins, secreted biosurfactants, amino acids, peptides,
organic acids, etc.) enhanced with biologically produced zinc oxide
nanoparticles. This technology will help cats by reducing inflammation, dental
plaque, chronic pain, promoting tissue and cell regeneration, treating viral
infection, and improving wound healing.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
