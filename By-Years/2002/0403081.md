This award provides partial support for the acquisition of a laser scanning
confocal microscope to be housed in the Optical Analysis Center, a multi-user
facility in the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Alabama.
The instrument will meet the growing needs of faculty, students and postdocs in
the Departments of Biological Sciences, Chemistry, and Chemical Engineering. The
equipment will also support three interdisciplinary centers: The Center for
Biomolecular Products, The Center for Freshwater Studies, and The Center for
Applied Biological Engineering Research. The instrument will replace a 10-year
old scanning confocal which is now obsolete, and will allow in-house optical
analyses that currently require researchers to travel to the University of
Alabama, Birmingham, over 50 miles away. In addition, the instrument will be
available for collaboration and training of students and faculty at several two
and four-year institutions in western Alabama. The existing microscope will be
retained both to support needs for analysis using inverted optics, as a training
instrument for an existing graduate course in microscopy, and for research
training of undergraduate students.
