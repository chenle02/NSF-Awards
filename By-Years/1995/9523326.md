This proposal will study the effects of solar irradiance variations associated
with the solar cycle on global change, with the use of a coupled climate/middle
atmospheric model. The PI will investigate the potential impact that solar cycle
variations may have on the troposphere and the stratosphere and the physical
mechanisms by which any such impact occurs. The main focus, due to previously
gained knowledge, will be determining the temperature and wind gradients
resulting from realistic solar insulation and QBO changes, and their effect on
the generation, propagation and dissipation conditions for planetary and gravity
waves in the middle atmosphere and troposphere. Additionally, they will assess
the potential climate impact of the solar cycling phenomena when integrated over
entire solar cycles.***
