Models of relaxing derived from studies on skinned fibers and isolated proteins
must ultimately be tested on intact muscle. The aim of this proposal is to
measure relationships among events connected with reciprocal regulation by (i)
Ca2+int and (ii) cross- bridges. The fraction of attached bridges lags behind
the fall in Ca2+int and relaxation in intact cells. Cross-bridge attachment
itself may slow relaxation (Weber and Murray, 1973). Quick length changes cause
the appearance of extra Ca2+int in cardiac and barnacle muscle (Ridgeway and
Gordon, 1984), but not in vertebrate skeletal muscle (Fuchs and Wang, 1991).
Quick length changes will be applied to aequorin-injected frog skeletal muscle
to probe the relations among (i) Ca2+int, (ii) rate of relaxation, (iii)
stiffness, (iv) filament overlap, and (v) degree of activation (Cecchi et al.,
1986) The results will refine the concept that mechanisms underlying g muscle
relaxation are perceivably of more than one kind. The physiological importance
of dual regulatory mechanisms will be determined and the relative contribution
of Ca2+int and cross-bridges in reciprocal regulation will be defined.
