This project is to develop an instrument capable of measuring the concentration
of torpospehric HO2 directly using tunable infrared diode lasers. The proposed
instrument would use a novel multipass cell which maximizes the optical path-
length while minimizing the cell volume and therefore also the HO2 residence
time and wall loss. The Phase I effort will focus on testing a prototype
multipass cell and on choosing the best spectral region for monitoring HO2. This
evaluation will be based, in part, on HO2 pressure broadening coefficients which
will be measured in Phase I.
