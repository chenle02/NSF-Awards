The project expands upon its existing energy programs and distance education
expertise to develop a Nuclear Power Technology Program. Industry and technology
partners include the Energy Providers Coalition for Education (EPCE) and the
Council for Adult and Experiential Learning (CAEL). The project develops and
delivers nationwide the only online accredited Associate in Applied Science and
Certificate Program in Nuclear Power Technology. An industry advisory committee
works with the project team to develop curriculum for a competency-based program
with measurable performance outcomes. The team designs and develops fourteen
technical courses for flexible, online delivery. Through internal and external
assessment, the project continually evaluates the model in terms of student
learning, retention, performance, success and overall program effectiveness. The
broader impacts of the program provide opportunities for presently employed
personnel who are place-bound and are unable to attend classes in a traditional
setting.
