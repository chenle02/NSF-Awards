*** 9732622 Bartlett The JILA (formerly Joint Institute of Laboratory
Astrophysics) and the Department of Physics will conduct a summer "Research
Experiences for Undergraduates" program introducing 14 undergraduates to active,
on-going research. The 19 participating faculty are well-recognized contributors
to the fields of Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics, Gravitational and
Geophysics, Condensed Matter Physics, Elementary Particle Physics, and Nuclear
Physics. Approximately 60% of the students will be selected from colleges and
universities in Colorado and the contiguous states; 40% will come from the
University of Colorado. Special efforts will be made to solicit applications
from minorities. ***
