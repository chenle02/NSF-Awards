9705491 McCLELLAND Carnegie Mellon University is developing an interactive,
multimedia planetarium presentation about the human brain. The interdisciplinary
project team will build upon and refine the experience gained from its recently
completed planetarium show, Journey Into the Living Cell. The context for this
work is the need for increased public understanding of the human brain - an
organ central to the very concept of humanity. The understanding of the human
brain is located at the lively crossroads of research in many disciplines,
including psychiatry, psychology, neuroscience, computer science and biology.
The proposed medium to address this important issue is a 45-minute planetarium
show. A broad audience ranging from pre-adolescent to adult will be targeted.
Sophisticated and entertaining imaging technologies, including animation and
virtual reality, will be used throughout the work. Narration and sound will be
tightly integrated into the work. The hemispherical display surface of the
planetarium will be fully utilized both visually and sonically. Recent advances
in the brain sciences as well as long held understandings about the brain will
be presented. Basic brain biology and principles of brain function including
cooperativity in brain region activity and brain region specialization will be
introduced.
