This award will support Prof. Shi-Kuo Chang of the University of Pittsburgh in
a research collaboration with Prof. G. Tortora of the Universita di Salerno,
Italy. The principal objective of the proposed research is to investigate the
fundamental methodologies and theories of visual languages. In particular, they
propose to investigate the methodology for the design of a visual language
compiler, called the SIL-ICON Compiler. The SIL-ICON Compiler is a software
system for the specification, interpretation, proto- typing, and generation of
icon-oriented systems. The design of the SIL-ICON compiler is based upon the
theory of generalized icons. A generalized icon is an object with the dual
representation of a logical part (the meaning) and a physical part (the image).
By bringing together experienced teams of inves- tigators to combine resources
and talent, this international project has the potential not only to provide
insights into both the theoretical understanding of visual languages and visual
concepts, but also to furnish practical applications in novel user interface
design for database applications.
