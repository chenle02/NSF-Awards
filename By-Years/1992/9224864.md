9224864 Wood This proposal is on research to investigate enhanced plasmid
stability by using multiple killer genes. Enhanced plasmid stability can be
useful for a higher level of expression of recombinant protien products in E.
coli and for effective genetic engineering strategies for waste treatment and
bioremediation. The two main points to be examined include: (1) the role of
media composition and temperature on plasmid stability; and (2) the effect of
using two killer genes for enhanced stability. Experiments in both chemostat and
shake - flask cultures will be performed. In addition, some modeling will also
be performed. ***
