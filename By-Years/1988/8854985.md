Kentucky high school students with high ability-high potential, who have taken
biology and chemistry (10th or 11th graders), will be participants (20 per year)
in a five-week summer project at Western Kentucky University, Department of
Biology which initiates a research experience in molecular biology for the
following year. The goals and objectives are: (1) to increase the number and
nature of educational experiences for the participants, teach scientific
approaches and research methodologies employed in molecular biology; (2) to
provide career testing, counseling, planning and information on sources of
financial aid and scholarships; (3) to give participants "hands on" experiences
in defining research questions, designing experiments with controls, collecting
data, forming conclusions and communicating results. Attendees will be divided
into four groups. Members of these groups will each undertake research projects
with one staff member throughout the five-week summer period. Each group will
also rotate for one-half day for one week into each of the staff members'
research laboratories. Research activities will focus on several molecular
approaches including; DNA replication, molecular virology and DNA sequencing,
eukaryotic cell structure and function and the effects of metals on enzyme
activity. Students will be exposed to career development activities and be
involved in discussions concerning morals and ethics in science. Research
activities will continue through the academic year that the participants high
school in a follow up program involving the research staff.
