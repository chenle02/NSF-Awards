This action funds Travis Walter of the University of California, Berkeley to
conduct a research project, entitled "Forecasting building energy use for
efficient distribution," during the summer of 2012 at the University of
Kitakyushu in Kitakyushu, Japan. The host scientist is Professor Weijun Gao.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is an application of load
forecasting techniques to the design of distributed energy systems. Previous
research in the area of demand response has led to very useful load forecasting
techniques, but the design of distributed energy systems uses simpler models of
energy use profiles. This research includes more detailed building energy use
models in the computation of optimal distributed energy systems. It promises to
advance discovery and understanding by introducing techniques developed by the
demand response community to problems being solved in the distributed energy
community.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
