Abstract Powers

This is a proposal for partial participant support for the Third East Coast
Operator Algebras Symposium (ECOAS) to be held at the University of Pennsylvania
in Philadelphia on October 1 and 2, 2005. Funding is for full support for
graduate students and postdocs and partial support for speakers and other
participants. It is expected to have about 80-90 participants, including 30-40
graduate students and 10-15 postdocs. ECOAS 2005 will be the third meeting of a
conference series on operator algebras, noncommutative geometry and
applications. Operator algebras have evolved in the last 30 years to one of the
most exciting areas of mathematics. Within the subject, areas of very active
research include Connes' non-commutative geometry, Voiculescu's free
probability, quantum dynamics following the work of Arveson and Powers, the
theory of subfactors following the work of Jones and Popa, and others. Operator
algebras techniques have also led to discoveries in a priori unrelated fields of
mathematics and physics, including for instance the discovery of Jones' knot
invariant via techniques from the theory of subfactors, and the work of Connes
and Kreimer on renormalization theory. Major progress on the Novikov conjecture
has been made through noncommutative geometrical methods developed by operator
algebraists.
