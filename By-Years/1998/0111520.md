In this project funded by the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Hai-Lung Dai of the University of Pennsylvania will pursue a program
of research on the dynamics of highly vibrationally excited molecules. This
project will extend work on the detailed relaxation mechanisms and rates of very
highly excited systems to low temperature and will investigate the underlying
principles governing inelastic rovibrational processes across a broader kinetic
energy regime of the same high vibrational level. A second set of experiments
uses van der Waals complexes to study energy transfer from a highly
vibrationally excited molecule to a nearby cold molecule to gain insight into
different coupling mechanisms, super collisions, and energy transfer in
molecules excited at fixed energies. Techniques such as kinetic quantum beat
spectroscopy and time-resolved Fourier transform emission spectroscopy will be
used to correlate the inter- and intra-molecular interactions for both types of
experiment.

This work will assist in understanding a wide variety of collisional phenomena,
such as nucleation and low temperature reaction dynamics. As such, this work has
relevance to societal concerns such as more efficient combustion of fuels and
problems in atmospheric chemistry such as the formation and destruction of the
Arctic and Antarctic ozone holes.
