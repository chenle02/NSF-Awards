While students in this department were receiving a modern view of physiology in
their classrooms, their physiology laboratory experiences before the advent of
this project in many instances were quite inadequate. Many of introductory and
intermediate-level laboratories or projects were of a descriptive rather than an
analytical nature. Other physiology-related laboratories or projects employed
somewhat primitive equipment. A modern study of physiology even at the
undergraduate level requires considerably more sophisticated equipment and
methodologies than were available to this department. The objectives of this
project are to enhance the quality of the laboratory in several physiology-
related courses by moving the laboratory experience from the descriptive to the
analytical. With the new equipment and the new or modified procedures recently
introduced, students are able to make accurate collections of complex and
meaningful data and to analyze it in the manner of the modern physiologist.
Equipment includes a number of different transducers, and two multipurpose
minicomputers complete with the hardware and software needed to interface with
this equipment in a number of different configurations to study elements of both
plant and animal physiology. The grantee institution is matching the NSF award
with an equal sum obtained from non-Federal sources.
