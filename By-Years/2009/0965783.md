A mix of financially needy community college transfer students and beginning
graduate students including those in the Northeast Alliance for Graduate
Education and the Professoriate majoring in Computer Science, Computer Systems
and Chemical, Civil, Electrical, Industrial and Mechanical Engineering are
receiving annual scholarships of $8,000. A total of twenty two students,
approximately eighteen of whom are undergraduates receive support for two years
while three or four graduate students receive one year support with the
possibility of a second year. In many cases, the graduate students are those who
need some additional studies beyond those taken as an undergraduate to qualify
for full acceptance into a graduate program. The project builds on previous
CSEMS and S-STEM awards.
