This award supports the travel, housing and registration costs of 18 students
who would not otherwise be able to attend the 5th International Conference on
Autonomous Agents (Agents 2001) to be held in Montreal, Canada, May 28- June 1,
2001. This conference is the premier conference on agent technology and will
have associated with it many tutorials, workshops and other events given by
leading researchers in this field. One valuable part of student training is
participation in the excitement of an international conference where major
researchers present their work and engage one another in dialogue. The goal of
this proposal is to enable students who are deserving but may not have the
financial resources available to attend. A committee of senior agents
researchers and conference organizers has been formed to select students based
on the following criteria: 1) those presenting papers or software systems; 2)
those presenting in workshops or other associated conference forums; 3) those
demonstrating financial need; and 4) new students to the area demonstrating
benefit from attendance.
