The Department of Physics at Southern University Baton Rouge (SUBR) proposes to
carry out a comprehensive research and enrichment project for underrepresented
and eligible minority physics undergraduates. Referred to as the Timbuktu
Academy, this project is named after the University of Timbuktu, a bastion of
scholarship in the middle of this millennium. The Timbuktu Academy will enroll
and support twenty (20) physics graduates, seventy per cent of whom are expected
to earn Ph.D. degrees in physics and related fields. Research participation,
enrichment activities, and a stimulating academic advisement are central
activities of the Academy. The proposed activities are guided by basic tents of
cognitive science, the taxonomies of the cognitive and affective domains, and
recommendations from several national reports. About ten percent (10%) of
African American scholars who earned Ph.D. degree in physics, in the last five
years, are alumni of the SUBR Physics Department. Recent enhancements of the
Department's resources are added predictors of the expected success of the
Academy. Existing and future linkages and partnerships with federal, industrial,
and academic laboratories are essential factors in support of the operation and
expansion of this Academy for the development of research careers for minority
Scholars (RCMS).
