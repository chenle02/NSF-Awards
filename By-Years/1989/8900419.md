This is a collaborative interdisciplinary program (with Peter A. Wolff at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Francis Bitter National Magnet
Labotatory and Aaron Wold at Brown University) to study physics and crystal
chemistry of semimagnetic semiconductors, specifically manganese, iron, nickel
and cobalt- doped stannite crystals, II-VI compounds containing manganese and
iron, and manganese-chalcopyrites. Emphasis will be on large polaron effects in
stannites, metal-insulator transition, magnetism and novel states of mercury-
cadmium-iron-selenium, and crystal chemistry to determine how magnetic ions are
incorporated in covalently-bonded semiconductors. Experimental techniques will
include Raman scattering, magnetoreflectance, luminescence, magnetization,
susceptibility, electrical transport and nonlinear optics.
