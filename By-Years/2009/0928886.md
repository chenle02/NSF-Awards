The goal of this US-Korea-Japan research effort is to develop a transformative
framework for Wireless Smart Sensor Networks (WSSN) to monitor critical civil
infrastructure that builds upon a foundation of substantial existing
collaboration with our international counterparts. To achieve the project goal,
four principal tasks are defined: 1) Develop multi-metric and multi-scale
sensors and associated algorithms that are informed by the sensory perception of
biological organisms; 2) Implement a service-oriented architecture that will
result in modular, easy to maintain applications that can be adapted for
monitoring different types of structures and will manage the complexity demanded
by multi-metric sensing; 3) Develop a user-driven WSSN macro-programming
environment to facilitate the implementation of structural health monitoring for
critical civil infrastructure; and 4) Prototype and test the WSSN by
implementing the developed software in both laboratory and full-scale test beds.
The benefits of this approach include greatly improving the scalability of the
software development process, enabling multiple dynamic, context-aware
applications to run concurrently in a shared environment, and increasing
efficiency through global shared resource management across applications.
Successful completion of this research will accelerate the practical
implementation of innovative strategies for protecting our respective nations
infrastructure.
