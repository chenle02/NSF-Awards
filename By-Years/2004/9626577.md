Computing increasingly involves interactions between autonomous and
heterogeneous agents distributed throughout a network, agents that have been
designed separately, by different people, with little, if any, knowledge of each
other. For such disparate agents to work safely and harmoniously together, they
must be able to trust each other to observe certain unifying principles and
protocols. Unfortunately, in such an open system one cannot expect universal
voluntary compliance with any given principle. If required, such a principle
must be imposed on all components of a given system. A flexible, scalable, and
fault tolerant mechanism for imposing such principles and protocols over open
groups of distributed agents is being developed under this project. This
mechanism, implemented as a toolkit called Moses, is based on the concept of
law-governed interaction (LGI), under which all messages exchanged between the
members of a given group of agents are governed by an explicit, declarative, and
locally enforced set of rules, called the law of this group. Some of the the
potential applications of LGI are being explored. ***
