It is proposed to use an existing ion microprobe to analyze well-characterized
metamorphic rocks to determine (1) OH-F partitioning between coexisting hydrous
minerals, (2) trace element distributions in quartz as a function of variable
pressure and temperature; and (3) the feasibility of measuring oxygen isotope
compositions in single mineral grains. All of these projects will help
understand the chemical evolution of fluid phases and the interaction of fluids
and rocks or their constituent minerals during metamorphism.
