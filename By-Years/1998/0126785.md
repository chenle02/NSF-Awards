Geology (42)&lt;br/&gt;Digital technology has revolutionized all of science and
engineering. Nowhere has the impact been greater than Geosciences where immense
quantities of spatial data, common to the discipline, can now be collected,
manipulated, and analyzed using a powerful GIS. Digital mapping has grown from a
convenience to a necessity and it is imperative that students be exposed to this
technology at an early stage in their education. We are integrating digital
technology into a traditional Geology summer field camp curriculum by adapting
an inexpensive Pocket PC computer, GPS receiver, and widely available software
for use as a complete digital field mapping system. Our goal is to enhance the
basic skills necessary for fieldwork with digital technologies to bring students
to the forefront of the digital revolution. To accomplish this goal, we are
adapting existing exercises (Onasch and Frizado, 1996; Brimhall, 2000) and
developing new ones for our summer field course. This project builds on the
successes of our pioneering effort in integrating technology in a field course
funded by NSF six years ago. We believe the new curriculum is making fieldwork
more efficient and accurate, extending what can be accomplished in the field,
and reinforcing important concepts and methodologies. Our curriculum can be
implemented by other schools through the use of digital products of the project
including mapping exercises in GIS format, templates for various field
exercises, references sources in eBook format, and a roadside geology GIS, all
of which are available on CD-ROM or from our website.
