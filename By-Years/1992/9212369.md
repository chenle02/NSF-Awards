9212369 Reed We propose to develop a portable tool set to explore the design
space for scalable input/output systems. This tool set will take the form of a
user-level input library that will be portable across several parallel systems,
permitting a wide range of experimentation with modest human resources. These
input/output libraries will be invoked by user input/output calls and will rely
on the underlying system software for physical input/output. Interposing the
libraries between the application and the system software will allow us to
quickly experiment with a variety of data distribution and data management
algorithms. For example, local read ahead and write behind policies could be
implemented in the user-level library. Alternatively, we could explore
coordinated global prefetching policies coupled with distributed caching.
