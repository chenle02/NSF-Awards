This award to Morgan State University supports the 2020 annual conference of the
National Society of Black Physicists (NSBP) themed “Achieving the Vision – From
First Principles to the Future.” The conference is designed for students
(undergraduate and graduate), post-docs, faculty and other researchers. The NSBP
annual scientific conferences are part of NSBP’s plan to increase the pool of
African American physicists available in the academic pipeline and STEM
workforce. The goals of the NSBP Conference are to provide mentorship
opportunities, increase participant access to recruiters, offer networking
opportunities and inform the broader community in physics and related areas on
best practices based on the outcome of evaluation of the workshop. The NSBP
Conference directly addresses (1) the NSF’s 10 Big Ideas, including Future of
Work at the Human-Technology Frontier, Windows on the Universe, and the
objectives of NSF INCLUDES and (2) the recommendation of the American Institute
of Physics TEAM-UP report that professional societies work with funding agencies
to commit to achieving the goal of doubling the number of bachelor’s degrees in
physics and astronomy awarded to African Americans by 2030. The conference will
be held online on November 6-8, 2020.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
