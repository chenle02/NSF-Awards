The purpose of this project is to conduct an intensive two-year sampling program
of the fishes of Fiji. Data from this project will be combined with information
from previous collections to establish a comprehensive list of the species
present and provide information on the habitats of the species and
characteristics of the biological communities. Although Fiji lies within the
region supporting the most diverse coral-reef fish fauna in the world, its
fishes are not well known and estimates of the diversity of fishes inhabiting
the Fiji Islands are grossly underestimated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collecting
efforts will concentrate on reef and shore fishes, and include sampling in
reefs, mangroves, seagrass beds, mud flats, and rocky and sandy shores. In
addition to making collections using SCUBA at depths of 30 meters or less, a
pilot sampling of fishes will be conducted to a depth of 120 meters using closed
circuit rebreather technology. Specimens will be photographed in the field and
returned to the University of Hawaii for
identification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fish specimens collected will be
available for future systematic and biogeographic studies, and will provide
information on biodiversity, habitat specificity, and characteristics of Indo-
Pacific marine communities. An interactive, searchable database system on the
fishes of Fiji will be developed. The database will contain basic taxonomic data
for each taxon (authorship, location of type specimen, synonyms), major
references for identification, diagnostic characteristics, distributional
information, photographs, and listings of major museum holdings of specimens
from Fiji. A book on the fishes of Fiji is planned as a follow-up project.
