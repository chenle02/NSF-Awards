During the past decade it has been recognized that young stellar objects and
symbiotic stellar systems (usually binary systems) accrete matter from
circumstellar accretion disks. Torbett proposes to study this accretion and the
bi-polar outflow of matter that is observed from these objects. His numerical
modelling is based on the hypothesis that matter arriving at the star's surface
from the disk creates a shock, gives up its rotational kinetic energy, heats the
local matter, creates high pressures, and accelerates this matter along the two
polar directions. (Acceleration in the radial direction is prevented by the
arrival of new material from the disk.) This theoretical investigation will be
accompanied by VLA radio observation of objects with bipolar flows.
