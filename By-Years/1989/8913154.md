This proposal on "Analysis of the Tectonic Origin and Stratigraphy of the Bohai
Basin, between Dag Nummedal of Louisiana State University Baton Rouge (LSU), and
Mr. Xue Shuhao of the Research Institute for Petroleum Exploration and
Development (RIPED) of the People's Republic of China is sponsored by NSF. The
Bohai basin is a large Cenozoic basin in eastern China with up to 10,000
predominantly fluvial and lacustrine sediments. Despite extensive research on
the basin, the relationship between tectonics and sedimentation, and the
depositional environments remain unanswered. The purpose of the proposed joint
research between the RIPED and LSU is to address some of these questions. The
first phase of the proposed research would determine (1) tectonic origin, (2)
stratigraphy of the basin fill, and (3) depositional systems of the basin. The
second phase of the proposed research would employ the knowledge developed in
the first phase to: (1) develop criteria that may be used to differentiate and
identify what factors (climate, tectonics, sediment supply, base.level changes,
etc.) controlled sedimentation, (2) develop techniques which would allow modern
concepts of sequence stratigraphy to be applied to lacustrine rocks, and (3)
test existing models for rift or pull.apart basins. The major tasks of the
proposed research would be to: (1) construct subsidence curves in order to
provide information on the history of tectonics, base.level changes, and
subsidence in the basin and to provide a basis for interpreting lithospheric
structures and mechanics, (2) analyze the geometry of faults and fold in the
basin, (3) estimate the sense of motion along faults, (4) map the 3.D geometry
of depositional sequences, (5) interpret depositional environments, and (6)
evaluate the effects of tectonics, fluctuations in base level, climate, and
other factors on sedimentation. The data used to accomplish these tasks would
include well logs, core, and seismic reflection profiles.
