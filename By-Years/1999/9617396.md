In the United States, as in many other countries, the economic burden of public
entitlement programs has become a serious fiscal issue. Most notable is the
Social Security system which has been the focus of much recent attention because
of the current demographic makeup of the population. The prospect of the
retirement of the baby boom generation and the demands that will place on the
next generation of workers has caused many to question the basic idea that the
provision of retirement benefits should be based on a pay-as-you-go system and
regarded as an `entitlement`. This project will study the system of transfers
that are regarded as entitlements. It will treat these as problems in political
economy. The approach taken is to ask how a social security system and a
publicly funded education system can emerge as both a political and an economic
equilibrium in a competitive economy. Very little research has been done that
simultaneously analyses the general equilibrium economic consequences and the
political economy of social security. Understanding the interaction between
political economy of social choices and their general equilibrium effects is
important for understanding their welfare implications, for evaluating proposals
for transforming social security from a pay-as-you-go system to a fully-funded
system, and for evaluating efforts to decrease the public funding of education.
A dynamic general equilibrium model will be constructed with multiple
generations of agents, that capture the essence of the intertemporal choice
problem involved in saving for retirement.
