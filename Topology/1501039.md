The thirteenth annual Graduate Student Topology and Geometry Conference (GSTGC)
is to be held March 29-March 30, 2015, at the University of Illinois Urbana-
Champaign. This will be the largest GSTGC ever, with over 150 graduate students
from across the country at various stages of their careers expected to attend.
The schedule includes a broad range of talks: 24-32 graduate student 30 minute
talks on expository and original research topics in geometry/topology; plenary
speakers, Kathryn Hess (EPFL), Misha Kapovich (UC Davis), and Daniel Wise
(McGill); and six invited young faculty speakers, Anna Marie Bohmann
(Northwestern), Jeff Danciger (UT Austin), Jo Nelson (IAS), Vivek Schende (UC
Berkeley), Hiro Lee Tanaka (Harvard) and Jing Tao (Oklahoma). This conference
will include talks in many subfields of topology and geometry, including
hyperbolic geometry, geometry of positive curvature, global analysis,
3-manifolds, homotopy theory, symplectic geometry, dynamics, knot theory,
cobordism theory, category theory, Teichmuller theory, 4-manifolds, differential
topology, geometric group theory, algebraic K-theory, and more.

This conference provides a venue for communication among young mathematicians
from different geographic regions. Participants include graduate students at all
stages of their careers. This is one of the few conferences in topology and
geometry that is dedicated to graduate students. Student participants at this
conference have the opportunity to learn about cutting edge research, to refine
their communication and networking skills, and to establish collaborations with
peers. Geometry and topology are fundamental mathematical fields with deep
connections to many other areas of research, such as dynamical systems, physics,
computer science, and mathematical biology. This conference serves to foster
research and communication about research in these areas, and to enable and
encourage graduate students in these fields.
