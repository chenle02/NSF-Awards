This is a program of research and education centered on development of
efficient, formally verified CAD tools for high-level synthesis and codesign of
digital systems. The notion here is to develop CAD tools which are, themselves,
formally verified and guaranteed to synthesize correct designs. This eliminates
the need for designers to master application of formal methods. The aim is to
produce code running on an embedded processor and custom hardware on field
programmable gate arrays. The tools are designed to partition a design into
hardware and software components, to generate microprocessor code, and to do
high-level synthesis. Verification is done by providing semantic models for the
representation languages used in the system (behavioral specification, register-
transfer level description, gate-level circuit, machine code) and proving that
the tools produce designs whose meanings are refinements of the meanings of
their specifications. Theoretical and practical classroom courses which
compliment this research are being developed.
