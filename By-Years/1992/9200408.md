This program will bring ten undergraduate students to Hunter College of CUNY in
the summer of 1992, to be followed up with a once weekly academic year
experience which will be a continuation of the work begun in the summer. The
students will all be from underrepresented groups, and will be students at
Hunter or one of the smaller private colleges in the area. In addition to the
coverage of research topics, the participants will be provided with the
opportunity to visit several industrial sites during the program, and will be
presented with materials dealing with ethical issues in computer science and
engineering. The research topics include problems about the existence of
projective planes, about the existence of symmetric balanced incomplete block
designs, and about the existence of perfect error correcting codes.
