Genetic mutation can be caused by external mutagenic agents such as chemical
mutagens or radiation, or it can occur without the impact of external agents.
Natural mutagenesis due to transposable elements is understood primarily from
research in fruit flies; it results when a gene is affected by the movement of
another gene causing a change in phenotype. Activity of a Mariner element was
observable in Drosophila mauritiana as a high frequency of mosaicism or
speckling in the eye controlled by the Mos1 gene (Hartl, 2001). Although it
appears that many transposable elements have become silenced leaving an inactive
sequence in the host genome, the mechanism of regulation is not understood.
There are few models of natural mutagenesis apart from those in fruit flies.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to develop a new genetic
model for natural mutagenesis, focusing on understanding the mechanism by which
multiple spontaneous mutations of pigmentation (black eye, golden eye, et al.)
and patterning (striped eye) arose in a lineage of a moth, Heliothis virescens
(Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). While there are many possible mechanisms for this
phenomenon, this project will focus on one working hypothesis that each of the
various phenotypes is controlled by mutation in a corresponding gene. Each
putative gene will be purified while gathering physiological data on mechanisms
of altered pigmentation so that the mutations and any novel genetic mechanism
involved can be identified subsequently. This project bears the risks of
disproving the stated hypothesis; however, in that case this approach will
provide information applicable to an alternate hypothesis. The significance of
discovering a new type of natural mutagenesis if present will be in advancing
the basic science of eukaryotic genetics leading to scientific applications to
benefit society. Examples of present and anticipated applications of
understanding mutation include defense against genetic weapons and genetic
control of mosquitoes and other pests.
