The Tenth International Symposium of Odonatology, sponsored by Societas
Internationalis Ordonatologica, will occur at East Tennessee State university
during 6-12 August 1989. Approximately 100 biologists, representing many
biological disciplines but with a common interest in dragonflies (Insecta:
Odonata), are exprected to attend the symposium. This award would support the
travel expenses of several selected participants. Allocation of travel funds,
determined by a six-person Organizing Committee, will be directed toward active
researchers, both foreign and domestic, who would make particularly valuable
contributions to the symposium, but would be unable to attend without financial
assistance. The resulting exchange on current research topics will be a direct
benefit to symposium participants; and publication of many of the papers in
Advances in Odonatology, Volume 5, will provide a lasting record to benefit non-
participants.
