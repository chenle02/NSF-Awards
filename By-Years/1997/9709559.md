9709559 Naeem The composition of biological communities varies enormously over
most scales of investigation. Changes in community composition are especially
prevalent in small ecosystems where local extinction, colonization, and
biological invasion are commonplace, but large communities are arguably
experiencing such changes as well. How sensitive are community properties to
such variation in composition and can patterns be predictable? Although
communities exhibit a tremendous range of responses to even small-scale changes
in community composition, a diverse body of theory suggests that this broad
range of responses is predictable. This body of theory is based on the
compensatory abilities of species within trophic guilds and the distribution of
interaction strengths and the number of trophic groups in a community. The large
number of replicate communities necessary for testing this theory, however, has
limited empirical explorations. This research will use small analogs of
freshwater microbial communities reared under controlled environmental
conditions with sufficient replication to test this body of theory. Composition
is experimentally varied using both assembly and fixed-structure methods to
produce communities that contain 2, 3, 5, or 5 trophic levels with 1 to 5
species per level. Autotrophic and heterotrophic biomass will be measured as
community response variables. Three sets of experiments are designed to
explicitly assess the roles of compensatory growth and interaction strengths in
determining patterns in biomass distribution. This study will provide an in-
depth exploration of the interface between a specific set of theories and its
biological analogs. It will link experimental results with equivalency- and
uniqueness-based theory to predict patterns in the association of biomass
distribution with community composition.
