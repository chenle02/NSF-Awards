The proposed program is the area of applied and computational analysis to be
hosted by the Department of Mathematics and the Institute for Computational
Engineering and Sciences (ICES) at the University of Texas at Austin. The goal
is the creation of a model program in applied and computational mathematic that
will include enhanced undergraduate research experience (REU), reduced time to
graduation and stronger background in applicable mathematics for graduate
students, and the highest level of postdoctoral mentoring, all to be achieved by
curriculum and examination reform, new undergraduate concentrations, new
integrated seminar and working group series, summer programs, and an active
mentoring program.

The intellectual merit of the proposed work is based on applied and
computational analysis as the fundamental field that links mathematics to the
different areas of applications in the natural and social sciences and
engineering both within and outside of the university. Focus will be on non-
linear theory and computations of differential equations, which give the most
fundamental of mathematical models in science and technology from an applied
point of view. The need for young, well-trained mathematicians capable of
connecting to diverse areas of applications has never been higher. At the local
level, the proposed program will contribute towards the increase of the number
of students attracted to mathematics, and, at the national level, it will serve
as a model program for similar initiatives.
