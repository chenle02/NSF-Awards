This project will study the electric field variations in the polar cap as a
function of the interplanetary medium and the magnetic substorm activity.
Primarily, the work will center around the Sondrestrom incoherent scatter radar,
but will also entail coincident data from other ground based facilities and
satellite instruments. Two issues the proposal will address are: (1) the
influence that the interplanetary medium has on the polar cap electric field,
and (2) changes in the electric field in and near the polar cap during
substorms.
