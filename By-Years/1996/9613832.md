This research will analyze hundreds of flare events already observed, as well as
additional events yet to come as solar activity increases. The flare work will
measure plasma parameters such as electron spatial and energy distributions,
magnetic field strength, and ambient density in single or multiple flare sources
for a large number of events. The PI will obtained improved snapshot images from
both current and future burst data using a new spatial/spectral MEM algorithm,
hence obtaining improved spectra from which to extract these physical
parameters. In addition, he will study active regions as they rotate across the
disk, employing techniques such as stereoscopy and the spatial/spectral MEM
reconstruction, potentially giving the height structure of stable active regions
viewed from different aspect angles as the Sun rotates.
