Profound economic and social changes over the past two decades have put
enormous pressures on American cities and led to reorganization of local
political arrangements. Except for a few large cities, however, these changes
are uncharted and not well understood. Among the trends that have contributed to
the crisis in urban governance are: 1) the decline in public money available for
local development projects, 2) the consequent erosion of regulations supporting
representation of minority and neighborhood interests in development activities,
3) the rise of a variety of new social movements (e.g. environmentalism) based
on shared values rather than ethnic or neighborhood identities, and 4) the shift
of development decisions to non-electoral area. This research examines the
interplay of these trend in eight little-studies American cities since 1980. The
research is framed and interpreted in terms of urban regime theory and focuses
of differences in the nature, extent, and scope of interest representation
across different policy areas in these different cities over time. Aggregate
statistics will be supplemented with intensive interviews with political elites
and the leaders of local interest groups and associations. When completed this
research will provide a better understanding of contemporary patterns of
representation in American cities and help to identify the strengths and
weaknesses of alternative models of urban governance.
