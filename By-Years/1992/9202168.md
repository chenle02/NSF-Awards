This U.S.-Mexico award will support Professor Mark Spong of the University of
Illinois-Champaign in a research collaboration with Professors Jaime Alvarez and
Rafael Castro of the Centro de Investigacion y de Estudios Avanzados del I.P.N.
(CINVESTAV) in Mexico City. The proposed research will combine techniques of
nonlinear and adaptive control theory, including the control of nonlinear
systems with time delay, with detailed studies of the dynamics of robots and
teleoperators for the control of high performance manipulators. The primary
benefit of this collaboration will arise from the combination of the expertise
in robot dynamics and the experimental facilities at Illinois with the expertise
in nonlinear control theory, adaptive control theory, and the theory of
nonlinear time delay systems at CINVESTAV. The present research could have
important applications to work in hazardous environments, such as repair and
maintenance in nuclear plants, off-shore oil riggs, and undersea mining and
exploration.
