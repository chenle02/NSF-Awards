This is a fundamental study of the important ion exchange processes for protein
separation. Three major tasks are proposed for obtaining a complete
understanding of the kinetic and transport processes as well as the bed
dynamics. A novel differential bed is proposed for studying the ion exchange
kinetics. The primary systems in the study are amino acids and amberlite resins.
The major processes to be studied are elution and displacement chromatographies.
