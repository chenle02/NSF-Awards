In the Williams College SMALL REU program, for ten weeks each summer (nine in
residence at Williams and one at home), 20 to 30 undergraduates work on research
projects under the direction of a faculty member. There are usually between 4
and 6 groups each summer of various sizes. Topics will be drawn from algebraic
geometry, Bayesian statistics, combinatorics, commutative algebra, computational
cartography, computational geometry, CR structures, discrete geometry, dynamics
and ergodic theory, graph theory, hyperbolic manifolds, knot theory,
mathematical biology, mathematical physics, measure theory, minimal surfaces,
neural networks, number theory, parallel processing, particle collisions,
probability, random matrix theory, Riemannian geometry, symmetry groups, and the
topology of robotics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this REU is to introduce
undergraduates to the excitement and challenge of doing original research in
mathematics. In the process, students naturally learn a great deal of background
and are encouraged to present as well as publish their work, all invaluable for
graduate school. The variety of mathematical activities provides a rich
intellectual environment. Our nation needs a wider appreciation and
understanding of mathematics, and cannot afford to leave anyone out. We have
increased the numbers of women and under-represented minorities participating in
the program over the last five years, and we are continuing to look for new and
better ways to encourage applications from women, minorities, first generation
college students, and other under-represented groups. Students, faculty and the
broader mathematics community will benefit from the presentation and publication
of original research. Students will develop a lifetime network of peers and
mentors, and many of them will pursue graduate studies, partially because of
their REU experience. Almost all students publish papers in research journals
and many present their results at national and international research
conferences.
