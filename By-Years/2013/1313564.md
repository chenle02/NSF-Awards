This project team is working to develop a learning product that uses games and
animations to help students build a conceptual understanding of mathematics by
engaging them in discussion, problem solving, and understanding vocabulary in
context, moving beyond simple fluency in operations. The products, as well as
the development model that created them, differ from existing digital learning
products by offering teachers and students the opportunity to explore
mathematics at a deeper level using the Common Core Math Practices.
Additionally, these products are being developed in both English and Spanish and
are designed to be an alternative to the typical current models of drills,
practice games and "how-to" lectures.

The most immediate impact of the proposed activity would be to expand access and
availability of the learning products to a larger audience through partnerships
with both for profit and nonprofit groups. Through relationships with
publishers, school districts, and online distributors, more students and
teachers would be able to use product materials as a result of broader
implementation, national exposure, and shared distribution through online
portals. In expanding to a larger audience, this work has the potential to take
proven strategies for all learners nationwide, encouraging even more
underrepresented students to enter STEM careers or identify additional ways to
support this critical group of learners.
