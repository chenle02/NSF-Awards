This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop
printable, soluble conducting polymers that can be crosslinked using ultra
violet light. These printable, conducting polymers can be printed using
photolithography into thin films with 2-dimensional features ranging from solid
thin films for flexible displays to highly detailed features for printed wiring
boards and multi chip modules. These printed conducting polymers will also be
low-cost, flexible, lightweight and mechanically more robust than inorganic
electronics. Soluble, conductive polymers will be synthesized with functional
groups that can be crosslinked by a polymerization reaction induced by
ultraviolet light. Thin films will be cast onto substrates and then rendered
insoluble by the crosslinking polymerization under ultra violet light. The
kinetics of photopolymerization will be measured and optimized to maximize the
resolution of photoimaging for micron sized conducting features. An engineering
analysis will be performed to determine if the process conditions, printing
resolution and conductivity of our proposed conducting polymers is commercially
attractive for electronics applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercial
applications for printable conducting polymers include flexible displays,
printed wiring boards, multi chip modules, transistors, and light emitting
diodes especially when the combination of conductivity and the properties of
plastics (flexibility, mechanical stability, etc.) are desired.&lt;br/&gt;
