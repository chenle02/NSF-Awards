The conference on Witt Vectors, Deformations, and Absolute Geometry will be held
at the University of Vermont, 16 July 2018-21 July 2018. This workshop will
foster research interactions and will provide a setting for graduate students,
as well as younger and more established mathematicians, to learn of the newest
trends and interact with some of the most prominent researchers around the
world. The organizers will focus financial support on graduate students and
early career researchers to facilitate their
participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientific purpose of this conference is to
bring together researchers in several, disparate fields whose work is connected
to Witt vectors and their related constructions. These techniques are important
for extending deformation theoretic techniques to new settings and promotes
research activities at the interface of algebraic geometry, algebraic topology,
number theory, and applied model theory. A website for this meeting is
maintained at http://www.uvm.edu/~tdupuy/witt2018.html. The slides from the
conference will be posted there and left publicly
available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
