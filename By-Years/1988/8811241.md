This is the renewal of research on the principles and application of controlled
nucleation during alpha aluminum oxide phase transformation. It was established
that by controlling the nucleation of the reaction through the addition of
crystallographically similar substrates (i.e., seeds) upon which the reaction is
initiated epitaxially, the nucleation barrier to reaction is almost eliminated,
the incubation period for reaction is significantly reduced, the reaction time
and temperature are reduced, and the particle size is reduced. The current grant
includes the study of these principles on lead-based perovskites, lead magnesium
niobate and lead zinc niobate. The studies focus on the epitaxial relations
between the seed crystal and mixed metal oxide precursor, growth of the
nucleated perovskite as a function of transport path, microstructural evolution
and electrical properties. Polymeric sols will be used to study epitaxial
relations as a function of lattice mismatch and transport path. Seeded sols will
be used to determine transformation kinetics, microstructural evolution and for
preparation of specimens for evaluation of electrical properties. The materials
being investigated are used in the electronic industry for dielectrics. They are
difficult to synthesize with reproducible properties. The research under this
grant is relevant to new processing techniques which lower the processing
temperature, and potentially improve control of the structure. Training of
students with experience to perform research on these technologically important
materials is a significant component of the grant.
