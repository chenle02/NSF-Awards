Chestnut Hill College in partnership with Rohm and Haas has received NSF
support to improve hands-on science application activities in Delaware Valley
schools and to foster direct involvement of scientists in the improvement of
science education. The activities include (a) summer six-day internships for
teachers at Rohm and Haas, (b) follow-up to that experience to generate lessons
for students, (c) development of strategies to insure use of materials and
extension of the collaborative efforts. Fifty-four teachers will be affected, 18
each summer for three summers, by the project.
