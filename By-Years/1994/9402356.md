9402356 Chryssostomidis This grant supports a joint United States- United
Kingdom workshop focusing on the application of unmanned underwater vehicles to
the problems of pollution and global climate monitoring. Both countries have
ongoing research activities in all these areas, and the United Kingdom has
expressed great interest in a joint workshop. The two fundamental motivations
for international cooperation are to prevent research duplication, and to focus
resources on outstanding problems of mutual interest. The workshop will
establish a direct dialog that will determine the status of current research and
areas of mutual interest. Identification of areas fertile for US-UK
collaboration will be the highest priority of the workshop. A second objective
is to develop an in depth understanding of research in the UK in these fields.
