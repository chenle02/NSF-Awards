This award funds a postdoctoral research fellowship in plant biology for two
years. The project entitled "Analysis of Arabidopsis circadian clock" is to be
carried out in the laboratory of Dr. Steve Kay, at the NSF Center for Biological
Timing located at University of Virginia. This fellow has studied the electron
transport system of photosystem I in cyanobacteria for her Ph.D. With this
fellowship, she will gain research experience in Arabidopsis molecular genetics
in general and the molecular basis of biological clock in particular. The
postdoctoral fellowships in plant biology are designed to increase the number of
outstanding young investigators in plant biology.
