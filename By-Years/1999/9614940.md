9614940 Amemiya The Hox genes exist as highly conserved gene clusters within the
chordates. The protochordate, Amphioxus, has a single gene cluster, while the
mammals, birds, and fishes have four. The Hox genes play an important role in
embryogenesis, specifying developmental identities along the anterior/posterior
axis. Drs. Ruddle, Wagner, and Amemiya will determine by direct testing whether
intermediate forms such as cyclostomes and elasmobranchs have intermediate
cluster numbers and whether cluster duplication occurred once or several times
independently during Chordate evolution. They will also determine whether
different clades posses different Hox gene numbers, and if the loss or gain of
genes has been the same or different. Differences and similarities in Hox gene
composition will be correlated with the developmental status of the different
species examined. They will study particular Hox orthologous genes in detail,
especially examining similarities and differences in enhancer structure and
function on a comparative basis. By these approaches, they hope to better
understand the relationship between developmental regulation and evolutionary
process.
