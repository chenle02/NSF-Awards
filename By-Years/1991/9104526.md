Mangroves, a taxonomically diverse group of tree species that grow in the upper
intertidal zone of sheltered shores in the tropics, are characterized by
adaptations such as aerial roots and salt regulation strategies for this
stressful environment. Their close relationship with sea-level position renders
mangrove swamps particularly vulnerable to disruption by sea-level rise. This
doctoral dissertation project will study Hungry Bay, the largest mangrove swamp
in Bermuda. Hungry Bay is a key site in mangrove research because it has the
longest continuous mangrove peat sequence in the world and because it has
provided the first documented evidence of significant retreat cause by
contemporary sea-level rise. In order to increase understandings of the dynamic
impacts of sustained sea-level rise on mangroves, paleoecological and isotopic
techniques will be used to examine the record of the swamp during sea-level
rises of the last 5,000 years. Analyses of sediment budgets, water chemistry,
and productivity also will be used to monitor the water flow in creeks. This
project will provide valuable information about the ecosystem dynamics of
mangrove swamps, and it will increase understandings of how to manage such
ecosystems during predicted periods of increased rates of sea-level rise. This
project also will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar
to continue to develop independent research skills.
