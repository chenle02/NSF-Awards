In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Prof. Roger E. Miller of the University of North Carolina -
Chapel Hill will conduct experiments with his undergraduate, graduate and post-
doctoral research students to study a wide variety of chemical systems confined
to cold helium droplets. The nature of the cold droplets allows Miller and his
group to study a wide range of chemically interesting systems that would be
difficult or impossible to study by other means. Included in these studies will
be continued studies of hydrogen-bonded systems, highly reactive radical
molecule complexes, metal and semiconductor clusters, and small biomolecules.
Additional experiments will be performed with a powerful infrared pump laser to
investigate intramoleuclar rearrangements and bimolecular reactions. The results
from these very basic studies will be applicable to a wide variety of
disciplines from nanoscience to biophysics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the
broader impact of the research that will be performed, students trained in the
Miller group are given a very broad training across many scientific
disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;
