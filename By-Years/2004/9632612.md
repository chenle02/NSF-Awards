9632612 Wilensky The content area of the project is learning about "complexity".
Complexity is the study of systems in which phenomena exhibit complex behavior ,
the growth of a snowflake crystal, theperimeter pattern of a maple leaf, the
dynamics of the Dow Jones or of a fourth grade classroom. These are all systems
which can be modeled as composed of many distributed but interacting parts. They
all exhibit non-linear or emergent qualities which place them beyond the scope
of current K-12 mathematics curricula. The project goal is to make complexity
accessible to students through the use of object-based parallel modeling
languages (OBPML). Students build models of complex mathematical and scientific
phenomena from "scratch" as well as exending models they are given from a
library of "extensible models". Through these activities, the researchers seek:
* To understand how learners make sense of complex phenomena when engaged in
building object-based parallel models * To design computational tools and
activities that foster learner's in a) building models of complex phenomena and
b) building intuitive conceptions of complexity * To investigate the ways in
which learners engaged in this kind of modeling change their beliefs about and
attitudes towards the mathematical and scientific enterprises * To investigate
patterns in the kinds of symbolization developed by learners engaged in object-
based parallel modeling. OBPMLs afford a probabilistic and statistical approach
to modeling. One outcome of the project is a strengthened and broadened role for
probability and statistics in the mathematics and science curricula, combining
it with computational techniques such as Monte Carlo simulations - thus
developing a new subject area perhaps better called stochastics. In this respect
and others, we expect to develop new mathematical content areas - content areas
which live in an object-based parallel medium. ***
