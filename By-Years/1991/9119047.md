This supports a summer institute to study parallel computation, with the
purpose of strengthening the interaction of the theory and practical
communities. The institute, entitled Dartmouth Institute for Advanced Graduate
Studies (DAGS), will address in its first year, June 1992, issues and obstacles
in the practical implementation of parallel algorithms and the use of parallel
machines. The main session of the 1992 DAGS PC (Parallel Computation) will
extend for two weeks, with the option for certain participants to remain for a
more extended working period. The institute will be both a forum and a working
environment. The institute will also be interdisciplinary, with emphasis on
interdisciplinary involvement from within Dartmouth in the first year.
