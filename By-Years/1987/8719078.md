This project is to develop an efficient and practice-oriented analytical
approaches, for the seismic analysis of secondary systems including the effects
of the slab and wall flexibilities. The approaches are based on the synthesis of
modes of the flexible components and be implemented on micro-computer work
stations. The effort is expected to impact the quality of the design of
subsystems as employed extensively in the nuclear and other industries.
