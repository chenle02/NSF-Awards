The PI will address large-scale low-frequency phenomena that dominate tropical
processes and have sources either within the tropics or higher latitudes. The
principal phenomena of interest are the Asian-Australian monsoon and El Nino
Southern Oscillation and their component modes, all of which range in time scale
from intraseasonal to interannual. The PI proposes to focus on the following
four specific research themes:

(1) the monsoon as a coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomena; (2) monsoon
intraseasonal variability in a coupled ocean-atmosphere context; (3) mechanisms
by which the tropics influence the extratropics and vice versa on time scales
that range from synoptic to interannual; and (4) the variable nature of the
long-term relationships between boundary forcing and climate variability.

The work is important because it will lead to improved understanding of major
climate phenomena, especially the monsoon over a wide range of time scales.
