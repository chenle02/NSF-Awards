Ziegler, Susy University of Wisconsin, Madison The doctoral dissertation
research will explore the natural history of old-growth and second-growth
hemlock-northern hardwood forests in north central Adirondack Park, New York
state. Three objectives are pursued: 1. an identification of the species
composition, size structure, age structure, and disturbance regime of old-growth
and second-growth forests; 2. a comparison of the structural characteristics and
disturbance regimes of old growth stands with those traits of second-growth
forests representing different disturbance histories; and 3. a reflection of the
degree to which the Adirondack wilderness appears `natural` rather than shaped
by human activity. The study will provide valuable information on a specific
wilderness area and also will increase the resolution of data describing
disturbance regimes in this forest type in the northeastern U.S.
