Abstract ATM-9416662 D'Arrigo, Rosanne D. Columbia University Title: Tree-Ring
Data from Subantarctic Forests: Indices of Southern Hemisphere This award
supports a project involving the development of high- resolution, precisely-
dated tree-ring chronologies from the subantarctic land areas of Tasmania, New
Zealand and Tierra del Fuego and their utilization in the modeling and
reconstruction of indices of temperature and atmosphere-ocean circulation for
the Southern Hemisphere extratropical latitudes. This project will 1. develop
additional ring-width as well as maximum latewood density chronologies for
subantarctic forest sites; 2. extend the Tasmania- New Zealand paleotemperature
records further back in time through collections of subfossil wood material; 3.
produce chronologies from several additional tree species; and 4. continue to
model and reconstruct temperature and circulation indices for subantarctic
latitudes. The information gleaned from this project will improve our long-term
(centuries to millennia), high-resolution perspective of natural and recent
climatic variability for a region of the Southern Hemisphere with very sparse
instrumental and paleoclimatic data coverage.
