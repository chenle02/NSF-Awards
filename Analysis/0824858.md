Abstract Beanland

This proposal requests funding to continue the yearly meeting, Virginia Operator
Theory and Complex Analysis Meeting (VOTCAM), which has been held almost
continuously since 1992. The intention is to move the conference from the
University of Richmond to Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) for the next
three years, continuing the tradition of this extremely successful conference
while encouraging an up-and-coming academic research institution (and now the
largest university in Virginia), VCU, to engage analysts from across Virginia
and beyond. The broader impact of the proposed meeting is in establishing a
forum where researchers and graduate students can come together in a supporting
environment to share ideas and establish research contacts. VOTCAM allows people
from a variety of different areas of analysis - from traditional operator theory
and complex analysis to non-traditional applications such as quantum computing -
to learn more about the field outside of their own research area. VCU is an open
enrollment university dedicated to educating students of diverse backgrounds,
with a particular emphasis on first generation college students. This diversity
is reflected in the makeup of the undergraduate and graduate mathematics
students, many of whom will be invited to participate in the meeting as student
attendees.
