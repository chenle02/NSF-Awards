Professors Fletcher and Smyrl propose an organized study of the possibilities of
electrolysing hydrogen sulfide H2S (industrial waste) to produce hydrogen and
sulfur. At the present time no information exists on electrolytic systems in
which H2 is used either as a solute or a solvent. They paln to specifically: (1)
establish the stoichiometry of the reactions, (2) study the effects of mass
transfer limitations, (3) run the system at atmospheric pressure initially (but
are aware that they may have to alter this and run it at elevated pressures),
(4) look at kinetic and ohmic limitations at each electrode, and (5) investigate
the effects of electrode materials in electrolysing the reactions. The process,
if successful could result in the commercial utilization of a noxious waste as a
source of a chemical (S2) and as a fuel source (H2). The PIs are eminently
qualified to do the research and the facilities at the University of Minnesota
are very good. A 2- year exploratory effort is recommended at $73,718 out of FY
86 funds and $79,648 out of FY 87 funds.
