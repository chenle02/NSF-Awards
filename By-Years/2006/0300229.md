PI: Vadim Kaloshin, CAL Tech&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0300229&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed project consists of two main parts. The first part is investigation
generic properties of discrete dynamical systems (diffeomorphisms) on a compact
manifold. We apply Newton Interpolation technique to investigate bifurcations of
homoclinic tangency for 2-dimensional diffeomorphisms and, in particular,
Newhouse phenomenon of infinitely many coexisting sinks. Homoclinic tangency has
proved to be the most interesting feature of dynamics in dimension 2. The second
is investigation of instabilities of generic of Hamiltonian systems, primarily
using Mather theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enormous number of systems in the
nature and technological processes are described by ordinary differential
equations. Therefore, it is extremely important to understand long time behavior
and stability of trajectories of in some sense generic ordinary differential
equations. The first part of proposed project is an attempt to contribute to
understanding of complicated behavior of chaotic low dimensional systems. Motion
of plans, comets, and celestial dynamics in general are described by Hamiltonian
equations. The second part of the project is devoted to investigation of such
dynamics using primarily variational methods developed by many people and J.
Mather in particular.&lt;br/&gt;
