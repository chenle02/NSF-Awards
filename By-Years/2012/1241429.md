This CRPA award addresses the issue of multidisciplinary science and the
public's awareness of the ideas. The PIs believe that the prevalence of
multidisciplinary science is high and growing fast. Thus, the public and
particularly the younger generations need to understand these concepts and to
begin thinking in those terms. Thus, they will derive hands-on modules for three
age groups that are age appropriate. The project team includes 7 NSF funded
researchers who do multidiscipline-based research in biology, mathematics and
engineering.

These modules will be tested at the Boy and Girls Club of Dane County prior to
being exhibited at the Madison Children's Museum and the Aldo Leopold Nature
Center. Further, the local PBS TV station (WPT) will air some of the
demonstrations giving the project more visibility and impact. Each set of
modules designed for the three age groups shall be evaluated separately using
age specific goals and objectives.

The project is a collaboration between 7 scientists and engineers, the Boys and
Girls Club of Dane County, the Aldo Leopold Nature Center, the Madison
Children's Museum, and the Wisconsin Institutes of Discovery of the University
of Wisconsin.
