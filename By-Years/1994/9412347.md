9412347 Bachus The PI of this Equipment Grant proposes to purchase an OPTOTRAK
3020 3D Motion Measurement System to support research in bioengineering. The
equipment will be used in projects for measuring the 3 dimensional translation
and rotation of the spine. The goal of the research is to significantly enhance
the performance of implanted orthopedic devices. Measurements include the 3D
motion of vertebrae to better understand the effects of spinal deformities,
instabilities, and instrumentation on the spine. ***
