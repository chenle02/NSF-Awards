CDA 9529488 Hughes, Herman D. McKinley, Philip K. Mutka, Matt W. Michigan State
University CISE Research Instrumentation for ATM Networking The Computer Science
Department at Michigan State University (MSU) requested support to purchase
equipment for upgrading an existing research laboratory, the High-Speed
Networking &amp; Performance Laboratory (HSNP). HSNP was established in 1993,
with primary support from NSF and additional funds from the AT&amp;T Foundation
and MSU. This Laboratory supports a testbed that consists of Asynchronous
Transfer Mode (ATM) switches interconnected by fiber optics links to a
collection of SPARC-10 workstations. In order to serve the growing number of
faculty and students (both graduate and undergraduate) interested in
experimental research activities associated with the mission of HSNP, additional
equipment is needed. The equipment essential for upgrading the current
facilities to provide expanded research opportunities includes: (1) An ATM
traffic generator/analyzer, (2) OC-3 upgrade packages for existing ATM switches
and Interface cards, (3) An ATM SynOptics switch and Interface card, (4) A RAID
disk storage system, (5) ATM-related software, and (6) Advanced multimedia
workstations. This requested equipment will be used to enhance both the quality
and scope of on-going as well as future research in ATM technology (e.g.,
multimedia traffic modeling, traffic policing mechanisms, bandwidth allocation
algorithms, buffer management schemes, and admission control algorithms) and in
high-speed networking issues in distributed parallel computing, performance
analysis, and interoperability. The results of this research will contribute to
the development of ATM technology to support multimedia applications over high-
speed networks.
