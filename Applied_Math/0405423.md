Proposal: DMS-0405423 PI: Giovanni Leoni Institution: Carnegie-Mellon University
Title: Singularly Perturbed and Multiscale Systems

ABSTRACT

The central theme of this proposal is the application of modern mathematics to
materials science in order to study the macroscopic behavior of materials at
small length scale. The PI proposes the following specific studies:
Dislocations. Planned here is a variational formulation of the equilibrium
problem for a finite number of dislocations in a plane domain, and the
characterization of the energy content of a body with isolated defects in terms
of a regular function of the defect configuration, the renormalized energy.
Generalized Wulff shapes of second-phase particles and voids in the presence of
bulk elasticity. The PI plans to study the influence on corner angles of the
interaction between elasticity, surface energy and the corner regularization.
Elastic solid-state phase transitions. Planned here is the study of a higher
order variational model for the fine scale structure of twinning of two-phase
variants of martensite in the presence of an austenite-twinning martensite
interface. Micromagnetics. In the study of the microstructure of ferromagnetic
materials simplified models, usually derived by neglecting or simplifying
various terms in the micromagnetic energy, have been proposed in particular
regimes. The PI plans to study the complete micromagnetic energy in order to
determine the length scale and the fine geometry of the refinement, as well as
domain branching, that is, the separation of scales of the domain widths at the
boundary and at the center of the body.

Defects in crystals, microstructures, and phase transitions play a key role in
determining properties of materials. Thus, understanding their structure is
necessary in achieving desired material properties and optimized performance.
While electron microscopy and experimental activity have provided a great deal
of detailed information on structures, the integration of mathematical modeling,
analysis with experimental approaches promises to greatly increase our
understanding of phase transformations, ferromagnetic, ferroelectric and
martensitic materials, nanomaterials, thin films and self-assembled structures.
