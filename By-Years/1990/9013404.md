This grant supports the national Drosophila Species Resource Center, at Bowling
Green State University. The Center maintains and distributes approximately 300
species of Drosophila for the research community in the U.S. as well as foreign
countries. The Center also provides other services including identification of
specimens, assistance in culturing Drosophila, maintenance of reference
libraries, publication of catalogues of the collection, and support of visiting
scientists at the Center. The Center is considered an invaluable resource to the
biological research community at large as Drosophila is one of the most often
used experimental model systems in modern biology.
