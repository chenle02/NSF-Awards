9412393 Mileti This award is for renewed support for the Natural Hazards
Research and Applications Information Center at the University of Colorado. The
Center monitors and disseminates hazards research information to multiple users:
administrators, practitioners, policy makers, engineers, and scientists. The
Center publishes and distributes the Natural Hazards Observer to over 12,200
subscribers six times a year; operates an electronic newsletter, Disaster
Research; publishes monographs, working papers, bibliographies, and special
publications. It holds an annual workshop involving users and producers of
hazards research results, and it provides information on a day-to-day basis in
response to inquiries. The Center conducts modest research activities relating
to societal response to natural hazards and it supports researchers throughout
the nation as they carry out quick-response studies of specific disasters. In
addition to NSF, funds for this award are also being provided by FEMA, NOAA,
EPA, NIMH, USGS, and the Corps of Engineers. ***
