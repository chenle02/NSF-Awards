This research is an experimental program concerned with the nature of relaxation
phenomena that appear in supercooled liquids and glasses. Dielectric
susceptibility measurements over 14 decadses in frequency will be utilized to
investigate various aspects of universal behavior seen in recent experiments on
liquids near the glass transition. Specific heat experiments are planned to
search for similar universal behavior in the relaxation of the enthalpy.
Dielectric susceptibility measurements in the glass state will be used to
investigate secondary relaxation. In parallel, low temperature specific heat
measurements will be made to make a direct comparison with the secondary
relaxation data to check whether they can be related by current theories of the
glassy state. Computer simulations will be carried out in parallel with these
experimental studies.
