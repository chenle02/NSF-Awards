The history of research on phenylketonuria (PKU) provides a rich opportunity to
examine an array of critical ethical and social issues that arise in the
application of human genetics. Since the early 1960s, all newborns in the U.S.
have been screened for the genetic disease PKU which, if untreated, leads to
severe mental retardation and behavioral disorders. This screening program is
generally considered the greatest success story of applied human genetics.
However, its success is not unqualified. Because PKU screening has a relatively
lengthy track-record, it can provide a guide to the probable trajectories and
pitfalls of other screening programs. In particular, a history of this program
can illuminate why solutions to problems that involve the application of science
have singular appeal to the press, the public, and state officials; how even
controversial screening programs, once instituted, may be quickly routinized
and, once routinized, easily expanded for other purposes; how analyses of
benefit and harm may come to be framed in ways that minimize the latter; how
widely accepted ethical principles (as reflected in textbooks and in guidelines
issued by professional organizations) may cease to inform on-the-ground
practice. The project aims to provide insights of value both for policymakers
and for scholars in the fields of science and technology studies and ethics and
values studies. Its conclusions will be based on research in the scientific
literature, supplemented by archival work and interviews with individuals
involved in the early history of newborn screening. Through talks, articles and
a book, the investigator aims to reach multiple audiences.
