9453739 Riehl South Seattle Community College, Boeing Company, Eldec
Corporation, Clover Park Technical College and 12 other organizations will
develop a process for determining specific workplace standards for manufacturing
education and training in Washington State. These standards will, in turn, lead
to an industry-guided manufacturing technology core curriculum. The curriculum
will begin in high schools and will feed into a 2+2 Tech Prep post-secondary
community college program. A workplace-based internship will also be an integral
part of the curriculum. This comprehensive, innovative proposal has strong
support from both labor unions and industry. It will help bridge the gap between
secondary school technical education and the requirements of the industrial
workforce.
