This proposal requests renewed support for studies combining molecular
immunology, protein chemistry and recombinant DNA technology to ascertain the
properties of immunoglobulins of primitive vertebrate species and to identify
and characterize the genes specifying them with respect to rearranging elements
(Variable, Diversity, Joining and Constant regions), the multiplicity of these
elements, and their arrangement. Future studies will focus on: 1) completion of
the characterization of the genes specifying light chains in the sandbar shark,
Carcharhinus plumbeus; 2) characterization of the gene sequence and arrangement
for sandbar shark heavy chains, and 3) characterization of cyclostome
immunoglobulins and their genes. The immune response is a complex and precisely-
regulated defense mechanism that is present in all vertebrates. Antibodies play
a major role in the vertebrate immune response. The vast preponderance of
biochemical and molecular genetic studies of antibodies have been carried out in
man, mouse and rabbit, but very few comparable studies have been carried out on
primitive vertebrates. The goal of this research is to provide new information
on the rearranging elements of antibody genes in primitive vertebrate species,
sandbar sharks and lampreys. This information will enhance our understanding of
the origins of the genetic events underlying the fundamental recognition and
defense mechanisms of the vertebrate immune system.
