Virtually all of the work in continuous-time finance assumes that the prices of
securities follow an exogenously specified process. However, the prices of
securities are in fact determined day-by-day and minute-by-minute by the
balancing of supply and demand. A complete economic model of continuous-time
trading requires the derivation of the pricing process as an equilibrium
determined by more primitive data of the economy, in particular the agents'
information, utility functions, and endowments. The known results on existence
of equilibrium in multi-agent continuous-time financial markets are limited to
the case in which markets are dynamically complete, i.e. the available
securities either include a complete set of Arrow-Debreu contingent claims, or
it is possible to construct a complete set of Arrow-Debreu contingent claims
from the available securities. The assumption that the available securities
include a complete set of Arrow-Debreu contingent claims is highly implausible;
the assumption that one can construct a complete set of Arrow-Debreu contingent
claims from the available securities is highly endogenous, since dynamic
completeness is a property of the prices of the securities, not the underlying
data of the economy. Without equilibrium underpinnings, the economic foundations
of finance models are seriously in question. The main goal of the project is to
prove the existence of equilibrium prices in continuous-time finance models with
dynamically incomplete markets. The second goal is to explore the implications
of equilibrium for the nature of securities price processes.

This research is intended to provide solid economic foundations for continuous-
time finance. In particular, it will provide alternative pricing processes to
those which are currently studied in continuous-time finance; these alternative
pricing processes may provide a better fit to actual stock market data than
those currently in use. This research has the potential to benefit society by
improving the accuracy of pricing in securities markets. First, because the
research leads to specific predictions about the interaction of prices for
different types of assets, it should lead to more accurate pricing across
markets, such as housing, mortgages, stocks and bonds, which currently function
largely independently. Second, it should lead to more accurate pricing of
options in the situation where the exercise price of the option differs
significantly the current price of the underlying stock.
