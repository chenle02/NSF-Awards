"Advances in Level Set and Related Methods: New Technologies and Applications"

Principal Investigator: Stanley J. Osher

ABSTRACT

The level set method devised by Osher and Sethian in 1988 has proven to be
phenomenally successful as a numerical and theoretical device for representing
and analyzing the motion of curves in R^2 and surfaces in R^3. A level set
calculus has been developed, and recent extensions include the ghost fluid
method, convolution generated motion, dynamic surface extension, the variational
level set approach, and the motion of higher codimensional objects. Recent
applications include multiphase fluid dynamics, the island dynamics model for
epitaxial growth, level set based interpolation of unorganized points, and fast
methods in image restoration. This work was partially supported by our previous
NSF grants. The goal of this proposed research is to extend the technology and
the range of applications through the following two projects: (1) Convolution
generated motion for filaments. (2) Fast algorithms for steady state geometric
Hamilton-Jacobi equations and the induced motion of fronts.

The level set method is rapidly becoming the method of choice to simulate on the
computer a host of important physical, biological, materials science, image
processing, computer vision, electromagnetic and other real world problems. In
particular areas of nanotechnology will also be impacted. Improvements of the
numerical methods used to simulate these phenomena will ultimately be crucial in
the design of computer chips, analysis of explosions, recognition of objects and
many other areas of modern technology. This proposal addresses further
improvements of the level set and related methods.
