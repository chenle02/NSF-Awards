Furman University is directing a science-based scholarship program through the
NSF S-STEM funding mechanism providing 15-21 financial aid awards of up to
$40,000/student over a period of five years. The need for such a science-focused
initiative targeting South Carolina students from underrepresented minority
(URM) groups is acute, as enrollment of African-American students in public K-12
schools approaches 40%, but the annual number of Ph.D. awards in STEM fields
within this group is historically less than 5%. In this context, Furman has an
outstanding record of matriculating undergraduates from all backgrounds into
STEM-based graduate programs, and the SOAR (Science Opportunities, Activities
and Resources) Scholars initiative provides critical support for students for
whom the cost of attendance would be a hardship. A primary goal of this award is
thus establishing Furman as a financially accessible option to a larger fraction
of talented students, particularly those from regional underserved and/or URM
populations. Furman's S-STEM SOAR Scholars are students expressing intent to
major in Chemistry or Biology, recruited and selected based on financial need,
demonstrated academic merit, and outcomes from on-campus interviews. SOAR
Scholars are benefitting from a host of program activities including a mandatory
pre-college bridge experience offered immediately prior to the freshman year,
weekly interdisciplinary seminars, opportunities for science-based community
outreach through established programs directed at disadvantaged populations, and
guaranteed placement into (optional) on-campus paid summer research experiences.
Additional supporting mechanisms aimed at sustaining high rates of retention and
graduation among SOAR Scholars include peer mentoring programs, regular meetings
with permanently assigned secondary advisors, free on-campus tutoring and the
active participation of Furman's Office of Multicultural Affairs.
