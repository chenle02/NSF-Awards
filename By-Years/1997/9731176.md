9731176 Hart This project will develop technology in three areas applicable to
the search for extra-solar planets. A coronographic imager for operation in the
1 to 5 micrometer spectral range will be developed to be used initially with the
3.5 meter telescope of the USAF Starfire Optical Range (SOR), and later with the
upgraded 6.5 meter MMT of the University of Arizona. A novel concept for a high-
order adaptive mirror to be used with the MMT will be investigated. The project
will also modify an echelle spectrograph to provide resolution of ~200,000 to be
used with the SOR and the MMT to examine brown-dwarfs and massive extra-solar
planets.
