This project develops an automated microwave measurements laboratory used in
conjunction with a senior elective lecture course in microwave networks. The
bench test equipment is of industrial quality and is used by sixteen students
per session for ten weekly sessions. The equipment consists of signal
generators, computer controlled measuring instruments and passive microwave
components. This project provides students with "hands-on" experience in the
automated measurements techniques used in most microwave design laboratories in
industry. This laboratory experience enhances the students ability to function
as a contributor in the communications laboratory environment. The award is
being matched by an equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
