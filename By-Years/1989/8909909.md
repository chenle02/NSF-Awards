In prior work supported by the NSF, Professor Van Fraassen has examined the
possibility of an epistemology for science compatible with empiricism. He
focussed special attention on the tension between Bayesian and traditional
epistemological models of theory change and accommodation of evidence. He found
a possible form of reconciliation through the theory of a priori expectations of
future (posterior) probability distributions. Crucial to the view developed to
date the modeling of opinion through probability functions, but in a way that
allows for vague, qualitative, and comparative judgments of opinion, admitting
numerical probabilities only as a limiting case. Many relevant theorems
transpose easily from numerically precise to vague opinion, but many do not. The
aim of the project which Professor Van Fraassen is now undertaking is to develop
this indispensable subtheory.
