Millennials are now the largest generation in the American workforce, and their
influence on the economy is growing. This project investigates whether and how
employment practices in the finance and insurance industries shape where
Millennials want to work. Existing research suggests that practices designed to
make workplaces more hospitable to a varied workforce may be of particular
importance to Millennials. This research considers whether Millennialsâ€™
assessments of these practices influence whether they accept a job offer. A
critical component of the research will explore the challenges faced by various
demographic groups in the workplace, and the extent to which corporate practices
address their concerns. Findings from the project will help companies to attract
and retain a pipeline of young talent, who can fuel innovation and ensure the
health and longevity of U.S. industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will
conduct in-depth, open-ended interviews with 60 workers aged 23-37 in the
finance and insurance sectors in New York and North Carolina. From a set of
known initial participants, snowball sampling will be used to locate additional
respondents from varied backgrounds. Interviews will take place via telephone,
over the web, and in person. This project provides an opportunity to hire,
train, and work with students of varied backgrounds, who will assist with all
stages of the research process. The research will lay the foundation for a
better understanding of how young workers make decisions about where to work.
The findings will inform sociological theories of work and
aging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
