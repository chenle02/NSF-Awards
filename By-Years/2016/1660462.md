The award provides funding to support participation of primarily junior
researchers (postdocs and graduate students) in the meeting consisting of the
workshop ``Elliptic Curves, Torsors and L-functions" and the lectures by B.H.
Gross on the ranks of elliptic curves in the Distinguished Lecture Series
``Virginia Mathematics Lectures." The workshop and the lectures will take place
March 24-29 at the University of Virginia. The lectures by Gross will include a
survey of the Birch--Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture as well as very recent results
on the average rank for all elliptic curves over the field of rational numbers
and the arithmetic of hyperelliptic curves. The lectures in the workshop will
complement Gross's lectures by expanding into related areas of arithmetic
geometry and the arithmetic theory of algebraic groups. The meeting is sponsored
in part by the Institute of Mathematical Sciences at the UVA Mathematics
Department. &lt;br/&gt;The website is http://www.people.virginia.edu/~lww8k/work
shop/workshop.html.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rank is the most important but
least understood invariant of elliptic curves over Q. The recent work of M.
Bhargava, B.H. Gross, B. Poonen and others on `average' ranks marked a
breakthrough in the field by introducing the viewpoint of `arithmetic
statistics'; that is, studying the distribution of such arithmetic invariants.
The general methods of arithmetic statistics are applicable to many adjacent
areas of arithmetic geometry. The objective of the planned workshop at UVA is
precisely to cater to the intense interest in these methods from those working
on related areas, by bringing together experts on this topic with both senior
and junior researchers from adjacent areas of arithmetic geometry.
