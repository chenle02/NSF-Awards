Work will be done on problems in three areas of complex function theory. In the
first, the principal investigator plans to expand his work on zeros of entire
functions of bounded order. This work will follow up on his recent solution of
the Polya- Wiman conjecture concerning real entire functions with real zeros.
There is one remaining case where the order of the function is exactly two, and
this will be treated through the analysis of functions in the Laguerre-Polya
class. Work is also planned on analytic functions whose derivatives are square
integrable with respect to area. This is the so- called Dirichlet space. The
question of interest here is whether a univalent function is a multiplier for
his space if the area derivative of its derivative (squared) is bounded by the
lograrithmic capacity of the underlying set. A third research area deals with
conformal or Rieman n maps of discs. The goal here is to find geometric
properties of the target region to ensure that the mapping function satisfied
Bloch or Lipschitz growth conditions. Previous work on Holder domains should be
applicable to this effort. Applications of this research can be found in
potential theory, fluid flow and grid transformations for two dimensional
numerical approximations.
