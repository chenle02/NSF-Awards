Preliminary research leading to the development of monolithic complementary
pseudomorphic III-V compound heterjunction bipolar transistors on InP substrates
is proposed. The novelties in proposed approach are the use of two different
material systems for achieving optimum pup and npn HBTs on the same substrate
and the use of InP substrates which makes the proposed complementary HBTs
integratable with optoelectronic devices. During the time covered by the
Research Planning Grant, the necessary theoretical development that will lead to
guidelines for the design of the optimum complementary HBT structures will be
accomplished. Experimentation leading to the production of the complementary HBT
structure will be initiated with emphasis on the InA1As/InGaAs structure. In
addition, with material provided by the Naval Research Laboratory, in
Washington, DC demonstration of a functional pnp InGaAs/InAlAs HBT will be
accomplished. Although, initial efforts will emphasize InP lattic match material
systems, future plans are to expand to pseudomorphic layers in material systems
with more promising characteristics.
