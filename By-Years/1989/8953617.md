This project changes the educational experience for engineering students to help
the graduate develop the ability to integrate their knowledge with that of other
professionals in order to synthesize appropriate and innovative solutions to
multidisciplinary problems which require an understanding of the social,
cultural and economic questions involved. This is accomplished by three
distinctive student experiences: 1) An experience during the freshman year to
show engineering and technology development as integral activities of a modern
society; 2) a continuing study of issues in contemporary society emphasizing the
connected nature of human activities and knowledge; 3) a capstone design
experience involving teams of students and faculty developing proposed solutions
to real life problems and situations. The grantee provides funds for this
project that are more than twice the NSF award.
