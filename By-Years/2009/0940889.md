This award facilitates scientific research using the large, new, computational
resource named Blue Waters being developed by IBM and scheduled to be deployed
at the University of Illinois in 2011. It provides travel funds to support
technical coordination between the principal investigators, the Blue Waters
project team and the vendor technical team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
involves porting to the Blue Waters system and refining two quantum chemistry
codes, based on Quantum Monte Carlo techniques. The award will enable the
project team to evaluate whether, for problems in six target areas, the use of
these codes on Blue Waters is likely to lead to breakthrough science that cannot
be achieved on other, less costly systems or with other techniques. If this
seems likely, it is anticipated that the project team will formulate a detailed
research plan and request an allocation of time on the Blue Waters system so
that they can pursue this plan. The six target areas are: the simulation of
dense hydrogen and helium under conditions similar to those in the core of
Jovian planets; the electronic and magnetic structures of transition metal
compounds; phases and properties of fermionic atoms in optical lattices; the
calculation of adsorption energies and reaction barriers involved in formic acid
oxidation on platinum and platinum-bismuth nanoparticles intended for use in
fuel cell catalysis; a determination of the defect level of dopants in compound
semiconductors; and a simulation of liquid water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
target areas are important in astrophysics, materials science, chemistry, and
the development of more useful fuel cells and semiconductors. Students and post-
doctoral researchers will be included in the interactions with the Blue Waters
team.&lt;br/&gt;
