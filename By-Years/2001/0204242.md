Research is proposed on the specification and verification of computer programs
written in languages that provide a low-level view of storage and other
resources. This research will focus on novel formal methods for two particularly
crucial programming techniques:Shared mutable data structure - the use of
representations that may contain more than one pointer to a location that can be
updated by the program. These data representations will be specified in an
extension of predicate logic, called separation logic, in which the structure of
assertions mirrors the separation of storage into&lt;br/&gt;Disjoint components.
Embedded code pointers - the use of data representations&lt;br/&gt;Containing
updatable components that point to program instructions. &lt;br/&gt;Programs
using code pointers will be specified by using a reflection&lt;br/&gt;Operator
that allows code to occur within assertions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific
aspects of low-level programming to be investigated include&lt;br/&gt;storage
allocation, share-variable concurrency, and the relation&lt;br/&gt;between
specifications and tye systems.&lt;br/&gt;As a consequence of this research, it
will become easier to avoid&lt;br/&gt;errors in an important class of useful but
difficult computer programs. &lt;br/&gt;Eventually, it should be possible to
automate the logic so that programs in this&lt;br/&gt;Class can be accompanied
by machine-checkable proofs of their correctness&lt;br/&gt;
