The proposal calls for the study of atoms in optical lattices, which are
periodic potentials formed by the light shift in specific laser interference
patterns. The proposal is concerned with experimental studies of the quantum
motion of Cs atoms in optical lattices. This proposal will use ground state
atoms as a starting point for the generation and study of new quantum states of
atomic center-of-mass motion. It will study the propagation of atoms by
tunneling through the lattice in the presence of gravity, in obvious analogy to
the propagation of electrons through solids in the presence of an electric
field. ***
