Funding will be used to investigate the relationships of species of bee-killing
flies found in the New World tropics. The immature stages of these little-known
flies are internal parasites that eventually kill their bee hosts. Approximately
30 species of these flies are known, but there are estimated to be over 200
species actually in existence, many of which are undescribed and still to be
collected. In addition to using specimens already in hand, travel will take
place to Central and South America to obtain specimens of further species for
analysis. Molecular characters from nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences will
be used, as well as the external structure of adult flies, to hypothesize
relationships. The resulting phylogenetic trees will be used to examine host
choice and the distribution of host-attacking behavior among the fly species.
This research will be conducted by a collaboration of a museum-based
morphologist who is already actively working on these flies (Brown- Natural
History Museum of Los Angeles County) with a university-based, molecular
biologist (Smith- California State University, Bakersfield), allowing new
opportunities for both researchers and their institutions. This research will be
useful for its contribution to our knowledge of host-parasite interactions,
which are the key to biological control of insect pests. We will be involving
undergraduate students in our project, giving them valuable laboratory and field
experience that is rare at CSUB, an institution that does not have graduate-
level research. Finally, we will be helping to understand a little-known part of
the world's threatened biodiversity.
