The objective of the project is the development of a theory of "digitation".
Digitation means the movement of a grasped object by means of phased movements
of multiple, multiply actuated fingers. Physically, what is referred to here is
the kind of movement which a human being employs when continuously rotating an
object in one hand, when using a screwdriver, for example. In addition to
developing a theory of digitation, it is proposed to simulate implementation of
that theory. Digital simulation and animation techniques are used in support of
that effort. Digitation techniques are developed sufficiently to be ready for
implementation in hardware at the conclusion of the project.
