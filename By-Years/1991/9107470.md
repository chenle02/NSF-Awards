Sunlight significantly affects the heat or cold stress experienced by animals
in nature. Historically, biologists expected that heat gain from solar radiation
was largely determined by an animal's surface coloration (e.g., darker surfaces
acquire greater heat loads). Dr. Walsberg has demonstrated that mammals and
birds can alter heat gain independently of animal coloration. The current
project extends these previous analyses by quantifying the significance of such
adjustments for heat balance and energy expenditure of animals in their natural
habitats. Three species will be studied: (1) Golden-mantled Ground Squirrels in
which different populations differ greatly in coloration but manage to maintain
constant solar heat loads, (2) a contrasting case in which populations of House
Finches remain similar in coloration across wide geographic distances yet
adaptively alter solar heat gain, and (3) the Rock Squirrel which maintains the
same appearance over the annual cycle yet substantially increases solar heat
gain during cold winter months. This research should improve understanding of
the diverse functions performed by the insulating coats of animals. This work
will contribute substantially to understanding of the thermal stresses imposed
upon birds and mammals in nature as well as the selection pressures affecting
solar heat gain, thermal insulation, and visual communication. These studies
have potential practical implications because thermal and energetic stresses are
important problems in livestock production and because human clothing
essentially is an artificial substitute for the fur or feather coats of mammals
and birds. Understanding the mechanisms produced by natural selection in wild
animals and which adaptively adjust solar heat gain may provide useful insights
into properties that would be advantageous from an applied perspective.
