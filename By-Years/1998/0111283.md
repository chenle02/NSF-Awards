Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0111283&lt;br/&gt;D. Dunn-Rankin, U of Cal
Irvine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 10-kHz diode laser illuminator, a high-speed
digital camera, and associated optics and control software are acquired for use
in visualization in a variety of combustion studies. Among these are studies of
droplet streams and droplet stream flames, interacting droplet combustion, flame
control, and electrospray flames.&lt;br/&gt;
