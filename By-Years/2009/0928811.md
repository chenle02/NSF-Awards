Paine College, founded in 1882, is a historically black college (HBCU) located
in Augusta, GA, with an enrollment of about 900 students. The overarching goals
of the Paine College STEM Education Pipeline Project are to increase the number
of qualified, baccalaureate-seeking minority students in the STEM disciplines;
and to provide a seamless pipeline from high school to college to graduate and
professional schools or the STEM workforce for qualified minority students
interested in STEM disciplines. Proposed objectives and activities to achieve
these goals are curriculum revision, faculty development, and student
recruitment and retention. &lt;br/&gt;The curriculum revision component is to
enhance and update the content, activities, laboratory exercises and pedagogical
methods in gate-way courses in order to create a learning environment that is
stimulating, interactive, hands-on, as well as meaningful and useful for
students entering STEM disciplines at Paine College. The faculty development
component will provide STEM faculty with opportunities and incentives to become
more effective in the areas of teaching, student-learning, research, use of
technology, STEM curricular design, and the intersections of these areas.
Student retention activities are centered around tutoring, undergraduate
research activities, graduate and professional school preparation workshops,
internships and other activities to enhance STEM students' competitiveness for
graduate and professional programs in the STEM disciplines.
