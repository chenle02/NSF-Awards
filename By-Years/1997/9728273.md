9728273 Sharkey Heat stress decreases crop productivity and limits plant
survival and distribution, in large part by reducing photosynthesis. We have
recently shown that the chloroplast small heat-shock protein (HSP) protects
photosynthesis during heat stress and is important in acclimation of
photosynthesis to heat. In the present research, we will investigate how the
chloroplast small HSP protects photosynthesis by addressing the following three
objectives: (1) determine which photosynthetic protein interacts with the
chloroplast HSP, (2) determine which region of functional domain of the
chloroplast HSP is needed for protective function, and (3) examine the
functional efficiency of the chloroplast small HSP is species that differ in the
heat tolerance of photosynthesis. These studies will increase our understanding
of the effects of heat stress on photosynthesis and the role that HSPs play in
protecting photosynthesis at high temperatures. Such information will add to our
knowledge of how plants survive and adapt to heat stress and warm habitats and
will help in the bioengineering and breeding of crop plants for improved
thermotolerance.
