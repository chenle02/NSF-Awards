This is a study of sulfide in the oxygen-rich near surface waters of the North
Atlantic. The PI has found that contrary to predictions based on thermodynamics,
oxic waters do contain measurable quantities of sulfide. He intends to determine
its diel, seasonal, and vertical distribution, and to investigate its production
and consumption. These investigations will help determine whether or not the
ocean is a source or sink for hydrogen sulfide. Part of the significance of this
work is its bearing on recent theories of the planetary climate control
mechanisms. Andreae, Lovelock, Bates, Charlson and others have proposed that
reduced sulfur emissions from the ocean are a major source of cloud condensation
nuclei and thus are important in regulating the earth's albedo. Although
dimethylsulfide may be the major source of the reduced sulfur other sources must
be investigated. This project is such an investigation.
