Funds are requested to continue at Brandeis University a research program
involving the use of positron annihilation techniques in the study of solid
state physics problems. The topics to be studied are: 1) Fermi surface and
momentum density measurements in some metallic alloys; 2) The use of spin
polarized positrons to study ferromagnetic materials; 3) The continuation of the
graphite intercalate studies, and 4) Momentum density studies in high
temperature superconductors and in other highly correlated metallic oxides.
