This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2008
to Dr. Nathan G. Swenson whose research and training plan is entitled
Phylogenetic diversity and turnover in tropical forests: discerning the role of
ecological, biogeographic and evolutionary processes. The sponsoring scientist
is Dr. Stuart James Davies at the Center for Tropical Forest Science at
Harvard?s Arnold Arboretum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A growing paradigm in community
ecology is that through studying the evolutionary history of species
unprecedented insights can be gained into how biodiversity in communities is
generated and maintained. Although the number of phylogenetically-based analyses
of communities is expanding, currently lacking is an extensive broad-scale
integrative analysis of phylogenetic diversity and turnover across multiple
species rich communities. Further, few informatics tools have been developed to
carry out such research. The proposed research is filling this gap by developing
novel phylogenetic analytical tools and by integrating phylogenetic hypotheses
with a large tropical tree community data set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research
program also provides an opportunity to learn new skills and develop a novel set
of analytical techniques that broaden the Fellow?s range of scientific enquiry
using novel integrative analytical tools in order to refine an understanding of
how so many species can co-exist in communities. The broader scientific impact
will be in both ecology and evolutionary biology.&lt;br/&gt;
