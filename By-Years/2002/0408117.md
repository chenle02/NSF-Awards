Populations of migratory songbirds are limited by multiple environmental and
ecological factors. Events occurring on the wintering grounds, the breeding
grounds, and during migration all potentially affect their population size.
Currently, the ecological mechanisms that control populations of migratory birds
are poorly understood. Evidence based ecological correlations suggests that food
abundance may be the most important winter-season factor limiting populations of
migratory songbirds; however, no published experimental evidence exists to
support this hypothesis for migrants in temperate or tropical wintering areas.
Using the Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus) wintering in Jamaica, we are
investigating how experimental manipulations of food availability affect the
behavior, physiology, survival, and migration departure timing of a migratory
songbird. Based on estimates derived from these experimental and observational
studies, we will construct a simulation model to investigate how populations may
respond to climate change, which affects food abundance via patterns of changing
rainfall. Model predictions will be tested by correlating long-term,
continental-scale changes in Ovenbird populations, as measured by Breeding Bird
Survey data, with historical records of climate and vegetation patterns from
across the Ovenbird's winter distribution. We take a unique approach by using
simulation modeling to link small-scale, field-based experimental tests of the
mechanisms that limit migratory bird populations with well documented large-
scale changes in population size of a widely distributed North American
migratory bird species.
