The Einstein theory of general relativity predicts the existence of
gravitational waves, which are literally ripples of curvature in the fabric of
space and time that are generated whenever massive objects oscillate. Among the
best sources for gravitational waves are neutron stars, which are the remnants
of supernovae, the spectacular explosions that result when the cores of heavy
stars collapse after they have exhausted their nuclear fuel. After a few months
of cooling, the core of a neutron star is predicted to become superfluid, a
special state of matter that can flow with no friction and can rotate only by
forming a dense array of Ultra-thin vortices --- very skinny tornados --- that
thread the star. This project will develop computer-based models of the
oscillations of superfluid neutron stars and the gravitational waves that they
emit.

Because of the special properties of superfluid matter, the modes of oscillation
of a superfluid neutron star should be very different from those of an ordinary
fluid star. Consequently, the gravitational waves that are created from their
oscillations should carry a distinct signature of superfluidity. Suitably
advanced gravitational wave detectors should be able to extract this signature
from the gravitational wave data. Because of their extreme mass (on the order of
the same mass as the Sun) and compact size (about 20 kilometers in diameter),
neutron stars represent a form of matter that cannot be created in Earth-based
laboratories. Direct detection of gravitational waves thus allows neutron stars
to become, in effect, astrophysical laboratories for the study of matter under
the most extreme conditions.
