9711038 Billstein This is a 12-month planning grant at $49,997 to provide the
mechanism to work closely with many knowledgeable leaders involved in
professional development and teachers from these programs to develop a Teacher
Enhancement proposal to meet the teacher enhancement needs of teachers,
administrators and communities that seek to implement standards-based middle
grades mathematics instructional materials in their schools. In particular, this
planning grant will explore the enhancement needs for implementation of the
Mathematics in Context and Six through Eight Mathematics instructional
materials. A 3-day meeting of staff development leaders, the project staffs from
these materials projects, and the publishers will identify needs and priorities
for staff development of such materials.
