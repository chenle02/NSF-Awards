LOUGHIN DMS-9628643 The Department of Statistics at Kansas State University will
purchase a distributed statistical computing system with data warehouse
capability. The equipment will be used for several research projects, including
in particular: (1) A Permutation Test for Split Plot Experiments with a Single
Replication of the Whole Plot Experimental Units; (2) Maximin Clusters for Near
Replicate Regression Lack of Fit Tests; (3) A Bootstrap Approach to Likelihood
Ratio Tests For Joint Likelihood Ratio Ordering; and (4) A Procedure for
Detecting a Dominant Set of Cells Within a Multinomial Distribution.
