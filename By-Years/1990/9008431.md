This is a theoretical physics project to calculate some properties of matter at
extremely high temperatures (1010 times room temperature) and high densities
(1015 times normal). These conditions occurred in the early universe and are
recreated in particle accelerators that collide very large nucleii. One part of
the investigation will attempt to calculate scattering probabilities directly
from thermally- averaged correlation functions. A second part will investigate
the physical significance of the wave excitations known as quasiparticles that
can propagate at ultra-high temperature. These calculations will help test how
successful the so called, "standard model" of elementary particles is when
applied to extreme conditions. The standard model is a theory which has very
successfully described the behavior of the elementary particle constituents of
matter under non-extreme conditions. It will be very interesting if it also
succeeds at extreme temperatures and densities.
