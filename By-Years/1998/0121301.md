This NSF-CBMS Regional Conference in the Mathematical Sciences on `Numerical
Methods in Forward and Inverse Electromagnetic Scattering' at the Department of
Mathematical and Computer Sciences, Colorado School of Mines will be held June 3
to June 7, 2002. The principal lecturer will be Professor Peter Monk of the
Department of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Delaware. The theme of
his ten lectures will be Maxwell's equations, and methods for their solution.
This classical topic still offers many challenges today, especially as the need
to solve Maxwell's equations has increased rapidly in recent years with
applications including electromagnetic compatibility testing (to ensure
different components like a car generator and electronic control unit do not
interfere with one another) and safety (for example predicting the effects of
cell phones on users), as well as familiar applications such as radar.

Topics covered will include: variational methods for cavity problems; finite
elements and their application to cavity problems; coupling between finite
elements and boundary integral equations; perfectly matched layers; adaptive
methods; and methods for solving various inverse problems, such as locating
obstacles.
