The focus of this research is the use of boronic esters in asymmetric synthesis.
New chemistry which should be useful for convergent syntheses will be studied,
including a new type of allylic group transfer from one boron atom to another,
and connection of halo boronic esters to carboxylic ester enolates. Both of
these yield a new chiral center at the connection point, potentially with high
stereoselectivity. Cyclization of halo boronic esters will be used for making
four- and five-membered rings with chirality control. Intramolecular Diels-Alder
reactions using vinyl boron intermediates will be investigated. A mild method of
generating alkoxyborohydrides, discovered in the Principal Investigator's
laboratory, will be utilized as a route to new and inexpensive asymmetric
reducing agents. %%% With this Renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is
supporting the research of Dr. Donald S. Matteson of the Department of Chemistry
at Washington State University. Professor Matteson will focus his work on the
use of boronic esters in asymmetric synthesis as a general method for the
production of chiral molecules.
