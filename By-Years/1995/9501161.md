CTS-9501161 Hatton MIT The synthesis, characterization and applications of
acrylic polyampholytes consisting of neutral, acidic and basic blocks will be
studied. The polymers disperse as single chains at high pH, form stable micelles
at intermediate pH and precipitate at the isoelectric point. Polyampholytes of
selected chemical composition, architecture and molecular weights will be
synthesized based on group transfer polymerization. The micellization,
solubilization and adsorption of these polymers will be determination
experimentally and theoretically as a function of salt and pH conditions. The
applications of these polymers as solvents for contaminant removal from
industrial discharges, for groundwater remediation and in ion-exchange
displacement chromatography will be evaluated. The research may lead to the
development of new copolymers with applications in environmental and biological
separations.
