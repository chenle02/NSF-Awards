Active sensing for three-dimensional auditory localization&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed project examines the production, reception and processing of acoustic
signals for spatial localization in a dynamic environment. The research
described in this proposal utilizes the echolocating bat as a model system for
the study of auditory localization, with particular emphasis on the coordinated
operation between perception and action for the representation of three-
dimensional space. The echolocating bat produces ultrasonic vocalizations and
uses information contained in the returning echoes to determine the direction
and distance of objects in space. With this acoustic information, the bat builds
a three-dimensional auditory representation of the world.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will combine acoustics, behavior and modeling
to specify general principles of spatial information processing and orientation.
The big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus, an insectivorous North American bat that
produces frequency modulated (FM) sonar sounds will serve as the subject in
three inter-related studies: 1) Detailed measurements of the acoustic
information available to the bat for sound localization. This study also
examines how cues related to sound source direction and distance are ultimately
combined to represent an auditory object's location in three-dimensional space.
2) Behavioral measurements of the bat's active control over the direction and
volume of the sonar beam used to gather acoustic information from the
environment. This study aims to identify the active processes that contribute to
the bat's spatial orientation and tracking by echolocation, which shares
important principles with other sensorimotor systems. 3) Perceptual experiments
will measure the resolution of the bat's sonar receiver along the distance axis.
This study complements the acoustic measures of sonar signal direction and beam
width and the pressure transformation of acoustic signals at the two ears to
permit modeling of active sensing for auditory localization in three-dimensional
space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interdisciplinary work described in this
proposal holds importance to the public sector, contributing to education
(cross-disciplinary research and scientific training), technology
(teleconferencing and radar/sonar) and society (human factors). Furthermore, the
bat's motor control over the information extracted from three-dimensional space
presents a special opportunity to examine and develop models of action and
perception that bridge work in audition and vision. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
