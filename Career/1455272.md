Landslides, earthquakes, avalanches, wildfires, and financial crises are
examples of disaster events in complex systems. The aim of this research is to
prove theorems about mathematical models of these systems, with three particular
goals:

(1) Quantify the dependence of large-scale observations on small details. Which
details actually matter?

(2) Develop efficient algorithms to determine whether a given system will
stabilize and how long it will take.

(3) Examine the threshold state that precedes a large disaster event, and what
triggers the disaster.

While simulation is an important tool for modeling complex systems, the focus of
this research is on mathematical proof. A simulation reveals how a system
behaves, but a proof reveals why.

Many interacting particle systems have a phase transition between a state that
eventually stabilizes and a state in which activity persists forever. These
systems have a second level of dynamics, operating on a slower time scale and
driving the system toward greater instability, leading ultimately to a threshold
state in which activity persists forever. Until recently this threshold state
remained beyond the realm of rigorous proof, but it is now understood in a
particular case, the abelian sandpile in the limit as the initial condition
tends to negative infinity. Dr. Levine will leverage this understanding to
locate the activity phase transition in a wider class of models. This project
also has an educational component, whose goal is to encourage and enable bright
young people to pursue science and technology careers by providing them with the
working knowledge of probability they will need to succeed in those careers.
