Community detection is the problem of identifying community structure in a
network. With applications to fields such as biology, sociology,
telecommunications, and transportation, community detection is an important
question in network science. Community detection is a well-studied problem in
probability, statistics, and theoretical computer science, where the network is
typically assumed to be random. While there has been much research on community
detection in random networks, the standard probabilistic model is too
restrictive to model many network-science applications and cannot effectively
capture certain features of real-world networks: higher order interactions,
overlapping communities, and hierarchical structure.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The
project will advance the understanding of network science and network inference,
by studying richer, more expressive, and realistic formulations of community
detection that move beyond the standard Stochastic Block Model (SBM). Broad
goals include community detection in the hypergraph generalization of the SBM,
using tensor methods to find overlapping communities in hypergraphs, recovering
hierarchical community structure, and understanding the capabilities and limits
of simple spectral algorithms for many community-detection problems. Tackling
the above questions will involve developing new mathematical and algorithmic
techniques related to random matrices and random tensors, and bringing them to
bear upon problems in community detection. The project will involve graduate
student training and co-mentorship by the PIs across computer science and
mathematics, as well as outreach to middle- and high-school
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
