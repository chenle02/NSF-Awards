This research focusses on a specific model of design which can be summarized as
Design = Refinement + Constraint Propogation. The researcher hypothesize that
this model of design provides a proper structure around which knowledge-based
design aids can be organized. They will study the range of design domains over
which this model is valid and will also explore how best to build aids that
embody this model. Specifically, they will create knowledge-based design aids
for VLSI circuits and for mechanical transmission systems. As part of this
effort, they will also work on a software environment that supports the
development of knowledge-based systems for a number of domains.
