This award was provided as part of NSF's Social, Behavioral and Economic
Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships (SPRF) program. The goal of the SPRF
program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for
scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF
awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established
scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research.
NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the
scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its
research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an
important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each
Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance
their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Dawnie Wolfe
Steadman at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville, this postdoctoral fellowship
award supports an early career scientist investigating how forensic
anthropologists in post-atrocity contexts can honor diverse mortuary care
practices in their work while meeting the medical and scientific standards of
forensic science. For example, there is a model whereby a cultural
anthropologist acts as mediator between forensic workers and Indigenous tribes
who do not recognize Western medicine. While research shows that community
perceptions of proper treatment of the deceased is critical to reestablishing
social cohesion in post-atrocity contexts, the lack of systematic guidelines for
doing so leaves forensic anthropologists at risk of doing more harm.

To expand our understanding in this area, we will research how forensic
anthropologists in human rights investigations align diverse cultural
requirements for mortuary care with the application of medical and scientific
standards of forensic science. We will pursue two lines of inquiry: 1) forensic
capacity, specifically the integration of qualitative data into biological
profiling; and 2) cultural sensitivity, evaluating to what extent a victim-
centered approach used reconciles with the Differential Protocols being tested
by forensic anthropologists. By integrating traditionally qualitative data such
as oral histories and witness testimony into the forensic process, this research
will hopefully help lay the groundwork for the gradual establishment and
refinement of cross-cultural tactics for syncretizing forensic work with
localized mortuary care.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
