This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop
commercial uses for conjugates capable of exploiting cloned gene expression in
transformed plant cells to control their growth and physiology. The specific
goal of this project is to synthesize a series of new beta-glucuronide
conjugates of plant regulatory substances and to test these conjugates for their
ability to modify the growth and protein expression of specific tissues and
cells expressing the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) marker gene. Conjugates will be
assayed in tissue culture and in whole plants for the ability to cause localized
cell death in a promoter dependent manner. Such compounds will be of general use
for plant research on the control of development and gene expression and have
the potential to produce agriculturally important plant species in a reversible
manner, through the use of selective application of substrate and choice of
reporter gene and promoter elements.

The commercial application of this project is in the area of agricultural
biotechnology.
