This project permits undergraduate students in this institution's computer
science program to have a practical laboratory experience associated with the
study of operating systems. The equipment that supports the project includes
fifteen Zenith microcomputers running the MINIX operating sysytem. Using the
source code of this operating system, students gain a hands-on experience in
modifying the operating system. This award is being matched by an equal sum from
the grantee.
