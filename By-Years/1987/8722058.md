The George Washington University, through its Institute of Reliability and Risk
Analysis, will collaborate with the National Bureau of Standards and conduct a
"Conference on Uncertainty in Engineering Design". The aim of the conference is
to provide an opportunity for statisticians and engineers to discuss modern
statistical methods and their application to product engineering and process
design. The discussions will concentrate on five major topical areas which are
of prime importance today in the engineering and statistics communities. These
are: 1) achieving quality through design in manufacturing, 2) achieving quality
through design for chemical processes, 3) statistics in design for flexible
automation, 4) uncertainties in design optimization, and 5) statistical issues
in integrated circuit design and fabrication. The conference will motivate
important interactions among members of the technical community concerned with
improving product quality and industrial competitiveness of American
manufacturers.
