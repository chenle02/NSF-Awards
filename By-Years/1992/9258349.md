The primary thrust of this research is the development of processor
architectures which will be suitable building blocks for general purpose
parallel computers and the transfer of these architectural technologies to
industry. A second thrust is the investigation of highly specialized
architectures to address computationally intractable problems and the setting of
the architectural framework for the atomic level technologies of the next
century.
