This award will provide support for US participants, especially women, graduate
students, postdocs, and junior faculty, to attend the twenty-third and twenty-
fourth international conferences entitled Formal Power Series and Algebraic
Combinatorics (FPSAC), to be held, respectively, in Reykjavik, Iceland, and
Nagoya, Japan.

The continuing success of the annual FPSAC conferences stems in part from their
considerable interdisciplinary breadth -- linking leading researchers in
combinatorial mathematics with strong researchers in allied fields drawn from
pure and applied mathematics, theoretical computer science, physics, and
biology. The span of this conference series is unique among international
conferences with an emphasis on combinatorial mathematics. The principal topics
featured during the FPSAC 2011 and 2012 conferences will be algebraic,
geometric, and enumerative combinatorics. The emphasis will be on applications
in physics, biology, and computer science and on relations to other areas of
mathematics such as algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, K-theory, geometric
group theory, representation theory, and symplectic geometry.
