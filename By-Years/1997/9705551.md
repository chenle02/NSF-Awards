9705551 Badding This project explores the synthesis under pressure of novel
covalently bonded networks. The experiments utilize diamond anvil cell
techniques, to achieve synthesis at extreme pressures of 20 to 100 gigapascals,
and at temperatures from 4 to 3000 Kelvin, combined with in-situ and ex-situ
measurements of the formation and properties of new materials consisting of
covalently binded networks to include carbon nitrides and novel carbon phases of
graphite. An existing Raman system will be adapted for operation in the
ultraviolet region of the spectrum and used as an in-situ technique for
characterization. %%% Carbon plays a central role in science and technology as
exhibited by the present emphasis upon the class of materials variously referred
to as fullerenes and nanotubes. High-pressure and temperature routes to the
synthesis of other carbon based covalent networks will provide additional new
classes of compounds with spectacular optical, mechanical, and electronic
properties. ***
