9450361 Leitzell A workshop at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, on June 2-4,
1994, is open to teams of faculty from regional institutions with pre-service
teacher preparation programs. All teacher preparation institutions in the nine
state area of Nebraska, Colorado, South Dakota, Montana, Iowa, Minnesota,
Kansas, Missouri, and Wyoming are invited to send teams of four faculty, with at
least one in mathematics and one in mathematics education; other members of the
team may represent these areas or be administrators with interest in pre-service
preparation of teachers of mathematics. Sessions of the workshop address the
various roles mathematics teacher educators play in moving toward systemic
change in mathematics education. Of particular emphasis, both in selecting
participants and in organizing the content of the sessions, is the joint
responsibility mathematical sciences and mathematics education faculty share in
the pre- service and continuing mathematical education of teachers of school
mathematics. Working together these teacher educators can reshape in a powerful
way the undergraduate curriculum in mathematics and have a strong impact on
state policies regarding initial certification, the development of frameworks,
and programs for additional endorsements. Mathematics teacher educators also
need to play more visible roles in Statewide Systemic Initiatives efforts, State
Coalitions sponsored by the Mathematical Sciences Education Board, and state
affiliates of national professional associations. Workshop sessions feature
speakers as well as working groups of institutional teams. Speakers and advisory
committee members will be available as consultants. Participants develop a set
of planned activities to be undertaken during the 1994-1995 academic year.
During late spring and summer of 1995, the outcomes from these activities will
be collected, compiled, and disseminated to all participants and others
interested in the revitaliza tion of undergraduate mathematics education. ***
