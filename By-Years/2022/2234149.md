This project aims to take advantage of the latest developments in laser
diagnostics to develop a new scheme to measure heat transfers in complex flows
at an unprecedented resolution. This will represent the first demonstration of
the direct measurement of turbulent flow combined with temperature. The new
technique will provide a tool to shed insights into this important phenomenon
and will lead to the development of new models to improve the operation of many
processes. For example, the ability of a fluid to transport heat away from hot
surfaces directly affects the efficiency of many systems (e.g., solar panels,
nuclear reactors, computer chips, electric car batteries) or affect the drag of
moving bodies (e.g., naval ships, airplanes,
automobiles).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of the proposed work is to
take advantage of the latest developments in the design of molecular tagging
velocimetry (MTV) to further expand MTV to thermometry with the ability to
achieve time-resolved and spatially distributed sensing of heat fluxes in
turbulent boundary layers. The research will take advantage of the spectroscopic
nature of MTV to select dye and measurement schemes that enable the resolution
of the temperature field, instead of an inert dye. The addition of thermometry
to the MTV scheme will enable for the first time to measure temperature and
velocity fields in an instantaneous manner and at the smallest scales of
relevance for many industrial flows. The project will demonstrate the technique
in a locally heated turbulent channel flow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
