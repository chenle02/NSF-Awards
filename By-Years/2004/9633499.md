This project will analyze stable isotopes and CD/Ca in benthic foraminifera from
cores to be taken along a depth transect at 30degrees S off the coast of Brazil.
Samples of bottom water will be taken at each site and compared with the
composition of living foraminifera to verify the relationship of chemistries.
The best cores will then be analyzed to examine changes in water mass structure
over the last glacial cycle, with sampling close enough to resolve suborbital
variability. At issue is the linkage between northern- and southern-source water
masses.
