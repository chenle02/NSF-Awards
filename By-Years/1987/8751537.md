The Mechanical Universe and Beyond the Mechanical Universe is a one-year
college level physics course for national television that was developed at
Caltech and supported by a $5.8 M grant from the Annenberg/CPB Project. For the
past three years, the project staff which developed the undergraduate course,
have been adapting the videos for use at the high school level as well as
providing written materials and teacher guides. To date, 12 modules have been
adapted from The Mechanical Universe. This project will select the most
appropriate materials from Beyond the Mechanical Universe and adapt four modules
for use at the high school level. In essence, the majority of concepts and
topics treated at the secondary level will be covered. The four modules will be
selected from the following programs: "The Lorentz Transformation", "Velocity
and Time", "Optics", "The Atom", "Particles and Waves", "Atoms to Quarks", and
"The Quantum Mechanical Universe". The final selection of topics will be done by
the project staff in conjunction with the Council on Development. The Council is
composed of 12 outstanding high school teachers who will work during the summer
of 1988 and field test the materials in their home schools during the 1988-1989
academic year. In addition to the Council, approximately 60 other teachers
across the country are participating in the field testing and evaluation of the
program. This project is making a substantial contribution toward excellence in
physics instruction. Each module stresses conceptual understanding of the
underlying physical principles. The computer animation adds to the learning
experience in way not possible in the past. The current materials have been well
accepted by schools across the nation and evaluation reports underscore their
effectiveness.
