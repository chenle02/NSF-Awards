This Small Grant for Exploratory Research will support one summer of computer
vision research by Dr. Oliensis, a mathematical physicist, in collaboration with
Allen Hanson, Associate Director of the Computer Vision Laboratory at the
University of Massachusetts. Dr. Oliensis has discovered interesting qualitative
properties of the shape from shading problem, implying the existence of robust
algorithms for unique recovery of physical surface shape from gray scale
imagery. This grant will support software implementation needed for experimental
verification and for investigation beyond the restricted imaging models of the
current theory.
