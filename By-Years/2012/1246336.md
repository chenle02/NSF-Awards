Increasingly, researchers are addressing challenges of a scale and complexity
that defy the boundaries of traditional academic fields as well as the limits of
individual capacity. As new tools of inquiry based on advanced
cyberinfrastructure have become available, many previously intractable issues
have begun to be addressed by distributed, interdisciplinary teams of scientists
and engineers. This is a proposal to study how large scale cyber-enabled science
and engineering collaborations achieve success. It will primarily rely upon
observation and interviews with members of exemplary project
teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team plans to develop a novel,
exploratory, socio-technically informed set of outcome-based best practices and
evaluation criteria for large scale cyberscience. Research on the evaluation of
large scale team science is still in its earliest stages and has not considered
the broad range of potential success metrics and the long time frames required
to evaluate cyberinfrastructure projects. Such a framework could potentially
transform cyber-enabled grand challenge communities, radically improve the
ability to identify and assess categories of project impact across levels of
scale, and guide future development of appropriate cyberinfrastructure tools.
