This project is focused on developing useful new catalytic ring forming
reactions. A detailed plan is put forth to utilize mechanistic insights to
design new catalysts for the ring expansion of strained heterocyclic synthons.
The information gained from these catalyst design and development studies will
be used to build chiral variants of the optimal ligand frameworks. The resulting
new chiral catalysts will be used for asymmetric desymmetrizations and kinetic
resolutions. Concurrently, new and efficient synthetic routes for assembling
these heterocyclic synthons will be developed. This will be accomplished in one
pot by adding carbon nucleophiles to uniquely activated carbonyl electrophiles.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
Program is supporting the research of Professor Jon T. Njardarson of the
Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Cornell University. Professor
Njardarson's research efforts revolve around the development of new and useful
methods for building valuable heterocyclic frameworks. Successful advancement of
these new synthetic methods will provide access to a wide range of important
heterocyclic products, which will benefit researchers both in academia and the
pharmaceutical industry.
