This research seeks to examine the effects of family size (number of siblings)
on the social and psychological adjustment of adults. The objectives are to look
at the consequences of family size for a range of variables, such as individual
well-being, leisure time, achievement motivation. Previous studies of the number
of siblings have tended to focus exclusively on its impact on cognitive
functioning and educational achievement. Thus this study constitutes a logical
extension of that work. The study will use data from a 1976 archive, consisting
of a national random sample of over 2000 adults. The project will contribute to
an understanding of the ways in which number of siblings affects adult
personality and adjustment, an important issue given the current declines in
family size.
