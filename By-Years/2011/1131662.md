This award provides student support for the Twenty-Second International Solid
Freeform Fabrication Symposium to be held August 8-10, 2011 in Austin, Texas.
The meeting is comprised of plenary and parallel session technical presentations
and a poster session. There is ample time allotted for informal interactions of
world-class researchers and students in formal meeting settings and also at
informal social events during the meeting. Approximately 150 persons will
attend, with approximately 50 of these participants being students. The two
"FAME" awards will be given for the third time. The first is a senior award
called the "Freeform and Additive Manufacturing Excellence" (FAME) Award. The
second is an award to recognize researchers early in their career, the Award for
"Outstanding Young Research in Freeform and Additive Manufacturing". There will
also be a special session on sustainability and additive manufacturing. The
conference will bring together world experts in the area to update and extend
their understanding of advances in the technology. All meeting papers will be
published in a conference proceedings to be distributed to all participants
including students. The award will support approximately 50 students.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference is a mechanism for transfer and
dissemination of knowledge and understanding in the field of additive, freeform
manufacturing. It is a model for advancing discovery and understanding while
promoting teaching, training and learning. The networking of world-class
researchers with students is strong. The meeting is a pinion for research
infrastructure. Through the heavily cited proceedings, information is widely
disseminated to an extensive network of researchers and students around the
world. The societal impact includes identification of pre-commercial
technologies and sharing of information pertaining to freeform fabrication that
will eventually be developed and implemented into machines and processes that
will enhance domestic productivity.
