This technology will help mobile app developers do their due diligence and
easily scan their apps for any legal and security issues, thereby not only
protecting their brand, but also ensuring the security and privacy of end users.
The technology also preserves the open-source software ecosystem, by enabling
mobile app developers to proactively scan their app and identifying any
inadvertent open-source license violations. Based on the reported results, app
developers can either comply with the licensing terms of the software being used
or switch over to a more permissive Open-Source Software
(OSS).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;App stores are quickly getting crowded, with
currently over 6 million apps. Therefore, app developers often rely on Open-
Source Software (OSS) to reduce the development cost and quickly bring their
apps to market. Unfortunately, careless use of OSS can introduce severe legal
and security risks. If ignored, such risks can not only jeopardize the security
and privacy of end users, but also cause high financial losses to businesses
owning such apps and damage their brand. However, tracking all OSS components,
their versions, and inter-dependencies can be tedious and error-prone,
particularly if the OSS is imported with little to no knowledge of its
provenance. This problem is exacerbated by the esoteric licensing terms of these
OSS, as developers may lack awareness about the legal ramifications of their
use. The PI's research team has built a fully-automated software system that
analyzes mobile app binaries to detect usage of all Open-Source Software (OSS)
components being used, and report associated security and legal
risks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
