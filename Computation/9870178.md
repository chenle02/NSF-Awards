9870178 Lai This project concerns investigation of multivariate spline
functions. Bivariate and trivariate splines of smoothness r and degree d, will
be studied more carefully to enhance their computational efficiency which is
essential for applications in computer aided geometric design (CAGD) and
numerical solutions of partial differential equations (PDE). The PI will
identify the best spline spaces for these applications in the bivariate setting,
comparing the dimension of all spline spaces of a fixed smoothness, the number
of triangles of their underlying triangulations and their approximation power.
The PI will implement these best spline spaces when r=1 and r=2 for typical
applications in CAGD and numerical solution of PDE's, e.g., scattered data
fitting, filling polygonal holes, numerical solutions of linear and nonlinear
biharmonic equations. The PI will study the construction of compactly supported
orthonormal wavelets under H1 norm using bivariate splines so that the numerical
solution of the standard elliptic equations can be solved without inverting the
linear systems. Furthermore, the PI will also study the trivariate spline spaces
and identify the best one for the application in numerical solutions of 3D
partial differential equations, in particular 3D Navier-Stokes equations. Once
the best spline space for r=1 is identified, the PI will implement it for
numerical solution of PDE's in the trivariate setting. When computing with these
splines, multi-level and domain decomposition methods will be employed to
improve the performance of the computation.
