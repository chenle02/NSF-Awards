In this program in Experimental Physical Chemistry, Prof.Dunning (William Marsh
Rice University) will use molecular beam techniques to steer electrons loosely
attached to parent atoms into a chemically active environment. This permits an
unprecedented degree of control over electron catalyzed ionization reactions.
%%% Giant pseudo-atoms, up to hundreds of times bigger than those commonly
available, will be prepared by Prof. Dunning (William Marsh Rice University).
These atoms provide a powerful new source of electrons which Dunning will use to
understand the fundamental basis of reactions which involve electron attachment
and de-attachment -- processes which underlie an enormous variety of gas-phase
chemical processes.
