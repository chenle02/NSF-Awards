DMR-9510699 Heiman Strongly correlated two dimensional electron states based on
gallium arsenide are investigated in high magnetic fields using steady state and
time-resolved optical techniques and low temperatures. Investigations of
interest include study of the incompressible quantum liquid without perturbation
by valence band holes, study of the electron solid as well as composite
fermions, and the study of quasi-three dimensional electron systems with wide
parabolic quantum wells. %%% Electron states confined to the interfaces of
semiconductors exhibit unusual properties when investigated under conditions of
very low cryogenic temperatures and ultra high magnetic fields. These systems
have revealed new and completely unexpected behavior and continued studies are
likely to yield further insights into the properties of highly correlated
electron systems. Measurement of such properties is of intrinsic scientific
interest but also holds the promise for discovery of novel technological
applications. The current investigations coordinate the strengths of powerful
optical characterization techniques at ultra low temperatures with state-of-the-
art semiconductor materials preparation.
