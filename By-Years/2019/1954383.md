This proposal partially supports 26 students for their travel to attend the 2020
Real World Cryptography Conference (RWC) to be held in New York, NY, USA from
Jan. 8-10, 2020. RWC has emerged as a premier venue for the presentation of
ideas, advances and challenges from both academic and industrial cryptographers
and security researchers. The conference aims to bring better understanding of
real-world cryptographic issues to the theoretical community, helping to inform
their research and set new research challenges for the theoretical community,
and enables practitioners to develop a clearer view of the current state-of-the-
art in cryptographic research and what it offers to practice. The organizers
will prioritize student speakers, students from underrepresented groups, and
students from universities where research funds are not available. As such, it
fits closely with the goals of NSF's Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC)
program, which include applied cryptography and implementation of cryptographic
schemes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
