The primary objective of this project is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms
by which a cloned gene called Frt1 induces development of mushrooms (fruiting
bodies) in the woodrotting fungus Schizophyllum commune. Analysis of the protein
sequence predicted from the corresponding cDNA, and other data, indicate that
Ftr1 encodes a membrane- associated protein that functions through some form of
self versus non-self recognition and that its activity is influenced by activity
of the mating-type genes and a linked genetic element. These concepts will be
tested by the following methods:1) a tag to determine the location of FRT1
within cells. 2) Employ the techniques of in vivo mutagenesis to start
determining which parts of the Frt1 sequence are essential for activity. 3)
Isolate and start characterizing the linked DNA sequence which, in addition to
Frt1, is essential for fruiting this will be done using the method of DNA-
mediated transformation to test the sequences flanking Frt1 for their ability to
restore the fruiting phenotype in the appropriate Frt1 deletion mutations. 4)
Isolate and start characterizing an alternate allele of Frt1 by using Frt1 ,
and/or flanking sequences, as probe to a clone bank of an alternate strain of S.
commune. %%% Mechanistic concepts elucidated by studying genetic regulation of
this important developmental process in this relatively simple eukaryote should
be applicable to an understanding of similar processes in more complex, less
accessible organisms.
