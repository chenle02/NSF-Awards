9509945 White Density matrix renormalization group calculations will be done on
a number of quasi-one-dimensional systems. The density function renormalization
group technique is a new numerical method to obtain accurate results for single-
chain magnetic and electronic systems. The technique was developed by the
principal investigator. The tecnique can be extended to quasi-low-dimensional
systems by coupling single chains. Algorithms for this new computational method
will be developed to improve efficiency and to enable study of systems with
greater width. The focus will be on coupled Heisenberg and Hubbard chains. %%%
The primarily computational research will both improve an exciting new algorithm
and apply it to model systems which are thought to describe real materials of
current interest, e.g., high temperature superconductors. ***
