9353939 Vitz Two six-day workshops for undergraduate general chemistry teachers
will introduce participants to the LlMSport program, a cost-effective
implementation of computer data acquisition and reduction in the laboratory.
LlMSport allows direct data acquisition into a spreadsheet. Since standard
hardware and software (Lotus 1-2-3) are used, both the program and the
individual student experiments are easily shared. Faculty will have hands-on
experience with interfacing and an opportunity to adapt laboratory experiments
to the LlMSport format. ***
