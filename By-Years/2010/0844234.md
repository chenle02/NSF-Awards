This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
Program supports the research of Professor Jason Shearer of the University of
Nevada Reno to synthesize biomimetic metallopeptide and transition metal
complexes aimed at elucidating key questions concerning the coordination
environment and mechanisms of nickel superoxide dismutase (NiSOD). A total
synthesis of NiSOD in conjunction with a cell-free protein expression of NiSOD
and the native chemical ligation of NiSOD fragments are utilized to investigate
the properties of the metalloenzyme. NiSOD is a superoxide radical scavenging
enzyme which removes potentially toxic by-products in oxygen-metabolizing
organisms; it is implicated in a number of human diseases including cancer and
arthritis. Graduate and undergraduate students will be extensively trained in
chemical biology protocols as well as in computational techniques.
