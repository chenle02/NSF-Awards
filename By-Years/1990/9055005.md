The Oregon Museum of Science and Industry will initiate a six-week, residential
Young Scholars project for 20 students entering grades 10-12 in
Paleontology/Geology (10 students) and Fisheries/Freshwater Ecology (10
students). Paleontology and Fisheries Research Team members will work in the
field and laboratory. Both teams will be learning appropriate methodology,
discussing ethical and philosophical considerations, and actively engaging in
the on-going research activities of their respective research team leader while
also completing an independent project of their own. School year follow-up
activities will include attending a distinguished scientist lecture series,
additional student research, work with local scientists, and/or other
appropriate projects to be proposed by students in individual follow-up plans.
