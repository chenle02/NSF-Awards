This project will investigate the quaternary system, BaO-Y2O3-Cu- O, by
constructing sections of constant BaO content at different oxygen partial
pressures using a simultaneous thermal analyzer and quenching technique.
Compatible phases and melting relationships will be determined as a function of
temperature and oxygen partial pressure. Measurements of electrical resistivity,
critical current, and magnetic susceptibility with temperature will be followed
as a function of composition and state of oxidation of copper. In addition,
measurements of critical field and heat capacities will be investigated between
1 K and room temperature. Conditions for growing single crystals from melt as
well as conditions for synthesis and processing polycrystalline material with
the highest possible Tc will be established.
