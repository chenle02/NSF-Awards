9317980 Wootton This project investigates the effect of stream disturbance on
the length of aquatic food chains. Ecological theory indicates that food chains
should be shortened by disturbance, but preliminary observations suggest that
periodic winter scouring in northern California rivers may actually lengthen
food chains. The interplay of disturbance and trophic dynamics is investigated
by laboratory trials to establish susceptibility of key invertebrate taxa to
predation, field experiments to assess the effect of disturbance on the strength
of species interactions and of artificial scouring on the benthos and feeding
rates of predatory fish, and field surveys comparing the trophic structure of
regulated (low disturbance) and natural (high-disturbance) rivers. %%% This
research is important for several reasons. First, this is an ideal system for
testing (and revising) fundamental theories on the stucture of food webs and the
role of disturbance in community structure. The results of this study have
important implications for the effects of dam-release schedules and flood
control projects on the biodiversity and community ecology of rivers. Results
from this research will provide important information for stream and river
management and restoration. ***
