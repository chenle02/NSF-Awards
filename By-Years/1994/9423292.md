This proposal is for continuing research on coherence effects in quantum optics.
The research projects include new experimental tests to demonstrate the
violation of local realism without the use of Bell inequalities, experiments to
test the validity of the operational approach to the phase of a quantum field
and investigation of the elastic scattering component in resonance fluorescence
from a two- level atom and its possible use in some quantum interference
experiments.
