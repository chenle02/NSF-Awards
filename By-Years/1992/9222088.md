This award will fund Undergraduate Design Projects to develop custom software
and/or devices for persons with disabilities. This is a joint undertaking
between faculty/students at IIT and staff/patients at Marianjoy Rehabilitation
Hospital. The group will work on six projects per year and will provide written
reports on the projects completed. This type of undertaking is important since
not only will it provide meaningful projects for engineering students to
complete as part of their education, but it will also benefit a population where
customization is usually required to increase the usefulness of the devices
and/or software.
