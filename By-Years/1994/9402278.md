9402278 Bajaj In this research project the response of nonlinear systems to
nonstationary excitations is investigated leading to analytic relationships
between nonlinear system parameters and nonstationary response characteristics,
such as maximum response amplitude and timing of sudden jumps in amplitude.
These relationships are helpful in the design of vibration isolation strategies
for the dynamic characteristics of highly nonlinear systems, for example,
response of rotating machinery during startup and acceleration through critical
speeds. The research methodology uses a combination of the traditional
asymptotic nonlinear vibration theory and the recently developed dynamic
bifurcation theory. Amplitude characteristics of the nonlinear response of
single and multi-degree-of-freedom systems are investigated analytically, and
the results are validated experimentally using lightly damped beams subjected to
harmonic excitations. ***
