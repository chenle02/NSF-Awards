ABSTRACT FERNANDEZ &amp; RUSTAD DEB-9730110 Greenhouse gas emissions are
expected to increase mean global temperature by 3-5 C in the next 50-100 years.
The consequences of this warming for primary ecosystem processes are not yet
understood, and have become tile focus of an emergent field of ecological
research. This project will bring together a multi-disciplinary, international
group of scientists representing 22 soil/air warming sites from seven countries
to synthesize the current knowledge on the effects of elevated temperature on
terrestrial ecosystems. In addition, the participantswill use this forum to
discuss and launch a new GCTE Ecosystem Warming Consortium, which will have far
reaching effects in supporting and promoting future information exchange,
technology transfer, and synthesis efforts in ecosystem warming research.
