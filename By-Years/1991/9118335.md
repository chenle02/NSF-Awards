A multi-disciplinary project is proposed to determine how variations in
climate, dust flux, and lithology are genetically linked to soil-landscape
evolution on alluvial fans in desert environments. Important variables can be
examined because the study area contains an arid to semi-arid climatic gradient,
an independent record of Quaternary climate change and dust flux, excellent
chronostratigraphic resolution, and sequences of lithologically distinct
deposits (granite, limestone, mixed). The project objectives are to: determine
variation in rates of soil- geomorphic processes among different lithologies,
determine spatial and temporal changes in dust flux, climate, surface
permeability, and soil-water balance, and determine how changes in these factors
control formation of calcic soils. Soil-geomorphic properties related to spatial
and temporal changes in climate and dust flux will be documented through field
descriptions and laboratory analysis of soils, morphometric measurements of fan-
surfaces, and evaluation of soil and fan-surface hydrology. A novel approach of
this study will be to integrate empirically measured soil- geomorphic properties
with computer simulations of soil water movement and pedogenic accumulation of
carbonate. Isotopic studies of soil carbonate will provide additional
information concerning the timing and processes of calcic soil formation and
paleoclimate. Results will provide information for developing criteria for
recognition of signals of climatic change preserved in soil- geomorphic systems,
for evaluating the effect of climate change on the rates of soil-geomorphic
components commonly used for age estimations, and for developing regional
stratigraphic correlations to other Quaternary deposits in the southwest U.S.
