Drs. Parkinson and Smith at Harvard University will conduct a research project
in laboratory physics which will greatly aid our understanding of the makeup of
comets. These scientists will create molecular ions in the laboratory, they will
excite these ions to higher energy states, and they will measure the decay of
these ions back to lower energy states in order to determine radiative lifetimes
and absolute oscillator strengths for these molecular species. The
interpretation of molecular absorption and emission features in astronomical
spectra relies on the accuracy and completeness of laboratory data. Accurate
data such as oscillator strengths are necessary for the determination of
molecular ion abundances in the atmospheres of comets. Drs. Parkinson and Smith
will provide the required data on a number of species of ions known to exist in
comets.
