Dr. Hurt's proposed research on carbon formation in flames is designed to
establish a link between the carbon mesoscale structure (lying between the
atomic and macroscopic scales) and the combustion conditions. Experiments
involving specialized heat treatment techniques using rapid time-resolved
quenching on model carbons and precursors followed by sample structure
characterization are proposed. In addition models will be developed to describe
the mesoscale structures of the carbons and compared with the experimental
results. The PIÄ±s educational plan was considered innovative especially the
involvement of undergraduates in research. He has developed good relationships
with industry and national laboratories.
