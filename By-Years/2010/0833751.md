GreenFab is a three-year ITEST project designed to introduce low-income,
minority high school youth in New York and New Jersey to engineering and
technology skill sets that are used in the sustainable technologies industry.
This project builds on the success of the SoBRO TEC ITEST (05-25162) and targets
youth in the Hunts Point neighborhood of the South Bronx. Collaborators include
New York University's Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP) and
Sustainable South Bronx, which will co-facilitate classes in the NSF-funded Fab
Lab. Students participate in afterschool sessions and summer fellowships
designed to introduce sustainable practices, industrial design, and prototyping.
Activities enable participants to explore solutions to community environmental
problems using small scale manufacturing. Modules to be developed and piloted
for use in the afterschool sessions include: Green Machines, Sustainable Living,
Adaptive and Assistive Design, and Urban Sustainability. All modules incorporate
NETS Technology Standards, NSTA Science Standards, and 21st Century Learning
Skills. Engineers are invited each Friday from a variety of organizations
including the MIT Media Lab as well as recycling, metal fabrication, HVAC, and
similar industries to help students learn how the skills obtained in GreenFab
can be applied to a variety of green collar jobs and STEM positions. Finally,
summer fellowships extend student skills through the application of digital
technology, material repurposing, and critical analysis.
