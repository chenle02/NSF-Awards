This is an award under the National Science Foundation Program of Research at
Undergraduate Institutions. The research emphasizes the study of the effects of
hydrogen termination on the chemical nature of the surface of silicon single
crystals and on the nature of interfaces between the silicon and epitaxial
layers. The chemistry of the surface of the silicon will be determined using
x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, low energy electron diffraction, gas
chromatography, Auger electron spectroscopy, reflection high energy electron
spectroscopy, and high resolution electron microscopy. Training of undergraduate
students in physics and chemistry related to electronic materials is an
important feature of the grant. It is hoped that exposure of highly qualified
undergraduate students to research will encourage them to opt for a career in
teaching and/or research.
