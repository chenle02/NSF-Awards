The grant supports travel for graduate and undergraduate students to attend the
32nd IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME
2016), in Raleigh, North Carolina on October 2-10, 2016, which is the main
international conference in this Software Engineering research area. The funds
are to increase participation of qualified US-based students with attention to
for underrepresented groups. The grant gives students an opportunity to engage
in technical, professional, and social components of the meeting, which will
contribute to their formation as researchers in the field, will provide them
with feedback about their work, and will create and strengthen collaborations.
It will help build the next generation of researchers in the field.
