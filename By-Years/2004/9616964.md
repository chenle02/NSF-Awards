Jones, Thomas 96-16964 Dr. Jones will study the synchrotron radiation which
results from the relativistic plasmas ejected from the nuclei of active galaxies
and in the presence of a magnetic field. The research is a combined program
using numerical simulations as well as radio observations using interferometer
and single-dish mapping. The simulations will include the injection and
transport of relativistic electrons and will show the predicted signatures of
radio and x-ray emissions. Then very large radio galaxies will be observed with
multiple frequencies, producing the spectral shapes for comparison with theory.
Combining the theoretical and observational results should provide a check on
the current assumptions about synchrotron sources.
