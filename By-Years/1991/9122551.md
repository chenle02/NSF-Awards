A NATO International Scientific Exchange Programme Advanced Research Workshop on
the Use of Biomarkers in Assessing Health and Environmental Impacts will be held
in Portugal in June 1992. The objective of the workshop is to develop a
conceptual framework for the use of biomarkers in assessment of human and
environmental health; to review the current state of knowledge of biomarkers;
and to formulate the research needs for implementation and interpretation of
biological monitoring programs to define community health needs. This proposal
is to provide funds to permit more scientists to participate in the Workshop.
