The primary objective of the project is to develop a competitive research
proposal on "Larval Release Rhythms and Control of Egg Hatching in the Cardian
Shrimp Palaemonetes Pugio." Support of the project will assist a well trained
biologist to improve his research capability and to complete the planning and
development of a regular MRI proposal. The planning activities, if successful,
will significantly enhance the potential of the investigator to compete for MRI
and other research support.
