The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a suite of tools that can audit decisions made by neural
network/artificial intelligence (AI) systems as an audit engine. AI-based
decision systems can be cheaper and faster than human-based systems and have led
to explosive growth by companies using products like Facebook ads, the Netflix
movie recommendation engine, or Google translate. These AI systems are not
transparent and lead to an overall poor understanding of how and why they work,
as well as an inability to properly diagnose and correct errors. This opacity
prevents the benefits of AI from being realized in high impact or safety-
conscious systems such as medical diagnostics, self-driving transportation, or
quantitative finance. The proposed technology uses AI fundamentals in order to
develop tools to allow AI to be safely deploying throughout critical sectors of
society.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of neural network analysis
techniques as an audit engine to better understand how and why a neural network
makes a particular decision. The audit engine allows the technology to attribute
a decision among various architectural and training components, providing
increased understanding of the system and the ability to pinpoint necessary
fixes. Existing AI methods to explain decisions use a heuristic approach to
understand such information as feature influence, but cannot complete a
comprehensive audit of an artificial system. The audit engine also provides
internal metrics that can then be used as the starting points for a variety of
secondary analyses. In addition to commercial applications, the audit engine
analysis will benefit neural network researchers, who can more closely analyze
their neural networks.
