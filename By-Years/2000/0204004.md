This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) provides funds for an
examination of fluorescence as a means for identification of bacteria on solid
surfaces. A number of constituents common to all organisms, including several
amino acids and vitamins, fluoresce in response to ultraviolet or visible light.
Because the amount, duration and wavelength of such florescence should vary with
the exact composition of each organism, measurement of florescence could provide
a means to identify bacteria in the presence of other materials and distinguish
one type of bacteria from another. Using a synchrotron light source for
irradiation of bacteria at well-defined wavelengths between 170 and 700 nm., the
peak wavelength and time-decay of fluorescence by several, non-pathogenic
species of Bacillus and other bacteria will be determined and then compared to
the fluorescence of other particulate materials including plant pollen and clay.
The goal is to investigate the potential utility of fluorescence as the basis
for a device to detect bacteria on the surface of envelopes and other objects.
