The Tenth International Conference on the Electronic Properties of Two-
Dimensional Systems (EP2DS-10) will be held in Newport, Rhode Island from May
31-June 4, 1993. This conference is the tenth in a series and has the tradition
of providing a forum for lively interaction and discussion with strong
international participation. The emphasis of EP2Ds-10 will be on the fundamental
physics of the electronic states and phenomena associated with reduced
dimensionality (less than 3). The conference proceedings will be published in a
special edition of Surface Science. The subject matter of the conference covers
the following topical areas: *Nanostructures; quantum wires and dots; and
mesoscopic effects *Many-body interactions, collective effects, and Coulomb
blockade; optical spectroscopy of correlated states *Semiconductor
heterostructures, quantum wells, and superlattices; III-V, IV, and II-VI
materials *Integral and fractional Quantum Hall Effect and low dimensional
electron solids *Electrical transport in strained-layer heterostructures *Novel
fabrication techniques *Electrons on helium and cryogenic solid surfaces *Low
dimensional organic polymers %%%
