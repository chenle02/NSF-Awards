Materials are being adapted for the general calculus population, with which
students use computing to solve realistic open-ended mathematical and scientific
problems. The project will impact 700 students each fall, in contrast to the 100
select students currently served. The results of this project will serve as a
model for large scale implementation in other institutions. Laboratories are
equipped with workstations using Mathematica. A text is being written and tested
which significantly integrates technology into the course.
