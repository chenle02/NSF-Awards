9520821 MABRY This award will contribute support to the doctoral dissertation
research of a student at the University of Texas, Austin. The award will provide
funds for laboratory supplies for molecular sequencing and for travel to collect
plants within the United States. The study will investigate the origins of red-
violet pigment types (anthocyanins and betalains) in the plant order
Caryophyllales by superimposing this information for different families onto a
cladogram or diagram of relationships of families in this order of plants. This
cladogram will be derived from molecular sequence data for two regions of the
chloroplast genome (rbcL and ndhF) and will allow testing of hypotheses about
origins of the relatively unique plant pigment class of betalains. %%% This
award will contribute to the research training of a young plant systematist in
modern molecular systematic methods. The study should contribute knowledge about
relationships in the diverse plant order Caryophyllales and provide information
about the origins of betalain pigments. These floral pigments may constitute
important signaling systems to attract pollinators and knowledge about their
origins may prove important to studies of pollination biology. ***
