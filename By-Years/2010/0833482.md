Kapiolani Community College, University of Hawaii, recognizing that our
continued success is contingent upon building a formal and institutionalized
?STEM enterprise? and developing more engaged STEM faculty who can offer
compelling courses as well as mentor students in undergraduate research, the
College proposes to create the organizational, administrative and programmatic
excellence and infrastructure needed to support such an enterprise. Our long-
term goals, therefore, are to: 1) institutionalize, improve and sustain a formal
STEM enterprise; and 2) increase the number of STEM faculty engaged in producing
more Native Hawaiian and other STEM degree completers. This I3 project will
integrate faculty innovation within a formal, sustained, always improving STEM
Program tied closely to the strategic and long range directions of the College.
