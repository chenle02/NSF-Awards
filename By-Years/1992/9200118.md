This project will bring six undergraduates students to the Hope College Campus
for a ten week period in the summer of 1992. In this time, the students will be
provided with a research experience, and given the encouragement to pursue a
career in computer science research. Half the participants will be from Hope
College, and half from other institutions. A strong emphasis will be placed on
the recruitment of women and minorities. Areas for research include parallel
algorithms, neural networks, data communication, concurrent processing, voice
recognition, fractal growth and graphics algorithms.
