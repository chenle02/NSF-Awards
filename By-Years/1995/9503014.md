9503014 Rogerson This project consists of an investigation of the dynamics of
Natal Pulses and their influence on ring formation and retroflection with a high
resolution isopycnal numerical model. The study consists of two parts: (1) the
dynamics of growth and propagation of the Natal Pulse will be studied in a
limited-area domain; and, (2) the influence of Natal Pulses on ring formation
and retroflection will be studied in a two-basin domain that allows explicit
representation of the retroflection region. ***
