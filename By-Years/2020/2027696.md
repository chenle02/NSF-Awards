The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of an accurate, robust tool
for sampling airborne viruses, bacteria, fungi and other bioaerosols. Major
deficiencies with existing sampling technologies limit their broad utility in
fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, and the proposed technology could substantially
inform pandemic mitigation efforts. Customers for the proposed instrumentation
include public health professionals, epidemiologists, medical researchers
studying infectious and allergenic airborne diseases, homeland security and the
military, industrial hygienists, aerobiologists studying the microbiome of the
built and natural environment, and indoor air quality investigators. This
technology will have applications beyond the current COVID-19 pandemic.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop an urgently
needed diagnostic tool for investigating whether SARS-CoV-2 , the virus that
causes COVID-19, is present and transmitted as an aerosol, including as
submicron particles. Existing air samplers are grossly inefficient in capturing
particles smaller than 1 micrometer, and the sampling itself can damage the
cellular walls and destroy genomic material. The technology proposed has a
unique condensation growth tube (CGT) that collects and concentrates virtually
all airborne particles from 5nm-10Âµm and instantly preserves the DNA/RNA, making
it vastly more effective at sampling aerosolized viruses for genomic recovery.
However, conventional CGT samplers are too large, expensive, and difficult to
operate for widespread COVID-19 monitoring. This SBIR project will accelerate
development of a simple, low-cost, scalable virus sampler for broad deployment
by minimally-trained technicians. The project will fabricate several prototypes
and demonstrate their efficacy both in the laboratory and in sampling airborne
SARS-CoV-2 particles in key indoor locations such as medical facilities, nursing
homes and/or public transportation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
