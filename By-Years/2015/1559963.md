This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site program at Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute (RPI), entitled, "Bioengineering and Biomanufacturing",
will engage a diverse cohort of students in research projects with an
intellectual focus on engineering biological systems and biomanufacturing. A
combination of computational and experimental research will be conducted on
projects related to biomedical, chemical or biological engineering. The
development of engineered biological systems for medical, biotechnological or
chemical applications remains an important research challenge for a broad range
of applications. The proposed REU site will focus on both the research and
development that goes into developing new bio-based technologies and their
manufacture. The proposed integrated training experience will guide
undergraduate students, recruited from underrepresented groups from non-
research-intensive schools, through a research project; while also helping them
understand how they could pursue an engineering career. Cohort building and
inter-cohort interactions between REU students and graduate/high-school students
will be integrated into the program for community building and to provide
students with opportunities for mentoring and to serve as mentors to future
engineers and scientists. The programs' research results will be disseminated
broadly by the PIs, participating faculty, and students via scientific
publications, conference presentations, and internet-accessble materials.

Each undergraduate student will conduct research over a ten week summer
experience on a project that is designed for his/her abilities, under the
mentorship of both a faculty member and graduate student. The twenty
participating REU faculty have highly active, externally funded research
programs and include undergraduates in their research teams and as co-authors on
publications. Weekly workshops that address communication, ethics, mentoring,
and the nature of research will help the students gain professional skills and
personal confidence that are critical for their success.
