Surface chemical processes involved in the growth of II-VI semiconductors from
organometallic precursors are studied. Among the issues addressed are mechanisms
of surface reactions, structures of reaction intermediates, catalytic properties
of the surface, and sources and impact of carbon and other impurities
incorporated into the growing films. Techniques employed will include thermal
desorption spectroscopy, photoelectron spectroscopy, and high-resolution
electron energy-loss spectroscopy. Initial investigation focusses on the growth
of zinc oxide, zinc sulfide, and cadmium sulfide on substrates of silicon or
gallium arsenide, then progressing to homoepitaxial growth of these materials as
well as growth of zinc telluride and cadmium telluride. Metal-organic chemical
vapor deposition (MOCVD) and chemical beam epitaxy (CBE) are important processes
for the growth of thin films of compound semiconductors. In this study, basic
processes relevant to the application of these methods to the production of
films of II-VI semiconductors are studied. These particular semiconductor are
important because they form the interface that interconverts optical and
electronic signals.
