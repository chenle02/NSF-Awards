9711882 Keeling The project will continue Professor Keeling's 40-year
atmospheric carbon dioxide time series and his measurements of dissolved
inorganic carbon (DIC) and titration alkalinity (TA) of surface sea water at an
array of stations (a 13-yr record). The long term goal of this work is to
document how the carbon cycle is responding to human activities and to
variability in climate. As part of this science objective, the project will
continue to produce time series data on the stable carbon isotopic ratio of
carbon dioxide and DIC on the same samples of air and water, to identify impacts
on the oceanic and terrestrial carbon cycles. The stable isotope information
will be combined with laboratory studies to predict to high accuracy the partial
pressure of CO2 in sea water from DIC and TA data. Finally, the patterns in the
time series data sets will be compared to patterns observed in records of global
temperature and of the greenness of vegetation. This additional task is intended
to produce knowledge about the fluxes and storage of carbon in natural systems
and their relation to climate by detecting temporal and spatial patterns in
atmospheric CO2. ATM-9711882
