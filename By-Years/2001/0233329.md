This project is a laboratory study of a diverse set of atmospheric reactions
potentially important to odd hydrogen (HOx) and organic analog (ROx) cycling in
the troposphere and stratosphere. Initially, laboratory experiments will involve
direct detection of short-lived intermediates and weakly bound complexes by
isolating and identifying spectroscopic signatures. Reaction kinetics of these
various reactive intermediates will then be studied using a variety of sensitive
spectroscopic techniques and reactant flow systems designed to cover broad
ranges of temperature and pressure representative of the ambient atmosphere
(troposphere and stratosphere). Laboratory results will be combined with
theoretical calculations involving quantum mechanical and statistical-dynamical
computations. The broader impacts of this work include results that will be
important in gaining a better understanding of the oxidative pathways
controlling the oxidizing capacity of the Earth's atmosphere, and thereby
improve greatly our understanding of some important reactions driving
tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry. This project will also provide
laboratory research training for three graduate students and one postdoctoral
researcher.
