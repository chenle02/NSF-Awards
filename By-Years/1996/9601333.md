The history of science contains many tensions, but none is more engaging than
those between established mastery and inspired youth, between persons with
formal education and those who've taught themselves. Jonathan Horrocks was an
inspired young autodidact whose keen observations of Venus's transit across the
disk of the Sun corrected errors in Kepler's calculations. In consequence
Horrocks accurately predicted, contra Kepler, the transit of 1639 and (wtih his
friend, William Crabtree) became the first astronomer ever to observe a transit
of Venus. This new translation of Horrocks's Venus in sole visa, and the
associated commentary, will not only illuminate a crucial period in the history
of astronomy, it will also shed light on the spirit of scientific inquiry,
embodied in a young scientist of ingenuity and mathematical rigor.
