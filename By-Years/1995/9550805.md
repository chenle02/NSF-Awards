This project is setting up a development platform for embedded system design
projects that will use a real-time microkernel. The platform includes: a) real-
time microkernel software used in designing embedded systems ranging from small
single processor systems to network distributed systems; b) core hardware cards
that contain base hardware required for any embedded system development; c) an
In Circuit Emulator (ICE); and, d) 4-PC networked platform for hardware and
software development of embedded systems around the microkernel. Major use of
this equipment occurs in undergraduate student's major qualifying projects,
which in addition to being significant also provides the capstone design
experience required by ABET. The use of these components is based on the
philosophy of not starting embedded system hardware and software development
from scratch. Instead, tested hardware and software modules are used and reused
when possible so that the students can successfully undertake and complete
ambitious embedded systems projects. Additionally, using a microkernel provides
a systematic design methodology, experience with tools commonly used by
engineers in the industry, and a better appreciation for the interaction between
operating systems, device drivers, and the underlying hardware. The emulator
speeds up hardware and software co-design processes significantly. Having a
dedicated development platform for embedded system projects allows students to
efficiently share and access the equipment. Training and experience gained with
this equipment will prepare students to better tackle complex problems when they
join the industrial work-force, and will help in structuring a top quality
program in embedded system design that can serve as a model to others.
