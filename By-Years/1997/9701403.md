9701403 Ryan The research component of this CAREER award addresses several
important topics in the area of sequential decision making. Decision makers are
often faced with making a sequence of decisions about a system over a possibly
infinite horizon, with inherent uncertainty in the environmental conditions
influencing the system state. Standard multiperiod decision-making techniques
are often inadequate in integrating forecast information for future time periods
with the decision made in the current time period. This research is focused on
integrating a general and flexible forecasting approach with a rolling horizon
procedure that iq modeled as a Markov decision process. The research objectives
are to: (1) determine appropriate lengths and formulations of the finite
deterministic subproblems to account for forecast uncertainty, (2) assess the
effect of each level of approximation on the long term cost of the decisions,
and (3) gauge the effect of forecast revisions. The proposed educational
activities are intended to improve student understanding and retention at the
undergraduate level through the use of active and cooperative learning
strategies, and enhance teaching effectiveness by participation in a project on
the peer review of teaching. The use of sequential decision-making for long- (or
infinite-) term planning projects under uncertainty arise in a number of
different contexts. For example, electric utilities must deliver power to
customers over an infinite horizon, with uncertainty in the demand for
electricity over time. Manufacturing concerns must allocate funds for capacity
expansion over time based on uncertain demand estimates. This research should
have an impact on our ability to better make decisions over long planning
horizons. Moreover, the educational component should have a positive impact on
the engineering infrastructure, encouraging interdisciplinary and team-thinking
among undergraduate students.
