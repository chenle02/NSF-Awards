This project will support attendance of young faculty, under-represented
minority scientists, PUI faculty, along with graduate students and post-docs at
the 2017 Organellar Channels and Transporters conference to be held in West
Dover, Vermont, July 30-Aug 4, 2017. The meeting will consist of short talks,
poster sessions, communal dining, and conversations that will provide ample
opportunity for sharing latest research results and for exploring collaborative
possibilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Organellar channels and transporters play
essential roles in both the function of individual intracellular compartments
and also how the activities of these compartments are coordinated and integrated
into cellular function. The Broader Impacts of this work involves both the
importance of the topic to a range of organisms including both plants and
animals, as well as the training of new scientist to pursue research in these
emerging fields. Sessions will be developed to provide opportunities for young
researchers to present their work. The primary purposes of this conference are
to promote discussion between scientists with common professional interests,
including those from non-research-intensive colleges and universities, to foster
the exchange of ideas from advanced aspects of their field, and to enable
scientific collaborations to evolve in new directions.
