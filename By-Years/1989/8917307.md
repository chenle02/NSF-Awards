The major objective of this proposal is an inversion of both near-source and
teleseismic wave forms to determine the temporal and spatial behavior of slip
during recent moderate-sized earthquakes utilizing strong-motion recordings of
the Guerrero array on the Pacific coast of Mexico. This array has been extremely
valuable in the recording of strong-motion waves from earthquakes including the
1985 magnitude 8.1 event. This work will apply the frequency domain source
inversion method developed by the investigators. The research has direct
application to the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
