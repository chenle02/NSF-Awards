Abstract Woman Hospital - R. Roy WHNET Connection to Internet Proposal No.
NCR-9318038 Woman Hospital requests support from NSF for connection of its WHNET
to Internet. The proposed project results in benefits in four specific areas:
research, patient care, continuing education, and medical library. Access to the
Internet will be available to all professional staff, residents, and nursing
students at Woman's Hospital. Following the installation of the necessary
hardware and the establishment of a 56 kbps leased line, Performance Systems
International will serve as the regional service provider to the Internet.
Additionally, key project staff from the Information Systems Division and from
the Medical Library will receive specialized training on Internet and develop
training modules appropriate for users at the hospital.
