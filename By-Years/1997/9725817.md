9725817 Rowley The India-Asia collision, being the only active example of a
continent-continent collision, has been from many points of view. However, many
conclusions hinge on knowing accurately when the ocean floor between India and
Asia was consumed and the two continental masses touched. This project will
address this by studying a sequence of strata in the Nieru valley region o f the
High Himalayan which likely preserves a syn-collisional stratigraphic sequence.
Mapping and biostratigraphic dating of this sequence is expected to document the
syn-collisional nature and to accurately date the event. Results, when combined
with other evidence will begin to address not only timing of initial contact,
but also explore possible diachroneity along the suture.
