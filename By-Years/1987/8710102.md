Studies of the atmospheres of other planets are of considerable interest as
basic research. Additional interest results from the fact that these studies
often turn out to have application to the earth's atmosphere. This grant funds a
theoretical and experimental study of the chemistry and chemical evolution of
the earth and other planetary atmospheres. The objectives of the project are:
(1) to accomplish theoretical and modeling studies of the chemistry of existing
planetary atmospheres; (2) to experimentally investigate the sulfur chemistry of
the earth's atmosphere; (3) to develop a unified theory of the origin and
chemical evolution of planetary atmospheres. This work will include studies of
the sulfur cycles of Venus and the earth's atmospheres and the nitrogen,
phosphorus and germanium chemistry in planetary atmospheres. Subsequent research
will be directed at the non-equilbrium chemistry of volcanoes and nebula, and
the atmospheric chemical effects resulting from the impact of comets and
asteroids with planets.
