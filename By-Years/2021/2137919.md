Jacob J Bernal is awarded a Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending
Postdoctoral Research Fellowships (MPS-Ascend) to conduct a program of research
and education at the University of Arizona. He will explore the synthesis and
interstellar presence of carbon nanostructures (such as fullerenes and
nanotubes) from shock heating of silicon carbide (SiC) circumstellar dust
grains. The astronomical detection of fullerenes transformed our understanding
of chemical complexity in the Interstellar Medium (ISM). Dr. Bernal is working
to overcome the perception that education has historically been used as a tool
of assimilation and control of Native Americans, resulting in a lasting negative
perception and distrust of higher learning institutions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent findings, published by Bernal and collaborators,
revealed that shock heating of SiC grains produced carbon nanobuds, which can
subsequently close to form fullerenes. The findings also point to formation of
carbon nanotubes, if SiC molecules are heated to higher temperatures and longer
heating durations. These nanostructures would become the largest known molecules
in the ISM, consisting entirely of reduced carbon, and destruction of these
nanotubes may account for the presence of previously detected complex organic
molecules. This could have implications for studies of meteoritic materials and
astrobiology. He will build awareness of astronomical observatory facilities on
the Tohono Oâ€™odham Nation and demonstrate that STEM careers are attainable while
remaining in the supportive local community structure of the
Tribe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
