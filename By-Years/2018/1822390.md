The 30th Cumberland Conference on Combinatorics, Graph Theory and Computing will
be held at Marshall University, May 19-20, 2018. This is the latest in a series
of conferences, usually held annually, that provide a venue for students and
researchers, particularly but not exclusively from the southeastern United
States, to discuss the latest advances in discrete mathematics and computer
science. Discrete mathematics is a rapidly expanding field with applications in
communication, network and information science, life sciences and engineering.
The conference will promote applications of discrete mathematics in computer
science and encourage participation by students and groups underrepresented in
mathematics. It provides a setting where researchers at all levels can present
their work, exchange information and collaborate on solving problems. It
strengthens the regional network of researchers while connecting that network to
broader national and international communities.

The conference scope includes all areas of discrete mathematics. Four featured
internationally-known speakers will give 50-minute plenary presentations.
Estimated attendance is around 100 participants, and about 60 contributed
20-minute talks are planned. Abstracts from the conference will be available
indefinitely through a conference abstracts service. Funding from this award
will support travel, accommodation and meal expenses for the featured speakers,
and other participants identified through a selection process. The selection
process will prioritize women, members of underrepresented minorities, people
with disabilities, early-career mathematicians, and researchers without federal
funding. The conference website is http://www.marshall.edu/math/cumberland2018/

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
