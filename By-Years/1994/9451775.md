9451775 Parks The objective of the proposed project is to construct a state-of-
the-art software development laboratory which will support three courses in
large scale software development with emphasis on manufacturing applications.
Learning software engineering concepts is a vital educational experience for
modern engineers and this educational experience is largely being ignored in
engineering education. Further, engineering students cannot get the appropriate
experience by taking just a couple of computer science courses, since most
computer science departments (with a few exceptions) focus primarily on
algorithm development and database research. In order to correct this
deficiency, we are proposing to offer our engineering students three courses in
software development with an appropriate laboratory experience. The students
will be required to design large software systems illustrating team programming
concepts, software maintenance issues, and systems integration principles. This
proposal is a joint effort of the Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISE) and
the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Departments. The courses will be
taught and maintained by faculty from both departments. The planned laboratory
will give engineering students experience in the three major software paradigms
used in today's manufacturing software development: functional and data
modeling, object oriented analysis and design, and real time programming. We
plan to expand this experience to all engineering disciplines.
