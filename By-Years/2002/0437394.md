&lt;br/&gt;The National Curve Bank (NCB) was founded under NSF DUE CCLI - EMD
proof of concept grant #0127283. The NCB addresses the challenge of improving
learning through making materials inexpensively and easily available to a wide
audience of faculty and students via the Web site
http://curvebank.calstatela.edu. Through this site topics on curves often are
enhanced in various ways that the printed page does not allow, including
animation and interactive components. Numerous modules (deposits) are
featured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CCLI- EMD full development project continues
to refine and expand the Web site by increasing interactive capabilities,
improving animation and video streaming, adding deposits on surfaces, and
creating multimedia components. Other features include applications of
mathematics concepts in science, technology and engineering for STEM
undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students and faculty of diverse
backgrounds participate in every stage of development, and the 33 members of the
National Advisory Board continue to communicate regularly in evaluating new bank
"deposits." An annual prize, the Renie, is awarded for Best Deposit of the
Year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project lies in the
development and refinement of materials for the NCB. In addition to including
students, faculty members, and an Advisory Board from numerous institutions in
the process of developing, improving, and approving materials, the broader
impacts include that the results of the project reach a diverse, national
audience.
