Dr. Hansen is the recipient of a Presidential Young Investigator award. He is an
outstanding young man, with training in bioorganics chemistry. He has already
done some very significant work on the design and testing of mechanism based
inhibitiors of S-adenosyl- methionine synthetase and stereochemistry of
phophorus containing enzymes. The focus of his future work will be catalytic
antibody design. He has several workable and novel ideas, some of which have
already been demonstrated.
