This proposal combines experimental and theoretical investigations of the
response of PDLC films to applied fields. The primary objective of this work is
to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the major contributions to the
switching mechanisms in these materials. This will enable systematic
modification and control of the film characteristics to achieve optimum film
performance for specific device applications. Experimental studies will include
dielectric and transmission measurements of PDLC films in response to fields of
sufficient strength to reorient the liquid crystal director. Electron microscopy
will provide information on droplet geometry. These measurements will be used to
correlate the response with important film properties: the electrical
characteristics, liquid crystal elastic constants, droplet size and droplet
shape. To achieve a comprehensive picture, the experimental investigations will
be supplemented by theoretical studies of the response. In particular, the
electric field in a birefringent (bipolar) ellipsoidal droplet will be examined
in detail numerically. This will be coupled with calculations of the director
configuration in the droplets to understand the role of the field strength,
elastic constants and droplet geometry on the director realignment in a droplet.
These calculations will be applied to recently developed models of the
dielectric response and optical transmission for comparison with experimental
response curves.
