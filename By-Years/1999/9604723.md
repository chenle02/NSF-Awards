9604723 Handa The hippocampus is a forebrain structure of the temporal lobe,
constituting an important part of the limbic system and of the Papez's circuit.
Its general anatomy and connections to other regions of the brain are well
defined. Functions that depend upon the hippocampus are recognition of novelty,
learning and memory. Indeed it is believed that this brain region serves as a
spatial map that helps us remember where we have been. Recently, it has been
shown that the hippocampus contains a high concentration of androgen receptors
suggesting that testosterone may influence this region of the brain. Moreover,
sex differences in cognitive functions have been reported. Despite recent data
demonstrating that the hippocampus is a major target for androgen and there are
male-female differences in spatial memory and in learning, few studies have
examined the neural mechanisms by which androgen can alter hippocampal function
or hippocampal cell parameters. Recently, Dr. Handa showed that androgens
influence hippocampal function by altering the n-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)
receptors, which are important for glutamate neurotransmission and the
underlying sensitivity to neurotoxic insults such as anoxia and chronic stress.
He will now combine his expertise in molecular and cellular neuroendocrinology
with Dr. Beck's talents in neurophysiology to carry out an integrative series of
studies to examine the effects of androgen on hippocampal synaptic plasticity.
They will examine the effects of androgen on hippocampal cell morphology, NMDA
receptor composition and function, and enzyme activity. The results from these
studies will provide new knowledge on the role that steroid hormones play in
modulating a brain region that occupies a central role in regulating multiple
non- reproductive behaviors.
