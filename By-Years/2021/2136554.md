The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to advance a real-time assessment system for
patients at risk of respiratory distress. The goal is to monitor these patients
and avoid hospital admissions or re-admissions for previously discharged
patients. The first envisioned application is monitoring of Chronic Obstructive
Pulmonary Disease (COPD), for which there is no cure - but the disease can be
managed with diligent surveillance. The envisioned remote patient monitoring
system will enhance patient care and outcomes by providing early warning of COPD
flare-ups, thus reducing the need for emergency hospital visits and admissions.
This system will provide healthcare workers and caregivers added time to
implement protocols, such as inhaler-based drug delivery, thus reducing critical
events for COPD, as well as COVID-19, asthma, pneumonia, and other respiratory
illnesses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase II project is to develop a reusable device monitoring biomarkers of
nociceptive pain, dyspnea, and coughing dynamics, along with traditional vital
sign measurements. The project will develop a reusable device with a
rechargeable battery and replaceable adhesives for prolonged use during the
duration of the monitoring period. Additionally, the user interface will be
optimized for the display of pertinent symptoms to the patient, caregivers, and
medical personnel providing remote care from a centralized monitoring center.
The efficient sharing of continuous changes in patient status will allow for the
most effective personalized treatment. The project will develop a system with
appropriate cybersecurity protocols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
