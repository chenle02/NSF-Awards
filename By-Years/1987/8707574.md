The proposed research is part of an ongoing program of work which revolves
around problems of controlling nonlinear systems with imperfect or partial
observations. The main problems investigated are: smoothness of the optimal
value function, behaviour of the optimal control, the asymptotic behavior of the
system as the time or noise parameters approach zero or infinity, and
establishing a class of explicitly solvable case examples. A special case of the
partially observed problem with a finite parameter set has been solved in the
investigator's previous work. It is known under the name of the so-called
Adaptive Control problem formulated as a stochastic control Bayesian problem. Of
interest is now the extent to which these results can be established for the
continuous parameter case. The general partially observed problem is another
topic of interest for this investigation. Recently, the investigator has
established the general equivalence of the partially observed problem and the
so-called separated problem, which is a special infinite dimensional completely
observed problem. The next step in this research is the establishing of the
Bellman equation. The investigator intends to rely here on the recent results on
viscosity solutions. Finally, he intends to establish a general continuity
result, i.e. to prove that the value function depends continuously on the
generators. Another topic of interest that the investigator wants to pursue is
the exit problem. Stochastic control and filtering is an area of active research
with potential applications to stock management, control of noisy dynamical
systems and filtering of signals.
