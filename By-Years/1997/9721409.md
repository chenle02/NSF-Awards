This research program focuses on the experimental study of the dynamic evolution
of prepared quantum states, the transition between the semiclassical and quantal
regimes, and the response of a quantum system to non-classical excitation. The
experiments will be conducted in a cavity QED apparatus, where optically pumped
atoms interact with a single mode of a driven high finesse optical cavity. The
investigations will probe dissipative quantum processes and will help elucidate
questions of continuous quantum measurement for open systems.
