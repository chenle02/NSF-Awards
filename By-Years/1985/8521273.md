There is a need for more efficient water heating and space conditioning of both
residence and commercial buildings. Existing electric heat pumps are available
but their coefficients of performance are low. An absorption heat pump is an
alternate device with a coefficient of performance that is almost double that of
an electric heat pump. This proposed effort seeks to demonstrate the technical
and economic feasibility of a new abosrption heat-pumped water heater. A new
working fluid has been developed with distinct advantages over other fluids for
heat pumps. Energy, corrosion and cycle studies, including both experiments and
analyses, will be conducted and the economic viability will be assessed. If
successful, this work will result in significant energy savings.
