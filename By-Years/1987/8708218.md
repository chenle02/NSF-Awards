Paramecia have been likened to swimming neurons and they serve as examples of
receptor cells that are sensitive to exogenous chemical stimuli. The PI has laid
the ground work in the study of chemoreception in Paramecium to the point where
there are putative chemoreceptor proteins identified for the stimuli folate and
cAMP. A genetic approach has been used from the very beginning of these studies
of chemosensory transduction. Mutants figured heavily from the theses studies to
quantify the behavioral responses to stimuli, to describe the swimming
mechanisms that led to attraction and repulsion, to identify and characterize
the membrane electrical responses that follow ligand-receptor binding and to
describe the binding proteins including the chemoreceptors for two attractant
stimuli. The stage is now set for the PI to apply the techniques of molecular
genetics to the study of chemoreception. The PI proposes to train herself in
molecular genetics during a sabbatical year at USC. The goal will be to clone
the genes for the cAMP and possibly folate binding proteins that are candidates
for chemoreceptors and to bring the technique of molecular genetics back to her
laboratory at UVM. The end result will be to apply powerful techniques to a
problem ripe for them, to provide training in state-of-the-art techniques for
the PI, and in general, to improve the future directions and productivity of the
PI's laboratory.
