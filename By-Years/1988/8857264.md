Dr. Michael M. Miyamoto of the University of Florida's Department of Zoology
will investigate two ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes and three transfer RNA (tRNA)
genes from the mitochondrial DNAs (mtDNAs) of ruminants, beginning with the
white-tailed deer, pronghorn antelope, and mouse deer. These efforts are
directed toward the construction of phylogenies and phylogenetic classifications
of the suborder Ruminantia, part of the grand order Ungulata, which includes the
cetaceans (whales and dolphins) and artiodactyls (even-toed ungulates: llamas,
camels, deer, giraffe, and cattle), among others. A second objective is to
evaluate these data for patterns of congruence with available anatomical,
paleontological, and other information. Finally, the molecular evolution
(structure/function relationships and mutational mechanisms) of rRNA and tRNA
genes will be studied. Also planned are studies of interfamilial affinities of
vascular plants: gymnosperms, including cycads and the ginkgo, and angiosperms.
This research is supported by a five-year Presidential Young Investigator award.
