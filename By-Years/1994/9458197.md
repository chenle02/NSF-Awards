Abstract 9458197 Bacterial cytokinesis will be analyzed with genetic,
biochemical and molecular approaches. It has been shown that the control of the
placement of the division septum in Escherichia coli is regulated by a 3 gene
operon and one of the genes products provides topological specificity. It has
also been shown that an essential septation protein, FtsZ is important to
cytokinesis. It forms a membrane-associated ring structure at the site of septum
formation. This ring shrinks as it remains associated with the leading edge of
the ingrowing septum until cytokinesis is complete. In vitro, the protein self-
associates into filamentous structures upon binding of GTP. We will develop a
quantitative assay for FtsZ polymerization and study the role of nucleotide
hydrolysis in Fts-multimerization. Genetic studies have suggested that FtsZ
interacts with a number of other division related proteins. Several of these
will be tested in purified systems by a variety of methods. In addition,
peptide- tagged derivatives of FtsZ will be used in an unbiased search for
proteins that interact directly with FtsZ. %%% Although much is known about the
genetics and physiology of the bacterium, Escherichia coli, much less is known
about mechanisms involved with converting one cell into two cells. This work
should deepen our understanding of the genetic regulation of and the
physiological mechanisms involved in cell division. ***
