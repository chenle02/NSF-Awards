This award is partial support of the 2023 Symposium on Stakeholders Perspective
on the Bioeconomy as part of the meeting of the USDA S-1075 Multistate
Committee. The biobased economy has potential to produce biofuels and
bioproducts in an environmentally sustainable way. This consortia of researchers
from 35 land grant universities address barriers to a bioeconomy including
challenges in feedstock logistics and conversion technologies. Annual meetings
of the S-1045 multistate committee are held to coordinate and share research
from land grant universities across the nation. Symposiums are organized with
leading researchers and speakers from funding agencies to share the latest
research knowledge and coordinate future research.

The 2023 S-1075 Multistate Committee annual symposium will be held at the
University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The meeting is planned to occur on July 13-14,
2023. The goal of the 2023 symposium is to develop an understanding of the key
challenges when trying to commercialize bioenergy and bioproduct technologies.
NSF funding will be used to support graduate students to attend this symposium
and to meet with member researchers from approximately 35 land grant
institutions. This is a meeting where the students can interact with the entire
sector of the bioeconomy including researchers, producers, processors, financial
sector, and government agencies. This will help in orienting the next workforce
generation to challenges and opportunities in the bioeconomy. The proceedings
from the symposium will be published and distributed widely to interested
audience by S-1045 members.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
