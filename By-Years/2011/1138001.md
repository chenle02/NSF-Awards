Continental Scientific Drilling (CSD) has a long history producing
transformative science. In 1984, the CSD community formed a non-profit
corporation, DOSECC, to encourage and nurture community efforts to develop CSD
projects, prepare drilling plans and budgets, design and fabricate equipment,
and conduct scientific drilling operations. In addition, since 1997 the CSD
community, through DOSECC, has conducted annual workshops. The CSD community is
large and has diverse interests, but significant barriers hinder implementing of
projects: technical hurdles in planning and budgeting projects, difficulties in
implementing and managing drilling operations, and uncertain funding. Growth and
cohesion of the US scientific drilling community is also important for
maintaining national competitiveness and participation in the International
Continental Scientific Drilling (ICDP) Program. This workshop will address these
issues by gathering scientists of diverse background and research focus to learn
from the successes and challenges of recent CSD projects, discuss collaboration
opportunities, and chart the course of the future of continental scientific
drilling in the U.S. This will be accomplished through keynote presentations on
recent CSD projects and disciplinary breakout sessions to create a vision for
future theme-based workshops. The workshop findings will be gathered in a report
that will be distributed widely through print and electronic forms.
