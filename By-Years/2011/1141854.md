The geological activity that manifests itself so dramatically at the Earth's
surface ultimately originates from processes in the deep interior. To improve
our understanding of the interior dynamics and structure of the Earth, it is
necessary to combine geophysical observations such as those from seismology with
direct experimental measurements of the physical properties of the relevant
geological materials. The aim of this study is to measure the sound velocities
of minerals at high pressure and to use the results in combination with seismic
data to construct improved models of the composition and structure of the
Earth's upper mantle.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Using Brillouin spectroscopy we will
carry out new measurements of the high-pressure elastic properties of major
phases of the upper mantle including olivine and its high-pressure polymorphs.
The elastic properties of minerals are essential for the interpretation of
seismic data for the Earth. The bulk and shear moduli along with density
determine compressional and shear wave speeds which can be directly compared to
seismic data. In combination with our previous work on hydrous olivine
polymorphs, these studies will yield new understanding of how iron and hydrogen
affect the elastic properties of the major phases of the upper mantle. In
particular, our studies will shed new light on the velocity crossover between
hydrous and anhydrous forsterite observed in our previous work. Another goal for
this project is to develop and apply techniques for Brillouin spectroscopy at
simultaneous high pressures and temperatures (to as high as 600oC) using an
externally heated diamond anvil cell. This work will provide the first
experimental constraints on the high P-T elastic tensor for some key mantle
minerals. Lastly, we will undertake a comprehensive synthesis of our current
understanding of chemical and structural controls on mineral elastic properties
and their importance for interpreting seismic data.
