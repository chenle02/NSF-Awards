This research is on developing algorithms and tools to synthesize testable
digital sequential circuits. The testable synthesis problem has in the past been
dealt with as two independent problems namely, the state assignment problem and
the testing problem. Algorithms and tools that can synthesize area-efficient and
testable designs of sequential circuits represented as finite state machines are
being developed. Methods of partitioning and re-synthesizing large sequential
circuits using the CAD tools and/or the test architectures developed in this
project and generation of test vectors for the resulting circuits are being
explored.
