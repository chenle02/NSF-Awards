This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop
transparent electrodes based on silver nanowires and polymer substrates to
replace indium tin oxide for applications in thin-film and flexible electronic
devices. The approach is to form a silver nanowire-polymer composite with sheet
resistance and transmission comparable to indium tin oxide coated on glass. A
transfer technique will be employed to produce smooth electrode surface free of
protruding silver nanowires. The expected outcome of the project is a new
transparent electrode technology, with less than 10 nm surface roughness, 85%
transmission, and 10 ohm per square sheet resistance. The project will also
demonstrate high-performance thin-film electronic devices based on the composite
electrodes.

The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to provide a
viable alternative to indium tin oxide to reduce the production cost of
important electronic devices such as organic light emitting diodes, thin-film
solar cells, and liquid crystal displays. The combined markets for these devices
represent a substantial growth opportunity in the near future. However, the
rising cost of indium and the lack of flexibility of indium tin oxide have
become a major challenge. In this project, new composite electrodes will be
developed, which are anticipated to be low cost, flexible and even stretchable
without compromising device performance.
