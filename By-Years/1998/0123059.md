A number of opportunities exist for COLLEGE OF MENOMINEE NATION that require
further &lt;br/&gt;development of SMET programs currently offered at the
College. To forward its 8,000 &lt;br/&gt;years of stewardship and expertise in
sustainable forest management, the Menominee&lt;br/&gt;Nation is committed to
ensuring that future generations are prepared as stewards &lt;br/&gt;well-
schooled in sound sciences and best practices in Menominee autochthony.
Our&lt;br/&gt;challenge is to assure that quality in SMET education is
commensurate with that &lt;br/&gt;stewardship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COLLEGE OF
MENOMINEE NATION will enhance student opportunities in science,
math,&lt;br/&gt;engineering and technology through a planning process that will
provide assessment &lt;br/&gt;of the SMET infrastructure and the development of
an institutional plan to enhance its&lt;br/&gt;SMET program. The process will
also assess the needs of the communities on the &lt;br/&gt;Menominee
Reservation, as well as the Oneida, Mohican and Potowatomi Nations and
&lt;br/&gt;neighboring non-Indian communities to determine the constellation of
SMET programs&lt;br/&gt;that will promote sustainable development in the
communities of northeastern &lt;br/&gt;Wisconsin. In addition, assessment of the
current math offerings as a necessary&lt;br/&gt;interface is a priority. We
envision such an analysis as the key to our delivery &lt;br/&gt;of student
research opportunities in eco-toxicology, environmental science and
&lt;br/&gt;environmental health. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
