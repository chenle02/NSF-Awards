9705375 Berg This planning project, sponsored by Community School District #18
of the New York City Schools, will carry out planning activities intended to
implement a district-wide parent involvement program as a supplement to the
Science in the Seamless Day program currently in effect with NSF support. The
planning activities will include day-long planning seminars with teachers and
staff, ongoing planning sessions with parents, after school materials
development sessions, travel to the Chicago TAMS project and travel to local
science, math and technology resource institutions. The final proposal will
include parent preparation and training activities, family "discovery"
workshops, take-home activities and parent leadership development. The project
staff will be helped by a wide variety of partners which have been active in
district programs. The matching funds constitute about 10% of the NSF award.
