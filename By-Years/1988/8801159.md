This project is mathematical research in Banach space theory. A Banach space is
a (usually) infinite-dimensional linear space in which one can take limits in a
reasonable way. One reason for the historical development of their theory is
that differential equations may be profitably studied from the point of view of
operators on certain Banach spaces of functions. Part of the project is to
investigate certain aspects of the non- linear geometry of Banach spaces. This
is a very new aspect of the theory, which hitherto has concentrated on linear
subspaces and linear operators. Another non-linear topic is norm estimates on
products of polynomials, wherein the latter are regarded as elements of various
natural Banach spaces of functions. The principal investigator will also work on
a classical problem for the Banach space of absolutely integrable functions of a
real variable.
