This investigation is designed to test important hypotheses regarding the East
Antarctic ice sheet and the bedrock geology at its base: 1) Clay samples from
supraglacial moraines (Elephant and Reckling Moraines) will be analyzed for
microfossils (marine diatoms) in order to confirm the existence of a marine
embayment on the continent in Neogene time and to determine the source of
detrital feldspar grains by Rb-Sr dating; 2) Geochemical and isotopic data will
be used to determine whether specimens of black acicular calcite from the
Elephant Moraine are of hydrothermal origin and therefore indicate the former
presence of hot springs under the East Antarctic ice sheet; and 3) The oxygen
and hydrogen isotope composition of 135 ice samples collected along surveyed
traverses are expected to indicate whether the icefields adjacent to the
supraglacial moraines expose a stratigraphic cross-section of the East Antarctic
ice sheet. *** //
