A graph signal is a signal in which relationships between its components follows
the structure encoded in a weighted graph. The purpose of graph signal
processing is to exploit this underlying structure to analyze and process graph
signals. The last few years have seen significant progress in the development of
theory, tools, and applications of graph signal processing. The Graph Signal
Processing (GSP) Workshop is a forum intended to disseminate ideas to a broader
audience and to exchange ideas and experiences on the future path of this
emerging field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of the funds requested in
this proposal is to facilitate the participation of students by providing a
limited number of travel grants. The recipients of the travel awards will be
selected by the organizing committee among students who apply for them and who
are principal authors of papers presented at the workshop. These awards will be
based on merit (e.g. novelty of the research) but also on distance. We expect to
provide a $500 travel awards to 20 students.
