This Chemistry Division award provides continued support for a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in the Chemistry Department,
University of Nevada, Reno, directed by Dr. John H. Frederick. Ten students will
participate each year over the next three years in a 10-week summer program. The
program will focus on students from small four-year colleges in the West with
limited research opportunities. The participants will be exposed to a variety of
research topics across all the fields of chemistry. Other program activities
include weekly departmental research colloquia and a presentation concerning
post-graduate opportunities for students in the sciences made by an outside
speaker. Students will be required to report research results in the form of
posters and an oral presentation at a regional Undergraduate Research Symposium.
