This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). The Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry
and Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Programs support the efforts of Professor
Elizabeth M. Boon of SUNY at Stony Brook for the investigation of H-NOX heme
structure in response to NO and O2 using chemical and biological tools. This
research project will establish structure / function relationships by examining
ligand-induced changes in the heme structure and the mechanisms of signal
transduction for heme sensor proteins. This fundamental study on the basic
science of gas sensing by heme proteins could ultimately lead to applications in
biotechnology (artificial O2 and NO sensors), medicine (gas delivery agents),
and synthetic biology (artificial signaling pathways). Professor Boon has
established a workshop that is targeted at the elementary school level to
encourage young girls to explore scientific concepts. A local high school
teacher will be working in Professor Boon's laboraotry for the summer,
developing new ways to introduce chemical and biological concepts into the
curriculum. A new course in chemical biology for undergraduate and graduate
students is also under development.
