Experimental work on the properties of atoms in specific excited states will be
undertaken. These include the photoionization of excited atoms, atomic
collisions of excited atoms and the study of atomic energy levels in Stark
fields. The work is closely tied to ongoing theoretical efforts and involves the
participation of a number of undergraduates and secondary school teachers.
