This project will complete the MORVEL models for present day plate motion.
MORVEL is a successor to NUVE<-1 and NUVEL-1A. The MORVEL data consists almost
entirely of spreading rates from marine magnetic anomalies and transform-fault
azimuths from marine bathymetric data, and are a significant improvement on
prior data sets. Two models will be constructed, one that averages motion over
the shortest geological interval possible for a given plate boundary, and a
second that uniformly averages motion over the past 3.16 Ma.
