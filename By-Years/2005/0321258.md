With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Lee H.
Spangler and colleagues in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at
Montana State University will develop a new method of mirror control in a step-
scan FT spectrometer that will still utilize a helium-neon laser as the
reference wavelength, but will allow step sizes much smaller than half the HeNe
wavelength. Because the free spectral range is inversely proportional to the
step size, this development will double to triple the free spectral range and
permit the FT spectrometer to cover the entire useful optical range (ultraviolet
to far infrared) in the step scan mode. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to
span the HeNe frequency in step scan mode is potentially beneficial to anyone
using this instrumentation for time resolved spectroscopy. The approach to be
undertaken by these investigators is compatible with existing instrumentation
and shows promise of commercial viability. The principal investigators have a
strong partnership with industry, which should facilitate this
commercialization.
