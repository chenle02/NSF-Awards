This project seeks to better understand the structure, persistence and
variability of the tropospheric polar front and subtropical jet streams,
investigating their separate driving mechanisms using time-averaged data. A
hypothesis is put forward to describe the dynamical relationship between these
jet streams and their influence on the structure of storm tracks and the
formation of low-frequency anomalies in atmospheric flow. A series of modeling
studies will be undertaken for both dry and moist atmospheric conditions, and
the results used to formulate an analytical (or semi-analytical) theory for
predicting jet regimes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is expected to benefit
the scientific community by improving its understanding of the different
mechanisms driving atmospheric jet streams, enabling the prediction of their
influence on large-scale climate variability. The project will also involve
student participation, including attendance at professional meetings, and
dissemination of its results in classroom teaching.
