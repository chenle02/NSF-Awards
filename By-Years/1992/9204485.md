Understanding the feedback between volcanic processes and fluid migration
requires a truly interdisciplinary effort. To promote discussion of these
processes among diverse earth scientists, a Geological Society of America
Penrose Conference, "Fluid-Volcano Interactions", will be held October 4-9,
1992. Participants will include volcanologists, hydrogeologists, geochemists,
geomorphologists, geophysicists, and others united by an interest in volcano-
related physical and chemical processes. This award will provide travel funds
for American graduate students to attend the conference.
