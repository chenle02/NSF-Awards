Recent research has shown that the principal cause of errors on some digital
data networks is due to cycle slips that occur during clock recovery, instead of
erroneous decisions made at the detector. Conventional codes are unable to
tolerate cycle slips, and can make the problem worse. The objectives of this
project are to develop new and efficient coding algorithms that can correct
slips. In addition, the coding algorithms studied will have a limited error
correction capability, so that the occasional error can be corrected and so that
the resulting algorithms are not sensitive to errors. The research has two
different directions. Previous research in the area has led to the development
of some fairly efficient codes that can tolerate cycle slips at the boundary
between codewords, but nowhere else. The research examines ways to extend or
modify these codes so that they can correct cycle slips that occur anywhere in
the codeword. Another direction for the research is the study of novel coding
methods for correcting cycle slips, including source coding and convolutional
code structures.***//
