This award provides funding to Howard Community College (HCC), in partnership
with Johns Hopkins University to help plan, organize, and deploy a regional
Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) workshop at Illinois Institute of
Technology (IIT), on September, 27, 2003. The workshop will connect current NSF
principal investigators from universities/colleges in Illinois with Chicago area
middle/high school mathematics and science teachers and community college
faculty and provide a venue to explore opportunities to link these groups
together in NSF funded research experiences through the Research Experiences for
Teachers (RET) Program.
