This proposal will investigate the feasibility of measuring to very high
resolution (+200 microns) the locations of multiple components of known
composition whose positions are intended to conform to a well-defined pattern
inside a structure. The proposed technique relies on scanning photon beams
across the structure surface, detecting transmitted and scattered radiation in
collimated detectors, and employing techniques such as template-matching that
incorporate a priori information such as size and composition of the components
and their intended pattern. A combined experimental and theoretical
investigation is undertaken to study design issues such as source energy, source
and detector collimation, scan mode, scan step size and speed, and required
number of detectors and their locations for a practical instrument.
