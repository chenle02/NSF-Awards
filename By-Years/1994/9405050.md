9405050 Kesler This is a preliminary study of the Vergenoeg iron-fluorite
deposit in South Africa. Vergenoeg consists if fluorite and iron oxides and is
closely associated with silicic extrusive rocks. Research a Vergenoeg will
attempt to answer two questions. The first question involves the nature of fluid
phases present during formation of the deposits, which should clarify the
relation between silicate and iron oxide magmas and the possible role of
volatile phases(s) in causing the heavy iron oxide phase to extrude. The second
question is why the immiscible iron oxide phase separated from the silicate
magma, if indeed it did. We plan to map these rocks, verify the stratigraphic
position of iron ore in the sequence and then look for any changes in the oxygen
isotope composition of the silicic rocks, which might relate to introduction of
ground (e.g. meteoric) water.
