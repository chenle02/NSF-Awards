This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Jefferson Laboratory in Newport
News (Virginia), the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider in Brookhaven (New York),
and other facilities throughout the world already (and plan to) explore a
variety of high energy collisions involving strongly interacting particles (like
the proton) in order to reveal their substructure in terms of quarks and gluons
--- the elementary entities on which Quantum Chromodynamics (the fundamental and
microscopic theory of the strong interaction) is build. While in the past only a
1-dimensional picture was possible, recent developments allow one to get a
3-dimensional view of the proton and of other strongly interacting particles.
The major goal of the proposed project is to provide theoretical support for the
ongoing experiments and to help sharpening the plans for future experimental
activities. It is also expected to get new insights on how precisely Quantum
Chromodynamics can describe a certain class of high energy collisions, namely
those processes where polarization of just one particle is involved. It is
notoriously challenging to find the proper framework for such processes, which
currently are intensely studied both from the theoretical as well as the
experimental side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this project,
which is accompanied by a yearly lecture on theoretical particle and hadronic
physics, is primarily in the training and education of graduate students. This
project will also enable a greater overlap with the activities of the
experimental hadron physics group at Temple University.
