The purpose of this proposal is to develop video materials to enhance student
interest in mathematics. The means of accomplishing this purpose is to show the
students a world of opporltunity open to those with good mathematical skills. In
particular the videos will involve women and minorities, and thus provide role
models for women and minority students. Each video will involve Jaime Escalante
and people who have successfully applied mathematical skills in their chosen
profession or job. The materials produced will include: twelve videos and
teacher material for each video. This material is to give supplementary
information for the teacher to use in leading a discussion of some of the
mathematics involved.
