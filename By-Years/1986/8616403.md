This is a continuation of research previously supported by NSF grant
EAR83-19084, involving the direct determination of thermodynamic properties of
important minerals by solution calorimetry. The research will yyield excess
enthalpies and volumes associated with chemical substitution in muscovite-
paragonite micas, nepheline- analcite-leucite. Enthalpies of formation will be
determined for paragonite and sodalite. Enthalpy changes associated with strain
will be measured in crypto-perthites. Excess entropies will be formulated in
alkali feldspars by combining calorimetric results with data from phase
equilibrium studies. The proposed projects have not been attempted previously
and thus will lead to new data on these minerals.
