0121208&lt;br/&gt;Aitken&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed research is to
examine bacterial chemotaxis to organic contaminants. This research will examine
if chemotaxis is a significant process with respect to overall biodegradation
rates near nonaqueous-phase liquid sources. The importance of chemotaxis in the
presence of multiple effectors on the biodegradation rate will be examined.
Also, a model of chemotaxis flux will be further developed and validated. The
results of this research could provide increased understanding of the relevant
mechanisms that govern in situ biodegradation. This could help to quantify and
predict biodegradation rates. &lt;br/&gt;
