Distributed applications (such as web applications and cloud-based applications,
where multiple computers cooperate to run the application) are becoming
increasingly common. Given the amount of commercial activity and information
handled by these distributed applications, it is important that these
applications are correct, reliable, and efficient. However, many traditional
tools and techniques for programmers cannot be used for distributed
applications, making it difficult for programmers to write and debug distributed
applications. This research explores the use of software contracts for
distributed applications. Software contracts are specifications for software
components that can be checked at run time (i.e., when the software executes).
By developing techniques and tools to incorporate software contracts into
distributed applications, this research has the potential to make it easier for
programmers to write distributed applications that are correct, reliable, and
efficient.

Specifically, this research explores the use of higher-order contracts for
distributed applications. Higher-order contracts are contracts for higher-order
values such as first-class functions or objects. Higher-order contracts are a
good fit for distributed applications as components in distributed applications
are often higher-order, and higher-order contracts facilitate reasoning about
dynamic composition of components (which is common in distributed settings such
as web applications). Potential benefits of higher-order contracts include: (a)
declarative specification of the functional behavior of components; (b) run-time
enforcement of specifications; and (c) correct identification of faulty
components. This research focuses on the efficient enforcement of behavioral
contracts, the correct enforcement of contracts in the presence of untrustworthy
distributed components, and the specification and enforcement of non-functional
behaviors.
