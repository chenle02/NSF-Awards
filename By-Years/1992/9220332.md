This is a unit of DOE/NSF/USDA Collaborative Research in Plant Biology Program.
The theme of this research training group is plant-insect interaction. Insects
play important roles, both beneficial and detrimental, in plant growth and
development. One of major challenges of biotechnology research has been how to
minimize detrimental effects of insects on plants. Efforts to date suggest that
creative interfacing within and between many disciplines is needed in order to
meet the challenge. The aim of this research group is to build these interfaces.
The members plan to develop a center of excellence in the genetic engineering of
plants, guided by a combination of research skills including expertise in insect
ethology, physiology and ecology. The research training group award will provide
opportunities for interdisciplinary research to 17 faculty members, and support
postdoctoral and graduate students, as well as selected undergraduate students
who will be exposed to a broad range of scientific research as related to plant-
insect interaction.
