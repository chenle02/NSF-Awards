This collaborative grant provides travel support to enable students and postdocs
to attend the High-Performance Numerical Methods Supporting Radiation Therapy
Treatment Planning Workshop that will be held at Lehigh University, May 9-11,
2014. The funds will help reduce the travel cost burden on students and thereby
improve student participation at the workshop. It is expected that approximately
10 students will benefit from these travel funds. Students will participate in
the scientific sessions and also present their work at a dedicated poster
session. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop provides an excellent opportunity
for students to broaden the impact of their work. In addition, it is a unique
opportunity for the students to network with peers, leaders in the field, and
future collaborators. Through the travel grant, the SES community will be able
to increase student participation in the workshop.
