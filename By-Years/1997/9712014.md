9712014 Diffily The Ft. Worth Museum of Science and History will plan activities
related to their proposed exhibit "Texas Pre-History: How Do We Know?" This will
be a 10,000 sq. ft. permanent exhibit along with a traveling exhibit and
education program menu and will feature a constructivist approach to inquiry-
based learning focusing on archaeological and paleontological fieldwork being
carried out in Texas today. Research sites prominently featured in the exhibit
will be several early Cretaceous dinosaur sites excavated by paleontologists
Louis Jacobs, and Dale Winkler, Southern Methodist University, and
archaeological sites from early Clovis and Dalton Periods being excavated under
the direction of archeologist Reid Ferring, University of North Texas. The
exhibits and complementary activities will explore the questions a) what is
being learned about the prehistory of Texas b) how do scientists interpret their
findings and c) what don't we know? With this planning grant, they will conduct
extensive front end studies to identify key questions that visitors will have
when they come to the exhibit. Meetings with advisors to develop a conceptual
plan for the exhibit and educational materials. During these sessions such
questions as the following will be explored. A) "How can the Museum pre-design
multiple mysteries and outcomes to satisfy the interest of diverse visitors...",
b) can the museum combine paleontology and archaeology without perpetuating the
naive notion that dinosaurs and people lived at the same time, c) what materials
and policies will be developed to handle the creationism vs evolution that might
arise, and d) how will the challenges of circulating the traveling exhibit be
addressed? Museum staff will travel to other museums to examine model exhibits,
and project staff will work with teachers to develop project-related formal
education programs.
