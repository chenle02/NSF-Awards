This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project explores a new
approach to internal-node integrated circuit (IC) testing. An atomic force
microscope (AFM) will be used as a non-contact voltage probe for testing high-
speed ICs. It can be positioned and used to image the IC with nanometer
accuracy. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated to measure signal frequencies up
to 70 GHz. The probe works in air and can sense voltages through passivating
dielectric layers. Small electrical forces are detected by using a flexible
micro-mechanical cantilever and an atomically sharp, conductive tip. The tip
hovers over the IC and stroboscopically samples the voltage waveform on the
metal trace below it. With progressive scaling in chip linewidths, speed, and
complexity, ICs are outstripping the capabilities of conventional systems to
test them. Present technologies are lacking in measurement bandwidth, spatial
resolution, and accuracy. Low-end probing solutions, such as contact probes,
risk damage to the IC and perturbation of circuit operation. High-end solutions,
such as electron-beam testers, have the disadvantages of great complexity and
cost, low sequential throughput, and inflexibility. This new technology has
potential for overcoming some current deficiencies and affording new solutions
for accurate measurements in design verification and fault isolation in the IC
design cycle.
