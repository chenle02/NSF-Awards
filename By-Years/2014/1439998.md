Attrition rates are a serious problem in U.S. education in both STEM and non-
STEM fields and in traditional classroom and Massive Open Online Course (MOOC)
settings. By detecting confusion and disengagement automatically and in the
moment it occurs, the proposed technology enables instructors to respond
immediately, spending more time on material when more help is needed. By
preventing students from becoming discouraged and disenchanted, attrition rates
may be reduced for STEM majors. Reducing the attrition rate by 7% would create
half a million more STEM professionals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
addresses the growing e-learning phenomenon as well as traditional learning
models. It proposes to use what has been discovered about brain signal
technologies to improve learner engagement. Decades of research in neuro-signal
processing produced methods for measuring a host of cognitive and affective
metrics - attention, cognitive load, and engagement are a few. Building on this
work, this team developed SynMetric that utilizes methods for detecting
important metrics relevant to e-learning using portable inexpensive brain signal
sensors - detecting text difficulty, reading comprehension, student confusion
while watching course material, and user frustration while using a spoken dialog
interface. SynMetric applies brain signal technologies proven in
neuromarketing/neurocinema to help instructors better engage students. With
SynMetric, instructors receive real-time information on the engagement and
confusion level of students without any conscious effort from the student. This
process is automatic so students simply listen to a lecture and minute-by-minute
feedback is derived from their brain signals and transferred to an instructor
dashboard without any conscious effort from the student. Additionally, this
technology may inexpensively provide neurologically based measurements of
engagement, expanding the traditional neuromarketing/neurocinema market to many
other previously untapped markets e.g. small advertising studios, small film
studios, independent branding managers, and small firms building their own
branding.
