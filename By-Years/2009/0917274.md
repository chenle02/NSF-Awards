New Theoretical Foundations of Tensor Applications: Clustering, Error Analysis,
Global Convergence, and Robust Formulations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tensor
decompositions become increasingly important in analyzing high-dimensional
multi-index data. However, applications of tensor decompositions are so far
restricted: (1) they are mainly used for data compression ? critically important
tasks such as data clustering have not been addressed. (2) No bounds on
reconstruction error exist ? the compression parameters are determined on a
trial-and-error basis. (3) As solutions to non-convex optimizations, tensor
decompositions are not unique. This could severely affect the reliability of
tensor analysis. (4) Tensor decompositions are obtained via minimizing the sum
of squared errors, thus are prone to noise or outliers in the data. A robust
formulation of decomposition is highly desirable for applications with large
noises. In this proposal, we investigate these new fundamental aspects of tensor
applications: &lt;br/&gt;(1) Investigate the clustering capabilities of tensor
decompositions, in addition to the established theoretical results on
clustering; &lt;br/&gt;(2) Provide comprehensive error analysis of tensor
decompositions and derive lower and upper error bounds; &lt;br/&gt;(3)
Investigate conditions for global convergence for tensor decompositions and
investigate good initializations for the cases where global convergence fails.
&lt;br/&gt;(4) Develop robust formulations for tensor
decompositions.&lt;br/&gt;In addition, we will develop user-friendly software
toolbox that contains the resulting algorithms and make it available to the
public. We will also educate graduate and undergraduate students with
fundamentals in matrix and tensor computations. We will present tutorials and
organize workshops on this new direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
