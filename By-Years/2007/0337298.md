This study is concerned with the electromagnetic waves produced by lightning and
propagating worldwide in the natural waveguide formed by the conductive surface
of the earth and the conductive ionosphere. Measurements are under way with a
new antenna to monitor the height of this waveguide using the energy of
individual lightning flashes, with the goal of detecting changes in the height.
Such changes can arise from the ionizing effects of lightning flashes, or from
changes in ionizing radiation from the sun or outer space. The so-called quality
factor of the waveguide is also scrutinized to investigate global variations in
ionizing radiation from space. A second major task involves the characterization
of electrical current that flows in vertical lightning channels. The
mathematical theory for electromagnetic waves in the ELF (Extremely Low
Frequency) region of the electromagnetic spectrum is used in conjunction with
electric field measurements to infer the history of the lightning current. These
currents are then used to understand the behavior of transient luminous
phenomena such as sprites, elves, and haloes, which occur over large
thunderstorms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader scientific impacts arise from the
global implications of the observations, which enable access to evidence of
global change both within the waveguide (the troposphere) and external to the
waveguide (the sun and outer space). The educational impacts involve the
international collaboration almost guaranteed by problems of a global nature,
and the entrainment of MIT undergraduate students early in their scientific
careers.
