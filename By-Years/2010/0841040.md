Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The work proposed is to relocate and examine the
focal mechanisms of mid to large size earthquakes along the circum-Pacific
subduction zones. Assuming that along-strike variations in rupture processes
within the subduction zone reflects fault zone conditions, the PIs will address
the following: 1) whether slow earthquakes occur in known tsunami generating
areas; 2) whether areas with slow earthquakes have certain characterizes which
might make them prone for generating tsunamis; and 3) whether there are spatial
correlations between slow slip events and deep episodic tremor and aseismic
slip. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The project will support
two early career female PIs and will contribute to the understanding of two
MARGIN?s focus sites. This proposal also relates to Societal Theme 2 of the
