The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of software technology enabling residential electric loads to
provide fast services to the power systems. These services improve electricity
reliability and also may help the grid incorporate more renewable energy,
reducing the environmental impact of electricity generation and delivery. Near-
term applications include fast timescale load reductions utilities paying for
transmission costs based on a utilityâ€™s portion of the total demand during
specific periods. Longer-term applications include capacity upgrade deferments
in electricity distribution networks, frequency regulation resources in
wholesale markets, reduction of renewable energy curtailment, providing ramping
capability, and so on. Using electric loads to provide these services may be
more cost-effective than building/using other resources such as traditional
generation, transmission, or distribution equipment, or energy storage.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is to explore translation of control
algorithms that enable rapid cycling of residential compressor-based electric
loads (e.g., air conditioners). Rapid cycling on fast timescales allows
aggregations of these loads to provide services to power systems through changes
in their total power consumption, but currently this is difficult as rapid
on/off cycling can damage the equipment. Existing companies simply avoid
controlling these devices for services that require this speed of switching
signals. The proposed novel control algorithms avoid damaging the equipment
while enabling control on these fast timescales (e.g., every second). In
addition, estimation and inference strategies can enable control without the
need for pervasive high-resolution sensing and communication networks, reducing
the cost of control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
