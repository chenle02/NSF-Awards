This engineering education research project seeks to learn why the engineering
service organization Engineers Without Borders is successful at attracting a
large number of women volunteers and thus better understand the factors that can
help recruit women into engineering degree programs. The project uses the
constructs of self-efficacy and outcome beliefs to examine why individuals make
choices about engineering degree programs and future career
paths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this
project will be to potentially inform engineering educators and policy makers
about why women, who are significantly under-represented in engineering, are
attracted to some engineering organizations but not engineering degree programs
in general. The study will also shed light on why women who obtain engineering
degrees may choose not use take advantage of that degree by following an
engineering career. Given the large personal and societal investment in
engineering degrees, this may have far-reaching impact on the number of
engineers in the United States.
