Cell volume restoration following an osmotic stress is the property of every
cell type. The mechanism of this volume regulation depends upon the ability of
the cell to control intracellular water gain and loss by regulating the
intracellular levels of ions and low molecular weight organic solutes (cellular
osmolytes). Cells with the greatest volume regulatory ability have the greatest
ability to control the accumulation and loss of the organic solute molecules.
Dr. Popper has excellent evidence that the quaternary ammonium compound, glycine
betaine, is the primary cellular osmolyte in the heart cells of the marine
horseshoe. Glycine betaine is also used by a number of salt resistant strains of
plants and bacteria. Popper feels that the mechanisms regulating glycine betaine
levels are common to all these salt stress resistant organisms and that the
heart of this crab will serve as an excellent model system for elucidating these
mechanisms. Planned experiments involve characterization of some of the
biosynthetic and catabolic enzyme systems, studies on uptake and utilization of
precursor molecules and an evaluation of the changes in the regulation of gene
expression (enzyme synthesis) under various conditions of osmotic stress. The
results will have both basic science and practical value in terms of our
understanding of the mechanisms of cell volume regulation and salt stress
resistance.
