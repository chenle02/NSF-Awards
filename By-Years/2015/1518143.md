The objective of this project is to develop an end-to-end simulation and
analysis pipeline for observations of the so-called "kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
(kSZ) effect." This effect is due to the scattering of cosmic microwave photons
by gas in galaxy clusters, and can be used to infer the "peculiar" motions of
clusters (i.e., their motion relative to cosmic expansion) along the line of
sight. Broader impacts of the work include research training of graduate
students. The proposers will directly impact their local community by
volunteering in a local high school physics classroom, assisting with lab
activities, delivering lectures, and leading interactive demonstrations using
state-of-the-art equipment from Caltech. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research work
will quantify the expected science reach possible with kSZ measurements, and
will characterize the impact of astrophysical and instrumental systematics on
estimations of cosmological parameters, dark energy, and large scale structure.
