This grant supports the research of Judy Kennedy. The goal of the research is
to investigate the role of exotic topological sets in typical dynamical systems.
There is much evidence that these sets occur frequently and unavoidable even in
low dimensions. Chaos is a phenomenon that can occur in very simple dynamical
systems that model many aspects of everyday life. The dependence of solution
behavior on small changes in initial conditions and in parameters can profoundly
influence expected outcomes.
