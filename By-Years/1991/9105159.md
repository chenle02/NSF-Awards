A combination of field, petrographic, and isotopic work has identified 2
horizons in Precambrian carbonate strata (800 m.yr. Beck Spring Dolomite, CA.
and 1200 m.yr. Mescal Limestone, AZ) which were silicified during Precambrian
erosion events. Microfossils have been discovered in chert samples from these
horizons by R Horodyski and represent the first fossil record of organisms that
inhabited the Precambrian land surface. Carbon isotope measurements in the
associated carbonate reveal that the land surface was extensively occupied by a
terrestrial photosynthesizing community. The microfossils in the chert are
therefore probably not isolated examples but are elements of this extensive
community. An attempt will be made to establish the first paleontologic record
for the Precambrian terrestrial environment. Field, isotopic, and petrographic
work will establish the paleoenvironmental conditions of the paleokarst horizons
and will establish, in detail, which silica phases formed during Precambrian
weathering as opposed to those which formed during early diagenesis of the
original marine carbonates. Cherts with strong textural and geochemical
characteristics indicative of subaerial formation will be examined in thick
petrographic sections for the presence of microfossils. The biogenicity of
microstructures will be evaluated, and an effort will be made to establish
biologic affinities for any microfossils found. Particular attention will be
given to comparing microfossils associated with the exposure surfaces with those
in the underlying marine cherts to establish that the microfossils found
associated with the exposure surfaces truly represent microorganisms that were
living in a terrestrial setting.
