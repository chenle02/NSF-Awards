Several topics concerning parallel and distributed computing will be
investigated. 1. Assignment and Scheduling of Precedence Graphs: The existing
parallel compilers for supercomputers rely heavily on the programmer for running
an application. By gaining a better understanding of assignment and scheduling
issues, much of this process can be automated. 2. Sparse Certificates and
Communication Networks: Sparse certificates for graph connectivity (highly
connected spanning subgraphs with relatively few edges) have been introduced as
a useful tool for communication networks. Certificates for weighted graphs and
their utility in the design of reliable protocols will be explored. These
certificates, if employed properly in communication protocols, could result in
considerable savings in the amount of message traffic generated. 3. Algorithms
for Graph Connectivity: A recent almost-linear time algorithm for edge
connectivity based on matroid theory will be used to investigate questions
pertaining to the vertex connectivity graphs and digraphs, and the complexity of
connectivity testing on parallel and distributed models. Efficient reductions
and parallelizable alternate methods will be considered as ways of solving these
problems.
