This is a CAREER project which requests funding for the deployment, operation
and analysis of data from a meridional array of paired magnetic stations along
the east coast of the United States at L- shells from 1.7 to 3.4. The purpose of
the array and analysis will be to investigate processes of energy transfer from
the solar wind and magnetotail to the inner magnetosphere. In addition to the
scientific objective of the array called MEASURE, it will become an integral
part of the Florida Institute of Technology's Space Science undergraduate
curriculum and will be a testbed for a national high school magnetometer
network.
