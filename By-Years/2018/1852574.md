This award supports a new Research Experiences for Undergraduates site in
Physics at the University of California-Santa Barbara. The site will support
eight students per year for nine weeks of summer research in topics including
Astronomy/Astrophysics, Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics,
Biophysics/Physics of Living Systems, Condensed Matter Physics, Gravity, and
Elementary Particle Physics. The REU is intended to be a transformative
experience in the career path of the participants, particularly those from
institutions with fewer research opportunities, by providing the necessary
mentorship to explore their interest in Physics and develop the professional
skills needed to succeed in a career in academia or
industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop research and
professional skills of the next generation of academic physicists and the STEM
workforce by giving undergraduates the opportunity to participate in cutting
edge research, with faculty who have extensive experience in fostering
undergraduate research from Freshman to Senior level students. The REU students
will engage in research to explore black hole entropy, search for new Physics at
the Large Hadron Collider, study the dynamics of morphogenesis, tackle the
Physics of accretion disks, perform quantum simulation using ultracold quantum
gases, or discover exoplanets, contributing to the creation and advancement of
knowledge in a broad variety of research areas, at the same time learning the
skills that transfer to a variety of STEM careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
