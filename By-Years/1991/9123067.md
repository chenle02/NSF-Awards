The subjects of graph theory, applied combinatorics, and algorithms are of
great current interest in mathematics, with applications to a variety of fields.
This project will support the Seventh International Conference on Graph Theory,
Combinatorics, Algorithms, and Applications to be held from June 1-5, 1992 at
Western Michigan University. The conference will include both invited talks and
contributed papers. Special efforts will be made to attract recent doctoral
recipients to attend and present their work, to stimulate them with ideas at the
frontier of the subject, and to help them build collaborative relationships with
leading researchers in the field. A refereed proceedings, similar to those for
previous conferences in this series, is planned to be published.
