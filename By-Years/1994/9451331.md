9451331 Cromartie This project is using field monitoring equipment that is
linked to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in a core curriculum for
undergraduate environmental studies at the institution. The Environmental
Studies Program (ENVL) offers a major which includes geosciences, environmental
chemistry, biological resources, and management/planning. The recently revised
basic courses include physical geography, ecological principles, and
environmental issues. ENVL also plans to incorporate key developments in
instrumentation and data analysis into the curriculum. The most important of
these are GIS and the Global Positioning System (GPS).It is also expected that
this project will influence undergraduate environmental studies at other
colleges and universities.
