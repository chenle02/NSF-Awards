The scope of undergraduate research projects is being expanded by studying
certain geophysical aspects of bedrock and surficial deposits with instruments
capable of measuring the radioactivity of the rocks or fluids contained in the
rocks. Purchase of a radon detector with accessories for degassing of fluids and
a gamma-ray spectrometer will allow students to do these research projects. The
units are rugged, portable field instruments capable of use by a single
individual on projects such as: 1.investigation of a major crustal fracture in
northeastern Ohio embedded beneath several thousand feet of Paleozoic strata.
Details concerning position of this fault and others may be established by
mapping radon ascending from deep radioactive shales along fractures 2. New
research, resulting from a hydrogeology course will use the instruments to map
radon and radioactivity in glacial and bedrock aquifers and assess the
environmental impact. The college will contribute an amount equal to the award.
