The Standard ML programming language is important as a robust, high-level,
general-purpose language whose design is based on firm and clear theoretical
foundations, expressed in a concise, rigorous and complete formal definition. It
has become a paradigmatic language for the programming language research
community over the last twenty years. Standard ML of New Jersey is the most
widely used and best supported implementation of Standard ML, and it has seen
wide use in the programming language and formal methods research communities
(among others) since the late 1980s. It is available as a free, open source
software system with a liberal BSD-style license. To remain viable and
competitive, a programming system needs to be continually maintained and
improved, and the resources provided under this award will help to do this. In
order to maintain and increase the value of SML/NJ to its user community, this
proposal will address the following needs: (1) to keep SML/NJ in step with
advancing technologies (e.g. support for 64-bit architectures, Unicode character
and string types, improved interoperability with other languages, support for
new operating system releases and new platforms), (2) to improve the system's
performance, reliability, capabilities, and usability, both as a programming
tool and as a research and education platform, and (3) to manage the open source
development process (e.g. managing bug reports and fixes, integrating
contributed code, testing, building releases, writing and revising
documentation, etc.). In addition, the proposed equipment infrastructure,
consisting of instances of supported architectures and operating systems, will
help maintain the valuable diversity of platforms that SML/NJ is known
for.&lt;br/&gt;This is awarded as a community resource. Broader impacts of this
award include its wide use in research and education in the field of programming
languages, and use in development of major systems.&lt;br/&gt;
