0841901&lt;br/&gt;Kirby&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law
111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports acquisition of ground
penetrating radar (GPR) equipment, a real-time kinematic GPS system, 3-D
visualization software and field hardened notebook computers. The equipment will
support research and research training in the Department of Geosciences at Penn
State University that will benefit from the capability of GPR to image the near
subsurface. Specific equipment to be purchased includes a GPR system with
multiple borehole antennas (at frequencies of 50, 100 and 200 MHz) to support
stratigraphic, tectonic and hydrologic studies and a high frequency pulsed GPR
system to be deployed for imaging the thickness, internal structure and basal
contacts of glaciers. The equipment will support a range of PI and student
research including studies of the dynamics of rivers of ice draining the West
Antarctic Ice Sheet, studies of the movement of solutes through ground water
systems, morphodynamic investigations of meandering and braided river systems,
studies of pedogenesis and hill slope processes, and paleoseismological
investigations of buried faults near active plate margins. In particular,
research use of the GPR systems for study of the response of polar continental
ice sheets to climate change is of profound and timely societal interest. GPR,
in conjunction with seismic reflection techniques, offers the means to image
glacial structure at high resolution to hundreds of meters and to probe the
structure and nature of underlying deposits that serve to lubricate or slow
glacial advance toward the sea. Students trained in GPR operation, data analysis
and interpretation are well poised to gain employment in a host of civil
engineering and environmental consulting fields that increasingly rely on GPR as
a tool for near subsurface imaging.&lt;br/&gt;
