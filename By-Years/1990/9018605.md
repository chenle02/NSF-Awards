This grant will partially support a Research Symposium on Some Recent
Developments in Homotopy Theory to be held at New Mexico State University in
December 1990. The composition of the Symposium centers on a series of ten one-
hour lectures to be presented by Professor Douglas C. Ravenel of the University
of Rochester. Augmenting the lectures will be sessions for contributed papers,
research considerations, and discussion. The focus of the lectures will be the
Nilpotence Theorem of Devinatz-Hopkins-Smith and the Periodicity Theorem of
Hopkins-Smith, the algebraic considerations that motivated them, and their
applications. The entire series of ten lectures, beginning with history,
development of recent results, and thence into applications and open questions,
will be video- taped, as will contributed talks on an individual-consent basis.
