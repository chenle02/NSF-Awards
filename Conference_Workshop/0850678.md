This award provides support for the fourth meeting in the series of February
Fourier Talks (FFT), held 19-20 February 2009 at the University of Maryland,
College Park. The conference encourages and financially supports participation
by students, recent Ph.D. recipients, and members of groups underrepresented in
mathematics.

The meeting includes invited lectures on topics of current research interest and
also encourages poster presentations by students and recent Ph.D. recipients.
The conference brings together workers in a variety of different areas of
research in harmonic analysis, with emphasis on shortening the process of making
pure mathematics applicable.
