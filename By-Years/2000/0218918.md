0218918&lt;br/&gt;Johnson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Development of computer-aided
stereographic projection techniques has greatly aided interpretation of Earth
Science structure and processes. We have developed and implemented an affordable
PC/Linux based stereo projection system ("the Geowall") that can be used by
individual research groups and within the undergraduate curriculum. The main
goals of this collaborative Information Technology Research project between the
University of Michigan (EAR-&lt;br/&gt;0219246; PI: P. van Keken) and the
University of Illinois at Chicago are to greatly improve the content development
and delivery for Earth Science applications. This will include the development
of conversion software and viewers for existing Earth Science applications;
implementation of tools for interaction and manipulation of 3D data; testing of
these tools in Earth Science departments; improvement of the collaborative
environment for work between groups of researchers; and dissemination through
the Geowall consortium (geowall.org). &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
