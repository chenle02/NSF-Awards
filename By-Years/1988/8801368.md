This project is mathematical research on linear differential operators. Such
operators transform spaces of functions by taking derivatives and multiplying by
coefficients. They are often used to represent physical systems. In this
situation, their spectrum, a set of numbers determined by how the operator acts
on the space, corresponds to possible energy levels of the system. More
specifically, Professor Johnson will study linear ordinary differential
operators with bounded but non-decaying coefficients (which might be almost
periodic, or might be typical paths of a stationary ergodic process). Using
techniques from dynamical systems theory, he will study spectral properties and
generalized Floquet exponents for such operators. He will apply his results to
the following areas among others: bifurcation from invariant tori in nonlinear
dynamical systems; the Korteweg -deVries equation with bounded initial data;
relations of this to string theory via the Virasoro algebra; the topological
index theory of periodic and non-periodic differential equations, and its
relation with the homology theory of certain operator algebras.
