The PI will conduct research on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) including
partitioning algorithms among several FPGAs, computers and memories; developing
hardware efficient algorithms; and exploring interactive visualization methods.
The research will be applied to bioinformatics. The PI has experience with using
FPGAs for global sequence comparison. They will consider other bioinformatics
algorithms such as simulated annealing for task partitioning, BLAST and FASTA
for sequences for applications of FPGAs. The project is working with the North
Carolina bioinformatics program. New university initiatives in bioinformatics
including a new $35 million center at UNC Charlotte will provide a setting to
maximize impact.&lt;br/&gt;The research will be integrated into education
programs and courses at the university; the PI will use team-based projects and
problem based learning to enhance education. The PI plans a WWW site to share
results and process data from other universities through a JAVA
interface.&lt;br/&gt;
