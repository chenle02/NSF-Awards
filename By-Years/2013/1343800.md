Geoscience and environmental science software is crucial for data analysis and
generating new knowledge and understanding about the Earth. Because
reproducibility of operations, calculations, and predictions done with this
software is important for science, commercial, and regulatory applications, it
is important that the software generated by geoscientists and their colleagues
be captured, curated, managed, and made available to all interested parties upon
request. This project initiates that process by building partnerships between
computer scientist, software developers, and scientists across all geoscience
domains with the goal or creating a software ecosystem and a culture of software
stewardship that will empower geoscientists and others to make their software
accessible and manage it as a valuable scientific asset. This work will examine
the possibility of creating effective on-line tools that will guide users
through best practices in software use and development, including componentizing
codes, describing and documenting their codes, licensing their programs, and
maintaining reusable code. It will also explore the best and most effective
means for training geoscientists and providing appropriate educational/training
materials to dramatically improve the ability of geoscientists to more
effectively develop and curate software generated by themselves, their students,
and others. Broader impacts of the work include building infrastructure for
science, engagement of early career professionals in both computer and
geoscience, and increasing cyber sophistication of geoscience practitioners. The
project supports a core team that is geographically distributed (California,
Pennsylvania, and Colorado) and partners with a nation-wide consortium of
academic organizations dedicated to advancing geoscience geospatial needs.
