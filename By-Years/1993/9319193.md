ABSTRACT P.I. John Fleagle SBR-9319193 The origins of monkeys and apes in
Africa are not well understood. The best finds for the earliest "higher
primates" come from Egypt (the Fayum Depression) during the Oligocene, but they
are very primitive indeed, and may well not lead to the clearly "African" monkey
and ape fossils that appear about 10 million years later, from the Miocene
deposits across East Africa. This Exploratory Grant in Anthropological Research
will examine very promising sediments in northern Kenya, on the northern edge of
East Africa, from the Oligocene and Miocene period. It is very likely they will
find primate and mammalian fossils connecting the times and geographic areas
already known, and may well dramatically change our understanding of those
ancestral forms leading to the flourescence of monkeys and apes in Africa. ***
