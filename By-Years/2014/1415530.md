This proposal provides travel support for the 2013 Energy CPS workshop, covering
speakers, breakout session moderators, and scribes important to the workshop's
overall success. Support will also be provided to enable the participation of
underrepresented minorities and women, to ensure the discussions will represent
important and emerging areas throughout the CPS and energy research communities.
The intellectual merit of the proposal is due to the important nature of the
workshop -- to define a research agenda for cyber-physical systems in the
context of energy. The broader impact is due to the pervasive nature of energy
in CPS, and the generation of a long-range research agenda as well as the
formulation of new collaborative teams pursuing efforts in this space.
