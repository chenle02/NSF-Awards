Hill The goal of this project is to design hardware and software for scalable
shared-address-space computers. Cooperative shared memory, the approach taken in
the project, provides a simple design for shared-memory hardware and a
programming model that can be used by programmers and compilers to understand an
application's communication behavior. Cooperative shared memory uses simple
directory hardware together with a set of pragmas for use in applications
software. The pragmas allow the applications software to indicate which
processors will be using a block of memory: a processor can check out a block
when it expects frequent use, check it back in when it is done, and can indicate
that it expects to check out a block in the near future. Simple directory
hardware can be used to place checked-out-memory locations in the caches of the
appropriate processors. Common state transitions in the directory protocol are
implemented in hardware, while the less common ones use software traps. Note
that the pragmas and the resulting hardware actions affect only the execution
speed of a program, not its correctness. A new virtual prototyping approach is
being used for evaluating the new architecture. The Wisconsin Wind Tunnel runs
parallel shared-memory programs on a parallel message-passing computer and
concurrently evaluates the programs execution times on proposed hardware using a
distributed simulation. The simulation runs quickly because instructions that
make only local memory references are executed directly.
