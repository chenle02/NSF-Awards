This award provides funding to defray travel related expenses of participants at
the conference "Midwestern Workshop on Asymptotic Analysis" that will be held at
Indiana University- Purdue University Indianapolis, October 6-8,
2017.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on recent developments in
Analysis, especially in the fields of mathematical physics, approximation
theory, and complex analysis. A number of distinguished mathematicians have
agreed to attend and speak at this conference. This award gives early career
researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF
and the like an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference. The
organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to
target groups through a number of different activities. More information will be
