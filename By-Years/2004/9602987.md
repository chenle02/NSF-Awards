This six-month award will support the participation of a Jon Miller of the
Chicago Academy of Sciences in an organizational meeting concerning a cross-
national survey of the public understanding and assessment of biotechnology,
headed by John Durant of the Science Museum of London in the U.K., and funded by
the European Union. The objective of US attendance at the organizational meeting
is to participate in the development of the questionnaire to be used in the
European survey. The U.S. investigator brings to this effort considerable
expertise in science literacy, public understanding of science and technology,
and in biomedical science, as well as experience in comparative efforts that
include Canada, the European Union, and Japan. The European PI heads a European
Union team that will conduct a cross-national project that will analyze
biotechnology development in each of the 15 member states, and identify the
commonalities across participating countries. The U.S. investigator will provide
the US perspective to this initial phase of the study.
