With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Wake Forest University will acquire a single crystal
X-ray diffractometer with CCD detector for small molecule diffractometry. This
equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including studies on a)
platinum group metals as DNA metalating and crosslinking agents; b) development
of a photoreversible enzyme inhibitor that activates by visible light; c) the
various roles nitroc oxide performs in biological systems; d) preparation of
low-dimensional cluster materials; and e) reaction mechanisms and structural
aspects of DNA-targeting natural products. &lt;br/&gt;The X-ray diffractometer
allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure
of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and it provides accurate
information about the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the
neighboring molecules. These studies will have an impact in a number of areas,
including materials chemistry and biochemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
