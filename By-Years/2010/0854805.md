This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neutrons and protons, the constituents
of the atomic nucleus, are composed of quarks. We study how this quark
substructure appears in nuclear physics. We focus on tests of charge symmetry,
which would be exact if protons and neutrons were identical. We study details of
the strong force binding the atomic nucleus, concentrating on reactions where
one observes all final reaction products. We carry out simulations of electrons
or atoms moving in small two-dimensional nanoscale systems, where the wave
nature of particles produces large effects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
impacts involve training of undergraduates and postdocs, who become expert in
complex systems with application to technology, defense, communications and
finance. Recent postdocs have included several women. The PI gives seminars on
advances in physics for non-scientists, increasing scientific literacy in the
general population. The PI and his students volunteer at a children's science
museum. He participated in a year-long study "Science and American Public
Democracy."
