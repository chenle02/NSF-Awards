9500083 Song This project investigates the problem of order-based approach to
inventory management. In order-based inventory control, the relationship between
the demand of items is considered in setting the parameters for inventory
control. This is against the item-based approach which assumes that the demand
of items in a system are independent of one another. The objective of this
research is to undertake a preliminary study to investigate the effectiveness of
using order-based approach to inventory control. The study will also determine
how to set the inventory levels for items in an order-based system. Components
of the study includes modeling, performance measure evaluation, optimization,
and comparison. Correlated demand of items is a common event in inventory
systems. The outcome of this research is expected to assist inventory control
managers to effectively manage the procurement of correlated items to minimize
unnecessary inventory buildup and cost. It will also provide some insight on how
to characterize the inventory behavior of items with correlated demands. This
will help manufacturers and distributors improve their customer service. ***
