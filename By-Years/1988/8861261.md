In order to evaluate the performance of a concrete structure it is necessary to
establish the condition of the concrete. This project will investigate the
feasibility of using a laser pulse method to generate the ultrasonic signal and
analysis of the return signal to determine the degree of concrete degradation.
This method will be the new technique to inspect concrete.
