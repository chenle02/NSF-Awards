Broader Significance:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ebola is an RNA virus characterized
by a high mutation rate. The genetic diversity of RNA viruses enables them to
adapt to varying conditions over the course of infection and keep proliferating.
Estimating viral genetic diversity is essential for the understanding of their
origin and mutation patterns, and for the development of effective drug
treatments. A viral population is characterized by the sequences and frequencies
of the genomes that comprise it. High-throughput DNA sequencing technologies
enable fast and affordable analysis of viral genomes. However, errors and
limited read lengths of high-throughput sequencing platforms render the problem
of estimating viral genetic diversity
challenging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical
Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this research is to develop novel
algorithms for determining and analyzing genetic diversity of RNA viruses and
applying them to the analysis of the Ebola virus. The investigator specifically
aims to: (1) Develop correlation clustering framework and computationally
efficient methods for estimating viral genetic diversity from high-throughput
sequencing data. In this line of research, reconstruction of viral genomes is
cast as the max-k-cut problem and efficiently solved using semi-definite
programming. (2) Design graphical models and belief propagation algorithms for
inferring viral genomes in a diverse set analyzed with high-throughput
sequencing technologies. The focus of this research thrust is on scalable
message-passing methods for estimating viral genetic diversity. (3) Relying on
the developed methods, analyze the diversity of the Ebola virus using publicly
available high-throughput sequencing data. The results of the outlined work are
expected to have an immediate impact on the understanding of the Ebola outbreak
mechanisms and virus mutation patterns.
