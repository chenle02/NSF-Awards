9360836 Oh The proposed technique will utilize a tunable, wavelength modulated
UV beam near 308 nm, generated by sum frequency mixing the output of a high
power single mode diode laser with the single frequency output from an Ar+ laser
in a nonlinear crystal, to access the OH A 2 + X 2 band. This approach promises
to yield good temporal and spatial resolution in tropospheric OH measurements
due to improved detection sensitivity by high frequency wavelength modulation
detection. In Phase I, laboratory experiments will be conducted to generate the
frequency modulated UV beam and to measure OH radicals in a discharge-flow
reactor. The results of these experiments will provide a basis for critical
assessment of the feasibility of this technique for tropospheric measurements
and will establish the crucial design parameters for development of field
instrumentation in Phase II. ***
