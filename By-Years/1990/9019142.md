The principal investigator and several colleagues will organize the
interdisciplinary meeting entitled "Converging Approaches in Computational
Biology". The aim of this conference will be to identify those computational
tools common to several disciplines and to facilitate an exchange among
computational biologists in an interdisciplinary atmosphere. The proposed
meeting will bring together scientists working in a wide range of disciplines
(such as x-ray crystallography, electron microscopy, sequence analysis,
neurophysiological signal processing) with the purpose of encouraging
interdisciplinary exchange on underlying concepts of mathematical modeling and
techniques of numerical analysis in biology.
