The dynamics of western boundary currents in the ocean will be considered in
this work. This theoretical investigation will address the problem of
recirculation by analyzing the transformation of properties such as potential
vorticity as the current departs from the western margin of the ocean. In
addition, the work will address the context of separation in the larger ocean
energy balance.
