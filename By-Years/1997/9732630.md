9732630 Boothby This grant provides partial support for the PI to visit India to
meet with Dr. Abhijit Mukherjee, of the Department of Chemical Engineering at
the Indian Institute of Technology in Bombay, for the purpose of finalizing
plans for a cooperative research project on the use of Fiber Reinforced Polymer
(FRP) materials for the repair of deteriorated concrete and masonry structures
and historic buildings. FRP materials were originally developed for the
aerospace industry, and they are now starting to be considered for the repair of
many deteriorating concrete and masonry structures throughout the world. but
little information exists on their behavior or durability when used in such
repair work. Boothby and Mukherjee will visit several sites to inspect damaged
structures and discuss with other professionals the extent of the repairs to be
made in order to determine which structures to include in their cooperative
research project.
