The derivation of terrestrial paleotemperatures is complicated because there
are few indicators of climate that are solely related to temperature. As a
result there are discrepencies between estimates based on different methods.
Furthermore, there is a serious difference between temperatures estimated for
the marine and terrestrial tropics during the last glaciation. This proposal
presents a novel approach to reconstruct paleotemperatures in terrestrial
environments. It is based on the known temperature dependence of the solubility
of noble gases in water. By sampling 20,000 year old water in two aquifers, the
PIs will be able to estimate past temperatures by determining their noble gas
concentration. This research is important because the new method is based on
sound chemical principles and it will help to resolve important discrepencies
between other estimates of glacial surface temperatures.
