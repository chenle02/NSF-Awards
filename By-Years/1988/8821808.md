This award will allow the measurement of stable isotopes on the new deep ice
core and surface snow collected at Summit, Greenland as part of the second
Greenland Ice Sheet Project (GISP II). The investigation will measure and
interpret stable hydrogen isotope ratios (del D values) and, in collaboration
with Dr. Pieter Grootes, University of Washington, will measure and interpret
deuterium excess values. Del D and del 18 O values in ice cores change in
response to changes in paleotemperatures, the rate of snow accumulation, and the
elevation of the ice sheet at the core site. Del D and del 18 values are also
useful in counting annual snow layers during the Holocene, and are thus helpful
in dating and in determining accumulation rates during this period. Deuterium
excess values will also be used to reconstruct evaporation conditions over the
ocean, information needed to interpret delta values as well as to infer shifts
in the moisture source regions over the ocean during the past.
