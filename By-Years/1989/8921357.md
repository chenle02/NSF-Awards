The proposed work addressed issues of obvious importance to society : the
measurement of post-school investments and their profitability, changes in
investment volumes and profitability over time, the contribution of these
investments to economic growth , the interrelation of these investments with
technological change and the substitutability between schooling and post-
schooling investments. The work will estimate the economy-wide investment in on-
the-job training, including both the opportunity costs borne by workers and
employer investments in training. These estimates will be based on two important
microeconomic data sets - the Panel Survey on Income Dynamics and the Current
Population Survey. The direct estimates obtained from these data sets are to be
compared to estimates of the same costs based on wage profiles. They will also
be used to verify the human capital interpretation of wage profiles. Another
focus of the work is on the responses of this type of human capital formation to
technological changes and the contribution made thereby to economic growth.
