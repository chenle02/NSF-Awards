This research studies the ways in which political and social configurations
enable some governments to commit themselves to sustainable macroeconomic
policies. Economists have stressed how important sound macroeconomic management
is for sustaining economic development. However, in the past decade many
developing countries have reneged on their commitment to economic restructuring
and reform. In turn this has led to declining economies. This research uses
Indonesia and Nigeria as case studies to compare the political conditions and
informal institutional arrangements that enable some governments to commit to
and implement sound macroeconomic policies. The research focuses on the role of
coordination in solving problems of credible commitment and in lengthening the
time horizons of politicians. In-depth surveys of policy elites and the
collection of economic data help test the theoretical concepts of committing to
economic reform.
