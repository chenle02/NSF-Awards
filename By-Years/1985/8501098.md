This research is concerned with the problem of estimating parameters in systems
which have noncausal impulse responses. Such systems arise in a number of signal
processing applications such as seismic processing. The approach is to derive
state variable models for one-dimensional noncausal systems and to develop
maximum-likelihood solutions to the problem of estimating the unknown parameters
in these models.
