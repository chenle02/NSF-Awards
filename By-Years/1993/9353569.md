This is an exploratory interview study with high school students in the greater
New York metropolitan area to determine what attitudes, competencies, and
motivations explain why some students who are taking low-level, academically
dead-end math courses, and who may be doing poorly in them, nevertheless express
positive attitudes toward math, and report that success in mathematics will be
important for their careers and lives. Generally, the educational psychology
literature reports a correlation between achievement in a subject, but among
Blacks especially this relationship does not always hold. If the factors in such
a situation can be elucidated, effective encouragement and intervention by
school personnel may be made possible.
