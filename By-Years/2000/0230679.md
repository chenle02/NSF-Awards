PROPOSAL NO.: 0230679 PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Fiez, Terri INSTITUTION NAME:
Oregon State University TITLE: Reforming Undergraduate Engineering Education
Using an Integrated Platform for Learning

Abstract

The planning grant will be used to develop new curricula for both Electrical and
Computer Engineering and Mechanical Engineering at Oregon State University. A
platform for learning is used to integrate the curriculum.. Beginning in the
freshman year, students build on the platform (in this case a robot we call
TekBots) so that subject areas become connected and students have a context for
their learning similar to what practicing engineers experience in their
profession. As students take courses throughout the program, they apply their
knowledge to this platform so that it becomes a representation of what they have
learned and how the various topics they have learned are connected. A key part
of developing this curriculum is also enhancing stakeholder-defined goals and
outcomes such as those in the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology
(ABET) criteria. The proposed curriculum will be designed to specifically
enhance these outcomes and, the will determine if and how much the platform for
learning curriculum improves each of these outcomes.
