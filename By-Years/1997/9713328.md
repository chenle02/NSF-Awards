The purpose of the workshop is to bring together experts for intensive
discussions of progress and prospects in the technologies of polarized ion and
electron beams and polarized gas targets. Measurement of spin observables at
IUCF, TJNAF, Bates, and HERMES is a high priority for nuclear physics as
outlined in the NSAC Long Range Plan.
