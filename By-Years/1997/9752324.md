This project is directed towards introducing cultural diversity into the
Microbiology curriculum while at the same time establishing a model for such
efforts in other scientific fields. This involves the creation of a casebook
that provides alternative examples to biological concepts, the use of these case
studies as a pedagogical tool, and dissemination of both the case studies and
methods for using them. For example, fermentation is illustrated by the
manufacture of soy sauce, a product that is consumed by half of the world' s
population and is the basis for a multi-billion dollar industry. There are two
principal objectives in preparing this material: To show the relevance of
biology in different cultural contexts, and to familiarize students with the
idea of appropriate technologies (defined as the choice of a product/process
that will fulfill a specific need in a manner that is appropriate to a
particular cultural and economic environment). Undergraduates were involved in
the research and writing of these case studies in the context of honors
seminars. Dissemination of the book and the use of case studies is being
accomplished through collaboration with professional organizations in developing
faculty workshops.
