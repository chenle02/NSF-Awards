This project is a three year program that includes a summer workshop offering
secondary science and mathematics teachers an integrated program of biology,
mathematics and curriculum change. The central theme of the workshops is
Conservation Biology. Approximate equal numbers of mathematics and science
teachers will be selected to participate from a nationwide pool, though
preference will be given to teachers from the Northwest region of the United
States. Preference will also be given to teams of mathematics and science
teachers from the same school or school district. During the course of the
program, two overlapping workshops (26 teachers in each, beginning in
consecutive summers) will be conducted. Each workshop will take place over two
summers and include a four week residential summer workshop, an interim academic
year, and a one week residential session the following summer. The first summer
session combines field work, laboratories, seminars, and lectures in biology,
mathematics and curriculum development. During the intervening year,
participants will test program changes in their home institutions while
interacting with fellow participants and faculty through a computer network. The
final one week session, during the second summer, provides opportunities for
participants to share successes and difficulties, develop future plans, and
reinforce the participants' commitment to curriculum development. An amount
equal to 13% of NSF costs will be provided as cost sharing
