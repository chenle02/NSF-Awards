Loredana Lanzani and her collaborators will explore a number of fundamental
questions in the area of Several Complex Variables and Partial Differential
Equations, with emphasis onthe ambient domain's lack of boundary regularity. To
accomplish these goals Loredana Lanzani and her collaborators will develop new
techniques that hinge upon an interplay of complex analysis and harmonic
analysis.

Several Complex Variables, Harmonic Analysis and Partial Differential Equations
are major branches of mathematics. They are of paramount importance in pure and
applied sciences and have vastly contributed to our present-day understanding of
such basic phenomena as heat transfer and celestial mechanics.
