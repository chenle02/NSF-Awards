The PI's request funding for an ocean observation Research Coordination Network
(RCN:OceanObsNetwork). The goal of the RCN is to foster a broad, multi-
disciplinary dialogue, enabling more effective use of ocean observatories and
observing systems consistent with national and international efforts. The major
RCN activities are: increasing observing systems sustainability; stimulating
inter-disciplinary cooperation; facilitating open data exchange; promoting
interoperability; improving the flow of information to key stakeholders; and
expanding effective capacity building. The proposed RCN will be the seed for a
long-term, sustainable international forum on observatories for scientists and
users of ocean information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This effort will encourage new partnerships, provide for
new and innovative research outcomes and provide younger scientists with
opportunities to lead technical task teams under senior Network mentors and
facilitate both technical and leadership capacity building in under-represented
groups. An emphasis on interoperability and exchange of data will both allow
closer cooperation between observatories and also support improved global
modeling. Interfacing with end users of information, whether in the government,
academia or industry, will increase use of data, providing more visible impacts
of observatories and ocean observing systems. Observatories are major
investments and broadening the user community will help long-term sustainability
of the systems.
