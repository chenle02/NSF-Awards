The principal investigator will study the problems of smoothing parameter
(bandwidth) selection for nonparametric models, and order selection for linear
models. Nonparametric and linear models have been used extensively in many
fields. Although there are many procedures available for selecting the bandwidth
or the order, it is recognized that the classical selectors are subject to large
sample variation, and thus may not be very useful in practice. Recently, using
the technique of Fourier analysis, the investigator proposed some stabilized
procedures to reduce the variation in selecting the bandwidth for kernel
regression of density estimation. This project will follow the approach recently
obtained by the investigator to study the bandwidth or order selection problems
for several important cases, which include boundary effects, random design
points, order selection for autoregressive processes, extraction of periodic
components, point processes, and robust smoothers.
