To enrich proposed curricular changes in introductory biology courses
(Principles of General Biology, Honors General Biology, and other courses) a new
computer component is being introduced into the laboratory that stresses
developing problem-posing, problem-solving and persuasion skills in beginning
scientists. This computing environment includes MacIntosh IIci computers,
supporting graphics-capable printers, and networking, and employs BioQUEST
software.
