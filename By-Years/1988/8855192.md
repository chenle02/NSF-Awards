The Wake Forest Young Scholars in Computer Science summer project will allow
students with interests in computer science, mathematics and science to study
together topics in Models of Computation and Problem Solving. The project is a
non-residential program held on the campus of Wake Forest University. In
addition to seminar and laboratory sessions, there will be tours of local highly
technical industries, career discussions with resource persons from the
community, information about college admissions and career planning, and
discussions concerning ethical issues facing the computer science community.
Participants will be recruited from the high schools in the locally surrounding
counties, as well as the North Carolina School for Science and Mathematics.
