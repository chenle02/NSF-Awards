A Statistics Resource Center of 12 NeXT computer workstations is being developed
to serve as a distributed electronic library and laboratory for the teaching and
learning of probability and statistics. This equipment supports a major project
to develop an interdisciplinary ensemble of computer-based lessons known as the
"Statistics Source" to support the teaching and use of statistical analysis
throughout the social sciences. In addition to all the social sciences, faculty
from biology, environmental science, and mathematics are participating in a
multidisciplinary design team to create the Statistics Source and the Statistics
Toolbox, a collection of both commercial and locally developed, custom
statistical tools for students to use in their everyday work in social and
natural sciences. This project provides faculty throughout the social and
natural sciences an instructional infrastructure sufficient for them to
integrate statistics and probability theory and their applications into a large
number of courses.
