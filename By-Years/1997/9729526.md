9729526 Lawton This U.S.-Brazil award will support research collaboration
between Dr. Michael A. Lawton of Rutgers University and Drs. Marcio Lamais and
Helaine Carrer of Universidade de Sao Paulo in Brazil. Most plants undergo a
symbiotic interaction with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. This interaction
is important for nutrient assimilation and for plant growth and health, yet
there is scant information regarding the molecular and genetic basis for AM
colonization of plants. The investigators plan to use gene tagging techniques to
characterize plant genes whose expression is associated with specific stages of
AM infection. The three investigators each bring a unique expertise to this
project. Dr. Lambais is an expert in plant:AM interactions, Dr. Carrer is expert
in plant transformation and molecular genetics, and Dr. Lawton in molecular
biology of plant:pathogen interactions. The final result of this work will be a
collection of tagged plants that will be of general use, made freely available
to the research community. ***
