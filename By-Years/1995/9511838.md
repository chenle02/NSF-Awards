9511838 Elser This Americas Program award will support travel and related
expenses for eleven U.S. scientists and five graduate students, to participate
in a joint U.S./Mexico workshop to be held in Guaymas, Mexico. Organizers are
Dr. James Elser, Arizona State University, and Dr. Edward Pfeiler, Instituto
Tecnologico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (ITESM), Sonora, Mexico. The
workshop will focus on the environmental biology of the coastal Sonoran region
as a step towards increasing scientific exchange between U.S. and Mexican
scientists in this ecologically diverse desert-ocean landscape. The potential
for transnational and global environmental disruptions, including climate
change, pollutant transport across international boundaries, and biodiversity
loss, has increased with the global economy. This potential is especially strong
in the environmentally sensitive and economically dynamic U.S.-Mexico boundary
region and calls for increased international scientific exchanges in the area of
basic and applied environmental biology. This workshop will bring together
senior scientists, and students from both the U.S. and Mexico, to identify
research questions of mutual interest for future investigations. ***
