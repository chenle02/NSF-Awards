This proposal is for a grant to support research in Systems and Control Theory
for Power Systems, part of the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications
(IMA) program for 1992-1993. Specifically the grant would provide partial
support for 8 participants in the workshop Systems and Control Theory for Power
Systems. The prospective participants are among the most outstanding and
productive researchers in the field of the application of mathematical theory to
power system problems. Additional support is expected from the Electric Power
Research Institute . The workshop proceedings will be published in the series,
IMA Volumes in Mathematics and its Applications.
