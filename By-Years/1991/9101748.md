The relative motion between the Cocos, Nazca and Pacific plates will be
determined in a kinematic study that extends recent work on the confidence
intervals of finite rotations to encompass confidence intervals on the six
parameters necessary to describe finite rotations of a three-plate circuit. The
determined spreading rates (with vigorous error bars) should offer an
improvement over existing calibrations of the young end of the magnetic reversal
time scale.
