9455980 Giordano A Consortium of schools committed to the use of
interdisciplinary projects throughout their undergraduate programs in
mathematics, science, engineering and technology is being developed. The
Consortium is planning to produce interdisciplinary application projects which
weld mathematics with the concepts of coequal disciplines, to promote curricular
reorganization focusing on student growth in modeling and problem solving, and
to promote faculty growth through engaging them in such developmental
activities.
