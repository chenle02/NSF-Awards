This award provides support for International Press Lecture Series II: Invariant
Theory and Combinatorics of Representations, which will be held at the
University of California at Irvine in January 1997. The conference will
emphasize the interdisciplinary nature of representation theory. Roger Howe will
give the three main one-hour lectures. Other participants in the conference will
come from the disciplines of geometric invariant theory, combinatorics,
representation theory, and group theory. There will be ten supplementary
lectures from mathematicians in these disciplines. The subject matter of this
conference is connected to several different areas of mathematics, including
invariant theory and combinatorics. In general, invariant theory involves the
actions of linear algebraic groups on manifolds or linear spaces and the
determination of the mathematical invariants of the space under these group
actions. Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how discrete
collections of objects can be arranged. The behavior of discrete systems is
extremely important to modern communications.
