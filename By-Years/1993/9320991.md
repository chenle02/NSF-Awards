The behavior of individuals with respect to risks to their health or to the
environment may be significantly affected by how they perceive the risks. This
has implications for public health and environmental policy designed to remedy
or manage these risks. Further, differences in risk perception may increase
confrontations between various groups in society or may render public policy
aimed at health protection and risk management ineffective. Careful, in-depth
studies of distinctive social groups and their interaction with health and
environmental risks can inform risk theory and promote the development and
implementation of more effective public policies. This study contributes to the
understanding of risk perception formation and the influences of psychological,
social and cultural factors in Native American populations, specifically, the
Mvskoke of Oklahoma. Ethnographic methods and a survey instrument will be
developed that integrate psychometric and cultural factors in risk perception to
capture a richer framework for addressing the risk responses of diverse cultural
groups.
