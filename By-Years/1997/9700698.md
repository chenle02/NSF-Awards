9700698 Zehnder A combined experimental and modeling study is being conducted to
characterize the frictional behavior of tool-chip interface and to understand
the relationship between wear of the cutting tool and the dynamic response of
the too-workpiece system. The experimental observations include recording the
dynamic temperature variations near the tool-chip interface, the dynamic, full-
field surface deformations on both the chip and the workpiece, and tool wear
measurements. The data are used along with finite elements to develop models to
predict tool wear. ***
