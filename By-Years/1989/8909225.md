The aim of this ROW Career Advancement Award is to elucidate in molecular terms
the basis for the male/hermaphrodite decision in a nematode by performing an
extensive molecular analysis of two genes that play a central role in that
decision. While some downstream sex determination genes have been cloned in
other laboratories, this research represents the first molecular analysis of the
genes that coordinately control both sex determination and dosage compensation.
This research is of intrinsic interest and will contribute invaluable
comparative perspective on the molecular mechanisms of sex determination.
