This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II research project will address
the continued development of a novel sensor to enable form and finish of complex
microscale structures as well as extend the technology to larger parts requiring
three dimensional surface profilometry. The company is partnering with a global
leader in the metrology industry to adapt this sensor and the corresponding
gauging technology to their coordinate measuring machine. The culmination of
this work will be a capstone industry specific demonstration on a new three
dimensional surface profiler. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this
research is the ability to provide a measurement capability not currently
possible in one tool. Form and surface finish are inseparable in manufacturing
and significantly impact functionality of a component in industries ranging from
medical implant (for orthopedic bearing surfaces) to automotive (crank shafts or
injector spray holes). Product reliability in these applications depends on the
quality of the subcomponents and mating parts which is defined by the capability
of the measurement technology. This measurement tool will provide a new
measurement capability that will ultimately give better understanding of the
manufacturing process and therefore the ability to make a higher quality and
safer product.
