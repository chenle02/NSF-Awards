The goals of this three-year research project include investigation of the
operation of devices based on alternate device technologies, including p-channel
strained SixGe1-x and narrow-width SOI device structures. The simulation tools
that will be developed for this purpose will begin at the semi-classical
Boltzmann equation level in the hierarchy of approximations, and extend to
direct simulation of quantum transport within various approximation schemes at
the most fundamental level. The main goals are to&lt;br/&gt;develop tools based
on direct solution of the semiclassical Boltzman equation using either full-band
or non-parabolic energy band models. These techniques will be combined with
robust, multi-processor field solvers based on multi-grid and Bi-CGSTAB methods
including non-uniform grids for arbitrary device geometries. Discrete impurity
effects will be included through a quantum molecular dynamics scheme to assess
the fluctuation in device operating characteristics based on random impurity
distributions. Collaboration with industrial partners will be undertaken for
comparison and calibration with state of the art device technologies. Due to the
computational demands of both 3D semi-classical and quantum device modeling, the
proposed research will be supported by high-performance computing environments
based on distributed workstation clusters. In addition to research, there will
be significant educational enhancements that will accompany this research
project. These include introduction of new classes in the area of Computational
Electronics, Web-based activities and inclusion of minorities and undergraduates
in research. As such, they will help introduce our graduate students to the
challenging world of Computational Electronics in both Industry and
Academia.&lt;br/&gt;
