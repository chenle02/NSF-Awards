Abstract Proposal No: 9727165 Proposal Type: SGER Principal Investigator: Josef
Michl Affiliation: University of Colorado This grant is awarded through the
Separations and Purification Program sub-element of the Interfacial, Transport
and Separations Program of the Chemical and Transport Systems Division. The
principal investigator is Dr. Josef Michl of the University of Colorado at
Boulder. The research will test a new concept in the two-dimensional cross-
linking polymerization of molecular modules into covalent molecular grids. This
will permit the crosslinking to be both revsersible, thus permitting annealing
to highly regular 2-D crystalline structures, and irreversible, making the grids
very sturdy and useful for applications. These seemingly contradictory
requirements will be met by separating the initial reversible organization of
the grid through weakly and reversibly binding ("phantom") couplers in time from
the final fixing of the grid through strongly and irreversibly binding real
couplers. The preparation of ultrathin molecular grids with controllable opening
dimensions and selectable chemical functionalization would open new horizons in
membrane science. Such 2-D molecular sieves would be capable of handling
extremely high fluxes and pore blockage would also be minimized. Successful
research could have a major impact on separations technology.
