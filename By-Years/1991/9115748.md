This award supports the cross-disciplinary efforts and the development of
research collaboration involving quantitative modelling in the geosciences. In
particular this research team of a statistician and a geologist will focus on
the development of bivariate time series methodology suitable for the analysis
of varve records for the purpose of dating.
