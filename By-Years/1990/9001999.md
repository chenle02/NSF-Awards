Dr. Daryl R. Sauer has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Sauer's doctoral degree was from the University of South Florida
under the supervision of Professor Stewart Schneller. Dr. Sauer intends to
continue research at Ohio State University under the sponsorship of Professor
Leo Paquette. Dr. Sauer's area of postdoctoral training and research will be the
design and synthesis of architecturally novel compounds of theoretical interest,
development of new synthetic methodology, and the synthesis of natural and
unnatural molecules which possess biological activity. The Postdoctoral
Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural
program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.Ds and
attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and
teaching.
