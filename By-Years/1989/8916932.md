Pyroclastic flows are poorly understood, hazardous mixtures of expanding gas and
hot ash that can move tens of kilometers at velocities in excess of 100 km/sec.
Pyroclastic flows are dangerous to observe and rarely coincide with
researchers'timing. This project, therefore, will begin a multi-disciplinary
study to investigate how pyroclastic flows work. Pyroclastic density currents
can be produced in the laboratory by pouring 600oC. ash down an inclined surface
that is moistened with water. Preliminary experiments successfully produce flows
with many of the features of natural pyroclastic flows. A moving flow has three
parts; a sediment-rich basal avalanche, an overriding ash cloud surge and a
convecting ash cloud. The environmental conditions of experimental flows can be
easily controlled individually and the effects on the flow noted. Of principle
concern are the factors that affect the mobility of pyroclastic flows because of
the obvious importance of runout in hazard assesment. The results of such a
study are likely to improve the assesment of hazards due to pyroclastic flows,
which is a serious societal responsibility for volcanologists.
