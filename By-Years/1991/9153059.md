The Department of Physics is using laser physics and spectroscopy to enhance
student understanding in optics, quantum mechanics, and atomic physics.
Experiments in interference phenomena, use of a spectrum analyzer, the
investigation of longitudinal and transverse laser modes and absorption laser
spectroscopy are being done.
