This project deals with volume synthesis, its theoretical framework, its
underlying voxelization algorithms for synthesizing volumetric (voxel-based)
objects from their geometric description, and its discrete rendering algorithms
for visualizing these objects. The three main objectives of this research are:
(1) to study the theoretical framework in 3D discrete topology for the
voxelization and discrete rendering algorithms in order to guarantee the
generation of a `well-behaved` discrete representation in terms of connectivity,
thickness, separability, minimization, coverage, and accuracy; (2) to develop
and implement efficient voxelization algorithms for 3D lines, 3D circles,
surfaces, and solids, using a variety of connectivities, thicknesses, and
spatial occupancies, with a specific focus on both binary and non- binary
(`fuzzy`) voxelization; and (3) to develop and implement discrete algorithms
that capitalize on the discrete representation of the volume buffer for fast
viewing of the scene, using approaches such as volumetric ray tracing and
template-based projection.
