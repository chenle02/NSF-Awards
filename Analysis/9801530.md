Proposal: DMS-9801530 Principal Investigator: Alexander Kiselev Abstract: The
research will focus mainly on two objectives. The first is to study the general
relationships between the behavior of solutions of the generalized eigenfunction
equation, spectral properties and quantum dynamics of Schroedinger (and more
generally elliptic) operators on infinite domains in any dimension. The second
objective is the investigation of spectral and dynamical properties of concrete
quantum mechanical systems. The goal is the development of a new spectral
analysis technique for studying fine structure in the essential spectra of
Schroedinger operators (that is, the decomposition of the essential spectrum
into absolutely continuous, singular continuous and pure point components). In
addition to spectral information, the new methods may yield valuable results
about quantum dynamics of various systems via new relations between the behavior
of solutions of generalized eigenfunction equation, spectral measures, and
quantum dynamics. This technique may have potential applications to and will
provide further insight into many important problems, in particular such as
models of quasicrystals, the Anderson model and other models involving random or
ergodic potentials, and Schroedinger operators with slowly decaying potentials.
The spectral and dynamical theory of Schroedinger operators is the cornerstone
of Quantum Mechanics. This theory describes the laws which govern the behavior
of quantum particles, such as electrons, atoms and molecules. Much of the
fundamental scientific knowledge about many important physical processes (such
as, for example, chemical reactions or conduction properties of various
materials) comes from the theory of Schroedinger operators. This proposal
focuses on the development of the new methods in spectral and dynamical theory
of Schroedinger operators which may allow a new approach to some long-standing
problems in Quantum Mechanics. These problems concern, in particular, the cond
uctance properties of materials with impurities and of quasicrystals, and have
direct applications to modern engineering devices, wave guides and transistors
to name two.
