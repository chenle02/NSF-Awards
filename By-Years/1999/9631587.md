9613587 Blanchard The goal of this research is to provide opportunities for
senior students in the Biological and Agricultural Engineering (BAE) Department
at North Carolina State University to design, build, and deliver projects to aid
the disabled. The completed projects will be given to specific clients or groups
of clients to the Tammy Lynn Center (which provides residential and educational
programs for children and adults with developmental delays) and the Governor
Morehead School (the only state-supported school in North Carolina specializing
solely in comprehensive educational and residential programs for students with
visual impairments), both in Raleigh, North Carolina. Through this effort, BAE
students will be able to directly improve the quality of one or more lives while
gaining valuable design experience for themselves. They will also be exposed to
new possibilities for future study and work in rehabilitation engineering.
Twenty-one potential projects have been identified by the staff at the Tammy
Lynn Center (e.g., outdoor swing for an adult wheel chair, voice-activated
multi-sensory toy with interchangeable parts, low cost bath chair for raising
and lowering a 100%-assisted person, etc.), while six additional projects have
been proposed by the staff at the Governor Morehead School (e.g., balanced ball
that makes a sound or plays music only when triggered by a remote device,
combination locks that can be used by the visually impaired on their school
lockers). The proposal anticipates the design, building, and delivery of an
average of 12 projects per year over a 5-year period. ***
