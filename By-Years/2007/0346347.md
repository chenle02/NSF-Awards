CAREER: Extragalactic Stellar
Populations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AST 0346347 Guy
Worthey&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Guy Worthey, at Washington State University,
will undertake a program of research in several areas related to galaxy
evolution, using spectroscopic and photometric integrated-light observations.
The goal of this research is to increase the accuracy of the spectroscopic
measurement of the mean age of stellar populations in non-star-forming galaxies,
to provide clues about galaxy formation. New spectral indices will be developed,
to allow for the measurement of abundances in galactic bulges, elliptical and
so-called "lenticular" galaxies, and quiescent regions in spiral galaxies. The
work will also generate useful "byproducts", including new observational and
theoretical libraries of stellar spectra, high quality spectra of galaxies, a
new spectral index system and new observations of stars and star clusters needed
to calibrate the models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential use of integrated
starlight observations to derive chemical abundances has broad impact across
many disciplines. The PI plans to develop the local "Project ASTRO" outreach
program, and will undertake a new initiative to develop a variation on Project
ASTRO to reach out to the Coeur d'Alene and Nez Perce reservation schools.
