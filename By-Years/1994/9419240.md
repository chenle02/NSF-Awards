9419240 Yogodzinski An ion microprobe and isotopic study of Aleutian high Mg#
silicates (phenocrysts, xenocrysts, xenoliths, glass inclusions, volcanic rocks)
is proposed here. The aim of this study is to understand the regional importance
of the various primitive Aleutian melt types, and to infer the predominant
mixing, melting, and reaction processes that occur in the Aleutian mantle wedge.
The approach is to use the trace element and isotopic characteristics of thigh
Mg# minerals as tracers of mantle wedge processes. There has been a recent re-
emphasis on primary calc-alkaline andesitic magmas in subduction related
magmatic arcs, with high Mg#'s, and high Ni and Cr contents, consistent with
equilibration with mantle olivine and spinel. The presence of these lavas in
arcs raises once again the question of the bulk composition of crust formed by
subduction-related magmatism. This study will address this broad issue by
defining more clearly the various primitive melts which are represented in the
Aleutian arc, and by providing an improved basis for identifying the predominant
processes which occur in the Aleutian mantle wedge.
