This renewal research is aimed at the synthesis and characterization of a unique
class of alkalide and electride materials. Optical, electrical and magnetic
properties will be determined, and structural studies by X-ray single crystal
and powder methods will be used to provide structure-function correlations. The
use of alkalides and electrides as aprotic reducing agents in both organic and
inorganic chemistry will be explored.
