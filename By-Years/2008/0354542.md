Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0354542&lt;br/&gt;D. Joseph, University of
Minnesota&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is to do exploratory study of the
effects of nanoparticle dispersed in polymeric solutions. We will be looking at
the enhancements in pulling power in tubeless siphons due to the nanoparticles.
The effect is evidently to create a new material wherein the polymer molecule is
replaced by an effective (super) polymer molecule bridged by nanoparticles. We
want to explore the effects of the size of small particles on the enhancements
of the siphon. We propose also to explore effects of carbon nanotubes
on&lt;br/&gt;rheological properties of polymer solutions. The tests of these
enhancements on properties will be done using simple beaker experiments
described in the project description.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:
This exploratory study fits perfectly well in the study of effects of small
particles dispersed in fluids. Central to this study is the creation of flow-
induced microstructure with a suite of possible applications. This particular
study is pointed to the use of tubeless siphons as vacuum cleaners for covering,
then cleaning, contaminated substrates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:
The broader impacts are technological and educational. The technological impacts
are the applications, not known yet, inevitably generated by new materials. The
educational aspects are two-fold. The research will impact fluid mechanics by
introducing a new set of phenomena associated with flows of nanoparticle laden
polymeric solutions. The second impact is on students who will get an education
in this emerging field. The PI has employed over 20 undergraduates in his
laboratory over the past 12 years. These undergraduates get real research
experiences and they make real contributions to research. At present five
undergraduates are employed. They are supported under REU supplement. The
proposed research will impact these students, and the others, in the
opportunities of nanoscience and nanotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;
