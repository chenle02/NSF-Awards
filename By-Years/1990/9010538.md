A central issue in developmental neurobiology concerns what factors are
involved in the differentiation of ion channels in developing neurons. This
issue will be studied in migrating neurons that form the enteric nervous system
in the moth, Manduca. This system is uniquely suited for such studies since the
developmental fates of these neurons are well characterized, there are only 300
neurons in this system and these are easily accessible for electrophysiological
recording and experimental manipulation in the embryo. In addition, these
neurons can be removed from the embryo and studied in culture. Intracellular and
patch clamp recordings will be performed on identified neurons during and after
their migration in situ and in culture to study the expression and development
of voltage dependent potassium, calcium dependent potassium, sodium and calcium
currents. These studies will lead in the future to molecular and genetic
analyses of channel gene expression.
