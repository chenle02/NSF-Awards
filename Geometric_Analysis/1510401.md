Differential geometry is the branch of mathematics that studies the shapes of
spaces through distances and angles. Mathematically these are measured by
Riemannian metrics. This research project investigates problems centering around
the Ricci flow, which is in turn a natural way to evolve Riemannian metrics in
their underlying space. The concept of Ricci flow was invented by R. Hamilton in
1982 and has had wide applications in mathematics since then. For instance, the
Ricci flow has had a profound and far-reaching impact on 3-dimensional geometry
and topology, as evidenced by G. Perelman's solution to the Poincare conjecture
in 2003. The investigator will study the applications of the Ricci flow in
algebraic geometry and 4-dimensional topology. These applications will deepen
our understanding of several related subjects, including partial differential
equations, probability, complex analysis, and theoretical physics. By organizing
conferences and seminars, the PI will motivate graduate students to join this
research endeavor. Moreover, the PI will present the work to undergraduate
students and the general public.

The investigator will continue developing tools based on the Ricci flow. In
particular, he will refine and localize the existing estimates in Ricci flow,
for the purpose of applying Ricci flow in algebraic geometry and 4-dimension
topology. He will generalize the pseudo-locality theorem of Perelman, and find
the relationships between Ricci flow theory and the theory of metric spaces with
lower bound of Ricci curvatures, i.e., the Cheeger-Colding theory. He will
continue to develop the special estimates in the Kahler Ricci flow. Among other
things, he will aim to combine the flow version of Chen-Lu inequality with other
estimates. Based on the improved estimates, the PI will aim to understand the
relationship between the minimal model program in algebraic geometry and the
Kahler Ricci flow. He will also determine if some of the results in the Cheeger-
Colding theory can be reproved using the Ricci flow method. Finally, the PI
intends to study the expected deep connections between the Ricci flow and
probability theory.
