9522613 Zabaras The project will pursue the development of inverse techniques
that can be used for a systematic multi-design of bulk metal forming processes.
Computational algorithms will be developed to design forming dies and preforms
and to select optimal process conditions such that products of desired
mechanical properties and geometry are obtained from given raw materials. The
work has a high probability of being used in practical engineering design. If
successful, it will benefit a significant number of manufacturing industries by
providing a fresh outlook on design techniques and the means to optimally design
forming processes that results in reduced deficiencies in the finished products.
Finally, the research methodology could be applied to a variety of scientific
and engineering problems with significant contributions to the growing field of
inverse problem theory.
