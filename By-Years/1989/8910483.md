This award will support an international conference in topology. It is to be
held on August 12-18, 1990 at the University of Hawaii at Manoa in Honolulu.
This conference is a part of what is becoming a tradition: having an
international conference in topology just before the International Congress of
Mathematicians. This conference should bring together the leading researchers in
all areas of topology to communicate their recent results and to assess the
status of their field. Proceedings should be published in the literature.
