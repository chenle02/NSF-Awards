This Small Business Innovation Research project proposes research leading to the
development of a fully packaged-sub-millimeter wave oscillator based upon
Resonant Tunnel Diodes (RTDs). Phase I research will optimize the MBE growth
process and perform exploratory development of the packaging. The RTDs are to be
fabricated in the InAs/AlSb material system and are expected to be similar to
those of Brown et. al.*. The designs will be optimized for the MBE growth
technology and process monitoring at Superiour Vacuum Systems. RTDs will be
characterized at DC and RF. Preliminary investigation will be made of
temperature dependence and reliability. SVT Associates will design a packaging
technology, which allows for the generation of wideband tunable signals to be
implemented under Phase II. *`Oscillations up to 712 GHz in InAs/AlSb resonant
