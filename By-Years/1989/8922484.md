This award will continue support of research on the wintertime north polar
stratospheric vortex, which is focused on phenomena that are believed to be
related to polar stratospheric ozone depletion. The measurements are made by
balloon borne instruments, some of which are especially designed for this
purpose. The instruments will measure ozone concentration, water vapor
concentration by the frost point method, temperature, pressure, nitric acid, and
aerosols and polar stratospheric clouds. The aerosol and cloud measurements will
be made by a new instrument called a backscattersonde that has been developed by
the principal investigator for this work. The balloons will be flown from Alert,
NWT, Canada; Heiss Island, USSR; the Kola Peninsula, USSR; and Frobisher Bay,
NWT, Canada. The first two sites are located well within the normal position of
the polar vortex while the remaining two are on the edge of the vortex and in a
region where there is some sunlight at mid-winter. The goal of the research is
to elucidate the role that polar stratospheric clouds and aerosols play in the
destruction of ozone. This project involves a collaboration between U.S.,
Canadian and Soviet scientists. The project is very unusual in that it includes
a Soviet Co-Principal Investigator, though there is no exchange of funds. The
project has been recommended for approval by COMEX of the CIA.
