P.I. McNutt, Marcia (MBARI) Proposal #: 0222650

Proposal Title: MARS: Test Bed for a High-Power, High-Bandwidth, Regional Cabled
Observatory

Project Summary The PIs propose to complete the design and then install an
advanced cabled observatory in Monterey Bay that will serve as the engineering
testbed for a future cabled ocean observatory. The Monterey Accelerated Research
System (MARS) cabled observatory would provide remote, continuous, long-term,
high-power, large-bandwidth infrastructure for multidisciplinary, in situ
exploration, observation, and experimentation in the deep sea using cutting edge
power and communication technologies. MARS will be located in Monterey Bay
offshore the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) and will include
one science node on 62 km of submarine cable with expansion capability for more
nodes in the future. It is proposed that the science node will provide 4 science
ports, and each port will have a 100-Mbit-per- second, bi-directional telemetry
channel. The node will have the ability to deliver a total of 10 kW of power to
the 4 ports. "Extension" cables can be plugged into any science port to provide
power and communications up to 100 km away from the original node using the most
cost effective deployment vehicle from several options including MBARI's ROVs,
ships of opportunity, or UNOLS class I, II, III or IV fleet vessels. MARS will
make use of the tools, techniques, and products developed over the last several
decades for high reliability submarine telecommunication and military systems to
ensure that this system can operate over a 30-year lifetime with minimal life-
cycle costs.
