This three-year award supports cooperative research in biophysics between
Harold Scheraga of Cornell University and Bernard Maigret at the Louis Pasteur
University in Strasbourg, France. The cooperation deals with the theoretical and
computational aspects of protein structure with particular emphasis on protein
conformation and folding, the so-called multiple-minima problem. The objective
of their research is to develop methods for computing the stable comformations
of proteins and protein complexes from their amino acid sequences utilizing
enhanced x-ray diffraction and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Methodology
based on exposed surface areas of proteins will be used to screen out
undesirable conformations. Dr. Scheraga and his research group bring to the
collaboration expertise in NMR, energy minimization and Monte Carlo
computations. This is complemented by French expertise in neural networks,
surface area and Monte Carlo computations. Their ultimate goal is to resolve the
multiple- minima problem and develop techniques for prediction of protein
structure. Knowledge of the protein structure is central to the fundamental
understanding of biological processes. The ability to predict structure will
advance our understanding of protein behavior and the principles that determine
these structures. In the long term, a computational model of protein structure
will make it possible to utilize protein engineering in designing new enzymes,
and possibly new drugs.
