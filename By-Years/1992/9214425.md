Bowdin College seeks to renovate research facilities within the Searles Science
Building. These renovations will modernize and upgrade research laboratories and
research support spaces to provide more efficient space utilization and to meet
health and safety standards. The primary renovation projects include: removal of
asbestos, installation of ventilation systems, provision of new lighting and
expanded electrical service, and replacement of bench tops and casework in nine
faculty research laboratories and their associated support facilities. In
addition, two rooms will be converted -- one for a biology equipment support
room and a clean room to support physics device fabrication and house equipment.
Their current use as animal holding spaces will be relocated and consolidated
into a renovated solarium. The general purpose biology research space will be
significantly modified and upgraded to accommodate increasing numbers of
independent and honors research students. All of these research spaces, except
the third floor solarium, will also be made accessible to the disabled. The
renovation addresses a priority capital need of the College that complements
other work currently underway in the building, the renovation of other teaching
spaces.
