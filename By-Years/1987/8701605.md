The PI has recently found that virus-like shells can be assembled in vitro,
using 14S pentameric subunits obtained from naturally-occuring empty capsids
(i.e. procapsids). This system provides a basis for designing an in vitro
reaction mixture capable of forming poliovirions. The main objective of this
proposal is to establish such a reaction mixture and to use it as an assay to
purify and isolate the viral-specific "morphopoietic" factor(s) present in Hela
cells which is responsible for forming procapsids (and virus particles) from 14S
material in vivo. Experiments will be conducted to: 1) identify its nature 2)
ascertain its mode of action, and 3) quantitate the amount needed to support the
in vitro virus assembly system. Two series of other experiments are also
planned. The first is aimed at characterizing the nature of the interactions
between the virions and monoclonal antibodies to different viral capsid
epitopes. The second deals with the significance of the "internal" initiation
site in polioviral RNA. The project as a whole will contribute substantially to
our understanding of the way proteins of poliovirus and other picornaviruses are
synthesized and processed.
