A careful analysis of upper ocean field data collected during two cruises (1995
and 1997) funded under the Coastal Ocean Process (CoOP) program will be
conducted to estimate air-sea gas exchanges. A focus of the investigation will
be on the interactive role that atmospheric forcing and surfactants play
generating and damping small waves and near-surface turbulence, and how the
modification of these processes affects the transfer velocity and therefore the
turbulent gas flux. The expected outcome of the analyses is an improved
parameterization of the air-sea gas transfer velocity which incorporates all the
relevant physical and chemical processes, and is applicable to wide range of
environmental conditions.
