Larsen&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1411809&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In the first part of this
project, the investigator and his colleagues seek to use methods from stochastic
analysis to provide a comprehensive study of price formation in financial
markets such as the stock and fixed-income markets. The specific goal is to
understand how idiosyncratic risks affect equilibrium price formation.
Currently, there are very few results available that can answer such questions
and this part of the project seeks to provide tractable models that can be used
to obtain approximate answers. In the second part, the investigator and his
colleagues seek to develop optimization tools that can deal with a large class
of stochastic control problems often encountered in mathematical finance. These
problems exhibit unexpected discontinuities that prevent the standard
mathematical tools from being applicable. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; From a rigorous
mathematical perspective, the investigator first seeks to establish the
existence of incomplete equilibria in continuous-time models governed by
Brownian motions. Such models are well-known for being notoriously intractable.
Therefore, the investigator seeks to provide tractable approximation tools that
can be used as surrogates for the general models. Secondly, the investigator and
his colleagues seek to provide a partial differential equation characterization
of the problem of optimal investment with unspanned endowment. This control
problem turns out to have a discontinuous value function (a facelift or boundary
layer), which prevents the use of standard partial differential equation
techniques. Finally, the investigator and his colleagues seek to develop tools
that can detect up front such discontinuities for a general class of stochastic
control problems.
