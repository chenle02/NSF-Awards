Demmel The purpose of this proposal is is design, analyze and make widely
available massively parallel algorithms for large sparse linear systems, large
sparse nonsymmetric eigenproblems,and large dense eigenproblems. Also proposed
are new algorithms which are innovative numerically and with regard to their
parallelizability. These algorithms will be packaged in toolboxes which permit
their easy reuse and performance for a wide variety of applications too
demanding for any "black box" solution.
