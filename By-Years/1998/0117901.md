In the face of the climate change treaty being negotiated under the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, oil corporations have responded
differently. Some have expressed support for the climate change treaty, while
most have challenged climate change science and lobbied against mandated carbon
dioxide and other greenhouse gas emission reductions. Understanding this split
in business views on the climate debates offers insights into the importance of
transnational organizations for international politics, and into the role of
non-state actors in negotiating international treaties among governments. Using
qualitative data on four oil corporations, and quantitative data on the 50
largest oil corporations, the project thus addresses four questions: 1) what
climate strategies have the oil corporations pursued, 2) what factors have
accounted for differences in strategies, 3) how have the oil corporations
responded to advocacy efforts of environmentalists, and 4) how has the split in
the oil industry affected the progress and outcomes of the climate change
negotiations?
