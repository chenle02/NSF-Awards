Dr. Shirley Tucker of Louisiana State University will continue her anatomical
and morphological studies of patterns of flower development in tropical legumes,
using methods of light and scanning electron microscopy. She is studying several
taxa in the subfamily Caesalpinioideae because her preliminary work shows that
the group is unusually varied in floral ontogeny, and includes genera with
primitive helical patterns of development as well as more specialized types of
unidirectional formation. In addition to documenting intermediate stages between
these two types, Dr. Tucker will determine whether unusual floral features (such
as unisexuality, heteromorphy, or nonradial symmetry) result from changes early
in development or represent terminal additions to ontogenetic sequences. Another
line of investigation involves determining the consequences of organ loss (for
example, loss of petals or of stamens) and organ-suppression (formation of
primordial cells followed by abortion) in various lineages of legumes. Floral
characters are critical in taxonomic classification of legumes and in
phylogenetic analysis of their affinities, and the developmental data acquired
in this research will permit rigorous test of the homology of comparable
features throughout the legume family.
