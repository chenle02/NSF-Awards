9619140 Chandrasekhar "Promoting Young Women in the Physical Sciences" is a
sequential program spanning grades 5-12 that involves collaborations among
teachers and administrators of the Columbia Public Schools, other area schools,
University of Missouri faculty, local industries and parents. A combination of
curricular, extracurricular and training components is designed to nurture and
broaden the participation, interest and knowledge of students, particularly
females. Curricular activities in the physical sciences are to be added to
grades 5-9. Integrated science courses for grades 9-10 are to be designed and
implemented so all students receive additional instruction in the physical
sciences. Female-targeted sections of physics and chemistry are to be made
available at the high schools. Extracurricular programs are to be implemented at
three levels: the Exploring Physics after school program for grades 5-7 girls;
Saturday Science Experiences, in collaboration with local industries, for grades
8-9 students; and a Summer Science Academy for grades 9-11 girls. The latter
integrates Science, Engineering and Mathematics (SEM) disciplines through a toy
factory building project. Training components for parents and school personnel
include: physics summer institutes for teachers; a gender equity course followed
by a semester of action research for science teachers and administrators; and
middle school parent training through Family Evenings with Science and
Technology (FEST).
