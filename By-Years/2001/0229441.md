&lt;br/&gt;Proposal #: 0229441&lt;br/&gt;PI: Wicklein&lt;br/&gt;Inst: U of GA
Res Fdn Inc&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary focus of this one-year project is
to design and develop a model summer engineering education institute focusing on
integration of engineering content with mathematics, science, and technology
education that could motivate academically qualified high school seniors to
seriously consider engineering majors in college. Another objective is The
institute model builds teams of educators at various levels - teacher educators
from mathematics, science and technology education; engineering educators; in-
service teachers; pre-service teachers; undergraduate engineering students; and
secondary students - to stimulate the inclusion of significant engineering
related instructional content within the public school curriculum. The teams
will participate in a variety of classroom and laboratory-based experiences
along with field trips and motivational speakers that focus on engineering
concepts to illustrate real-world applications of mathematics, science, and
technology. Faculty in engineering and education and teachers continue to
develop engineering enhanced instructional materials and strategies to be tested
in public schools and the university in the months following the institute.
