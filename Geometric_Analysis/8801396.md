James Reineck will continue the development of the theory of the Conley index
and the connection matrix. The fundamental objective is to use topological
information to provide dynamical information about flows. The Conley index
generalizes the notion of relative homology sequence of a filtration which has
been studied in the past. Reineck intends to apply this theory to problems in
reaction-diffusion equations, chemical networks and ecology. The problems in the
theory of the index are the proof of a Poincare- Hopf type theorem, the study of
the relation between the indices of a set in an invariant subspace and the index
of the whole space, and development of an equivariant theory. Connection matrix
problems include a relation between the connection map and the topology of the
set of connections, the development of a map to describe families of connecting
orbits in Morse decompositions and a more complete understanding of the
ambiguity which arises in the connection matrix.
