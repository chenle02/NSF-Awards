0122539 Basu An SGER award supports a study of the feasibility of depositing
compositionally graded coatings in the mullite-iota alumina system. The intent
is to develop coatings which will provide high temperature oxidation and
corrosion resistance to SiC and Si3N4 ceramics without spalling during thermal
cycles. The intent is to CVD deposit a coating which is mullite (3Al2O3.2SiO2)
at the interface with the ceramic substrate and to gradually change the
composition to pure alumina of the iota-alumina phase, which has the same
crystal structure as mullite. The coatings will be evaluated for crystal
structure, thermal expansion properties, and high temperature oxidation
resistance. ***
