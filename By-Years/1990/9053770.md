The Connecticut Business and Industry Association (CBIA), in partnership with
the Hartford Public schools, area colleges and universities, and business and
industry, with support of the National Science Foundation is conducting a 3-year
project to revitalize the secondary General Mathematics program. The activities
proposed are intended to revise the curriculum, promote the professional
development of secondary mathematics teachers, and devise new approaches to
mathematics education. The general strategy is to create a core of selected
members of the partnership who will be responsible for guiding the work of the
project. Fifty secondary school mathematics teachers and 20 high school
mathematics students will be actively involved in the project each year. Among
the devices proposed is the use of business and industry members for inservice
education (i.e., industrial applications of mathematics) and the creation of a
Student Internship Program
