This project is concerned with research in ring theory. The principal
investigator will continue investigating the structure of differential operator
rings, Noetherian rings, von Neumann regular rings, and related rings. A ring is
an algebraic object having an addition and a multiplication defined on it. Rings
occur in a variety of settings in mathematics and physics. The specific research
involves the structure and theory of von Neumann regular rings and rings of
differential operators.
