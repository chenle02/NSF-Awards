Financial support ($4,000) is requested for eight graudate students and
postdoctoral fellows to participate in this biannual meeting on solid state
chemistry. The program includes 23 young and established speakers from United
States and Europe. Speakers will discuss topics such as superconducting
fullerides, microporous solids in catalysis, and nonlinear optics in
communication. In addition, the organizers will specifically ask for posters
from the graduate students, postdoc, and young faculty, and will select 8 top
contributions by graduate students and postdocs for financial support. The chief
aims are to: 1) expose future scientists to the latest research in solid state
chemistry, 2) provide a medium for the new comers to interact with established
scientists from academic, industrial, and government laboratories, and 3) hear a
first-hand report from Professor A. Ellis on the NSF Program in Solid State
Chemistry for Undergraduate. This last portion is focussed on the introduction
of material chemistry into undergraduate curriculum. The Gordon Research
Conference is scheduled for July 27 - 31, 1992.
