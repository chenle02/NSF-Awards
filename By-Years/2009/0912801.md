This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research
Phase I research project seeks to develop advanced control technologies for
improving the overall cost-effectiveness of small-scale vertical axis wind
turbines. Most commercial wind turbines operate at energy efficiencies much
lower than what can be practically realized. The efficiency can be vastly
improved by implementing active control. In this project, simple blade actuation
mechanisms, advanced control algorithms, nonlinear filtering methods will be
integrated with effective generator, power converter and sensor technologies for
reduction of overall cost per kilowatt. Furthermore, cooperative control methods
will be developed for multiple vertical axis wind turbines installed on a
building, by enabling inter-unit communication. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is
expected that the proposed advanced technologies will render vertical axis wind
turbines units economically viable for small-to-medium scale implementation on
residential and commercial buildings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
