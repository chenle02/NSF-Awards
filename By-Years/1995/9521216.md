This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing research
of Professor Cynthia Burrows at the University of Utah. Primary objectives are
experiments on the site-specific metal catalyzed modification of DNA and other
small molecules. Fundamental problems to be solved are the activation of
dioxygen factors influencing the alkylation of DNA by nickel complexes and the
dynamic parameters of nickel catalyzed oxidation of small molecules. Oxidation
is a fundamental reaction in chemistry which when applied to organic and
biological molecules can be useful as well as deleterious. It assists
degradration and detoxification in some instances and it can initiate cancer in
other conditions. Thus, a thorough understanding of these types of reactions is
very important. This proposal addresses a specific aspect of the field wherein
nickel facilitates the oxidation of DNA, a significant component of biological
systems.
