DMS-9805621 EFFICIENT NUMERICAL METHODS FOR VISCOUS INCOMPRESSIBLE FLOWS Jian-
Guo Liu Project Summary This project will focus on continuing the development of
efficient, accurate, high order finite difference and finite element methods for
the unsteady viscous incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (NSE), with emphasis
on finding efficient time stepping procedures and new formulations of the
equations better suited to numerical computation. Some practical aspects of the
methods, including extensions to flows in general 2D and 3D domains, and
applications to more challenging physical problems, will be investigated. In the
vorticity formulation, a new time-stepping procedure is used for high Reynolds
number flows. For such flows the convection and viscous terms are treated
explicitly. The stream function, and hence the velocity, is then evaluated from
the vorticity via the kinematic equation. The key to the efficiency of the new
time-stepping procedure is that the value of the vorticity on the boundary is
obtained explicitly from the steam function without any iteration. This
eliminates some traditional difficulties associated with the vorticity
formulation. More akin to the primitive variable formulation, the investigator
is using a new formulation of the NSE in the impulse density variable which
differs from the velocity by a gauge transformation. The gauge freedom enables
one to assign simple and specific boundary conditions for both the impulse and
gauge fields, thus eliminating some traditional difficulties such as the
pressure boundary condition. This new class of efficient numerical methods has
already been used to study such real world problems as the investigation of the
mechanism of drag reduction on airfoils at high velocities, as well as the
development of severe storms in tropical latitudes. These methods provide an
important tool that allow scientists and engineers to study related fluid
problems in manufacturing and industry that were previous unsolvable with
currently available numerical techniques. They represent a significant step
forward in the efficient computation of solutions to such problems, and are
naturally suited for implementation on high performance massively parallel
computer architectures.
