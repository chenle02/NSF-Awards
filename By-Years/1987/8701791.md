Venema will continue his research in geometric topology. The problems to be
investigated involve topological embeddings into piecewise linear manifolds and
cell-like mappings of compacta. Among other things he will investigate the
structure of neighborhoods of compacta in piecewise linear 4-manifolds and try
to determine whether homotopy-equivalent, locally simply- connected compacta are
CE equivalent via locally simply-connected spaces. The importance of
understanding the structure of 4- dimensional manifolds is increasingly
recognized in theoretical physics. Even higher dimensional manifolds play an
essential role in the so-called "string theory" of current vogue.
