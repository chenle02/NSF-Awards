9403361 Higgins Dr. Daniel A. Higgins has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral
Research Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Higgins received his doctoral degree from
the University of Wisconsin/Madison under the supervision of Professor Robert
Corn. Dr. Higgins will continue research at the University of Minnesota under
the sponsorship of Professor Paul Barbara. His postdoctoral research will couple
the use of time-resolved spectroscopic methods with near-field scanning optical
microscopy to investigate the effects of different microscopic domains present
on semiconductor electrode surfaces. Longer term, he will apply near-field
scanning optical microscopy to the in-situ study of the photo-electrochemical
reactivity of microscopic crystalline domains on the surface of n-doped
polycrystalline titanium dioxide. The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in
Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to
broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into
meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and teaching. ***
