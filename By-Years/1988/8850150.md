Ball State University will offer two separate but identical two-week
residential sessions on Introductory Electronics to 48 twelth grade students.
The first session will be for girls only; the second for boys only. It is hoped
that these somewhat unorthodox girls-only/ boys-only programs will provide
educational opportunities for all interested applicants as well as offer an
incentive to attract young women into a traditionally male dominated field.
Emphasis will be placed on the application of electronics to science and
laboratory activities will constitute approximately 50% of the program schedule.
In addition students will construct their own computer interface. As a follow-up
project, they will use these interfaces to perform two experiments in their home
school and send reports of their results to the project staff.
