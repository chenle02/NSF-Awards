9350743 Viswanathan The project will purchase an FT Infrared spectrophotometer
to develop new directions in the chemistry curriculum. This will include the
introduction of microscale laboratory techniques in the 1) organic chemistry, 2)
general and introductory chemistry, and 3) special problems and research in
chemistry courses for the freshmen and sophomore level students.The instrument
with its built in computer will enable students to build libraries of spectra,
identify impurities in the synthesized chemicals, perform baseline corrections,
subtract solvent spectra and carry out computer searches in a relatively short
time. This instrument will also be used in the faculty members' research in the
areas of organometallic and natural products chemistry. ***
