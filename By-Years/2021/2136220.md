The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to provide a more economical, scalable,
and sustainable type of battery for storing the energy needed to support
Americaâ€™s growing renewable power grid. As more wind and solar power generation
is being installed, there is a growing need for economical forms of energy
storage to supply power during windless and sunless times. Older technologies
like lithium ion and lead acid batteries are not ideal for this purpose due to
problems with supply, safety, longevity, and sustainability. This project seeks
to produce new chemical components to enable grid-scale batteries based on
recyclable zinc metal, which offers a safer and more sustainable alternative
grid-scale battery option. Furthermore, since zinc and its other battery
components are sourced in the US, this project may help facilitate domestic
battery manufacturing and reduce dependence on foreign battery
supplies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase II project proposes to produce
chemical additives that make zinc-bromine batteries last longer, hold more
energy, and run more efficiently so that they can provide sustainable low-cost
energy storage for renewable power. Presently, the major problems with these
types of batteries are related to unwanted electrochemical side reactions that
happen during battery charging. This project will eliminate these side reactions
with stable, scalable, organic electrolyte additives designed to prevent
problems at the zinc surface. During this phase of the project, these
electrolyte addititives will be modified and optimized for performance and
scalability. They will be evaluated via testing in actual cells and full-size
batteries by the battery manufacturers. By the end of the project, new class of
enabling electrolyte may be available in large quantities to help establish
safe, sustainable, domestically made zinc-bromine
batteries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
