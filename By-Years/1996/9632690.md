9632690 Sondhi This grant supports work by a beginning assistant professor at
Princeton University. The proposed work involves study of various aspects of
quantum hall effect. These include spin textures (skyrmions) in quantum Hall
effect and other itinerant ferromagnets and an analysis of symmetries and
dissipation near quantum critical points. The latter has been stimulated by the
observation of symmetries of the nonlinear response in quantum Hall experiments.
Finally, there are plans to provide theoretical support to local experimental
groups studying quantum Hall effect in 2-d electron gases and also in quasi 2-d
Bechgaard salts. %%% Last decade has seen an explosion of activity in quantum
Hall effect, a novel state of electrons in very high magnetic fields. In spite
of certain superficial similarities to a superconductor, another anomalous state
for electrons, this state is fundamentally different. The PI, a beginning
assistant professor at Princeton, has been a pioneer in the theory of this
field, in introducing some novel magnetic defects and related phenomena for
dissipation. He will further advance this work. He is also proposing a theory-
experimental collaboration with his colleagues at Princeton to explore new
opportunities. ***
