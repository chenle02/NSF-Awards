The purpose of this research is to assess the evolution and the performance of
the labor market in the U.S. and abroad. The research will consist of four
separate, but related projects. The first will analyze the determinants of
regional fluctuations in wages, earnings, and employment. This project is built
around an empirical model of labor demand that can isolate the effects of
product demand shifts and technical change on labor market outcomes. This is of
interest for its application to local labor markets, and for its implications
for changes in aggregate wages and employment. Second, a set of international
comparisons will be developed regarding the evolution of labor markets, focusing
on countries that provide important contrasts to the U.S. experience. A key goal
is to compare the evolution of labor markets in Korea and Taiwan where
productivity and wages tripled in less than 15 years to the more developed
countries of the U.S. and Sweden that experienced sluggish growth in
productivity and wages. Third, the relationships between changes in wages, labor
supply, and unemployment will be determined and analyzed. Finally, work will be
initiated on a modern, quantitative history of labor markets in the U.S. Among
other topics this project will include work on changes in the structure of
wages, the evolution of unemployment and labor force participation, changes in
labor markets, and effects of immigration.
