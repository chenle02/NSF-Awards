In this project managed by the Chemistry Division at NSF, Professor Manar
Shoshani and his students at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley will
study the activation and functionalization of N-heterocycles by heterometallic
Ni-Lewis Acid complexes. Professor Shoshani and his group are focusing on the
development of new complexes to access more challenging as well as more
selective transformations. This project supports continued outreach with high
school students from the Rio Grande Valley, an area comprising greater than 90
percent Hispanic individuals. The outreach events include setting up stations
incorporating educational chemistry demonstrations led by Professor Shoshani and
his group members.

Professor Shoshani and his group members aim to carry out thorough reactivity
and mechanistic studies with well-defined heterometallic Ni-Al hydride complexes
to develop a detailed understanding of the operating mechanism of N-heterocycle
functionalization. The teamâ€™s goal is to leverage the modular nature of the
multimetallic hydride motifs and conduct a set of structure-function studies to
identify new ways to guide and toggle selectivity, as well gain access to more
reduced N-heterocyclic scaffolds. Professor Shoshani and his group are also
exploring new motifs to further leverage the reactive nature of bridged hydrides
between electron rich and electron poor metal centers towards further
challenging cooperative transformations.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
