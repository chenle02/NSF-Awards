This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from Seamless Solutions,
Inc. uses virtual reality representations of a signer's head, facial
expressions, and mouth to augment verbal and/or American Sign Language (ASL)
communication, and it provides a means to animate these models using commands
which can be transmitted over inexpensive, low bandwidth channels. The objective
of this project is to build on Seamless Solutions' current research and
development in the long distance communication of sign language by virtual human
representations or avatars. Specifically, the project will explore the
feasibility of using low-cost computer generated facial animations 1) to express
emotion, 2) to enable lip reading, and 3) to augment signing with head movements
that add emphasis to communication. This technology will not only provide low
cost, long-distance sign language communication, but will also supply more
natural and rapid interaction between humans and computer applications. Among
those who will benefit form this research are the more than 500,000 hearing
disabled Americans who are currently excluded from communicating in their most
expressive idiom over long distance communications systems. Moreover, the same
technologies that will enhance visual communication for the deaf can also add
expression to communications for persons with unimpaired hearing. Facial
animations can be licensed to education, communications, and entertainment
software developers (including developers of games, PC-based software, digital
TV, and videophones). Such licensing would result in avatar use in 1)
educational multimedia software; 2) computer games; 3) television programs; and
4) interact communications, where sound is utilized today. When coupled with
emerging technologies in voice recognition, natural language processing, and
facial expression recognition, the avatars can be added to existing media
without the cost of independently authoring their behavior.
