The research proposed is directed toward understanding the reaction mechanisms
for high momentum-transfer exclusive processes. Meson exchange and virtual delta
nuclear radiative capture and pion production reactions. Measurements with
polarized beams (photon beams for the photonuclear reaction studies) will be
used in order to isolate these two-body amplitudes from the conventional one-
body terms. The principal investigator is very energetic and highly qualified to
undertake the proposed research. The research will be done at the LEGS polarized
photon beam facility of Brookhaven National Laboratory, at the Indiana
University Cyclotron Facility, at The Svedberg Laboratory of Uppsala University
in Sweden, and at the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility of Los Alamos National
Laboratory.
