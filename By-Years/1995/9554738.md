The American Association of Physics Teachers proposes to improve undergraduate
education by conducting workshops for 100 new physics faculty members primarily
from the research universities. This workshop will cover new developments in
physics curriculum and pedagogy, especially those that have resulted from NSF-
sponsored projects. Participants will be selected from physics departments at
research universities from throughout the U.S. Topics to be highlighted include
active learning and interactive lectures, addressing conceptual
misunderstandings, using technology, minority and gender issues, developing and
funding innovation, physics as a liberal art, mentoring research students,
training the next generation, and precollege outreach activities. Follow-up
activities will include an electronic network and a session devoted to the new
faculty workshop at the annual meeting of the AAPT.
