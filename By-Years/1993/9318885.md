In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Alec Wodtke will investigate the role of bimolecular transition states
in vibrational energy transfer in highly vibrationally excited molecules. The
vibrational dependence of intermolecular energy transfer will be studied over a
wide range of energy above and below the chemical transition states for
endothermic chemical reactions in a variety of different systems. In these
experiments the excited species will be created using Stimulated Emission
Pumping (SEP). The main system for study is the diatomic molecule NO, but
experiments will also be performed on the HCN - HNC isomerization, leading to
some of the first experimental information on a molecule larger than a diatomic.
%%% In this project Wodtke will use laser techniques to put large amounts of
energy into vibrational motions of the chemical bonds of several molecules whose
reactions are important for understanding atmospheric chemistry. Such excited
molecules can undergo chemical reactions which unexcited species will not. This
effort is relevant to understanding global warming, ozone hole formation, and
the creation and remote sensing of nitric oxide, a known catalyzer of ozone
destruction.
