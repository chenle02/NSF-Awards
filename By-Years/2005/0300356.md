Principal Investigator: Prakash Belkale&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:

Hill&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract: Quantum Cohomology, Representation theory
and Feynman Amplitudes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal
investigator wants to pursue research in two areas: Representations of the
fundamental group and Quantum Cohomology, and the study of the structure of
Feynman amplitudes (the second area is in collaboration with Patrick Brosnan of
UCLA). In the first field, the PI wants to generalise his recent geometric proof
of Horn and Saturation conjectures to the Quantum analogues of these
conjectures. This project is inspired by the the problem of unitary
representations of the fundamental group of p1 of projective n-space with n
points removed with prescribed local monodromies. The principal investigator
plans to investigate the existence of Horn type recursion for other groups and
study analogues of the Saturation conjecture. A final goal of this work is to
determine an optimal set of inequalities for the problem of existence of unitary
representations with prescribed monodromies. In the second field (in
collaboration with Brosnan), the principal investigator will continue the study
of relations between Feynman amplitudes and algebraic geometry. The first step
of this work is to understand in general Algebro-geometric terms the integral
computations of the physicists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of relations
between Representation theory (`symmetries') and Algebraic Geometry is a very
important area of research. Part of the motivation for this work comes from
eigenvalue problems, which are important in numerical computing and in wave
mechanics. The work on the geometry of Feynman amplitudes is of interest both in
mathematics and physics. The aim is a better mathematical understanding of
Feynman amplitudes, which are fundamental to the quantum theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;
