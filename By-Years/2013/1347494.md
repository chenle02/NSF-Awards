The International Commission on Stratigraphy: developing global geostandards
through international collaboration and consensus

EAR-1347494 Stanley Finney, California State University

ABSTRACT PI requests three years of funding to support the activities of the
International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS), the largest and oldest
constituent scientific body of the International Union of Geological Sciences
(IUGS). The primary objective of ICS is to standardize the International
Chronostratigraphic Chart, which is the basis for the Geologic Time Scale and
serves as the global language for expressing geologic time. The funding
requested would allow ICS to greatly increase its activities to include 1) field
investigations and field business meetings necessary for the selection of Global
Stratotype Sections and Points (GSSPs) that define the units of the
International Chronostratigraphic Chart; 2) rejuvenation of websites of ICS
subcommissions in order that the websites become the primary archives and
portals for stratigraphic information produced by the subcommissions; and 3)
travel support for young scientists and scientists from under-developed
countries to participate in field investigations, field business meetings, and
international symposia of the subcommissions.
