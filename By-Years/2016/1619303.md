The cost of data movement through the memory hierarchy is very high in current
computer systems, relative to the cost of performing arithmetic operations, both
in terms of time and energy. It is expected to become even more dominant in
future computer systems. Therefore optimizing data access costs will become
increasingly critical in the coming years. This has great impact on algorithm
design and implementation on such systems. A characterization of data access
complexity is only known today for a few classes of algorithms, such as dense
linear algebra, and has required the use of problem-specific analysis
techniques. This proposal presents novel ideas for developing automated tools
and techniques to characterize the inherent data access complexity of arbitrary
algorithms. An automatable general approach for data access complexity of
programs will have significant impact on deriving highly effective algorithms
and their implementations, understanding the impact of future architectures on
algorithm design, and on advances in compilers aimed at improving data access
costs of programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal develops novel ideas to
address a fundamental problem of increasing importance -- developing tools and
techniques for characterization of the inherent data access complexity of
algorithms. The work develops the following: (i) the first unifying approach for
developing both upper and lower bounds for the inherent data access complexity
of a CDAG under a common underlying theoretical model; (ii) an approach to
remove a fundamental current limitation in the use of the popular reuse distance
analysis metric; (iii) a scalable and versatile dynamic analysis infrastructure
of use to application developers, compiler writers and architecture designers.
