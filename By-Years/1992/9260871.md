This is an award to support research on the feasibility of using air-sparged,
hydrocyclone flotation technology in the recovery of oil that has contaminated
water. This technology was developed originally for efficient removal of fine
particles suspended in water by flotation. This technology combines froth
flotation principles with those obtained by use of a hydrocyclone. This
technology has shown promise in being applied to the concentration of metal ores
and other minerals of industrial significance, cleaning of coal and in the
treatment of wastewater from deinking processes. This project addresses its
potential for removal of oil from water that has been contaminated with oil as
from accidental spills or as derived from remediation of oil- contaminated soil.
The proposal leading to this award was submitted in response to NSF 92-30, Small
Business Innovation Research under Topic No. 25d, Environmental Systems.
