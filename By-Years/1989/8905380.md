This project focuses on optimal control of multiple robots, specifically, on the
most rapid way to perform pick and place operations with two link robot arms,
where the actuators have bounded torques. Most research on two arm systems has
addressed the development of the equations of motion, or control schemes based
on position control to a given path. This work looks at control optimization.
The configuration assumed for this work comprises a two arm manipulator with
fixed base, bounded torques at both shoulder and elbow, forces only and no
moment applied to payload, and rigid links and payload. Initial work has been
directed at the case for small payload motions, where the payload starts and
finishes with zero linear and angular velocity, and the optimization problem was
to minimize travel time from the initial to final position. In the current
study, large payload motions are studied, and several cases are investigated
including (1) specified initial and final position, (2) open initial conditions,
(3) constraints on the internal force in the payload, (4) payload held by
friction as opposed to being pinned to the manipulator, and (5) moving base. The
research impact will be on the increased efficiency of robotic systems.
