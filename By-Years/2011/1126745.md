This MRI proposal requests a ULVAC ZEM 3M8 Thermoelectric Test Stand. This
instrument will enhance Lamar University's research and education activities in
materials science areas, its K-12 outreach program and future collaborates with
other universities in the central/ southeast Texas and east Louisiana as well as
local industrial partners. Lamar University (LU) is a mid size non-PhD granting
university. In the past few years, faculty members developed externally funded
research projects in materials development for energy related applications,
including thermoelectric oxides for power generation from automobile waste heat
and solid-state reaction to prepare novel catalysts for fuel cells. Many of the
projects need to analyze thermoelectric and electrical properties. Although the
university forms a Materials Instrumentation Center (MIC) that has assembled a
number of analytical and characterization instruments to support the research,
the lack of an instrument to characterize thermoelectric and electrical
materials hinders the progress of the research work. At this time, samples are
sent to Oak Ridge National Laboratories which is 500 miles away for analysis.
Although LU has made significant progress in the thermoelectric oxide
development, the long waiting time to analyze LU's samples seriously holds back
its research progress. Because of the urgent need of the capability to
characterize thermoelectric materials, the proposed test stand is a strategic
addition to LU's capability energy materials research. The lack of the
thermoelectric characterization capability not only delays LU's research
progress but also jeopardize its collaboration with other research institutes in
thermoelectric development.
