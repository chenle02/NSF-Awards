The Association of Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Minority
Institutions (ADMI) and the Computer Society of the IEEE will initiate a pilot
visiting scientist program for selected minority institutions. Experts across
the field will be selected to visit minority institutions to assist in
strengthening their academic and research programs. The visiting experts will be
matched to selected institutions for maximum benefit. Ten institutions will take
part in the first phase of this project.
