9503743 Schwartz, Steven The award will allow the purchase of a replacement for
a data acquisition and imaging system for a secondary ion mass
spectrometry/Auger electron spectroscopy (SINS/Auger) instrument. This new data
system will provide three dimensional imaging capability for the first time, so
that spatial maps of elemental concentrations at the parts per million level can
be produced. The data system will significantly enhance the machine sensitivity
by storing large volumes of data for post-analysis. The new system will replace
outdated counting-electronics modules and will incorporate specialized software
for simultaneous SIMS/Auger data acquisition. The SIMS/Auger unit at Queens
College is one of the most prolific SIMS instruments employed for materials
research. Approximately 100 publications have utilized data from this instrument
since 1985. These publications address a wide range of materials issues,
including segregation and ordering in polymer blends, interdiffusion and
metallic contacts in compound semiconductor devices, characterization of crystal
growth, and fundamentals of ion-solid interactions. The machine is currently in
round-the-clock use, in support of several research contracts and projects, and
involving faculty from several universities, as well as researchers in industry.
