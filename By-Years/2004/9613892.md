The investigators will develop an Arctic Ocean circulation model coupled to a
sea ice model on two spatial grids. The model numerical will allow the
researchers to investigate the input of Pacific Ocean water and the outflow of
Arctic Ocean water to the Atlantic so that not only the circulation within the
Arctic Ocean is simulated but also the important inputs and outputs are derived.
The model should produce a very realistic circulation that may be examined for
changing climatic conditions to determine the climatic effect on both Arctic
Ocean circulation and the effects of that circulation on the North Atlantic
Ocean. The model will provide a framework for other studies in the Arctic that
require a predictive capability for ocean circulation in areas of the Arctic
ocean where no observational data exists.
