All three branches of government play an important role within the system of
separation of powers that defines government in the American states. While the
judicial branch has been thought to be a check on the majoritarian power of the
legislative and executive branches, state legislatures and executives have the
ability to challenge the authority of state supreme (or high) courts through
court-curbing legislation. Examples of court-curbing measures include shortening
the terms of justices, allowing legislative review of judicial decisions, and
eliminating the power of judicial review. This legislation is designed to limit
the power of state courts, and to demonstrate the other branches' disapproval
with judicial decisions. Consequently, this project will examine court-curbing
legislation in the states, which will provide significant information on which
branch controls policy outcomes in the American states, and on the extent of
judicial independence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will collect and make
publicly available an original dataset on all court-curbing legislation and
constitutional judicial decisions in the American states between 2005 and 2015.
Analysis of the data will focus on how legislative and executive branches use
court-curbing measures to constrain state high courts, and whether such
legislation influences judicial decision making by limiting the power of
judicial review. Institutional rules such as methods of judicial selection will
be considered within the statistical analysis. Most prior research on judicial
independence in the states primarily involves the selection and retention of
judges. Instead, this project will focus on court-curbing legislation in order
to examine judicial independence, interbranch conflict, and how states balance
their legislative, executive and judicial powers.
