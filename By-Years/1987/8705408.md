The major long-term objective of the research of this laboratory is to define
the chromosome of Staphylococcus aureus, and thus gain a better understanding of
the manner whereby extrachromosomal elements contribute to its characteristics,
and the degree of diversity that exits within the genus Staphylococcus. The
specific aims of this proposed research are to (l) complete the genetic
continuity of the chromosome of lytic group III S. aureus, and to continue to
map additional markers of this lytic group, (2) initiate the development of
chromosome maps in lytic groups I and II of S. aureus (3) develop the pulse
field gradient gel electrophoresis technique for use with S. aureus to study the
genomic organization of the chromosome in different lytic groups, and to
identify the approximate chromosomal location of new markers on the chromosome,
(4) identify the chromosomal loci responsible for the recombination-deficient
phenotype in lytic group I and III, and (5) identify the nature and location of
the genetic deteminants of restriction and modification.
