This award supports cooperative research in the mathematics of dynamical
systems to be conducted by Sheldon Newhouse of the University of North Carolina
at Chapel Hill, Robert Williams of the University of Texas at Austin, Lai-sang
Young of the University of Arizona and Dennis Sullivan at CUNY in cooperation
with Jacob Palis and six others at the Institute for Pure and Applied
Mathematics (IMPA) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. They will study dynamical systems
including the specific areas of homoclinic bifurcations, rational mappings of
the Riemann sphere, stability conjecture for maps of the interval and the
dynamics and topology of the Lorentz attractor. In the last twenty or so years,
significant progress has been made in this field with increasing impact on
applications in biology, physics, chemistry and economics. This project will
provide direct cooperation between groups doing frontier research of fundamental
importance to both countries. It will also further strengthen the strong
background of cooperation between two productive groups in the field of
dynamical systems.
