Hatzes, Artie AST 96-15571 Dr. Hatzes will continue his research program of
Doppler imaging to study surface structure on a variety of active, late-type
stars. His program combines continued monitoring of RS CVn stars with new
programs to obtain Doppler images of weak T Tauri stars, zero-age main sequence
stars in nearby clusters, and cataclysmic variables. Studies of the sizes,
shapes, latitudes of formation, migratory patterns, and overall temporal
evolution of large cool spots on stars trace the emergent magnetic flux, and so
provide fundamental information on the magnetic and convective processes
responsible for observed activity on these stars and the Sun. Dr. Hatzes will
use the Hobby-Eberly telescope in preliminary studies of cataclysmic variables,
while performing studies of Weak T Tauri stars and brighter ZAMS objects with
the McDonald telescopes. In addition, he will begin a new observational program
of Zeeman Doppler imaging to study RS CVn and T Tauri stars with the 2.7m
McDonald telescope. In all these programs, the goal is to follow and map star
spot morphology and activity as a probe of surface magnetic activity and the
underlying stellar dynamo. ***
