The P.I.'s will analyze historical changes and interactions between land-use
practices and forest vegetation in central New England. An area that encompasses
significant gradients in environmental factors and cultural activity. Specific
objectives include: (1) examination of differences in the rate and degree of
forest clearance and farm abandonment across the region, (2) determination of
the relative contribution of economic forces versus physical constraints on
these processes, and (3) investigation of the effect of land-use history on the
current structure of the modern vegetation. Data will include numerous
historical sources collected on a township basis and spatial analysis will
utilize geographic information system. The results of the research will provide
information on long-term changes in the environment, and how these are mediated
by human activities.
