The Synthetic Organic Program is funding the research of Dr. Theodore Cohen of
the Department of Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh. The focus of the
work will be to develop new synthetic organic reactions using alkoxide-
carbanions and sulfur-containing carbenoid species. A major portion of the
project involves the exploitation of the generation of beta-, gamma- and delta-
lithioalkoxides by the treatment of epoxides, oxetanes and tetrahydrofurans,
respectively, with aromatic radical-anions. A variety of synthetic methods for
the preparation of oxygen heterocycles will be based on the use of these and
related anions. Metallo derivatives of bis(phenyl)thioacetals that behave as
carbenoids when present in molecules containing another anionic site will be
used to prepare compounds containing 3- or 5-membered rings.
