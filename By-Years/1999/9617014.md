Walterbos, Rene 96-17014 Dr. Walterbos will study the shell structure in
galactic disks and their relation to the overall structure of the interstellar
medium in these galaxies. A key part of the study is to identify shells using an
algorithm which they have developed and which has had demonstrated success. By
quantifying the numbers and properties of expanding shells in different galaxies
the researchers will study how the interstellar medium morphology may correlate
with the local star formation rate and under what conditions expanding shells
break out of the gas disk, allowing hot gas to escape into the halo of the
galaxies.
