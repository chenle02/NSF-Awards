This project addresses a key problem which currently limits the success of
machine vision in new applications: design of algorithms. Methods are explored
to partially automate the design of vision algorithms for recognizing and
localizing industrial parts and other man-made objects. The project suggests a
unified methodology for partially automating the generation of vision algorithms
using methodologies of search, reasoning under uncertainty, perspective geometry
analysis, and especially mathematic morphology. The work also addresses the
important software-related issue of testing and evaluation of vision algorithms.
The results should find use in industrial, military, and space applications.
