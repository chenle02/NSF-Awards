The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is due to the
zero-waste approach to resue spent coffee grounds (SCGs). This technology can
potentially result in a more sustainable waste management practice. It can
greatly reduce landfill costs for the municipalities and SCG generators. The
technology will result in more resources conserved by generating value added
materials and reduce the community?s carbon footprint. This I-Corps project will
directly benefit the entrepreneurial leaders by allowing them to go out of the
laboratory and make real world customer connections. This experience will better
equip the PI with the mindset and skills to pursue commercial applications of
her future research. This customer discovery process will provide the team with
essential information on technology-market fit, thus paving the way of
commercialization. This project may greatly promote the adoption of this
environmentally friendly technology by the society. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
I-Corps project is based on laboratory proven technology to reuse the whole
parts of SCGs. The SCGs will be separated into two products, the lipid fraction
as biofuels and the remaining solids as either biochar or a specialized
activated carbon. A direct esterification process is used for lipid extraction,
which also enhances the subsequent carbon reuse process with sulfur enrichment.
Compared with the solvent extraction process used by others, our patent-pending
process is more cost effective, efficient and environmentally friendly. The
simplicity and low cost will promote its wide use, and thus effectively divert
SCG from landfills and generate value added products that can be used locally.
Customer discovery is essential in understanding the product market fit, which
will greatly facilitate technology commercialization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
