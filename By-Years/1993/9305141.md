The principal objective of this research project is to conduct laboratory
experiments that will provide the foundation for quantitative prediction of
mineral-water reactions. This research will ultimately find application in
studies of groundwater aquifers and of fluid-mediated processes both at the
Earth's surface and at depth. The proposed experiments involve measurement of
dissolution rates, leaching, and hydrogen penetration for plagioclase, olivine
and pyroxene. Leaching experiments will be conducted up to 800oC and over a pH
range of 1 to 7. Techniques used to measure surface hydrogen and metal cation
inventories include SIMS, RNRA, XPS, and Auger electron spectroscopy.
