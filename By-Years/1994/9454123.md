Primarily because of extensive use by an increasing population and a
significant building boom following World War II, our nation's infrastructure is
degrading at an alarming rate. It is clear that there will not be sufficient
funds in the foreseeable future to address all the needed infrastructure
replacements simultaneously. It is therefore necessary to prioritize the needed
repair, rehabilitation, and replacement strategies. To prioritize the custodians
of the infrastructure must have knowledge of assessment technologies,
deterioration science, structural evaluation and analysis, construction
methodologies, and new high performance materials. This proposal is for the
establishment of a five year, Masters through Ph.D., interdisciplinary graduate
research traineeship program which will provide the future custodians and
educators of the custodians the engineering knowledge to effectively manage our
infrastructure. The program will be a fully integrated interdisciplinary
curriculum of material science, non-destructive testing, structural mechanics,
construction engineering and management, and sensor and control activator
technologies. Integration will be achieved through summer research programs and
a fourth year research capstone course. A core course curriculum will be
developed from existing, developing, and to be developed courses in statistical
data analysis, electromagnetic sensors and waves, signal processing, non-
destructive evaluation of materials, infrastructure condition assessment,
structural evaluation and analysis, deterioration science, fiber-polymer
composites, health monitoring sensors and damage control, and construction. The
core curriculum will provide the breath for the student to understand the
problems encountered in maintaining our infrastructure. Specialization in one of
the areas will provide the depth to crate solutions. Research training will be
accomplished through industry and university cost-sharing summer research durin
g the first three years and during the fourth year. Fourth year research will be
team solutions to industry problems and the fifth year will be devoted to
dissertation research. A unique faculty-industry mentor program will be
established to aid in the retention of students. The program will be laden with
the development of communication skills to insure student success. Student
recruitment will be on a personal basis by participating faculty and graduate
students and unique international educational opportunities will be established.
Program student accommodations will be under the umbrella of the Center for
Infrastructure Assessment and Management with newly constructed dedicated office
and research facilities.
