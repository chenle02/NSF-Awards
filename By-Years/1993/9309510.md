9309510 Luther Nerve cells communicate with muscle cells at a special site
called the neuromuscular junction. Nerve cells release a chemical,
acetylcholine, at neuromuscular junctions, and this substance causes the muscle
cells to contract by activating receptor proteins on the muscle cell-surface.
During development, the muscle cell surface undergoes a dramatic transformation
where it comes in contact with a growing nerve ending. It changes from a
relatively simple, unspecialized area into an elaborate 'postsynaptic complex'.
The postsynaptic complex contains many distinctive kinds of proteins, the most
important of which are the acetylcholine receptors. When a nerve cell contacts
the muscle cell surface during development, receptors are reorganized from a
diffuse population of single receptors into high-density clusters located
exactly opposite the nerve cell. This project will seek to learn what anchors
the acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction during this process.
Specific proteins will be identified in junctions by high resolution electron
microscopy relative to the distribution of the receptors. A super computer will
be used to construct three-dimensional images of these junctions. Together, this
information will help show how interactions between nerve and muscle cells cause
them to become specialized for their specific functions. *** l sw A wwwwwww KÃ• Y
