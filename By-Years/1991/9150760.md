This project will develop a new biology curriculum for non-majors which develops
the knowledge base, the observational skills, and intellectual study habits of
students in an area of science which will allow for continued learning without
formal instruction; act as an instrument to change student values; and will lead
students to a recognition of the interplay between science and public affairs.
To achieve these ends the PI proposes an experimentally based curriculum for
non-majors which focuses on open ended laboratory/workshop activities and de-
emphasizes lectures and demonstrations.
