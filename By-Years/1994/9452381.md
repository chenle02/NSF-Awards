9452381 Scholz The College of St. Thomas is developing an undergraduate
computer-mathematics laboratory for classroom instruction and student projects
within the University's Department of Mathematics. Applications of mathematics,
visualization of data and functions, and exploration of models and simulations
area being investigated in the facility. The University is providing a dedicated
and remodelled classroom for this laboratory. This facility is vital to the
Department's planned calculus and undergraduate mathematics reform and to the
design of computer-aided courses and instruction. The institution is currently
planning for a complete restructure of the present Calculus courses as well as
significant changes in Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Applied
Mathematical Modelling, Numerical Analysis, Probability, and Statistics
instruction. All of the Calculus classes are being held in the laboratory on a
daily to weekly basis, enabling students to experiment with mathematical ideas,
concepts, and realistic applications as they evolve from the lectures.
Traditional lectures are being supplemented and often replaced as students now
use the computer and powerful symbolic, numeric, and graphic software packages
to illustrate key ideas. The interactive nature between written lecture and
computer-aided instruction is a crucial aspect of this approach.
