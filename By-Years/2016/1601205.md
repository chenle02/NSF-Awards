This award supports participants at the Macaulay2 Development Workshop, May
7th-10th, 2016, at the University of Utah. Macaulay2 is one of the world's
leading open source software systems devoted to supporting research in
commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. The aim of this workshop is to bring
together researchers in these fields to develop new packages and functions that
utilize Macaulay2's existing functionality to perform computations essential for
research in algebra and geometry. These are then made available for use by other
mathematicians throughout the world. Many of the current Macaulay2 packages were
started at, or greatly enhanced by, work at workshops such as this one. More
information is available at the conference website&lt;br/&gt;http://wiki.macaula
y2.com/Macaulay2/index.php?title=Utah2016_-_Main_Page&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
workshop is designed to help guide researchers, including graduate students and
faculty members at both research universities and 4-year colleges, in the
development of packages for Macaulay2. This will be done by having groups of
participants consisting of a mix of experienced and novice members work
intensively on developing packages. Many of these packages will eventually be
integrated into Macaulay2, with some of those also going through a peer-review
process at the Journal of Software for Algebra and Geometry. These packages can
then be used by researchers throughout the world.
