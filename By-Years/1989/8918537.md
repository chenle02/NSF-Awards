Dr. John W. Thomson is one of the world's leading authorities on temperate and
arctic lichens of the New World. He has completed the second volume of his
monographic series "American Arctic Lichens", in which he provides the most
comprehensive treatment to date on microlichens. The monograph provides
illustrations, descriptions, diagnoses, distributional data, and identification
keys for 624 species in 104 genera. The proposed monograph will be an invaluable
tool for research, training, and environmental study of arctic lichens.
Ecologists, botanists, and ecosystem scientists will depend on this volume for
accurate field identifications. New and fruitful research projects will be
stimulated by its publication.
