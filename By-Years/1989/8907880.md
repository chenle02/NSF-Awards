Funds are requested to obtain a MicroVAX III (DEC 3600), four workstations (IRIS
4D/20 or equivalent) and a fast processor (Silicon Graphics 4D/240 or
equivalent) for a powerful computing facility to carry out crystallographic
structure analyses and refinement, NMR distance geometry calculations, and
molecular dynamics simulations in the Departments of Biological Structure and
Biochemistry. Projects which will benefit from these resources include studies
on blue copper proteins, iron sulfur proteins, nitrite reductase, hemerythrin,
rubrerythrin, lysophospholipase, neocarzinostatin, auromomycin, II crystallin,
and coagulation factor XIII. NMR related projects include calmodulin, zinc-
fingers, histidine-containing protein, as well as studies developing programs to
refine models by simulating NOE dynamics. Analysis of the extremely fast
reactions of bacterial reaction centers from a semi-empirical quantum mechanical
approach will also benefit from these resources. Our current computer resources,
made up of a venerable VAX 11/780 (purchased in 1978) and three workstations,
limits our ability to carry out crystallographic refinement efficiently or to
pursue research problems using NMR techniques and molecular dynamics
calculations. The proposed equipment will provide cpu speed to effectively
remove these limits on our studies of molecular structure and function and
significantly enhance our ability to explore new research directions.
