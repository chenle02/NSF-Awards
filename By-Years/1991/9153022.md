The Department of Geology is purchasing automated X-ray diffraction equipment
for use in introductory, upper division, and advanced courses, as well as
undergraduate research. Students in introductory classes are participating in
mineral indentification via local broadcast of data collected by the equipment
into the classroom. In upper division courses students are using the instrument
directly to analyze materials collected during field surveys.
