This research investigates political transitions in Africa. The research
focuses on the structure of political institutions in 46 nations in Sub-Saharan
Africa in the years 1975-1995. Extensive data is collected on country-specific
political reform, political violence and economic development. The research
addresses the extent to which political institutions vary in Africa and then
turns to demonstrating how political reform is affected by economic growth and
development. The research also shows how political reform and economic
development is mediated by the extent of political violence in a country. This
research produces considerable insight into the ways in which macro-level
phenomenon like economic conditions and levels of violence affect democratic
reforms.
