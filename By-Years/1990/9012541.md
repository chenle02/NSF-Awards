Theoretical analyses in elementary particle physics will determine the
predictions of the "standard model" of the basic forces for a variety of
physical processes which are to be explored experimentally at high energy
particle colliders of the present and future. These processes include production
of the particles which "carry" the weak force, production of jets of nuclear
particles, and production of the hypothetical Higgs particle which is related to
the origin of mass. If we are to be able to use experimental data on these
processes as evidence of physics that goes beyond the well - established but
limited "standard model," then we must first know the standard model predictions
for the processes. Hence, the studies to be undertaken in this project are an
important step in the search for physics beyond the standard model.
