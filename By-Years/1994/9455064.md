Though lasers have revolutionized research in optics and many other fields of
science, obstacles of cost and complexity have for the most part kept them out
of the undergraduate curriculum and laboratories. The goal of this project is
the operation of a workshop which will empower physicists and chemist to use
exciting new possibilities with diode lasers to bring demonstrations and
research opportunities before students. To accomplish this, attendees at a week-
long workshop will have direct, hands-on experience with a suite of diode-laser
experiments, and will receive seminar-format instruction in diode-laser
competencies for replication and operation of such experiments. They will also
become part of a follow-up support community intended to help them surmount
obstacles in their own laboratories. The workshop will be of interest to
physicists, and also chemical physicists, who want to bring modern tunable-laser
methods into the hands of students in courses on optics, electricity and
magnetism, quantum mechanics, and associated laboratory courses.
