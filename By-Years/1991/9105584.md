This is an award to the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) which is a
cooperative effort of U.S. companies and government agencies to strengthen and
maintain the vitality and competitive ability of the U.S. semiconductor
industry. It's two-fold mission is (1) to identify the scientific and technology
needs of the U.S. semiconductor industry and to develop and implement a long-
range strategy for meeting these needs; and (2) to enhance the skilled manpower
base of the industry. These goals ar realized through an integrated program of
basic research conducted by faculty and graduate students at leading U.S.
universities. Since 1982, the SRC has committed more than $150 million to this
mission and now supports more than one-half of all the silicon-related generic
research being carried out at U.S. universities. The intent of this grant is to
establish a new, three- year Memorandum of Understanding between the SRC and the
United States Government, as represented by the National Science Foundation,
which will provide the framework for continued Government participation.
