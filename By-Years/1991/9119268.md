This summer conference is concerned with the role of protein phosphatases in the
regulation of cellular processes. The areas of cellular events that are covered
are: nuclear proteins and transcription factors, receptors and ion channels,
growth regulation, tumor promoters, toxins, and phosphatase inhibitors, hormone
action, and cell signalling. The participants are the experts in their areas of
expertise. This meeting is international in scope and is held biannually. %%%
The FASEB summer conference on (Phosopho)protein Phosphatases will bring
together an outstanding group of researchers involved in biochemical, genetic,
and cell biology disciplines. There should be numerous opportunities for
interactions and collaborations that will accelerate progress in elucidating the
role of PPt's in regulatory events.
