Investigations of the electronic properties of lower dimensional metals using a
combination of magnetotransport and scanning tunneling microscopy techniques.
The materials to be studied include quasi-one- and two-dimensional metals
exhibiting charge- density-wave transitions (e.g., NbSe3, NbSee3 doped with Co,
Fe or Ni, and TaS3), and quasi-two-dimensional superconductors, including high-
Tc materials.
