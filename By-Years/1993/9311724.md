9311724 Perez Fundamental studies of epitaxial growth of diamond films by
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) will be conducted using scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM) in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV), and Raman spectroscopy to determine
the quality of the grown films. It is planned to study, at atomic resolution
detail, the growth of epitaxial diamond films on natural diamond substrates, and
the role that hydrogen plays in growth. Polycrystalline films on other
substrates will also be studied. The overall objectives include the study of
both the nucleation and growth of diamond films, and the role that hydrogen
plays in these processes. %%% Diamond films have a large number of potential
applications due to the unique chemical and physical properties of diamond.
Potential applications for diamond films include protective coatings, heat
sinks, optical windows, and transistors capable of operation at high
temperature, for example, at the internal operating temperatures of automobile
or airplane engines. This research is expected to contribute significantly to
our fundamental understanding of the formation of diamond films at low
temperature and pressure, and thereby to aid in the development of practical
applications of this unique material. ***
