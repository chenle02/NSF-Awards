This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
Program supports the research of Professor Janet Bluemel of Texas A&amp;M
University to synthesize a new generation of linkers for the immobilization of
catalysts on oxide supports. New 4,4'-bisphosphine biphenyl and p-tetraphosphine
tetraphenyl-element linkers incorporate rigid backbones which prevent the
phosphine groups and the bound complexes from bending down to the surface of the
support and decomposing. These tetraphenyl-element scaffolds offer up to three
metal coordination sites per surface binding site, so that optimal surface
coverages are obtained. Solid-state NMR is used to measure their translational
and precession-type mobility on the surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special
attention is given to the [(biphenyl)-R2PEt]+-O-{oxide support} linkage, as this
is the first time one can probe the "flexibility" of an ionic bond. The rigid
phosphine linkers are incorporated into metal catalysts for olefin hydrogenation
and hydrosilylation. Students will receive interdisciplinary training with both
internationally and industrially collaborative efforts.&lt;br/&gt;
