9601016 VandenBosch This award provides partial support for a Conference on
Emerging Model Legum Systems - Tools and Advances. The meeting will take place
July 12 - 14, 1996 in Knoxville, Tennessee, immediately prior to the 8th
International Congress on Molecular-Plant Microbe Interactions. The meeting has
two objectives: (A) to present a discussion of tools for genetic and molecular
analysis, plus selected advances which have applied these approaches, and (B) to
foster communication and interactions among researchers working on diploid
annual legumes as model systems. The format for the gathering will include
invited and contributed talks and discussion sections. Several means are planned
to communicate the proceedings of the conference, including a meeting review
article in The Plant Cell and the establishment of a home page for model legumes
The last five years have seen an increased interest in model systems to
facilitate genetic and molecular genetic analysis of development in legumes.
This meeting will bring together researchers from all over the world to discuss
how to coordinate activities of all interested parties.
