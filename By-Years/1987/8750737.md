The purpose of this project is to develop a microcomputer based psychology
student research laboratory. Perhaps the most important research tool of
contemporary psychology is the microcomputer, with its ability to present a
variety of stimuli, and to collect subjects' responses to them. Thus, an
important part of preparation for today's undergraduates must involve providing
them with opportunities to learn to use microcomputers, to design, set up, and
run psychological research, as well as to collect the data generated thereby,
analyze it, and prepare their findings for communication with other scholars.
The project is providing such learning experiences for psychology students
across a spectrum of courses. Students are being introduced to basic procedures
in their introductory courses, and to more advanced procedures in more advanced
courses, including courses which specifically focus on principles and methods of
research. Funding provided six APPLE microcomputers, peripheral hardware for
Networking, and selected software to complement the software library.
