The focus of this research will be design and preparation of C3 symmetric metal
reagents using optically active pyrazoles containing stereogenic centers
adjacent to the metal binding nitrogen to a central B, P, C, or N-centered
fragment. Complexes of Cu(I), Rh(III) and Fe(II and III) will then be prepared
and used to promote a variety of important enantioselective conversions
including cyclopropanations, 1,4-additions to enones, hydrosilylations,
oxidations and cycloadditions. %%% With this award, the Synthetic Organic
Program is supporting the research of Dr. William B. Tolman, a young
investigator in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Minnesota.
Professor Tolman will focus his work on projects that center on understanding
the effect of three-fold symmetry on metal-mediated asymmetric induction and on
developing new stereospecific synthetic processes.
