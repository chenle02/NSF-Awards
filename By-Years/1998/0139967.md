Investigations in theoretical high energy physics in areas of supersymmetry
phenomenology, CP violation, dark matter and extra dimensions and their
applications to model building will be carried out. The implications of the data
from the Brookhaven g-2 experiment and of RUNII of the Tevatron for
supersymmetry and surperstring theory will be explored. Correlated studies of
nonuniversalities, flavor and&lt;br/&gt;CP violation in grand unified and string
models will be carried out with the goal of achieving correlated predictions for
the electric dipole moments of leptons and of flavor violating processes. This
investigation&lt;br/&gt; is of importance in view of the proposed experiments
for the sensitive search of the muon electric dipole moment and of the process
mu-e+gamma.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Studies of the amount of supersymmetric dark
matter in the coannihilation region including effects of nonuniversalities will
be carried out. Further, studies of dark matter under the influence of CP
violation&lt;br/&gt;will also be carrried out in the coannihilation region.
Additional research will include investigations of new grand unified models
which can remove the current constraint on such models brought about by the
recent SuperKamiokande limit on the p-nubar+K mode. Such models include grand
unified models with large representations and models in extra dimensions.
Specifically the possible deduction of supergravity GUTs&lt;br/&gt;with a
cascade from higher dimensional supergravity theories to lower dimensional ones
along with supersymmetry breaking related to extra dimensions will be
investigated.
