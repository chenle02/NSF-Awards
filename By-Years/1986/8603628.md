The objective of this project is to study the degree to which the physical
conditions of equilibrium in climate-soil-vegetation systems, as formulated in
terms of their access to water, heat, and light, can represent the observed
gobal distribution and limits of vegetation. The research will address
formulation of analytical models of the equilibria of critical vegetation
formations, in terms of the physical variables and parameters governing
controlling water and energy fluxes. The resulting equilibria will be examined
for stability and uniqueness, and will be evaluated using observations from the
literature.
