This small grant for exploratory research (SGER) award by the Division of
Materials Research to University of California is to study new approaches to
replace high lead solder joints. By designing an ultra-fast reaction between the
lead-free eutectic Tin-Silver-Copper (SnAgCu) solder and Palladium (Pd), an
intermetallic joint of Palladdium-Tin compound can be formed that has the high
melting point required by industrial processing. The intermetallic joint can be
formed by a reflow step at a temperature of 250o C, and after the joint is
formed, it will not melt at 250o C. The innovative concept is that in forming
the intermetallic joint an ultra-fast reaction between eutectic SnAgCu solder
and Pd is used and a joint of 50 to 100 micron size is formed at 250o C in just
a few minutes. After formation, there no solder left. Since this type of joint
has not been studied before, this is considered to be a high-risk project.

Due to environmental concerns, there are four anti-lead bills pending in the US
Congress. One of them is from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The
European Union has already passed a law to ban the use of lead in electronic
products by July 1, 2006. In mainframe computers, a high melting point (above
300o C) high-lead (97Pb3Sn) solder has been used to connect silicon chips to
ceramic modules. The National Electronic Manufacturing Initiative (NEMI) has
recommended eutectic SnAgCu solder to replace low temperature eutectic SnPb
solder, but there is no lead-free solder available to replace the higher
temperature 97Pb3Sn solder. For this reason, the US mainframe computer companies
have obtained an exemption from the EPA to continue the use of high-lead solder
in manufacturing until 2010. This situation has resulted in an urgent need to
develop a high temperature lead-free solder. Research on this problem could
impact the future of our information technology and enhance US leadership in
global competition in high-end technology. From an educational point of view,
the SGER project supports two domestic students, including a female student.
