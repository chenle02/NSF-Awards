9413962 Sadayappan This award is for the acquisition of a mid-range scalable
parallel computer to support a number of active research projects. Some of these
projects focus on architectural issues, some on systems software issues, and
others on the development and evaluation of parallel algorithms and
applications. Besides facilitating several research projects within the
department, the machine will also aid in training graduate students in various
disciplines pertaining to Computational Science and Engineering. The following
specific projects that will benefit from acquisition of the parallel computer
are: (1) A Portable Parallel Programming Environment for Block-Recursive
Numerical Algorithms, (2)Communication / Synchronization Mechanisms for
Wormhole-Routed Systems, (3) Compiler Techniques for Efficient Execution of
Array Statements on Distributed Memory Machines, (4) Intelligent Simulation of
Nonlinear Dynamical Systems, (5) Large Scale Simulation of Oscillator Networks
for Pattern Segmentation, (6) Parallel Algorithms for Volume Rendering, (7)
Parallel Direct Sparse Matrix Algorithms for Distributed Memory Multiprocessors,
(8) Routing and (9) Mapping on Distributed Memory Multiprocessors. ***
