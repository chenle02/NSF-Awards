Abstract

The proposed research advances the novel design paradigm that polymeric
composites can be locally micro-tailored to meet design objectives. A liquid
polymer having randomly suspended micro- or nano-sized inclusions can be cured
in the presence of applied electric field to produce solid composite with
aligned microstructure. Locally structured inclusions enable one to (a) reduce
stress concentrations at discontinuities, (b) control hygrothermal and residual
stresses, and (c) provide self-sensing and smart material capabilities. The
major research objective of this three-year project is to substantiate
feasibility of the novel design approach by modifying composite microstructure
to reduce stress gradients at discontinuities. A tensile plate perforated with a
single hole or multiple holes is chosen as the study example. Individual
research activities include evaluation of process requirements, material testing
and predictive modeling for design optimization. This research will be
integrated with the educational missions of University of Wisconsin, Madison
which target student and community-at-large. The results will be utilized in
various educational and outreach activities and coordinated with the UW-Madison
Polymer Engineering and the NSF I/UCRC Centers.
