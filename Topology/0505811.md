The proposal deals with studying Heegaard Floer homology, the new invariants for
three-and four-dimensional spaces constructed by the investigator in
collaboration with Zoltan Szabo. These invariants give new insight into earlier
invariants for spaces constructed using gauge theoretic techniques: the
Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten invariants. In addition, they can be used to
address older topological questions, including specifically questions about Dehn
surgery on classical knots. This project aims to understand these invariants
better, and give further applications to knot theory and the topology of three-
and four-dimensional manifolds.

The introduction of equations with origins in mathematical physics has lead to
great advances in our understanding of the topological properties of three and
four-dimensional spaces in the past twenty years. Further progress in this area
is facilitated by an alternative, more geometric understanding of the data
derived from these equations. These alternative more geometric methods have been
the object of study of the investigator, and the present proposal deals with
further developments of these methods.
