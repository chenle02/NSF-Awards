ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0425737&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The redox
chemistry of iron (Fe) plays a fundamental role in marine geochemistry, yet
surprising little is known about these reactions in seawater. The oxidation
kinetics and solubility of Fe suggests that Fe(II) should be insignificant in
oxygenated seawater, yet unexpectedly high values have been reported. Although
analytical artifacts are usually called upon to explain such measurements,
scientists from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution have proposed an
alternative explanation that in some conditions, Fe(II) chelation by ligands
slows abiotic oxidation kinetics. Based on new evidence of a class of bacteria
that directly participate in mineral dissolution Fe oxidation do so with the aid
of Fe(II) binding ligands, they will study the interactions between Fe(II) and
organic ligands to provide new insights into Fe coordination and redox
chemistry. Using a unique model system will allow them to examine these
processes in detail with an organism that appears remarkably well adapted,
indeed thrives, in both high and low Fe conditions. Improved understanding of Fe
redox chemistry has a broad impact, due to its central role in the physiology of
all cells. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
