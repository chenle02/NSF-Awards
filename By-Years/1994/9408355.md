9408355 Theriot The Academy of Natural Sciences will computerize the taxonomic
determinations for all accessioned slides in the Academy of Natural Sciences of
Philadelphia Diatom Herbarium (ca. 184,000 entries). This will take
approximately 1.4 years requiring 2.0 FTE of which the Academy will supply 0.6
FTE for computer LAN management, supervision of data entry personnel,
verification of entries, taxonomic determinations and nomenclatural upgrades.
The requested funding for 1.4 FTE is for data entry. The material will be used
in the development of an ecological database in coordination with ecologists at
ANSP. There is a growing need within the diatomist community to construct and
analyze large databases in order to address larger problems of cultural and
natural effects on the environment. There are no published standards for aquatic
environmental databases.
