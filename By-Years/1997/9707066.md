A symposium on performance-based engineering will be held in January 1997 in
Berkeley. This symposium will be used to honor the contributions of Professor
Vitelmo Bertero to the field of earthquake engineering over his illustrious
career. Technical presentations on frontier research will be made on January 31
and February l. The target audience for the two-day technical program will focus
on performance-based earthquake engineering and a design. The symposium is split
into four one-half day sessions. The four session titles are: Reinforced
Concrete Structures, Steel Structures, Design Methodologies, and Learning from
Earthquakes. The Symposium will bring together many experts in the field of
earthquake engineering. It offers an outstanding opportunity for young faculty
from around the United States to gain state-of-the-knowledge information on
performance-based earthquake engineering, and to meet expert academicians,
researchers and design professionals. A unique feature of this meeting is to
bring 20 young faculty and 5 speakers from around the United States to the
Symposium. This will afford young researchers a valuable opportunity to interact
with senior and accomplished researchers in technical discussions.
