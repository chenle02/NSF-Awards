This award will support the research of three cultural anthropologists in
Antarctica, studying how an extreme and isolated environment affects group
structure and individuals' understanding of that structure. The incidence and
management of conflict will be studied as it is, in turn, affected by the group
structure. Both quantitative and qualitative data will be collected on the
formation of group structure, status and role consensus, perceived conflict and
morale for three groups at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole station. Quantitative
models of the formation of group structure will be created. This study will
contribute to our understanding of the role of group structure and cognition in
the functioning of groups in isolation, will complement work on health and
adaptation in polar environments, and provide important information that will
help develop improved procedures to assemble groups for the Antarctic and other
isolated environments (e.g., space stations).
