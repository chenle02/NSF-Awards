The State University of New York (SUNY) Louis Stokes Alliance for
Minority&lt;br/&gt;Participation (SUNY LSAMP), under the leadership of SUNY-
Stony Brook, will support&lt;br/&gt;12 additional post-baccalaureate students
during the 2011-2013 Bridge to the Doctorate&lt;br/&gt;(BD) program at the SUNY-
Binghamton. This program builds on previous program&lt;br/&gt;efforts that have
not only significantly added to the graduate enrollment and
masters&lt;br/&gt;and doctoral degrees to students from underreprested minority
(UREP) populations but&lt;br/&gt;have also led to important changes in the
culture and practice of STEM education in&lt;br/&gt;ways that not only help UREP
students but all graduate STEM students.&lt;br/&gt;The project adds to current
efforts by SUNY LSAMP to build research capacity in STEM&lt;br/&gt;education in
the area of graduate education. The lessons learned from the study of
the&lt;br/&gt;Bridge to the Doctorate Program will be put into the context of
broader issues of&lt;br/&gt;systemic change and disseminated to a broad national
audience.&lt;br/&gt;Using the lessons learned from this project, the alliance
expects to continue to develop&lt;br/&gt;and refine strategies that will
increase the recruitment and retention of graduate&lt;br/&gt;students and
further diversify graduate education departments. The strategy has
the&lt;br/&gt;potenital to increase the number of UREP STEM students who
successfully complete&lt;br/&gt;doctoral degrees in STEM disciplines and make
changes in STEM departmental culture&lt;br/&gt;and practice.
