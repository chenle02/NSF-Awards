9322106 Barber Frictional heating of brakes generates thermoelastic
instabilities which can result in vibrations at high speed. The phenomenon is
particularly pronounced in high performance systems, such as those which
currently are under development for automotive uses. Analytical methods for
determining critical speeds of hot spot development will be extended from
semifinite conditions to the finite dimensions of actual brake systems. The
approach assumes exponential growth with time of an initially small
perturbation, modifies the problem to an eigenvalue problem in spatial dimension
only, and discretizes it by the finite element method. Parallel experiments to
validate the results will be run at Allied Signal Corporation's Friction
Materials Department. ***
