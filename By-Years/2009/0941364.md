Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;In this project, new microscale imaging and chemical
identification capabilities are being developed through the innovative
coursework based on the Raman Scattering microscopy and Raman spectroscopy
instrumentation acquired by the State University of New York at Potsdam. The
innovative coursework involves hands-on experience with Raman instrumentation
for students of two science departments (Chemistry and Biology) and the
Anthropology department. A series of new experiments are being developed for use
in lower division undergraduate courses, and a series of new laboratories
incorporating advanced technologies are being introduced in upper division
courses. The new instrumental capabilities are also being utilized to engage
students in undergraduate research in the fields of nanoscience phenomena to
enhance students' preparation for solving future challenges in the work place,
industrial labs or academia. At the same time, demonstrations are being carried
out for anthropology students with the aim to spread the information about the
unique features and outstanding possibilities of compound identification and
microscale analysis. While the high resolution Raman imaging techniques and
chemical identification of species down to single molecule level have been
presented in textbooks and research papers, the new hands-on experiences for
students creates the opportunity to enhance students' comprehension of chemistry
at the nanoscale level and enables them to gain new laboratory skills. These
experiences integrated across the curriculum are advancing the learning process
to the challenges of the explosion of nanoscience discoveries and emerging
nanotechnologies requiring new approaches to the identification and monitoring
of active chemical species in nanostructures.
