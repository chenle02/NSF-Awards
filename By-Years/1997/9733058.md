An Integrated computational and experimental methodology for stochastic
prediction of elastic-plastic fracture parameters and probabilistic
characterization of fracture initiation and loads for two-and three-dimensional
cracked structures is developed. The developments have a broad impact on
standard industry practices of equipment reliability, remaining life assessment,
and fracture control. The developments are also integrated into the training of
undergraduate and graduate students. A textbook incorporating these advances is
prepared.
