Algebraic geometry studies algebraic varieties which are geometric objects
defined by polynomial equations. It plays an important role in neighboring
fields such as differential geometry. A natural and important question
connecting these areas is to find and classify algebraic varieties with nice
geometric structures, such as metrics with constant curvature. In recent years,
the development of higher dimensional algebraic geometry has led to a number of
breakthroughs in the search for such metrics when the algebraic varieties are
positively curved. The goal of this project is to advance these ideas to further
understand the geometric structure of general algebraic varieties. In addition
the project provides training and research opportunities for students and early-
career researchers in related areas, through seminars, summer schools, and other
activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, the project is motivated by the
influential Yau-Tian-Donaldson Conjecture that existence of canonical metrics
should be equivalent to some algebraic stability condition known as K-stability.
The PI will to develop a local K-stability theory for general Kawamata log
terminal singularities, with a view towards the understanding of their
birational geometry and moduli. The PI will also investigate some interesting
new questions in birational geometry that are inspired by recent progress in
K-stability. Finally the project will further advance the algebraic theory of
K-stability from the Fano case to the general polarized case, and attack some
open problems related to the Yau-Tian-Donaldson
conjecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
