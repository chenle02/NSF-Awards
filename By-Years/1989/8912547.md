The purpose of this project is to determine the current status, nature, and
rationale of R&D investments in Japan by U.S. corporations. The study will 1)
establish an inventory of U.S. corporations known to have made or to be making
such R&D investments in Japan, 2) develop a questionnaire designed to elicit
information relevant to the research objective, and 3) administer the survey to
the companies identified in step 1. Since relatively little is known about U.S.
corporate R&D activity in Japan, the survey will attempt to establish a baseline
of information regarding U.S. R&D operations in Japan. The growing investment in
Japanese R&D facilities by U.S. firms is of relevance to policymakers in terms
of addressing such issues as technology transfer, the globalization of
industrial R&D, and U.S.-Japanese technological competitiveness. This study
represents a significant first step in understanding U.S. R&D investments in
Japan by establishing a quantitative benchmark for such interests as the number
of firms investing in R&D in Japan, the volume of their current and capital R&D
investments, the nature of R&D (basic, applied development, product, process)
the characteristics of the scientists and engineers employed, and other detailed
statistical information. Additional survey items regarding the business
objectives, strategies, and experiences of companies with R&D labs in Japan
should provide important qualitative information on the rationale for corporate
R&D investments in Japan.
