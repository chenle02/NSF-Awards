Summary: This proposal requests funding for an exploratory field effort to test
the feasibility of acquiring long multi-decadal to multi-century coral time
series from subaerially exposed reefs in the western Pacific warm pool. Large
coral heads from raised terraces in the Western Solomon Islands will be cored. A
limited set of x-ray analyses, U-series dating, and isotopic measurements will
be done to test the suitability of these locations for providing reliable multi-
decadal to multi-century coral time series records for intervals of the
Holocene. &lt;br/&gt;
