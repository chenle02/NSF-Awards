This project involves the dissertation research of a student of cultural
anthropology from the University of California-Los Angeles. The project involves
studying the paternal behavior of men in a small-scale foraging society in
Tanzania. The hypotheses to be tested involve the consequences of different
levels of paternal care for the men involved. The student will assess the men's
payoffs from the provision of such care, in terms of improved status of their
wife and children, and in terms of access to other social benefits. The
differences in care provision to own children and step-children will be
assessed, through time allocation measures, intensive interviews, and
observations of foraging work and income. This research is important because the
opportunity to study human society at this socio-cultural level is fast
disappearing, as forager societies disappear. The expertise that this training
will provide about this sort of society, about the general region, and about the
specific theoretical issues of human paternity, child-care and its consequences,
will represent a valuable benefit for the country.
