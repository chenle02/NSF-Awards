This grant supports research at a Primarily Undergraduate Institution. The
majority of this funding goes to supporting the students to participation in
fundamental space weather research. Specifically, they will investigate how the
high altitude, non-neutral atmosphere (the ionosphere) affects modes of
transport in Earth's magnetic field (the magnetosphere). This involves
incorporating auroral data into an existing predictive model. This will improve
the community's ability to understand and predict space weather ultimately
providing a broader societal benefit by helping to protect human technology from
damage due to space weather phenomenon. Many studies have focused on the solar
wind driving to explain the different modes of magnetospheric transport, while
ignoring the role of the ionosphere. This project will investigate if
ionospheric feedback helps determine what mode the magnetosphere enters. The
team will incorporate both auroral data and modeling to calculate the
ionospheric conductance, Joule heating, and other parameters during these
events. By using Polar UVI auroral images as an input to the Global Ionosphere-
Thermosphere Model (GITM), accurate simulations of key ionospheric parameters
during these modes are anticipated, making this the first study of its kind.
