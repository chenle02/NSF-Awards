The purpose of this research is to analyze the role of immigration, commodity
trade and capital markets on the evolution of an international labor market
linking Europe and the New World over the century following 1870. Rather than
pursuing the traditional focus on the migrations themselves, the project will
focus instead on wages and employment in sending and receiving regions,
identifying episodes of labor market integration and disintegration as well as
isolating the causes for these changes. Special attention will be given to the
role of environmental factors leading to labor force migration such as the Irish
potato famine and the environmental decay experienced by urban centers during
the industrial revolution. The project will also explore the role of migration
in distributing the incidence of unemployment in response to global output
shocks, including identifying country experience with wage flexibility and
stickiness, and how that experience is related to international migrations and
the attributes of sectors which dominate sending and receiving regions. The
project will also search for an endogenous explanation for the timing and
location of quotas, subsidies, and other policy interventions. This research is
important because it will enhance our understanding of the dynamics of labor
migration and the impact of environmental change on migration.
