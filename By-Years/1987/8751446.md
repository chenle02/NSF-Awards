The Franklin Institute Science Museum will design, test, fabricate, and
circulate to eight museums an exhibit, "The Science of Music: Sound Waves and
Sound Forms" that will introduce visitors to the physical laws that govern sound
waves. By using music as an attractive and concrete subject to engage broad
public interest, the exhibit will illustrate such topics as sound wave
amplitude, phase, frequency, reflection and interference. Primary support for
the project comes from the eight member Science Museum Exhibit Collaborative,
consisting of: the Franklin Institute Science Museum, Philadelphia, PA;
Discovery Place, Charlotte, NC; the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History,
Fort Worth, TX; the California Museum of Science and Industry, Los Angeles, CA;
the Science Museum of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN; the Museum of Science and
Industry, Chicago, IL; the Center of Science and Industry (COSI), Columbus, OH;
and the Museum of Science, Boston, MA. Each has contributed $50,000 and the
costs of exhibit shipping and maintenance. Direct matching fund support totals
more than $381,000. The exhibit will spend three months in each location, and
the total audience will exceed 1.5-million visitors over its eight museum tour.
This project will extend the work of a group of museums that are already helping
each other in a collaborative effort. The exhibit concept has high public appeal
among groups that science finds it hard to reach, including teenagers and
minorities. An FY87 award of $145,000 is recommended.
