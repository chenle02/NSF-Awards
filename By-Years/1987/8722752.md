The University of North Carolina Computer Science Department is undertaking the
development of a prototyping capability for complete systems: chips,
architectures, hardware integration, operating systems, compilers, application
software, and user interfaces. The development of this capability will be done
in such a way that it can be transplanted to other locations, thereby creating
the possibility of a decentralized national capability for experimental computer
systems research. The development of the systems prototyping capability will be
structured around seven shared laboratories: the Micrelectronics Design
Laboratory, the Microelectronic Systems Laboratory, the Software Systems
Laboratory, the Graphics and Image Laboratory, the Natural Language and Text
Laboratory, the Communications Facility/Research Laboratory, and the Computer
Facilities. A previous CER grant provided support to improve the Computer
Facilities, to build up the Microelectronic Systems Laboratory, and to modernize
the Graphics and Image Laboratory. The current award will be for development of
the Software Systems Laboratory, enlargement of the Microelectronic Systems
Laboratory, modernization of the Microelectronics Design Laboratory and
expansion of the Computer Facilities and of a prototype of a new type of low-
cost inter-university network.
