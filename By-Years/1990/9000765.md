This project will establish at New Mexico Highlands University a research
experiences for undergraduates site during the 1990 academic year. Most of the
students recruited will be of Hispanic origins and will come from the NMHU
campus. The proposed research will explore the use of expert systems technology
to determine which bones in scattered or mixed skeletons belong to a particular
individual. The research will focus on the development of a knowledge database,
the discovery of rules and heuristics useful for bone discrimination, and the
representation of bone knowledge for computer manipulation.
