The Connecting Researchers, Educators and Students (CREST) program
(http://cbm.msoe.edu/crest) is designed to advance use of physical and computer
based models of molecular structures to enhance student learning, introduce
students to science research and to determine the impact of these additions to
the learning environment. Both the 3-D printed protein models and the
accompanying learning materials are produced by teams of students and faculty in
consultation with researchers whose work is described in the materials or based
on a reading of the appropriate primary literature. This current project is
disseminating the CREST approach to other institutions through workshops and
web-based materials. The project also adds to the information concerning the
learning outcomes evolving from CREST since it focuses on the rigorous
assessment of the impact of the program on student learning at three large
institutions (UW-Madison, Stony Brook University and Rochester Institute of
Technology), while simultaneously testing new paradigms of scalability and
dissemination across the nation. A new component of this expansion project
involves partnering with the Medical College of Wisconsin to offer training to
future faculty in student-centered, active pedagogy.

The intellectual merit of this proposal is that it responds to recent calls to
transform undergraduate education so that students actively engage in science
discourse and practice and the strength and experience of the leadership team.

The broader impact of this project is the information it is gathering on the
importance of physical models and visualization in helping students understand
biochemical and molecular processes and their importance in metabolic and
pharmaceutical processes.
