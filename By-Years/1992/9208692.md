This research is concerned with twin buildings and Kac-Moody groups. The main
thrust of the work is towards a classification of twin buildings of rank at
least three, and the groups of Kac-Moody type which operate on them. The
principal investigator will also study local-global properties of affine
buildings and the global structure of hyperbolic buildings. The research
supported is in a crucial area where several parts of mathematics intersect.
This project endeavors to classify certain finite groups by using finite
geometry and combinatorics. The geometric connection to the theory of reductive
algebraic groups and Kac-Moody groups is important for the study of finite
simple groups.
