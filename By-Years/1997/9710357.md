Elliot, Collinson, Hammer OPP 9710357 Earth science research in the central and
southern Transantarctic Mountains during the last 35 years has provided a wealth
of new information on the geologic evolution of the Ross Sea sector of the
continent. Many of these advances have had significance to the global
geosciences community, such as the vertebrate faunas, anatomically well
preserved plant fossils, and the young fossiliferous glacial deposits indicating
radically different climatic conditions. This award supports a workshop aimed at
capitalizing on these past advances by developing a white paper on possible
future research directions and identifying key scientific questions that can be
addressed. Research goals fall into four general topic areas: Late Precambrian-
Early Paleozoic development; Gondwana paleontology and paleoclimate; Mesozoic
and Cenozoic tectonic evolution; and Cenozoic landscape evolution and
paleoclimate. The workshop will also address the support required to carry out
remote field projects in this new ear of logistic capabilities. The workshop
will lead to a report that will lay out scientific goals for future research in
the central and southern Transantarctic Mountains.
