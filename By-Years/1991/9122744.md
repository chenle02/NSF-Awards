This MRI Research Planning Grant (RPG) will enable a young minority woman
faculty member to develop a competitive proposal in the area of quantum effect
phenomena in electronic materials. Her background and expertise is in the MBE
growth of such materials and structures. The requested RPG will provide the PI
with the support needed to gather and review additional literature, carefully
formulate materials calculations needed for design and growth of double barrier
resonant tunneling structures appropriate to the line of research she intends to
follow, to establish direct contacts with active researchers in this field, and
to further collaborations in progress. %%% Research in this field is oriented
toward the examination of hot electron and phonon-assisted tunneling effects
under double barrier resonant tunneling conditions associated with quantum
confinement structures fabricated in thin layers of semiconductors. The research
forms the basis for advanced electronic and photonic devices having potential
performance beyond conventional device structures and configurations.
