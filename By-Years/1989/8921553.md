Capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) is a relatively new technique for the
separation of small amounts of complex mixtures of biomolecular compounds. Used
generally as an analytic technique, the remarkable sensitivity of CZE recommends
it in a variety of applications to studies of molecules of biological interest.
Attempts to increase the sensitivity of CZE instrumentation will focus on use of
even finer capillaries than those in use currently. As the width of the
capillaries approaches the wavelength of light, the role of photon wavelength,
of the angle of photon incidence and of capillary imperfections will become of
crucial importance. The work funded through this award will investigate these
effects with the aim of establishing (practical as well as theoretical) limits
to capillary size with respect to both sensitivity and reproduciblity.
