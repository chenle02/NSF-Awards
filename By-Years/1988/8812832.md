The Cornell Theory Center, including the Cornell National Supercomputing
Facility, proposes to conduct a two-week Supercomputer Summer Institute for 25
young researchers. The Institute will focus on numerical techniques to exploit
vector and parallel processing through lectures and hands-on workshop sessions.
Attendees will bring with them their own computer codes which will be used as
the vehicle for training and education in optimization. Each attendee will be
given 10 computer service units which can be used after the Institute is over.
The Cornell Institute will be held directly following a regular one- week
session of the Cornell Remote User Training Workshop. The workshop will insure a
good grasp of the mechanics of using the Cornell facilities, and will take
advantage of course material which has been tested in previous sessions. The
original proposal request funding in the amount of $55,951. Negotiation has
succeeded in reducing the cost while maintaining most of the original scope of
work. An award is recommended in the amount of $30,000.
