The objective of this project is to obtain a better understanding than is now
existant of the transport of groundwater contaminants in the subsurface
environment. Laboratory work will be conducted to study the simultaneous
movement of multiple fluids in porous media and biodegradation of contaminants
in flowing aqueous solutions. The mathematical characterization obtained from
this work will then be related to its potential applicability in field-scale
applications that could be utilized to address environmental engineering
problems relating to and associated with aquifers that are contaminated.
