The main goals of this project are to define the various senses in which
mathematics is applicable in the natural sciences and to establish whether or
not the applicability of mathematics--in any or all of the senses--poses a
philosophical problem. Recent philosophy of mathematics, where it deals at all
with the applicability of mathematics, emphasizes metaphysical issues concerning
the alleged gap between mathematical reality and physical reality. Dr. Steiner
is dealing with epistemic issues of concern to physicists: what Eugene Wigner
has called the "unreasonable effectiveness" of (a) mathematical concepts and (b)
mathematical formalisms. Unlike Wigner, however, Dr. Steiner is focusing
primarily on the role of mathematics in discovery: (a) how mathematical concepts
allow physicists to make discoveries by formal mathematical analogy; and (b) how
mathematical formalisms are, in the words of Heinrich Hertz, "wiser than their
discoverers," since they contain latent, unintended information.
