Mixed-function oxidases (MFO'S) are enzymes that allow insects to tolerate
poisonous chemicals such as insecticides and certain plant compounds. Some
plants protect themselves from insects (and other herbivores) by making chemical
compounds that are toxic to the animals which try and feed on them. The MFO
enzymes detoxify chemical compounds, usually by changing their chemical
structure. The study of mixed-function oxidase enzymes, therefore, will provide
information as to how insects become resistant to insecticides and/or toxic
plant chemicals. This proposal involves the use of an insect-plant model system.
The insects are fruit-flies of the genus Drosophila, and the plants are columnar
cacti which grow in the Sonoran Desert of Mexico. A wealth of background
information on this model system has already been obtained including data on the
ecology and genetics of the fruit flies and identification and characterization
of the toxic chemicals that the cacti produce. The experiments outlined in this
proposal will establish a connection between the mixed-function oxidase enzymes
in these insects and their tolerance to the poisonous chemicals in the cactus
plants. This is a necessary first-step in a long-term study of the ecological
and evolutionary genetics of the genes which produce MFO enzymes in insects.
Understanding this system could be an important contribution to the development
of more effective insecticides.
