This proposal requests funds for a medium- sized parallel cluster computer to
investigate various computationally intensive problems arising in materials
science and mechanics. A particular problem of interest is the computation of
the mesoscale dynamics of systems of dislocations, and their relation to
continuum plastic deformation. Another problem that is the focus of current work
is the estimation of local elastic properties using mean square displacement
data from a large parallel molecular dynamics code. Other ongoing efforts that
will benefit from this facility are the simulation of solute diffusion to a
crack tip using kinetic Monte Carlo techniques and the effect of dopants upon
the creep resistance of high strength ceramics.

Computational materials modeling at Lehigh University is an interdisciplinary
enterprise involving researchers in several allied departments. Much of the
ongoing work is focused on obtaining a better understanding of how various
structural features affect the mechanical properties of materials over a wide
range of length and time scales. Indeed, research projects ongoing at Lehigh
have begun to produce significant advances, for example, in our understanding of
the high-temperature creep behavior of ceramic oxides, in the development of
constitutive relations for plasticity that link the mesoscale and the continuum,
in the quantification of local stresses and elastic constants, and in the
description of fracture behavior in materials with segregating impurities. This
proposal requests funds to acquire a relatively large Beowulf computing cluster
that will enable us to make significant leaps in our research program in
computational materials modeling
