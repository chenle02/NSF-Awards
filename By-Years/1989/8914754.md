Pressure swing adsorption (PSA) is a periodic adsorption process that utilizes
the kinetic effects arising from diffusion rate differences in the sorbent among
fluid mixture components to elicit a specie separation. It is a key industrial
separation methodology that in most applications to date is bound by
thermodynamic equilibrium limitations. The proposed research aims to extend the
range of this technology by exploring the kinetic phase of PSA which, although
still a relatively new methodology, holds the promise for an increasingly large
number of significant industrial applications. This research is a systematic
theoretical and experimental study designed to establish a firm basis for this
new and novel technology. Included in the work will be three important
separations: O2/N2 (AIR), CO2/CH4, and N2/CH4. The latter will be most
challenging because there are no commercial adsorbents available with the
requisite sorbent equilibrium selectivity. Several promising candidates have
been identified and will be investigated. The theoretical research along with
the adjunct experimentation here proposed will provide a firm foundation for
this new separation method for a wide range of potentially economically
important processes.
