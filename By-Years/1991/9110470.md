A numerical and theoretical study of the motion of deformable drops in flow
through circular tubes is proposed. This investigation incorporates the effects
of finite inertia and surfactant impurities. A modified version of the continuum
surface force (CFS) model is developed which accounts for the transport of
insoluble surfactant in the deformed surface of the drop. The modified CSF model
is used to obtain numerical solutions for the drop deformation and speed, as
well as the additional pressure loss in the tube due to the presence of the
drop. The drop shape and its velocity relative to the average velocity of the
two-phase system are measured in vertical glass tubes wherein the motion of the
drop through the tube is visualized, and then compared to numerical solutions.
The results of the proposed study will enhance our understanding of the motion
of drops in pipe flow. In addition, the development of the modified CSF model
will allow the application of this model to the solution of other problems
involving fluid-fluid interfaces.
