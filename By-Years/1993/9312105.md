9312105 Cruickshank This award provides funds to support the participation of
graduate students, junior scientists, and distinguished U.S. and foreign
scientists in the Gordon Conference on "Solar Plasma Physics and MHD Processes",
to be held at Plymouth State College, New Hampshire, August 9-13, 1993. This is
a follow-on to a highly- successful conference held at Plymouth two years ago.
It is generally accepted that fluid dynamical and plasma physics processes lie
at the heart of solar physics. The interdisciplinary aspects of solar physics
are encouraged in the organization of the conference which includes members of
the laboratory plasma physics, and fusion physics communities as well as solar
and mangetospheric physicists. ***
