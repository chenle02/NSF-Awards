Atomic transactions have been widely studied as a mechanism for coping with
concurrency and failures, particularly in distributed systems. A variety of
concurrency control and recovery algorithms exist. Unfortunately, not all
concurrency control algorithms can be used with all recovery algorithms. The
goal of this work is to study the interactions among the pieces of a distributed
transaction system, including concurrency control, recovery, commit
coordination, orphan detection, deadlock detection, and replication. By
understanding the fundamental requirements placed on each piece by the other
pieces, we expect to be able to develop more general algorithms, and to make it
easier to adapt algorithms designed for one system for use in other systems. We
also plan to study the division of work between the application program and the
underlying system, with the goal of doing as much as possible in the system
while still providing the expressive power necessary to, for example, use
application semantics to provide high levels of concurrency. ^R JUSTIFICATION
