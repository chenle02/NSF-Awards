This award supports Prof. Donald Kapraun of the University of North Carolina at
Wilmington in collaboration with Prof. Andres Lemus of the Universidad de
Oriente, Cumana, Venezuela. The researchers intend to engage in a basic research
project that will complement an applied research effort in Venezuela to
commercially exploit local seaweed resources, initially by harvesting biomass
from nature, and subsequently by developing the technology to raise selected
seaweeds in a mariculture system. More specifically, the researchers plan to:
screen selected isolates for suitability as mariculture seed stock; determine
optimal conditions of light intensity, water temperature and salinity for their
growth; develop techniques to vegetatively propagate cloned isolates by
spheroplast isolation or fragmentation, and to seed substrate for outdoor
cultivation; and initiate sexual and somatic hybridization studies to determine
the feasibility of creating new genotypes. By combining techniques of genetic
engineering of the U.S. side with the information from field studies of the
Venezuelan side on the seasonality of growth and reproduction of certain seaweed
species, the proposed research has the potential to help develop a seaweed
mariculture industry for developing countries.
