Computational complexity is the study of the inherent difficulty of
computational problems. The theory considers various models of computation, such
as classical computers, probabilistic computers, and quantum computers. For each
of these, it aims to describe how many resources are needed to compute the
solution to a problem as a function of the problem size.

The most prominent open question in complexity theory is whether the ability to
efficiently verify the validity of a candidate solution implies the ability to
efficiently compute a valid solution (assuming one exists). The question is
usually stated in terms of the corresponding classes of computational problems:
Is NP contained in P? Lots of computational problems from virtually any
discipline fall in the class NP but are not known to be in P. Therefore, a
positive answer to the P versus NP question would have tremendous algorithmic
implications. It would also imply a way to break any public-key cryptographic
system, as the security of such systems rests on the assumption that a
particular problem in NP does not belong to P.

This research project aims to develop techniques for determining the
relationships between complexity classes like P and NP: separations and
inclusions. On the separation side, the investigators focus on techniques that
do not suffer from the known pitfalls of relativization and natural proofs. In
particular, they concentrate on indirect diagonalization and exhibiting
distinguishing properties of complete problems. On the inclusion side, the
emphasis lies on efficient classical simulations of time and space bounded
probabilistic and quantum computations.

The educational goal consists of the development of graduate courses on pseudo-
randomness and derandomization and on quantum computing. At the undergraduate
level, the investigators plan to further the integration of discrete structures
in the core curriculum.
