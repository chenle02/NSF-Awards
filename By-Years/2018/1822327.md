This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award will support the
progress of science and advance the national prosperity and welfare by
transforming how urban systems researchers use data analytics in their studies.
Scientific progress in many operational problems in urban mobility, energy and
water usage, public safety, and healthcare is limited by lack of access to real-
world data. Currently, new models and algorithms developed by the operations
research community are often tested on simulated datasets that may not reflect
real operating conditions. Research supported by this project will enable the
creation of a novel Computational Operations Research Exchange (CORE) platform
that aims to overcome these limitations. CORE platform will allow researchers
from different disciplines to leverage actual operational data and compare their
methods and results on realistic scenarios. The exchange platform will also
provide a mechanism to encourage cross-disciplinary collaborations, which are
important to innovative solutions to complex societal problems.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will use a Systems-of-Systems approach to
build a re-usable cyber-infrastructure for operations research models. With
today's availability of open access public datasets, the platform will provide a
plug-and-play paradigm which can share data, models and algorithms in a seamless
manner, allowing researchers to effectively compare algorithms on real datasets.
The project will begin with three use-cases drawn from applications in energy,
transportation, and urban analytics. The PIs will design protocols so that these
applications will be instantiated using data available across many different
regions in the country, thus allowing models of similar scope to be tested using
regional datasets. The platform will provide generic model interfaces, where
alternative model types will be allowed to work on common datasets for
comparison purposes. The PIs are committed to working closely with women
and&lt;br/&gt;minorities and will involve two women Ph.D students in this
project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
