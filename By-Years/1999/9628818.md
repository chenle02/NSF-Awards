The principal investigator will develop on-line statistical techniques for the
operations and management of ATM networks. The statistical techniques include:
estimating the quality of service, estimating the spare resources, and improving
network operations. The motivation for this work is: 1) user-network contracts
specify a quality of service that is difficult to verify and 2) the network
needs to monitor its performance in real time to improve its operations. Some
users will want to monitor the QoS that the network provides. For instance, if
the user is a service reseller, he may want to protect himself against
complaints from subscribers. Similarly, the network will use such monitoring for
quality control and also for improving its operations. Given the likely
penetration of ATM networks, improving the operations and management of these
networks is an important objective. The statistical properties of quality of
service estimators are difficult to analyze on realistic models. Consequently,
this research will combine analysis, simulation, and actual experiments to
develop the on-line techniques.
