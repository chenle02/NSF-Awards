ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;0204084&lt;br/&gt;Gilbert Stewart&lt;br/&gt;University of
Maryland College Park&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Krylov sequence methods are widely
used in the solution of large eigenproblems (e.g., the Lanczos and Arnoldi
methods) and the solution of large linear systems (e.g., the conjugate gradient
method and GMRES). In their ordinary applications these methods are well
understood and have a firm theoretical basis. In more exotic applications,
however, the theory and practice are not as advanced. This proposal in concerned
with&lt;br/&gt;three of these applications. Residual Krylov methods. The
property of being a Krylov sequence is very sensitive to error. A single error
toward the beginning of the sequence causes permanent loss of&lt;br/&gt;accuracy
in the approximations to eigenvectors in the Krylov subspace. This has the
consequence that when shift-and-invert techniques are used to enhance the
spectrum of a matrix, the resulting linear systems must be solved to full
accuracy at each step of the process. It turns out, however, that if the
sequence is extended using the residual for a targeted eigenvector, the sequence
converges to that vector even when the shift-and-&lt;br/&gt;invert equations are
solved inaccurately. The practical consequences of this observation, which needs
new theory to support it, promises to be great.
