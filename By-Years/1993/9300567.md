This action will support the continuation of an REU Site at the University of
Michigan-Ann Arbor. Approximately twenty students, mostly from other colleges,
will spend a ten-week research apprenticeship. Recruitment for the program will
be through SPS chapters nationally, with special attention to recruiting from
historically black institutions and small colleges which lack the large number
of research opportunities available at the University of Michigan. In addition
to their research experience, students will have the opportunity to take a
course in shop technique and mini course in practical electronics skills.
Opportunities to explore research areas other than their primary placement will
be provided.
