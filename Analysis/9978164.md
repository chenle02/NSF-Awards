DMS-9978164 ABSTRACT

The Southeastern-Atlantic Regional Conference on Differential Equations
(SEARCDE) has met annually since 1981, and rotates among the research
institutions in the southeast. SEARCDE's primary objective is to promote
research and education in the field of differential equations by bringing
together established and new researchers, including advanced graduate students,
for the exchange of ideas and the discussion of recent developments in the
field. By covering a wide range of topics, including ordinary and partial
differential equations, integral and functional equations, numerical methods,
inverse problems, and applications to the sciences and engineering, these
conferences expose participants to current research outside of their immediate
area of concentration. They provide opportunities for all participants to
present their own work in contributed talks, to interact with other researchers
from the region and beyond, and to broaden their knowledge of the field by
hearing the invited lectures of eminent mathematicians.

The field of differential equations continues to be one of the driving forces of
mathematical research and its applications. With its special format, chosen to
minimize the cost and inconvenience of participation, and its traditional
emphasis on the support of young mathematicians, SEARCDE brings together
established and new researchers in this field from a vast region of the country
on a regular basis. The conference thereby provides unique opportunities for the
advancement of research and education in the broad field of differential
equations, as well as its myriad applications in the sciences and engineering.
In addition, this conference provides opportunities for young researchers to
present their work to an expert audience and to further their knowledge of the
field by interacting with more experienced mathematicians. Such interaction is
crucial to a young mathematician's professional development as a researcher and
educator.
