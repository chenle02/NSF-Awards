The project continues efforts to include polymeric materials topics in the
undergraduate chemistry core curriculum. Instructional packets and laboratory
experiments will be prepared for use by college and university faculty who have
little or no prior experience in the polymer area. The project utilizes and
extends the organization and infrastructure developed in a related earlier
grant. The three regional sites established in the earlier grant (Rennselear
Polytechnic Institute, the University of Southern Mississippi, and the
University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point) again will host the NSF- POLYED Scholars
who are developing polymer curricular materials during summer residencies at
these sites. In addition, instructional videotapes will be prepared at the
University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point. Regional workshops will be offered at the
three regional sites to begin dissemination of the curricular materials
developed. The effort also will move beyond general chemistry to include the
preparation of polymer curricular materials for the organic sequence. The
materials will be field tested and then disseminated widely through the proposed
workshops, through publications, and from the POLYED National Information Center
for Polymer Education.
