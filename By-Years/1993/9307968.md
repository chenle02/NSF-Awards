land and resource tenure systems among indigenous peoples of the Russian North
during the Soviet and post-Soviet periods. Legislation and policy developments
will be described.The study areas represents a cross-section of physical and
cultural environments, political statuses and relative stages of industrial
development. Methods adapted from land and occupancy and subsistence surveys
from the Western Arctic will be updated to incorporate GIS analysis techniques.

the Russian North, which is both a major source of raw materials and homeland to
numerous indigenous groups. ***
