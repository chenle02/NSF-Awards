A workshop focused on identifying key contributions of research in artificial
intelligence (AI) to the National Information Infrastructure (NII), in
particular to the Information Infrastructure Technology and Applications (IITA)
program is proposed. The workshop will bring together AI scientists from a broad
spectrum of research areas and institutions with Program Directors from NSF. It
will be held in conjunction with annual scientific meeting of the American
Association for Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), and will both draw on expertise
of attendees at the conferences and report to them. A report summarizing the
findings of the meeting will be prepared and disseminated with the assistance of
AAAI.
