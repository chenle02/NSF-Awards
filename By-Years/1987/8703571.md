The Molecular Control of Nitrate Reductase Synthesis in Squash and Soybeans:
The study of the regulation of nitrate reductase, the first enzyme in the
nitrate assimilatory pathway will be studied using molecular biologic techniques
C-DNA clones for soybean nitrate reductase isoforms will be isolated and
characterized. Understanding control of this rate limiting enzyme for the use of
nitrate by higher plants may make it possible to increase the efficiency of this
energy costly process.
