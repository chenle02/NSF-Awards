9802861 Guilbault This award provides partial support for a workshop in
geometric topology to be held in each of the summers of 1998, 1999, and 2000.
The 1998 workshop will be held in Park City, Utah, with Brigham Young University
acting as host, with Professor David G. Wright as the local organizer, and with
Professor Steven C. Ferry of SUNY-Binghamton as the principal lecturer. The 1999
workshop will be held at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, and the 2000
workshop will be held at Colorado College. These workshops belong to a well
established series that began in the 1980's. Geometric topology treats the
structure and properties of low- dimensional topological manifolds. Previous
workshops in this series have focused on such major developments in the field as
the solution of the knot-complement problem by Andrew Casson and John Luecke.
The principal lectures on that occasion (1989) were given by Luecke, whose
solution confirmed the conjecture that a knot in 3-dimensional space is
completely determined by its complement (the residual space remaining after a
worm has eaten its way along the knot, leaving a knot- shaped tunnel behind).
The workshops' primary goal is to provide mathematicians with active research
programs but limited support an opportunity to discuss their work with others in
the field. Another important goal is to expand the interests of the participants
by having a nationally recognized expert discuss an area that is related to, but
outside, the focus of their current work. A third goal is to provide a serious
but informal research atmosphere in which gradate students in geometric topology
can meet and learn from others in the field. ***
