The university is developing an Adaptive Technology Laboratory for its mentally
and physically challenged students. The number of students with disabilities who
are studying or want to study at this institution is increasing. The creation of
an Adaptive Technology Laboratory provides students with disabilities who major
in science, mathematics, and computer science the tools with which to perform
their work. It enriches their learning experience and substantially improves the
support given to these students in compliance with Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973. More importantly, this project enables them to
develop the necessary independence that leads to increased productivity, self-
esteem and, ultimately, access to careers in science, mathematics, and computer
science. Students who use this technology are being asked to evaluate the impact
on their coursework, homework, and study habits. Results of these surveys are
being shared through two newsletters: Special Education Resource Center
Newsletter and ConnSense Newsletter as well as at conferences and on-line.
