This grant covers experimental Elementary Particle Physics research by Dr.
Sheaff at the University of Wisconsin Madison in collaboration with other NSF
and DOE supported scientists. She plans to study the Hadroproduction of Heavy
Flavors at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. Her studies involve the
production and subsequent decay of particles containing a charmed quark. The
detailed study of such states of matter is important in delineating the details
of the Standard Model of Quarks and Leptons that describes the particles and
interactions observed in nature. Dr. Sheaff further plans detector development
research which could significantly increase the opportunity to study the
properties of bottom quark states.
