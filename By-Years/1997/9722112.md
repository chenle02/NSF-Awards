This grant will support the development of an improved isolation system that may
be suitable for use in an advanced system for the Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Professor Drever is investigating the
feasibility of a magnetic suspension system to isolate future gravitational wave
detectors from seismic vibration. The development of such a system, if
successful would extend the useful range of LIGO to gravitational wave
frequencies much lower than the initial detector under construction. The window
for scientific discovery would thereby be greatly enlarged. This project is
jointly supported by the Division of Physics and the MPS Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities.
