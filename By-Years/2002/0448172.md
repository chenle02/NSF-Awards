Proteins must adopt the correct folded structure for full functionality. For
some proteins, post-translational modifications have a tremendous impact on both
the structure and the function of the protein. Structural regulatory control of
protein function has been well established in many facets of biology and is
often a key control step in signal transduction events that are essential for
life, such as the response to nutrients and stresses, cell cycle progression,
and proliferation. However, unexpected alterations in protein structure can be
detrimental. Misfolded proteins are frequently associated with irreversible
loss-of-function and disease instead of regulation. In this project, one group
of proteins will be investigated for their ability to adopt a specific type of
"misfolded" state (prion conformation) as a means of regulation. A group of
prion proteins may have evolved with the intrinsic ability to produce major
changes in conformation as a means of regulation of a central process essential
for life: protein synthesis. Interestingly, a complex network of prion proteins
may regulate protein synthesis in yeast. This research will focus on elucidating
the underlying mechanistic principles of this type of regulation. The broader
impact of this CAREER project will include training of undergraduate students in
prion biology, as well as inclusion of under-represented minority high school
students in the research project.
