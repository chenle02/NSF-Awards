Electro-Optics is one of the fastest growing high technology disciplines in the
world. As of 1987 the dollar value of optics instrumentation produced by U.S.
industry was in excess of $10 billion. At present, however, the full potential
of this discipline is threatened by the lack of fundamental research and by a
serious manpower shortage to accomplish this research. Industry has indicated an
interest in supporting a cooperative research center in electro-optics
technology. The objective of such a center would be to address the generic
research needs of industry, especially in optical materials, applied image
processing, and non-linear optics. An I/UCRC in Electro-Optics Technology
appears to be one approach to satisfy the noted need. Alternative organizations,
operations, and policies would be studied as well as industry's interests and
specific needs in research. The principal investigator is highly qualified to
direct a study of the viability and feasibility of an Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center in Electro-Optics Technology. The study would also
determine if the Center has the potential to become self-sufficient with
industrial funding in a five year period as NSF funding is phased out. The
Program Manager recommends that Tufts University be awarded $25,000 for one year
to fund such a study. All future funding will be on the basis of a new proposal.
