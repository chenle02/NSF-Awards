The School of Engineering of Santa Clara University, in cooperation with the
IEEE Control Systems Society, will hold this workshop to explore research
directions in Systems Theory and Systems Engineering. The objective of the
workshop is to identify research areas where system theory and systems
engineering can make major contributions in the next 5 or 6 years. The emphasis
of the workshop will be to identify and elaborate those methods and developments
that promise to have an impact on multidisciplinary area. A diverse group of
approximately fifth researchers directly or indirectly involved in systems work
will be brought together in an informal but structured enviornment where past
accomplishments, present investigations, and speculations on new directions can
be combined to identify the most promising opportunities for future research.
