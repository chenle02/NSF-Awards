This proposal requests support for the principal investigator Dr. Charles
Glashausser and two colleagues at Rutgers University to carry out research on
spin excitations in atomic nuclei at the Laboratoire National Saturne in Saclay,
in collaboration with Dr. Louis Bimbot of the Institute for Nuclear Physics,
University of Paris XI and his research group. The two groups will collaborate
on new experiments at intermediate energy particle accelerators at the two
laboratories. By measuring observables which depend upon the spin of the
outgoing particles scattered from targets such as carbon-12 and calcium-48 the
experimenters will determine the spectrum of nuclear continuum states which can
be excited only by a transfer of spin to the nucleus. Previous independent work
by both groups suggests that these new experiments may resolve the long-standing
problem of missing magnetic dipole strength as well as determine features of the
nuclear spectrum in previously unexplored regimes. Both the U.S. and French
groups have a long record of significant accomplishment in this area of nuclear
physics. Their mutual involvement is very likely to lead to important new
results which neither could accomplish working alone. For the U.S. group, it
means the opportunity to initiate a new subfield by making use of the polarized
deuteron beam unavailable in the U.S. For the French, it means an opportunity to
make an important contribution now to a line of research effectively initiated
in France.
