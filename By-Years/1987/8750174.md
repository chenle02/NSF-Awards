This project is enhancing the science education of students enrolled in
Economics by introducing computer-assisted experiments that supplement
traditionally presented materials in such courses as Principles of Economics,
Micro and Macroeconomic Theory, and Econometrics. The computers also add great
flexibility to the treatment of topics studied in the Senior Seminars. The mix
of technologies now available takes advantage of the computational and graphic
capabilities of each machine, allows programming flexibility for the future, and
fully utilizes the developing computer expertise of the faculty. Economics
instruction is greatly improved by bringing the computer into the classroom,
thus allowing students to run regressions, to make forecasts, and to simulate
policy outcomes with the instructor nearby. Selected software includes Formodel
1000 for both the Macroeconomics and the Money and Banking labs, and SHAZAM for
Econometrics. Moreover, this new laboratory approach to teaching Economics makes
students intensely aware of integral part that computers and scientific
experimentation play in the professional lives of present day economists. With
its new suite of computing equipment, the laboratory is able to accommodate
sections of up to thirty students.
