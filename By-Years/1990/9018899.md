The long term goal of this project is to understand the biosynthesis of
cytokinins, a class of plant growth hormone. The project focuses on the first
enzyme in the cytokinin biosynthetic pathway: 5'-AMP-isopentenyltransferase
(ITPase). This enzyme has been detected in cultured cytokinin-habituated tobacco
tissue that will serve as a source of this enzyme for further purification using
conventional methods (batch, columns, HPLC). Antibodies against this partially
purified enzyme will be produced and purified by passing the antiserum through a
Sepharose-4B column coupled to soluble proteins obtained from the cytokinin-
dependent tobacco tissue which lacks IPTase activity. The purified antibody
preparation will be used for immunoaffinity chromatography to further purify the
enzyme. The kinetic properties of the enzyme will be studied. The enzyme ITPase
is the first enzyme in the cytokinin biosynthetic pathway. It is likely to
catalyze the rate-limiting step in cytokinin biosynthesis. An enzyme with
similar catalytic properties but not genetically homologous to the plant enzyme
has been isolated from plants transformed by Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
Unfortunately the lack of homology between the Agrobacterium IPTase gene and
plant sequences means that the gene for the plant enzyme must be obtained by
conventional means. This project is the first step toward isolating the gene for
the IPTase of plants. Understanding the regulation of this gene in plants is
important to our overall understanding of growth and development in plants.
