This project is a joint effort between the North Carolina State University, the
University of Nebraska, and LEAP Associates, Inc., as part of the PRESSS Phase
II Coordinated Research Program to investigate the seismic behavior of precast
concrete systems typical of the eastern and central United States. Buildings
targeted by this study are low-rise precast concrete structures in zones of low
to moderate seismicity. Research tasks will be conducted in the following
stages: system analysis, experimental investigation of panel connections,
experimental investigation of frame connections, and system design aspects
(production and construction). The project will focus on systems rather than
being limited to isolated details in order that the end product may be readily
applied to the needs of industry.
