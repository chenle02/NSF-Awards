Isostatic uplift of denuded footwall rocks beneath a shallowly-dipping
detachment fault is thought to cause upwards arching of the detachment and may
cause the shallow past of the fault to be abandoned. This theory predicts that
as fault slip continues, the hinge zone between steep, active and shallow,
inactive parts of the fault will migrate through the footwall. Alternative
models predict different strain paths will be recorded in the footwall rocks.
This study will test the hypothesis of a migrating hinge zone by examining the
strain state in footwall rocks beneath three detachment faults from different
tectonic settings: Beaver Dam Mountains, Utah; Whipple Mountains, California;
and Brenner Line, eastern Alps. The results will allow assessment of the
migrating hinge models and will have broad applicability to extensional zones in
a variety of tectonic environments.
