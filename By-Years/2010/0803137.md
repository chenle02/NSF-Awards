CBET-0803137, Logan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award funds partial support of a
symposium on microbial fuel cells (MFC) and bioenergy. The symposium is to be
held on the main campus of Pennsylvania State University in University Park, PA,
May 27-29, 2008. MFCs offer a promising new method of bioenergy production by
directly converting chemical energy in organic matter into electricity. With
slight modifications, and a small energy input (1/10th that used for water
hydrolysis), pure hydrogen gas can alternatively be produced (microbial
electrolysis cells or MECs). MFC/MEC student and faculty researchers and other
interested parties (such as companies) will be brought together for a symposium
completely dedicated to the topic of MFC/MEC research. Attendance of
approximately 150 participants from a wide variety of backgrounds from all
around the world is anticipated. Support is requested primarily for travel
expenses for MFC/MEC researchers and their students.
