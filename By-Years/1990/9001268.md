This proposal provides funds to equip the Sondrestrom incoherent scatter radar
so that it can routinely detect echoes from the "electron component" of the
backscatter spectrum known as "plasma line". SRI proposes to investigate high-
latitude plasma line signatures to design and add appropriate hardware and
software, and to achieve a routinely operating plasma line capability for the
scientific community.***//
