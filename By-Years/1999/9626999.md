9626999 Hanson "Under the Rock: An Experiment in Neighborhood Exhibit-Making" is
a project that will engage children in the development of exhibits as well as
present information about backyard ecology. The Children's Museum staff will
work with Federated Dorchester Neighborhood Houses (a group of inner city
neighborhood centers in Boston) to develop a model activity that uses the theory
and practice of exhibit making as a tool to engage children in science learning
in their neighborhoods. They will work with children and their parents in the
exploration of insect life in their urban settings and presentation of their
findings in exhibits the children will make. Exhibit making includes the entire
process of: studying live insects, doing research, writing text, designing and
building interactive activities for an exhibit about insects, and marketing the
exhibit. Exhibit making has been chosen as the pedagogical technique because it
parallels creative work done in the real world; it involves people working
together in teams, and utilizes different skills and intelligences of the
participants. In addition to the exhibits, other results of this project will
include: an educator's guidebook documenting the process of exhibit-making in
community centers; a proposal for an activity book for kids with writing samples
and illustrations that will be submitted to a publisher; video and electronic
resources; and contributions and recommendations for the Museum's "Under the
Rock" exhibit, a new exhibit to be developed subsequent to the completion of the
first two phases of this project.
