9311487 Paulsen This project concerns three main lines of research. First,
developing a Morita theory for operator algebras. This includes several stable
isomorphism theorems and a deeper study of projective modules over operator
algebras. Second, the project will examine operator space geometry and tensor
products of operator spaces. Third, the project will conduct a study of analytic
reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. This research is in the general area of
modern analysis and concerns the structure of spaces of operators or
transformations. A fundamental problem in any area of mathematics is determining
when two objects are equivalent and their geometry is similar. In this work, the
investigators examine the families of transformations on a space and relate
these transformations or operators to categories of structures through
equivalences. The point is that theory known for one structure can often be
shown to carry naturally to an equivalent structure. Thus, the approach is to
demonstrate that rather complex families of operators have natural equivalences
