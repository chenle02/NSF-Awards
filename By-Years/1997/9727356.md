The focus of this research is the use of reporting conformational templates
(RCTs) for initiating and accurately monitoring the stability of short
polypeptide helices. An RCT facilitates the study of peptide helicity in two
ways. First, by initiating a helix at its site of linkage to the peptide it
greatly enhances the probability that a helix can in fact be observed. Second,
by carrying built-in reporter functions that quantitatively monitor helicity, it
greatly facilitates measurement of the stability of helices. With this renewal
award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the
research of Dr. Daniel S. Kemp of the Department of Chemistry at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Professor Kemp will focus his work on
gaining a clarification of the fundamental bioorganic and physical principles
that underlie formation of unassociated peptide helices in solution.
