The objective of this three-year renewal of a U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research
project in mechanical engineering between Bozidar Vujanovic of the University of
Novi Sad and Stanley Jones from the University of Alabama, is to study the
variational methods (direct solution, conservation laws and Noether's theorem)
applied to non conservative engineering systems. This grant affords the
opportunity of linking oen of the major European research groups with U.s.
engineer. Previous collaboration has resulted in significant number of joint
publications. This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on
Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported through a joint fund
consisting of matching contributions from the U.S. and Yugoslav governments. The
U.S. contribution is provided annually by the Department of State. No NSF funds
are involved. The grants are composed principally of Yugoslav dinars and made to
the principal Yugoslav institute. Grants include travel for U.S. scientists to
Yugoslavia and a modest dollar allowance for Yugoslav scientists' living
expenses in the U.S.
