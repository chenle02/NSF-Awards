9632840 BUCKLIN Sequence-specific gene amplification by the polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) will be used to identify and discriminate individuals of two
calanoid copepod species Pseudocalanus moultoni and P. newmani, at all stages.
Temporal and spatial distribution of larval, juvenile, and adult female stages
of both species will be determined from zooplankton samples during the broad-
scale surveys of U.S. GLOBEC Northwest Atlantic Field Studes Phase 2 on Georges
Bank. Spatial patterns of distribution will be characterized monthly to
determine how stage-specific distributions interact with circulation patterns on
the Bank. Image analysis will provide size estimates for individuals of each
stage to ascertain whether rates of growth and development differ between
species. Collaborative work with bio-physical modellers will be conducted to
place the stage-structured populations of each species in realistic flow fields.
It is hypothesized that the life histories of the Pseudocalanus spp. on Georges
Bank differ in ways that are suited to the geographic distribution and
reproductive ecology of the species. ***
