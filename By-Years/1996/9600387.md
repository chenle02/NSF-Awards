9600387 Austin The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
scientists and engineers to conduct three to twentyfour months of research
abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions
abroad. This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit by
Dr. Amy T. Austin to work with Professor Osvaldo E. Sala at the Universidad de
Buenos Aires in Argentina. Dr. Austin and Professor Sala will be doing research
on controls on biogeochemical processes. They will establish a set of
experiments along a Patagonian precipitation gradient in the range from 100 mm
to 2000 mm annual rainfall at the latitude of 45 degrees S at Rio Mayo. They
will establish five sites in the different vegetation types of desert, steppe,
grassland, open and closed forest. In each of the sites they will measure the
above ground net primary productivity (ANPP), decomposition, and soil nutrient
availability, in an effort to understand the effect of changing water
availability on carbon and nutrient cycling. An understanding of the effect of
the processes could be a fundamental step toward ameliorating human-induced
desertification. ***
