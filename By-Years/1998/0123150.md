This award supports the United States' contribution to the Past Global Changes
(PAGES) International Project Office (IPO) in Bern, Switzerland. PAGES is one of
several scientific programs that operates under the broad umbrella of the
International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP).

Operated as a partnership between the US National Science Foundation and the
Swiss National Science Foundation, the PAGES program has enabled the
collaboration of international teams of scientists and students from developed
and developing nations on projects searching for answers to critical questions
in paleoclimate science. The specific responsibilities of the IPO include
organizing meetings and workshops, publishing peer-reviewed manuscripts and
books, producing newsletters, and maintaining and facilitating contacts among
international scientists.

The scientific data generated by PAGES-coordinated research projects are readily
available through various publicly accessible databases including those of the
National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) in Boulder, Colorado operated by the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In addition, PAGES actively
seeks participation in research projects by scientists in developing countries
thereby enabling technological transfer and capacity building within the
scientific community.
