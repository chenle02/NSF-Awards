The long term objective of this project is to define the role of D-raf mediated
signal transduction in the establishment and elaboration of pattern in
Drosophila melanogaster. The specific aims of this project are as follows: 1) to
define the role of membrane association and D-raf function in the Torso signal
transduction pathway, 2) to define the mechanism of regulation of D-raf activity
in the Torso pathway using dominant negative D-raf mutations, 3) to
characterized the relationship between D-raf function and the upstream signaling
factors Torso, corkscrew and D-ras1, and 4) to characterize the activity of
D-raf in a EGF-receptor mediated pathway. Since D-raf is the Drosophila
homologue of the Raf-1 proto-oncogene, the characterization of its developmental
role and determination of its mechanism(s) of regulation will provide clues
toward understanding signal transduction in higher organisms.
