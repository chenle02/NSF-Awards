This project creates an online portal of linguistic information on about
indigenous flora, fauna, and material culture (e.g., tools and utensils, fencing
and housing, food and fodder). Botanical, biological, and traditional cultural
knowledge is rapidly being lost due to easily available mass-produced modern
materials and commercially available foodstuffs and medicines. The loss of this
information results in significant knowledge gaps for biologists, botanists, and
linguists. This multidisciplinary project records, preserves, and disseminates
biological, botanical, cultural, and linguistic knowledge so that it can be used
for further research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators provide
interdisciplinary expertise to create a database of indigenous knowledge using
Documentary Linguistic methodology (recording, transcribing, translating,
lexicographic analysis) along with the analysis and commentary from indigenous
scholars, botanists and biologists. A particularly impactful aspect of this
project is the co-creation of a database that brings into alignment the naming
of plants, animals, and material culture by the participants. The project plans
to make this database available through an open-source content management system
that allows for integration of new commentary and information on biological and
ethnobiological material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
