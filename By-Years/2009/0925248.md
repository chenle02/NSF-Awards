This proposal requests NSF funding to support a summer school on Dynamic Field
Theory and its applications to cognitive science, to be held in June 8-12 at the
University of Iowa. Dynamic Field Theory provides a formal framework for
thinking about embodied cognitive dynamics. The Summer School is organized so
that students receive hands-on experience working with specific dynamic neural
field models within their own area of expertise. The Summer School begins with
an introduction to the central concepts of dynamical systems theory, and the
mathematical and neurophysiological bases of dynamic field theory. Next,
students will learn how activation dynamics in neural fields provide critical
links to two central challenges in cognitive and developmental science: the
integration of processes over multiple time scales and the origin of behavioral
flexibility. The final lectures will focus on applications of the theory in
different domains, from lower-level examples in the domains of motor control and
robotics to higher-level domains including working memory and word learning.
Lectures and course materials are freely available at the Summer School website:
