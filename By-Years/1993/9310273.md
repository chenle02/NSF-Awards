9310273 Jiles The primary objective of this research is to make a quantitative
examination of the relationships between microstructural parameters of a model
metal material and global magnetic property changes. The metal is pure nickel,
selected to avoid the complications of microstructural changes, such as hard
second phases, that could complicate the analysis. Cathodic charging is employed
to form hydrides at grain boundaries in the nickel and induce microcavities.
Creep damage in nickel is assessed in terms of cavity number density and average
size of cavities and compared to the bulk magnetic properties, coercivity and
permeability. %%% This investigation could have technological impact in areas
where high temperature creep damage is a potential problem, such as in steel
components operating in power plants. ***
