Through close mentoring relationships, we will build a community of scholars,
leading students through the various stages of mathematical research and
providing a complete research experience for student participants. We will offer
a broad range of choices in various areas of pure and applied mathematics.
Topics include: wavelets, metric geometry, dynamical systems, orthogonal
polynomials, geometric group theory, voting theory, matrix lie groups,
combinatorial identities, and spherical and hyperbolic geometry. There will be a
focus on enhancing the students' oral and written communication skills. Students
for whom this REU will be their first research experience will be our priority.
