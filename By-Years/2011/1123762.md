This workshop brings together scholars from several social science disciplines
to explore methodological innovations in surveys measuring environmental
attitudes. New technologies have emerged that reduce the cost of scientific
surveys, which leads to the potential to ask the same questions more frequently
than before. However, the tradeoffs involved with this increased frequency are
not clear. Workshop participants will discuss the scientific advances that might
be uncovered with more frequent measurement, and identify the potentially
unanticipated consequences of increasing frequency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
results from this workshop will inform scientists studying environmental
behavior, as well as behavior more generally, about feasibility of repeated
surveys and how they might be developed and implemented most efficiently and
effectively.
