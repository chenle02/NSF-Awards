9404278 Kusner Topics covered in the research include the geometry of area
minimizing and mean curvature surfaces from a variational viewpoint, knot theory
and the energy of knots in 3 and 4 dimensional manifolds. The research has
potential applications to elastodynamics and fluid membranes in surface physics
and surface interfacing in materials theory. ***
