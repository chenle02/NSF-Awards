Abstract CHE-0314688 Angus/Case Western

This research collaboration involving John Angus, Alfred Anderson, and Heidi
Martin and their students at Case Western Reserve University investigates the
fundamental interactions between the surface chemistry, electronic structure,
and charge transport at conducting diamond surfaces. With the support of the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, a research project focusing on the
growth of boron and sulfur doped diamond films, characterization of these films
by electrical, optical, structural, and electrochemical methods, and
spectroscopic characterization of adsorbates and their effect on surface
conductivity is being undertaken. Ab-initio calculations are used to interpret
the results of this experimental work. Proof of concept design of new sensors
based on the surface conductivity of diamond induced by adsorption is being
carried out.

A detailed understanding of the effects of adsorption on the conductivity and
electronic properties of diamond electrode surfaces can be used to develop new
sensor strategies. A combined experimental and theoretical research effort is
being carried out to address these questions in the growth and characterization
of diamond thin films.
