Barbara Wyslouzil is funded by a Small Grant for Exploratory Research to study
the chemical enrichment which takes place on the surface of liquid aerosol
droplets. The phenomenon to be studied, i.e., surface enrichment in aerosol
droplets of a binary liquid mixture, has been predicted but never directly
observed. A supersonic nozzle which can produce monodispersed aerosol droplets
has been developed by Wyslouzil, and will be used in a collaborative research
efforts involving the use of the Small Angle Neutron Scattering facility in
Grenoble, France to perform the studies. Wyslouzil will also be collaborating
with researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories on the project.
Surface enrichment has an important effect on heterogeneous chemistry, growth
and evaporation kinetics, and nucleation. Multicomponent, nanometer-sized
aerosols are produced by nucleation and condensation in many industrial and
natural settings. Fine refractory aerosols form in combustion and metallurgical
processes while sulfuric acid - water aerosols are produced in stack gases,
volcanic plumes, and as byproducts of photochemical reactions in the atmosphere.
The surface composition of these particles can strongly affect heterogeneous
reactions, growth and evaporation kinetics.
