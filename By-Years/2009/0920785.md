propose to automate the acquisition of gene expression data from individual cell
nuclei in Drosophila embryos and use this new quantitative tool to analyze the
formation of a sharp straight border between two domains of cells. Their goal in
these studies is to create computational tools that will permit the automated
acquisition and analysis of multiple fluorescent signals from single cells in
the Drosophila embryo. These advances should allow for the quantitative analysis
of 10-20 gene expression patterns at single nucleus resolution using a multi-
probe based approach to in situ hybridization. The proposed automated multiplex
methods should contribute substantially to enabling the creation of
comprehensive gene expression atlases such as the Brain Atlases created by the
Allen Institute, which are important for understanding basic biological
processes such as organization of tissues and organs and changes in these
structures during the evolution of developmental patterns. These methods should
also make it possible to determine the exact relative expression patterns of
different genes expressed in similar regions, which currently is not possible.
Such refined gene expression maps will therefore make it possible to reconstruct
transcription profiles for multiple genes simultaneously in individual cell
types within an embryo. The software and protocols will be made available to the
scientific community, and this project will include a graduate student and
several undergraduates. Thus, it will also have important educational benefits
for society.
