HeT DNA is a family of complex repeated sequences in the genome of Drosophila
melanogaster. The sequences are entirely confined to the telomeres and the
pericentric heterochromatin. One subset of the HeT DNA family consists of the
HeT-A elements a novel set of retroposon-like elements that have bee found added
onto the ends of the four "healed" telomeres that have been studied in
Drosophila or they may be able to organize telomere sequences. We propose to
test the putative function of HeT DNA sequences by attempting to construct
functional Drosophila mini-chromosomes using these sequences. The mini-
chromosomes will be transformed into cultured Drosophila cells and assayed for
their ability to be maintained and replicated as linear chromosomes. Such
chromosomes would allow a direct test of our conclusions about functions of HeT
DNA sequences. If we are successful in constructing mini- chromosomes, they will
be a useful tool for other studies on Drosophila.***//
