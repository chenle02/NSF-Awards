CTS-9313661 Cleveland State University Orhan Talu ABSTRACT The single crystal
method of determining diffusivity in micropores will be modified to permit
concentration-driven measurements at constant pressure and to include the
capability for isotopic labeling by the incorporation of a mass spectrometer for
analysis. Investigations performed with the single crystal method may help to
resolve differences between macroscopic (e.g. gavimetric) and microscopic (e.g.
NMR) - based estimates of diffusivities. Diffusion of gases in absorbants for
separations and in packed beds for reactors is important for the design and
operation of many industrial chemical processes.
