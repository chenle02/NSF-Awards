This award will establish a multi-century network of North African climate
records based on tree rings. This will be accomplished by extending existing
Moroccan tree ring chronologies geographically and temporally. New tree ring
chronologies will be developed for Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria. This network
will then be used to study interannual to century-scale climate fluctuations in
the region, and their links to large-scale patterns of climate variability (NAO,
AO, ENSO, etc.). North Africa is an ideal region in which to find moisture-
sensitive tree-ring sites most useful for developing mid-latitude climate
reconstructions. It is important to utilize this tree-ring resource before
population needs and land use changes destroy many of the oldest and most
scientifically valuable forests. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A meeting of
international collaborators will be held in Tucson prior to the first field
season for exchange of methodologies, discussion of mutual research objectives,
and detailed field planning with the North African colleagues. A series of
seminars and will be conducted in North Africa (one each in Morocco, Tunisia,
and Algeria) in order to present results and to garner feedback from users of
the results. The meetings will emphasize dialogue between scientists, resource
managers, and policymakers, focusing on the potential of incorporating results
into resource management and planning, appropriate means of disseminating
results, and future research-operational collaborative opportunities. These
interactions should also aid in the development of in-country capacity.
University of Arizona undergraduate students will also be an integral part of
the project as these students will be trained in research methods, participate
in field work, and be given an opportunity to present results at professional
meetings.
