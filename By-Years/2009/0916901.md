This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). The research funded by this award targets the difficult
problem of how to debug programs running on large parallel systems. The state of
hundreds to hundreds of thousands of parallel tasks that form a single
computation are too complicated for a programmer to usefully analyze. This
project will develop tools to find similarities between the state of different
processes, simplifying the task of the programmer. The challenge in finding
these similar tasks is to do it efficiently, without imposing an overhead so
hight that the tool is useless. A naive implementation would compare the state
of all processors against one another, and would introduce overheads increasing
as the square of the number of processors. Our approach will successively refine
sets of similar processes, will use key attributes of program behavior (e.g.
communication patterns) to perform this grouping. We will also investigate the
use these groups of similar processes to allow invariance and statistically
based techniques developed for sequential programs (such as value and PC
invariance) to be effectively adapted to parallel programs. Because these
techniques look for rarely occurring program activities, applying them to
disparate processes together will introduce noise into the analysis, severely
diminishing their accuracy. The use of our grouping strategy will allow
effective parallelization of the techniques, allowing them to be applied with
significantly less overhead than when used with sequential applications.
