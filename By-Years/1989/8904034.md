This research is to apply the relatively new mathematical theory of chaos to
earthquake catalogues in an attempt to extract the underlying attractor
structure of the system. The question whether the methods of deterministic chaos
are applicable to regional seismicity is highly relevant to models of earthquake
occurrence and has received very little attention. A practical goal of this
research is to see if the theory of chaos can be used to predict earthquakes and
the work is thus a contribution to the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction
Program.
