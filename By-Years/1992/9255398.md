The goal of the proposed Research Planning Grant is to structure a substantial
three-year program of research on young children's learning of chance and
probability. I propose to focus on chance and probability because of the
richness of the ideas themselves, the connections that chance and probability
make possible between mathematics and science, and the powerful vision of
mathematics that such a focus could convey to young children. The research
program investigates primary grade children's explorations of chance and
probability from the perspective of collaborative problem solving instruction.
It also examines the effects of learning these concepts in different situations,
because of the growing recognition of the influence of context on knowledge-
construction. Activities of the Research Planning Grant include completion of
literature reviews, refinement and extension of instructional interventions,
implementation of two pilot research cycles, drafting of a theoretical framework
to capture the multiple aspects of children's conceptual development in this
domain and their effect on problem solving, and the preparation of the full
grant proposal. The first pilot research cycle focuses on pairs of second
graders engaged in a series of chance and probability tasks, involving
prediction, empirical investigation, extrapolations and explanation. The second
pilot cycle extends the research to small group learning and also begins to
explore the entailments of different situations for children's understanding of
chance and probability. All sessions are videotaped to enable microanalysis of
children's thinking and the effectiveness of the activity sequence. The research
aims to construct and refine powerful models of problem solving instruction in
the domain of chance and probability, as it uses these as a vehicle to closely
examine young children's knowledge- construction.
