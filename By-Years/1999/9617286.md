Posture and locomotion are two of the most important influences on the
adaptation and evolution of the musculoskeletal system in primates. This is
especially true of the spine, which plays a key functional role in both posture
and locomotor behavior. The purpose of this study is to investigate the
relationship between back function and vertebral structure in a broad sample of
prosimian primates. Prosimian diversity in body size, anatomy, posture, and
locomotion makes them an excellent `natural experiment` with which to
investigate vertebral form and function. The methodology will address form as
well as function by employing two approaches: 1) quantitative analysis of
vertebral anatomical structure, and 2) quantitative analysis of spinal movements
using noninvasive video analysis. The results of this study will be directly
relevant to reconstructions of locomotor and postural adaptations in fossil
primates, thereby contributing to a more thorough understanding of primate
evolution, including the adaptations to upright posture that led to human
bipedalism.
