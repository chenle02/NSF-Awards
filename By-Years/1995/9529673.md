9529673 Jain The binding of circulating cells in the blood to the vascular wall
is a key step in many physiological processes, e.g., inflammation, wound
healing, cancer metastasis, etc. Previous studies have neglected the impact of
red blood cells (RBC's), a major blood component (up to 40% by volume) on the
adhesion of these circulating cells to the endothelial vascular lining. Three
key questions to be answered are: What effect do the RBC's have on the rates of
cell "rolling" and binding of lymphocytes and cancer cells to endothelial cell
monolayers? Are the observed effects biochemical and/or physical in nature? Can
a theoretical framework be developed to model the RBC-enhanced adhesion? The
main hypothesis is that the RBC's will enhance the adhesion of the cells to the
endothelial lining. The hypothesis will be tested in a laminar flow chamber. The
researchers are already familiar with the test chamber and the specified cells.
