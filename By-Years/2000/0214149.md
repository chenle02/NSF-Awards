This is a theoretical project in the area of mesoscopic physics. The electronic
properties of nanoscale structures will be investigated
including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Superconductivity in thin wires. When the cross-
section of a wire is as small as a few square nanometers, the wire is expected
to lose its superconducting properties. The critical Josephson current in such
wires will be studied, as well as the dependence of the current on the applied
phase difference. The research will then be extended to study other properties
of superconducting nanowires, including their current-voltage characteristics.
Comparisons will be made to experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Propagation of
interacting one-dimensional electrons in quantum point contacts. Unlike
conventional Luttinger liquid theories, this work will involve scattering off a
smooth potential barrier. Both conventional perturbation theory and bosonization
techniques will be used. This work is expected to advance our understanding of
electron transport in mesoscopic systems, especially semiconductor
heterostructures, and provide theoretical understanding of recent experimental
results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Decay of metastable states in double barrier
resonant tunneling structures and superlattices. The understanding of the decay
time is important for potential applications of the bistability features of
these devices. This work will involve conventional kinetic theory techniques,
such as Fokker-Planck equations, as well as modern approaches developed for
quantum field theory problems.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This is a theoretical
project in the area of mesoscopic physics. The electronic properties of
nanoscale structures will be investigated. This is very important from a
fundamental perspective in order to understand th ebehavior of electrons in very
small structures. It is also at the very foundation of applications of
nanoelectronics to devices affecting our everyday life.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
