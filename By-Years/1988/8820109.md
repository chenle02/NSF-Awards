The primary objective of this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research
project in physical organic chemistry between Dionis Sunko of Zagreb University
and Vernon J. Shiner of Indiana University is to improve our knowledge of the
mechanisms and effects of nucleophilic displacement reactions. Understanding of
the theory underlying these chemical reactions are of biological and
pharmacological interest. Past collaboration has been highly successful leading
to many joint publications. The joint project takes advantage of the
complementary stengths of the U.S. and Yugoslav research team. This project was
approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on Cooperation in Science and
Technology and is funded through a joint fund consisting of matching
contributions from the U.S. and Yugoslav governments. The U.S. contribution is
provided annually by the Department of State. No NSF funds are involved. Grants
are made to the principal Yugoslav institute. Dollar funds are included for U.S.
scientist travel to Yugoslavia and for Yugoslav scientists' living expenses in
the U.S.
