In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,
Professors J. Ewbank and L. Schafer of the Chemistry Department of the
University of Arkansas will continue the development and application of real-
time gas electron diffraction (GED) using a pulsed electron beam synchronous
with photoexcitation. The technique will be applied primarily to the study of
the conformation and structure of short-lived chemical species, namely those in
highly excited electronic states where the structure and conformation differ
significantly from those in the ground and low-lying excited states, or species
undergoing dynamical changes as the result of unimolecular reactions.
Traditional GED has relied on the use of the photographic plate to record and
store the information generated by the diffraction of electrons by molecules.
This method was therefore limited to studying the structures of stable
molecules. Current research in molecular dynamics concerns itself with how the
structure and conformation of a molecular system evolves during a reaction
process. Experimental information about such processes can only be obtained by
means of techniques in which the time plays an essential role. The methods of
pico- and femtosecond spectroscopy have been very successful in this regard but
also have their limitations owing to the difficulty in interpreting often
extremely complex spectral patterns. The method of real-time GED developed by
the principal investigators has shown great promise in making important
contribution to the understanding of the properties of short-lived species. The
aim of this project is to capitalize on this potential and contribute to our
understanding of the basic aspects of molecular dynamics.
