This project is about improving the speed and quality of solutions for network
facility location problems, such as locating new fire stations to reduce fire
loss or closing existing schools in population-declining communities. These
challenges called location-allocation (L-A) problems are extremely difficult to
solve optimally. This research investigates the tendency for similar or
dissimilar attribute values, such as residential housing concentrations to
cluster geographically near facility service usage. This clustering is called
spatial autocorrelation (SA). These researchers will fill a significant gap in
the spatial analysis literature by determining how SA information can facilitate
more robust solutions in L-A analyses. This new approach will enable better and
faster computational solutions to large L-A problems for location both public
and private facilities that are translatable to other research domains,
providing economical benefits to society. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The literature
describing relationships between SA and locational solutions to L-A problems is
scant. This research seeks to analyze a strongly suspected relationship between
SA in facility demand variables and solutions to L-A problems. It will exploit
this relationship to reformulate L-A models and their computer solution methods.
Revised problem formulations will focus on the reduction of the number of
possible locational solutions examined so that solving large-size L-A problems
and other related locational problems becomes tractable and efficient. This
investigation of the novel interface between spatial statistics (e.g., SA) and
spatial optimization (e.g., L-A) will provide new knowledge and convincing
evidence that should spur further research in various disciplines, including
operations research, regional science, and geography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
