The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to bridge the
gap between genomics and medicine by bringing a technology used in research
laboratories to the forefront of diagnostics at an affordable cost. There is a
vital need for a more accurate and faster diagnosis of dangerous and infectious
microbes such as bacteria, viruses and fungi. Treatment for infections and
viruses are two of the top ten reasons people visit hospitals, and infectious
diseases are a leading cause of death in children worldwide. Additionally, the
numbers of these illnesses continue to grow as bacteria and other microbes
become more resistant to current medications. Fortunately, the next-generation
sequencing revolution has provided a flood of genomic sequence data from a
variety of organisms, including pathogens. This data has remained untapped in
the medical field, which can benefit from the ability to quickly and accurately
identify genetic markers of dangerous pathogens. The potential market for this
project extends beyond research hospitals and includes smaller clinics in remote
locations, or military field hospitals situated near global conflicts.

This I-Corps project optimizes the well-established qPCR (quantitative
Polymerase Chain Reaction) technology to amplify pathogen specific DNA
sequences. The technology leverages publically available genomic resources to
design unique and specialized primers to be supplied in a simple kit for PCR
that will identify specific classes of pathogens. The equipment for quantitative
DNA amplification is standard, and the resultant amplification results are
visualized in-hospital also on standard equipment. The kits could enable medical
specialists and other healthcare providers to give patients more accurate and
rapid diagnoses at a fraction of the cost while accelerating treatment, reducing
the number of repeat visits, decreasing antibiotic usage, and shortening
hospital stays.
