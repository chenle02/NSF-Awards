Forward recoil spectroscopy (FRES) will be used to determine the concentration
profiles of interdiffusing thermotropic, liquid crystalline (LC) polymer chains.
The LC polymers synthesized for this study will be both deuterated and
nondeuterated LC polyethers with solubility in common solvents and controlled
molecular weight. Investigations will concentrate on the diffusion behavior of
LC polymers of controlled moleluclar weight diffusing into a matrix film of
known molecular weight. Diffusion of LC polymer chains in their smectic,
nematic, and isotropic phases will be studied. The effect of the degree of chain
orientation induced by poling in either magnetic or electric fields will also be
explored for its effect on the LC polymer diffusion characteristics.
Collaborations with other scientists will help in the characterization of these
thermotropic polymers using neutron scattering and rheological measurements.
