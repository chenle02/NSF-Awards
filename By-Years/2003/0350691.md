This project examines the strategic use of scientific knowledge to facilitate
coalition building between social movements. Its focus is on similarities and
differences in how labor organizations and environmental organizations identify
health risks in the workplace and the general environment. The project will
study how successful coalitions may be formed between the two movements by
jointly considering occupational health and environmental health science, which
have historically been discrete areas. Scholars who study social movements are
increasingly trying to develop more complex approaches and expand their
inquiries to include social movements in science, technology, health, and the
environment. This project will assist in understanding the roles played by
concepts and framing of risks (e.g., environmental justice, just transition) and
by familiarity and experience, in facilitating or interfering with attempts to
build alliances. The research project has three tasks. First, approximately 20
cases of successful and unsuccessful efforts at coalition building will be
identified through an extensive literature review and survey of leaders in the
labor and environmental movements. From these cases, four will be selected for
the second task, involving interviews and observations of two successful and two
unsuccessful cases of coalition building. The cases will include unionized and
non-unionized labor organizations, each with a successful and unsuccessful
effort. The third task is an historical study of one labor organization that has
been significantly involved in the establishment of labor-environmental
coalitions. The project provides graduate training opportunities, and its focus
is of interest to an ongoing research group at the university. Besides scholarly
publications, dissemination to labor and environmental groups and to government
agencies is planned and can lead to new opportunities for coalition building
between diverse groups.
