This project applies probability to three separate areas of mathematical
physics, statistics, and machine learning. The first two areas are conformal
field theory (CFT) and cryo-electron microscopy. The former is instrumental for
the theoretical high-energy physics, while for the latter recent advances in
detector technology and software algorithms have allowed to achieve the
determination of biomolecular structures at near-atomic resolution. The project
combines techniques from probability and representation theory to study them.
The third area, neural networks, uses methods which are extremely effective in
practice of Big Data, yet theoretically are mysterious. The project applies
probabilistic tools to theoretically ground and improve these methods. The award
will support the educational, mentoring, and outreach activities including
undergraduate and masters research projects in empirical machine learning and
training of the US national math olympiad team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, the project focuses on the conformal bootstrap in
CFT, non-convex optimization for cryo-electron microscopy, and data augmentation
for neural networks. The first part of the project applies prior work of the PI
giving a probabilistic construction of Liouville conformal blocks to
characterize their properties and complete the conformal bootstrap program for
Liouville theory. The second part of the project applies prior work of the PI to
characterize and improve first-order optimization algorithms for maximum-
likelihood estimation in cryo-EM in practice. The third part of the project
applies prior work of the PI connecting data augmentation and stochastic
optimization to create theoretically principled data augmentation
methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
