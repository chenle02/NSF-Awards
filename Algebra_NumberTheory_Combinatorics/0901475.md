ABSTRACT

Principal Investigator: Winkler, Peter Proposal Number: DMS - 0901475
Institution: Dartmouth College Title: Combinatorial Methods for Random
Structures in the Plane

The PI will tackle three random models in the plane, all of which show signs of
benefiting from the application of combinatorial techniques. The first of these
concerns branched polymers; the second, hard-core gases; the third, coordinate
percolation. Branched polymers are connected configurations of spheres in space;
their partition functions can be computed combinatorially in dimensions 2 and 3.
Hard-core gases are random sets of non-overlapping spheres in space; here the PI
has some ideas for discrete versions which may help in proving the existence of
a solid-state phase. Finally, combinatorial techniques applied to coordinate
percolation, in which the life of a site depends on events associated with the
lines that cross there, has already yielded an exact expression for percolation
probability.

The three models are connected to applications in biochemistry, physics and
computer science. Complex tree-like forms of proteins, hemoglobins, and
molecules involved in photosynthesis can be compared with random mathematical
``branched polymers'' to help discern the presence of unsuspected forces or
constraints. Formation of crystal structures should, in theory, resemble what
happens to collections of hard spheres when they are compressed on the plane or
in space---but this simple mathematical model is not yet fully understood.
Finally, scheduling processes (such as computer programs) to avoid conflict is
modeled by avoiding collisions in random walks, one of several applications of
coordinate percolation. The PI's approach is to use combinatorial methods---
rougly speaking, sophisticated means of counting and manipulating discrete
objects---to better understand all three models.
