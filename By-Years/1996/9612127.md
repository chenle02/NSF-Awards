In this project, an innovative design of a mega-sub structural configuration for
a tall building is proposed and its effectiveness in suppression of building
vibration resulting from wind and/or seismic loads is investigated. A building
using the mega-sub configuration consists of two major component structures: the
mega structure which not only supports the sub structure but also resists
external loads, and the sub structure which provides the usable space for either
commercial or residential purposes. From the physics point of view, the kinetic
energy of the mega-structure generated by the external loads flows into the sub
structure resulting in a vibration suppression of the mega structure. In the
meantime, the energy transferred to the sub structure can be dissipated by
properly designed damping of the sub structure, so that the acceleration of sub
structure can also be reduced, thus minimizing the acceleration-related risk for
the contents of the sub-structures as well as human discomfort. Preliminary
study has demonstrated the significant effectiveness and efficiency of the mega-
sub control system in reducing the vibration of tall buildings under turbulent
wind loads. The following tasks will be conducted: (a) establishment of a
realistic model for mega-sub structures, (b) development of design-consistent
wind and seismic load models, (c) optimization study of dynamic parameters for
design, (d) design of mega-sub building to achieve desired dynamic parameters,
(e) design of semi-active/active/hybrid systems and (f) practical design of
mega-sub structure. This research is expected to contribute to a new generation
of tall buildings which are designed with seismic and wind safety.
