Two-year colleges and smaller institutions of higher education play an important
role in shaping the country's economic and computing workforce. Burgeoning
interest in fields such as cloud computing and smart manufacturing have paved
the path for adoption of advanced cyberinfrastructure practices in research and
academic pursuits at these institutions. Expanding on the collective experience
of groups engaged in various aspects of campus computing, the Building Research
Innovation at Community Colleges (BRICCs) approach examines the research and
educational needs from advanced cyberinfrastructure in such institutional
settings. Led by CyberTeams, BRICCs offers an inclusive platform to develop and
extend efforts in this space to the national level. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BRICCs
is a unique opportunity to study campus computing characteristics at smaller
institutions and community colleges. BRICCs adopts a multi-pronged approach that
focuses on learning about the problems at hand, partnering with institutions to
enable solutions, and finally communicating its findings to the broader research
community. Fostering partnerships between knowledgeable cyberinfrastructure
professionals and these institutions is a critical aspect of BRICCs. Toward
achieving this, BRICCs will host virtual and in-person community workshops to
explore avenues to broaden the impact of advanced cyberinfrastructure on campus
computing at all levels. BRICCs will produce learning resources, workshop
reports, support future funding efforts, and propose campus networking models
that align with the research and academic pursuits of smaller institutions. As a
collective of computing expertise, BRICCs serve as a collaborative space to
address similar challenges in advancing cyberinfrastructure adoption in research
and educational settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
