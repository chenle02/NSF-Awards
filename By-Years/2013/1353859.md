This research project will examine how prenatal hormones can reorganize brain
circuits and impact behavior. Understanding how these hormones work during
development will provide important insights into the species-specific behaviors
that underlie social behavior and social structure.

The goal of this project is to determine how the neurohormone oxytocin acts
during development to organize neural structures important for displays of
aggressive behavior in adulthood. The Project will use a combination of
molecular, behavioral and pharmacological approaches to determine the
developmental timing and distribution of oxytocin and the oxytocin receptor in
the fetal mouse brain as well as how manipulation of the oxytocin signal during
fetal development affects adult male aggressive behavior. As oxytocin and its
homologues have evolutionarily conserved roles in the modulation of behavior,
this work has implications for understanding the neural underpinnings of social
behavior across species and will be the first to delve into the prenatal
organizational effects of oxytocin on aggressive behavior. Further, the genes-
to-behavior approach of this project is ideal for introducing students to
scientific inquiry and to behavioral neuroendocrinology. The conceptual and
methodological innovation of this project will allow the students to improve
their neuroscience knowledge as well as learn numerous behavioral and molecular
techniques.
