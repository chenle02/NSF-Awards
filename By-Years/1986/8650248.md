The aim of this project is to improve chemistry instruction at Monmouth College
by incorporating high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) into the
undergraduate laboratory curriculum, to complement separation theory taught in
lecture courses. The HPLC instrumentation will be used by students in
quantitative analysis, instrumental analysis, and organic chemistry laboratory
courses, to gain direct experience with and apprecia-tion for this powerful
modern method of separation and analysis of compounds. Students will conduct
analyses of "real-life" sample mixtures; determine effects of eluent
composition, column temperature, and gradient elution; and monitor progress of
organic reactions. The valuable experie-nce gained with the theory, operation,
and applications of HPLC will contribute to students' later success in the
workplace and in graduate research.
