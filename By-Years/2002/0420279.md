This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
novel high-resolution instrument (Precision Optical Intra-cellular Near-field
Technology, POINT) for analyzing molecular characteristics of intact cells is
proposed. The technique is based on a nanoprobe that penetrates the cell
membrane to image the inside of the cell without destroying it.

The commercial application of this project will be in the area of medical
diagnostics, for early detection of cancer.
