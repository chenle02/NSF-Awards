This award is in the joint engineering/computer information science engineering
ENG/CISE research thrust in Intelligent Material Handling Systems. The objective
is to develop an intelligent system for the dynamic control of automated guided
vehicle systems. The system examines events occurring on the shop floor and
reasons about those events using a selective attention mechanism. The system
will be developed and tested with substantial industrial collaboration in the
automotive sector. One of the greatest hurdles to overcome in the pursuit of
fully automated manufacturing is the lack of "understanding" of a global view of
the shop floor on the part of the computer. This research effort represents an
attempt to break down this barrier. The direct interface with a state-of-the-art
manufacturing facility enhances the technology transfer potential of the effort
and its applicability to other academic and industrial settings.
