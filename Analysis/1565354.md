This research project concerns the mathematics of several questions of geometric
and physical interest having to do with the shapes taken on by systems in
nature. The mathematical models under study are related to the physical
description of interface formation and the shapes of surfaces, such as liquid
droplets on substrates and in containers. Much of the work is centered on the
stability of solutions to the equations that model geometric properties of such
systems. The project aims to further develop the mathematical analysis
underlying phenomena governed by surface tension as well as other important
systems.

The variational problems under study concern constant mean curvature surfaces,
prescribed curvature equations, curvature flows, and isoperimetric comparison
theorems. A main goal of the project is obtaining a sharp quantitative
description of surfaces with almost constant mean curvature, which would lead to
new results of importance in capillarity theory. Other goals of the project are
developing a capillarity theory based on nonlocal surface energies, and
addressing in quantitative form various rigidity theorems involving intrinsic or
extrinsic curvatures of hypersurfaces. In the latter direction the program will
address the quantitative analysis of prescribed scalar curvature equations, of
the Pogorelov theorem on surfaces with vanishing Gauss curvature, and of the
Levy-Gromov isoperimetric comparison theorem. Considerable effort will be
devoted to the training of students through involvement in research on the
calculus of variations, partial differential equations, geometric measure
theory, and mass transportation theory.
