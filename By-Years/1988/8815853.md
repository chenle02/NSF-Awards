Support is provided for a symposium-work shop on "Computer Assisted Phylogeny
Programs in Research and Teaching" and a short course on "Molecular Evolution
and the Fossil Record" to be held in conjunction with the Annual Meeting of the
Geological Society of America in October, 1988. The object of both the symposium
and the short course is to acquaint paleontologists with the latest research,
methods and techniques in molecular evolution and computer assisted manipulation
of phylogenetic data, so that these can be incorporated immediately into their
own programs of teaching and research. Both the short course and symposium will
be augmented by take-home, "hard-copy" computer programs that will introduce
them, on their own computers, to some of the phylogenetic programs presented
during sessions. The conjunction of short course and symposium will bring
molecular evolution and computer assisted techniques to a wide range of
paleontologists.
