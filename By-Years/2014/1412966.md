This program will develop a method of measuring the gravitational redshift
effect (change in the frequency of light waves), which has become a new means of
testing general relativity on on the scale of galaxies. There is also a plan to
validate this method with numerical simulations. Broader impacts of the work
include training of undergraduate and graduate students, and a postdoctoral
researcher. With a collaborative team including computer science and graphics
students at Carnegie Mellon, a computer game for public outreach will be
developed based on cosmological structure
formation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Analytic theory and large scale realistic
cosmological simulations will be employed to make predictions for gravitational
redshifts of galaxies in various environments. Optimal statistical estimators
will be formulated to best constrain the large-scale gravitational potential.
These estimators will be applied to the simulated data to carry out tests and to
make predictions, which will be applied to existing galaxy catalogs.
