This award in the Bioinorganic, Inorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
supports research in the laboratories of Dr. Joan S. Valentine at the University
of California Los Angeles. The research to be performed involves the study of
both beneficial and toxic metal-catalyzed reactions of dioxygen, superoxide or
peroxide with organic substrates. The ferric peroxo complex of protoporphyrin IX
dimethyl ester will be used as a model compound to elucidate the nature of
intermediates involved in the reactions of heme iron-containing enzymes.
Additionally, the reactions of iron-neuromelanin analogs and copper
metallothioneins with ascorbate and carbohydrates will be examined to
investigate the role of such compounds in oxidative damage. Finally, modified
stellacyanin will be used to model the toxic reactivity of adventitiously formed
oxidation catalysts. Biologically important reactions of dioxygen and its
metabolites are often catalyzed by metalloenzymes. The proposed studies will
advance our understanding of the mechanisms of metal-catalyzed oxygenation
reactions suspected to be involved in degenerative diseases.
