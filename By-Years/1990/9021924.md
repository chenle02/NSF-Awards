The basic role of the CEDAR Science Steering Committee (CEDAR-SSC) is to
provide for coordination and information transfer throughout the U.S. aeronomy
community as well as in the international realm. CEDAR is currently in Phase II
of the program, during which time there will be extensive funded science
campaign activities as well as activities involving instrument and facility
development and upgrades. The chairman for the upcoming budget period was
selected by the SSC from among its members during the 1989 summer workshop.***//
