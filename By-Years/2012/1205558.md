The conference "Automorphic forms, representations, and combinatorics" will take
place at Stanford University from August 13--16, 2012, and highlight recent
research by Daniel Bump and his many collaborators and students. Their results
connect various matrix coefficients to the geometry and combinatorics of a
certain class of singular algebraic varieties. Many of these constructions
extend to matrix coefficients on metaplectic covers of reductive groups, certain
central extensions closely linked to reciprocity laws in number theory. These
extensions often lead to surprising connections with combinatorial
representation theory. Related developments in number theory, automorphic forms,
and random matrix theory will also be discussed in an effort to stimulate new
connections among these fields.

The conference will bring together a group of twenty international speakers who
are leaders in the fields of number theory, automorphic forms, and combinatorial
representation theory to discuss recent progress and suggest new directions of
study. The conference program also aims to introduce a new generation of young
mathematicians to these rapidly developing fields by offering some expository
lectures, curating materials in an online website, and offering partial travel
support for those without other sources of funding. A website for the conference
