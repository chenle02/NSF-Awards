A neural network model for task allocation among multiple mobile robots is
proposed. The goal of the system is to allocated tasks adaptively while
optimizing an overall performance index and avoiding conflicts among the robots.
Robots will be allocated to work locations according to the activation levels of
corresponding units in the network. Adaptiveness to environmental or internal
system changes will be achieved through a process of constraint propagation and
relaxation. It is proposed to resolve potential collisions among the moving
robots by analyzing a global path planning problem followed by a local path
replanning problem. Structural changes in the connectionist network will provide
the information for conflict resolution in replanning to avoid collisions. The
usefulness of the framework for controlling mobile robots will be demonstrated
by simulation on a TI Explorer Lisp machine, using an object-oriented simulation
language being developed in PI's laboratory.
