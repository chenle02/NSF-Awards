Abstract: The proposed investigation of U-Pb dating of fluor-apatite conodont
elements may provide a powerful geologic tool for linking biostratigraphic zones
with absolute ages. The combination eliminates the need to interpolate boundary
ages from absolute ages derived from sporadically distributed igneous rocks.
This interpolation is one of the largest sources of error in current absolute
geologic time scales. For the pilot study proposed for this planning grant, the
PI will date the stage boundaries in the Early Permian, a time when the
nomenclature and stratigraphic positions of stage boundaries are generally
agreed upon, and for which the PI can obtain abundant conodonts. If successful,
the PI will submit a major proposal to extend the approach into the Late
Permian, a time when the stage boundaries and duration of stages are subject to
constant debate. Resolution of the Late Permian stratigraphic controversies is
of particular interest because the time period includes the most extensive
Phanerozoic mass extinction, the lowest sea level stands, the end of the Kiaman
Reversed Period, and very rapid apparent rates of change in a number of
geochemical parameters. Success of this project will give the PI an important
new tool to enhance her existing research, which focuses on the interpretation
of global climate change recorded by isotopic variations preserved in marine
organisms.
