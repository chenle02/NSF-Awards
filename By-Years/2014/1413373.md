X-ray crystallography is the gold standard for determining molecular structures
such as DNAs and proteins. However, the trouble of growing crystals for
macromolecules has become the main bottleneck in crystallography. An alternative
technology called X-ray coherent diffraction imaging (CDI) has the potential of
determining noncrystalline structures of single macromolecules. An essential
part of CDI is to solve the mathematical problem called phase retrieval for
noncrystalline structures, in order to recover the phase information destroyed
by the photon detection process. The investigator studies the random mask method
as a way to recover this information. Because detection and reconstruction of an
optical signal after it has propagated some distance is a basic procedure in
optical communication and information processing, effective and efficient phase
retrieval for noncrystalline structures can affect not only the development of
CDI but also progress on some of the National Research Council Grand Challenge
Questions raised in the 2012 report "Optics and Photonics: Essential
Technologies for Our Nation." Graduate students are trained in the course of
this project.

This project focuses on developing the mathematical foundation and numerical
schemes for the random mask method (RMM) to enhance the performance of current
CDI. RMM is a quantitative coded-aperture imaging technique that employs a
random mask in photon detection and exploits the mask effect in reconstruction.
The investigator and his colleagues study RMM's potential for significant
performance gains in the following aspects: accurate reconstruction, efficient
computation, improved data quality, and reduction of demand for data and prior
knowledge, all of central importance to the ultimate impact of CDI.
