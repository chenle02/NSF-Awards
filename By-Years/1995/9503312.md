The goal of this research is to achieve robust parsing and disambiguation of
purposeful, spoken dialogs, where ordinary phrase and sentence structure may be
disrupted by acknowledgements, self- editing, correction and clarification
subdialogs, etc. The primary means for achieving robustness and on-line
disambiguation will be (1) an incremental `dialog chart parser` that fully
integrates all levels of analysis from the level of words and prosody to the
level of dialog segment structure; and (2) a `preference trade-off` technique
for selecting preferred analyses on-line, using lexical, syntatic, semantic, and
discourse structure preferences encoded as numerical potentials. Potentials will
be statistically `tuned` using available text corpora and the TRAINS planning
dialog corpus collected at the University of Rochester. The significance of the
research lies in the fact that dealing simultaneously with phrase structure and
dialog structure, and coping with rampant ambiguity, are two of the most
important challenges still facing natural human-machine communication. The
advent of robust, preference-seekin g dialog parsers will provide a basis for
genuine, practical dialog understanding in a wide variety of intelligent agents
offering interactive assistance in planning, problem solving, crisis management,
and information retrieval
