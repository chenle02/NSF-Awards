This four day workshop on mobile subsea robots will be concerned primarily with
complete working systems or subsystems and will emphasize experimental results.
Participation will be by invitation only on the basis of extended abstracts or
complete papers. Participants will be selected by an international Program
Committee composed of leading experts in the field. A maximum of twenty-five
papers will be selected for presentation and inclusion in the workshop
proceedings. The total number of participants, including observers, will be
limited to forty. Any person active in the field may request in writing an
invitation to participate as an observer. Topics to be addressed in the workshop
include: (l) sensors and sensor integration, (2) perception and environmental
modelling, (3) mission planning and mission execution, (4) locomotion,
maneuvering, and manipulation, (5) actuators, propulsion, and structures, (6)
system architecture and standards.
