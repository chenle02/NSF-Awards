9313440 Borders The Chemistry Department of the College of Wooster has been
housed in Severance Hall since 1902, and the building no longer provides an
appropriate environment for research and research training. The College will
renovate the structure, installing: a new heating, ventilating, and cooling
system; new laboratory spaces for faculty research; new research training
facilities for the undergraduate curriculum; facilities for computer graphics
and other computer-intensive activities; and building features that provide
access by persons with disabilities. The renovation of Severance Hall will have
a significant impact on the quantity and quality of research and research
training that takes place in the Chemistry Department. The department's faculty
members have an active program of research, and the building renovation will
remove several obstacles to greater research productivity. State-of- the-art
instrumentation will now have appropriate environments, and experiments that
could not be performed previously will be possible in the renovated laboratory
spaces. The research training that is integral to the undergraduate curriculum
will be expanded and modernized as a result of this renovation. Giving
undergraduates access to research environments and experiences such as these
will attract a greater number of students to careers in chemistry. ***
