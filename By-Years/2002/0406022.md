The project addresses an emerging field of quantum graphs and their applications
to modeling quasi-one-dimensional complex physical systems. In this project,
quantum graphs are graphs considered as one-dimensional singular varieties
equipped with differential or pseudo-differential "Hamiltonians." The main
problems to be considered are modeling wave propagation in thin systems by graph
models and studying properties of these models of relevance for many areas of
application, ranging from chemistry, to optics, to
nanotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Motivation for this study comes from
various areas of engineering, sciences, and mathematics. Among them are
materials science (nanotechnology, in particular circuits containing quantum
wires, and novel optical materials, so-called photonic crystals) and high-
performance computing (optical and quantum computing). The project aims to
develop the subject of quantum graph theory, which, in spite of its wide
applicability, is still in early stages of development. The project will advance
knowledge in this important area of mathematics with applications to several
active branches of science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;
