The research will examine the ecological and evolutionary consequences of a
microorganism that affects reproductive incompatibility in its flour beetle
host, Tribolium confusum. Males infected with this particular microorganism
cannot produce progeny when mated with females that are not infected. The
microorganism is transmitted from mothers to their offspring. If the
microorganism is introduced into an uninfected population, in the absence of
sufficient negative effects on its host, it is expected to spread through the
population. Dr. Stevens will examine how the reproductive incompatibility
affects host fitness, sperm utilization, and sperm competition. She will also
determine if there is variation in sensitivity of the cytoplasmic factor to
curing by high temperature. This research is important to basic scientific
research because it will shed light on how interactions among such infective
microorganism and their host are important in the process of evolution. The
results may also have potential applications in pest management; the flour
beetle itself is a major stored products pest.
