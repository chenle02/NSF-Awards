9316143 Engel This award provides one-half the funding required for the
acquisition of a bench-top gas chromatograph/isotope ratio mass spectrometer, or
GC/IRMS, system to be installed and operated in the School of Geology and
Geophysics at the University of Oklahoma. The institution is committed to
providing the remaining funds necessary. The GC/IRMS system will be used in
research on the isotopic composition of specific amino acids and its possible
effect on the interpretation of bulk isotopic analyses of organic remains in
fossils. ***
