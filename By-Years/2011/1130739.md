The research objective of this grant is to determine if the conformation of a
single polymer molecule on a surface can be accurately determined using the
scanning probe microscope. This objective will be achieved by synthesizing
alternating block copolymers comprised of well-defined surface affinities and
molecular structures, imaging these molecules adsorbed onto a variety of
surfaces, and then using dynamic force spectroscopy to repeatedly adsorb and
detach the molecule from each of these surfaces. Correlation of the forces
required to detach the molecule from a given surface with its molecular
composition and structure will enable identification of the three-dimensional
polymer?s interfacial structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this
interdisciplinary collaborative effort will lead to a better understanding of
how polymeric coatings interact with underlying surfaces and improved control
over the interfacial properties of materials. Understanding the adsorption,
desorption and conformation of polymers on substrates is extremely important in
defining colloidal material interactions. Colloidal interactions are important
in biomass conversion into biofuels, oil recovery, mining, food processing,
papermaking, and water treatment. This interdisciplinary project involves
students from under-represented groups and faculty from chemistry, chemical
engineering and mechanical engineering working together to meet the research
goals. Multiple undergraduate and graduate courses in the Schools of Chemistry
&amp; Biochemistry, Chemical &amp; Biomolecular Engineering, and Mechanical
Engineering at Georgia Tech will be enhanced.
