This award supports the Conference on Probability, Control and Finance, to be
held at Columbia University in the City of New York, 04-08 June 2012, with
website http://www.math.columbia.edu/department/procofin/. The aim of the
conference is to analyze, using mathematical models, interactions between
numerous financial market participants, and the consequences of such
interactions. It will deal with issues impacting the market as a whole, rather
than focusing only on the behavior of a single market participant. The objective
is to bring together domestic and international researchers working in the areas
of probability, financial mathematics and economics, control and estimation of
stochastic optimization processes, as well as stochastic analysis.

As a consequence of the crisis of 2007/2008, new regulatory changes are facing
financial markets and it is important to maintain and improve the training and
support available to young researchers who may play an important role in
implementing, in the future, those changes related to mathematical modeling of
the markets. By mixing researchers with different skills and perspectives,
including those from under-represented groups, the conference aims to foster
enriching interactions between people who would rarely interact otherwise. Even
though the field of Financial Mathematics has attracted many graduate students
in the last decade, many of them have looked for careers in industry; this
conference may help attract top students to careers in academia or regulatory
agencies, and increase the pool of US researchers in the field.
