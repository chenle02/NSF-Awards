University of Arizona The proposed research seeks to explore the use of local
economic development instruments by Russian local governments during
restructuring and to explain local policy variations. The research analyzes the
extent to which local policy makers have begun to use new methods to transform
the structure of the local economy. Specific topics of analysis include local
government policy goals and priorities, the tools used to achieve those, and how
geographical land use within the city is determined. The core of the research
effort is a survey designed to query local and regional officials and
policymakers. The results of the survey will be analyzed statistically and
compared with similar cities in advanced capitalist democracies
