Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) represents one of the fastest and
most powerful methods for analyzing mixtures of compounds and for monitoring
reactions as they progress. The acquistion of GC-MS capability especially
enhances the research of chemists involved in the multi-step synthesis of new
compounds. At the Department of Chemistry at the University of Nevada, Reno the
newly aquired GC-MS system will be used in support of the following projects: 1)
Mechanistic aspects of homogeneous catalysis 2) Homoconjugation in chiral
molecules 3) Photocatalysis in sol-gel semiconductors 4) Tris(cyclopentadienyl)
transition metal clusters 5) Preparation of and catalysis by asymmetric
catalysts 6) Electron delocalization in organic molecules 7) Novel reactive
intermediates related to organic photochemistry
