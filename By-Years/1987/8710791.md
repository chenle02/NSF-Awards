Molecular genetic techniques will be applied to study the molecular basis of
cell motility in non-muscle cells. As a model system the myxomycete Physarum
will be used. In this system meiotic gene mapping permits identification of
mutants by classical genetic analysis, allowing long term studies on a variety
of gene products important in cell motility. In Physarum, extensive biochemical
studies indicate that the proteins actin and myosin produce the force required
for cytoplasmic streaming. Calcium is believed to regulate the activity of
Physarum actomyosin, perhaps by binding to the essential myosin light chain,
LC-2. To verify this hypothesis, the principal investigator will identify the
cloned gene coding for LC-2 and determine its nucleotide sequence. From this
information the amino acid sequence of the protein will be deduced, and its
ability to bind calcium determined by comparison with the amino acid sequences
of known calcium binding proteins. The results of this project should shed light
on the method of regulation of motility in non-muscle cells. The work will also
provide evidence for the role of myosin light chains in actomyosin-based cell
motility.
