This award is to establish an Research Experiences For Undergraduates site at
Texas Southern University for 10 students. The project will center around finite
difference equations. The students will participate in a course in finite
difference equations and an informal research class in which published papers
will be read, analyzed and explained in detail. There will also be a series of
colloquia with guest presenters. The participants will be required to attend
these courses, prepare a presentation to be given at the end of the summer
component and prepare a manuscript to submit to the Journal of Undergraduate
Mathematics. This award is to a minority institution and the program is designed
to increase minority participation in mathematical research. The department is
very experienced in teaching minorities and currently has graduates attending
several large universities working on advanced degrees in mathematics.
