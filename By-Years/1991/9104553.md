The principal investigators will study the isotopic systematics of
synmetamorphic Acadian granitoids and potential metamorphic source rocks of New
England. In doing so they will attempt to evaluate the relative importance of
mantle magmatism versus crustal anatexis in the genesis of these plutonic rocks.
