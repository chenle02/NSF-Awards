DATE: January 8, 2001 PROPOSAL NUMBER: OPP 0110244 ORGANIZATION: Combustion
Science and Engineering PI: Douglas Carpenter

The National Science Foundation's Office of Polar Programs operates up to six
ski-equipped Lockheed LC-130 military cargo aircraft in Antarctica during the
austral summer season, along with supplemental intercontinental flights of C-5,
C-17, and C-141 aircraft. In addition, two ski-equipped utility deHavilland twin
Otter (DHC-6) aircraft and four helicopters (Bell 212, AS 350's) fly intra-
continental flights throughout the summer season. At present, hard-surface ice
runways capable of supporting wheeled aircraft operations are available at
McMurdo Station, with compacted snow ski-ways available at the other sites (as
well as at McMurdo) Organized airfield rescue and fire fighting services are
provided only at the airfields at McMurdo and at South Pole Stations. The NSF
published a request for proposals to study all military and civilian guidelines
for airfield rescue and fire fighting services and define the basic fire risks
those standards have been established to address. In addition, the contract is
established to study recent reports by noted authorities regarding airfield
rescue and fire fighting service requirements at airports to ensure that all
fire risks have been identified.

Three companies bid on the proposal. Combustion Science and Engineering (CSE) of
Columbia, Maryland was selected by the technical and business panels to be the
award recipient at a fixed price of $99,600 for a level of effort of
approximately six weeks. The effort will be led by Mr. Douglas Carpenter.

The PI has prior experience in Antarctica. The OPP Safety and Health Officer
recommends this award be made at the fixed level of $99,600 effective 15 January
2001 for a period not to exceed six months.
