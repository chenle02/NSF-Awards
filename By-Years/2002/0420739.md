With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Hamilton College will acquire a dispersive Raman
spectrometer equipped with a confocal Raman microscope and a macro sampling
chamber. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas: a) Raman
probe of enzyme mechanism and active site structure; b) studies of biological
transformations of iron oxide minerals by dissimilative iron reducing bacteria;
and c) maintaining biofunctionality of microcontact printed protein
nanostructures.

Raman spectroscopy provides a powerful probe of molecular information. Raman
scattering is complementary to infrared absorption in that it probes
fundamentally different types of molecular vibrational modes. For biological
samples, Raman scattering is the preferred method because it is not affected by
the polar water environment that absorbs strongly in the infrared. The Raman
effect is enhanced when coupled to a charge-transfer transition or when samples
are adsorbed on a metal surface. These enhancement mechanisms can lead to a
million-fold increase in signal intensity. This instrument will be used not only
for research but also for a number of courses at this undergraduate institution.
