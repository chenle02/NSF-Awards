This program looks at corrosion mechanisms in thin films of electronic
materials with emphasis on atmospheric corrosion in copper. In air copper
develops a thin surface film of oxide. Subsequent exposure to moist environments
containing corrosive gases, such as sulfur dioxide, aids the growth of corrosion
products on the surface. Of special interest are the microcell corrosion
processes pertaining to the conversion of an approximately 20 Angstrom film of
cuprite to a 200 Angstrom film of cuprite and copper sulfide. The studies
include corrosion of polycrystalline copper, single crystal copper, and vacuum-
deposited copper foils. The thin film growth process, chemistry, structure, and
morphology are determined by several surface analytical techniques, including
Auger spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and associated diffraction
methods. %%% There is a need for improved understanding of atmospheric corrosion
of microelectronic devices to improve their resistance to degradation. This
research on copper provides a foundation for the investigation of other metals,
alloys and semiconductors of commercial importance in thin film technologies.
