The Rice Hydrothermal system is an ideal location to evaluate the relative
contributions of magmatic and 18O- shifted meteoric reservoirs to a hydrothermal
fluid. Three plume fluid models (no mixing, progressive upward dilution, and a
spike of magmatic fluid) will be tested by measuring fluid parameters ( D, 18O,
temperature, and salinity) which vary with the degree of mixing between two
"end-member" fluids. The plume hypothesis itself will be tested by studying the
effects of water/rock interaction in sedimentary rocks in the Rico dome.
