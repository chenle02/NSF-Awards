This project is increasing student participation in independent research in
human cognition, and in introductory and cognitive psychology courses. Moreover,
it is expected to broaden students' direct experience with cognitive phenomena
central to contemporary research. A microcomputer facility with student stations
networked to a fileserver and printers, plus experimentation software written
for undergraduates, is being used in designing and conducting automated
experiments in human cognition. These facilities are also helping enrich and
broaden the research opportunities of psychology majors who must complete
specific psychology courses and independent projects to satisfy requirements
research courses.
