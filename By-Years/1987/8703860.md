The transport of ions across biological membranes is a fundamental process which
is essential to a variety of physiological phenomena. In addition to being
critical to the basic metabolism and bioenergetics of most cells, it is key to
many other more specific processes. Neurotransmission, muscle action and vision
are just a few examples of biological events that are mediated by the transport
of ions. A deeper understanding of ion transport could have far reaching
consequences in several areas of biochemistry. Dr. Dewey is investigating the
transmembrane ion transport kinetics for two of the better characterized
transport proteins, bacteriorhodopsin and calcium ATPase. Knowledge of the rates
of the individual, elementary reaction steps is required for a detailed,
molecular description of an ion transport process. A modulation relaxation
kinetic technique developed in his laboratory will be used. This method will
provide new information for evaluating reaction mechanisms.
