The 2014 Workshop on Compound Semiconductor Materials & Devices (WOCSEMMAD) will
address research areas in III-V compound semiconductor field. Growth and
material properties of 2D layered semiconductors, optoelectronic and electronic
device applications of 2D semiconductor materials and their heterostructures
will be a major area on which the Workshop will focus. It is one of the few
workshop format meetings where the latest results can be debated and discussed
in a relatively open format. WOCSEMMAD has played a key role in identifying new
directions for research. The workshop will be held February 16-19, 2014 at the
Menger Hotel, San Antonio, TX and the project will support student
participation. WOCSEMMAD's broader impact will be on the design and development
of novel new devices and materials. Along with these new materials and devices,
new industries and jobs will be created with lasting impact on science and
economy.
