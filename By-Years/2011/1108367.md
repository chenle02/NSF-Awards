This project will continue the research by PI James E. Dixon to continue
underwater paleoenvironmental modeling and archaeological survey in Southeast
Alaska as part of a multi-year effort to identify ancient archaeological remains
on the continental shelf dating to the late Pleistocene, ca 12,000-16,000 y.a.
This is the time period when sea level was lower, due to the ice sheets covering
large parts of North America. During this time period, the coastline had the
potential for supporting human occupation and it has long been hypothesized that
this was one of the routes of early human migration from Asia to North America.
Following the flooding that occurred with the post-Pleistocene sea level rise,
evidence of these early migrations,in the form of archeological sites, would
have been covered and now occupying the contemporary sea floor.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The previous project, Gateway to America I, was supported
though a Small Grant for Exploratory Research through the Arctic Social Sciences
Program. During that pilot project, two anomalies in the undersea area were
discovered; one resembling a stone fishing weir, the other a rectangular and
circular shaped depresses that could be of cultural origin. This project would
continue the investigation started in the pilot project by 1) documenting and
testing the anomalies observed in 2010, and 2) conducting additional underwater
survey and testing guided by GIS modeling and field observations. The project
has the potential to bring empirical evidence to a decades old debate in North
American archaeology: when and by what route did people migrate into North
America from Asia?
