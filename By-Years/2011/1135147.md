The Black Graduate Student Conference in Psychology (BGSCP) has been held every
year since 1995 and has demonstrated success in retention of African American
graduate students in psychology. The goals of this conference are to: 1) provide
graduate students in psychology with a supportive atmosphere to present their
research and receive constructive feedback from fellow African American graduate
students and faculty that will improve their research capabilities; 2) provide
students with an opportunity to exchange strategies and experiences that will
help them to thrive in graduate school and beyond; and 3) provide a forum for
African American graduate students in psychology to develop long-lasting
professional relationships with future colleagues. Conference activities consist
of paper presentations, poster sessions, roundtable discussions and professional
development presentations. Students are required to participate in all aspects
of the conference. This requirement along with the small size of the conference
ensures that students get to know each other and fosters a climate of support.
The enhanced level of interaction also promotes the exchange of scientific ideas
across different areas of psychology, encouraging a more informed and
interdisciplinary approach to psychological research.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Over
the years, the conference has played a vital role in training African American
graduate students to become productive and effective researchers, some of whom
have gone on to become academic psychologists. The impact of the conference
continues to be felt as the research skills and professional contacts that
former participants gained from the conference help them to develop
professionally throughout their careers.
