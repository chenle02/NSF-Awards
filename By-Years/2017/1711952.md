Missing data are ubiquitous in practical data analysis due to the study design
or a subject's refusal to participate. An important related problem is the
evaluation of non-randomized interventions, which can also be framed as a
missing data problem. Together, missing data methods have important applications
in biomedical sciences, economics, social sciences, and business. With practical
usage in mind, the PIs will develop statistical methodologies that are simple to
implement, easy to understand, and yet versatile enough to be applicable to a
wide range of practically-motivated problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A general
covariate balancing framework will be studied, which directly mimics missing
completely at random and randomized trials in the case of observational studies,
and has a better nonparametric flavor than existing model-based methods. The
investigators will extend the scope of covariate balancing to various estimands
and data structures, propose a unified framework for attaining uniform
approximate balance in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and disseminate the
findings to applied statisticians and non-statisticians.
