This project will create modern, instrumentation-based laboratories for general
chemistry students, science and non- science majors alike, by using a
Microcomputer-Based Laboratory (MBL). In this system, a personal computer with a
laboratory interface enhances the utility of laboratory instrumentation. The MBL
system can serve as a pH meter, voltmeter, ammeter, light detector, thermometer,
controller, or other instrument, as well as a data compiler and manipulator. The
computer allows students to control the experiment, collect data, analyze it,
and make a report of it in a manner not previously available in the general
chemistry laboratory. All experiments in the course will be conducted in the MBL
system. The grantee will match from non-Federal sources the NSF contribution to
this project.
