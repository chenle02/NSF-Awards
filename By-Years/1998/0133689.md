Proposal Title: PECASE: Computational social choice theory: strategic agents
and iterative mechanisms Institution: Brown University

This proposal aims to advance the state of the art of automated strategic
reasoning through research and teaching at the intersection of computer science
and economics. In research, the development of a computational theory of social
choice is proposed, emphasizing the interplay of artificially intelligent agent
strategies and computational mechanisms that implement collective decisions.
Such a theory will facilitate the translation of collective decision-making by
human societies into digital form. In education, the design of courses and
degree programs across computer science and economics is proposed, as is
encouraging women to participate in such programs and to explore careers that
build on the resulting cross-disciplinary skill sets.

This project was originally funded as a CAREER award, and was converted to a
Presidential Early Career Award for Engineers and Scientists (PECASE) award in
May 2004.
