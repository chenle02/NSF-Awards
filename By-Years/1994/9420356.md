9420356 Calvert The research is for development of a solid freeform fabrication
system based on extrusion of a fine jet of polymerizable slurry. Three-
dimensional parts are build up as a series of layers under computer control,
based on part geometry data stored in the computer. Preliminary results have
been obtained in conjunction with a local small business. The researched work
will use two joined heads so that two-component reagents can be used, allowing
parts to be formed from a wide range of strong polymers and from
organic/inorganic hybrids by coextrusion of alkoxide/monomer mixtures and
water/monomer mixtures. It will also allow composite materials to be formed with
compositional gradients, or with short-fiber reinforced composites, such that
mechanical properties can be locally optimized. Reinforced composites will be
designed using finite element methods to seek optimal distributions of
reinforcements. Rapid prototyping to near net shape offers numerous advantages
in terms of reducing cycle time, waste, and thus manufacturing costs. The
ability to make complex composites should open the way to biomimetic and
intelligent materials which can achieve levels of damage resistance and
responsiveness found in biological materials.
