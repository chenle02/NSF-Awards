This award supports acquisition of a rapid sediment analysis system for fine-
grained sediments. The acquisition has an institutional contribution of one half
of the system cost. The instrument being acquired operates on the principle of
laser diffraction making analysis time very short. The instrument will be used
to support research work that relates to paleoenvironmental change during the
Pleistocene and Holocene. Specifically, sediments from the Antarctic continental
shelf contain a very high resolution record of changing paleoenvironmental
conditions over the last several thousand years. The instrument will be applied
to studies of sediment records related to glacio-marine deposition which are
related to advances and retreats of the Antarctic ice sheets. This instrument is
an asset to a strong undergraduate research program and it will also benefit
other undergraduate institutions in the region.
