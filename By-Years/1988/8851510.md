Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrocopy is being incorporated into an integrated
four-year spectroscopy sequence and into professional education programs. The
program is impacting the laboratories in General, Organic, Inorganic, Physical,
Analytical and Biochemistry, as well as senior research. The addition of FTIR
upgraded the instrumental facilities and is allowing the offering of well-
balanced, modern laboratory experience. Many of the changes were initially
implemented using a loaned FTIR instrument, which were made permanent by this
project enhancing both the academic and professional programs. The grantee is
matching the award from non-Federal sources.
