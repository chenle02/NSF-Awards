Engineering - Mechanical (56)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project adapts work on
thermal systems laboratories at University of Virginia, US Naval Academy, and
Union College to establish an undergraduate laboratory in thermal engineering
technology for three undergraduate thermal science courses. The project provides
students with hands-on experiences of abstract concepts discussed in lecture and
allows exceptional undergraduate students the opportunity to learn about the
subject material in more depth by co-designing and constructing an experimental
apparatus. Furthermore, it supports collaboration between faculty to enhance the
learning experience of undergraduate students and provides potential future
teachers experience in the design of educational materials. Finally, it develops
a model that can be used in the development of other laboratory experiments in
the institution's mechanical engineering curriculum. Experimental stations are
being constructed and tested by undergraduate students who have recently
completed the courses into which the experiments are being implemented. The
project addresses the DUE themes of teacher preparation, faculty development,
and integration of technology in education. The evaluation program, under the
direction of a collaborator from the Center for Mathematics and Science
Education Research, includes student interviews and surveys, classroom
observation, and follow-up studies with faculty members teaching in subsequent
courses. The investigators plan to disseminate the organization and evaluation
of the project, along with two lab manuals, through conference presentations,
journal articles, and web site postings.
