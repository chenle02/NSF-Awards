9321166 Cline This grant will support an international symposium which will
focus on issues pertaining to the most recent information on the dark matter in
the Universe, the early history of the Universe, and the connection between
cosmology, particle physics, and astronomy. The symposium is to be held in Santa
Monica, California, on February 16 through 18, 1994, and will be hosted by the
University of California, Los Angeles. The goal of the symposium is to achieve a
better understanding of the role of elementary particles and early universe
cosmology, including superstrings in the future development of the field. In
pursuing this goal, we will explore the large-scale structure of the Universe
and the microwave background properties since these impact directly on the
subject of Astroparticle Physics. The symposium will provide answers which help
define directions of research for the future. The proceedings of the symposium
will be published. ***
