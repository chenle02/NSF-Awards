Echinoderms are a phylum of invertebrates that include starfish, sea urchins
and cucumbers, crinoids ("sea lilies"), sand dollars, and several extinct
groups, known only from the fossil record. One theory regards the echinoderms as
the ancestral group from which vertebrates arose. The evolutionary relationships
and history of diversification within the echinoderms has been the subject of
research for many decades, and data from fossils, skeletal morphology, and most
recently, DNA sequences have been amassed for this purpose. These studies have
also attempted to place the echinoderms in the evolutionary framework of other
major animal groups. Dr. Edward Ruppert is a leading specialist in invertebrate
developmental and comparative biology, and he proposes research on the internal
anatomy of echinoderms, with particular attention to the axial complex, which
controls the water vascular system. The proposed research will have wide-ranging
impact. The new anatomical data will help to interpret the functional anatomy of
a diverse and worldwide group, and these data may help resolve many remaining
questions surrounding the group's evolution. An independent data set such as
this will be compared with existing data, such as the DNA sequences, opening
opportunities for future research on the mosaic nature of evolution among
different character systems. The results of this study will have a wide audience
beyond echinoderm specialists.
