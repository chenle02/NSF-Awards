Theoretical studies are proposed for laser-induced energy transfer in molecular
collision systems and chemical reactions under several different kinds of
physical conditions. Calculations involving semiclassical and quantum-mechanical
scattering theory will be undertaken on the following projects: (1) Laser-
induced gas-phase bimolecular reactions between a rare gas atom and a halogen
molecule, in which a non-resonant laser pulse excites the van der Waals complex,
leading to the formation of an electronically excited product. (2) Manipulation
of ultrashort laser pulses to determine the outcome of a collision event. (3)
Photodissociation of a molecule near a grating, including the particular case of
predissociation. Effects due to neighboring molecules and possible laser-
assisted heterogeneous catalysis are also considered. (4) Laser-induced
reactions in a solid-rare gas matrix to determine potential energy surfaces and
reactions between halogen and rare-gas atoms. This is a fundamental theoretical
study directed towards understanding the details of how a pulse of laser light
can cause particular chemical reactions to occur. The possibility of controlling
the outcomes of chemical reactions by varying the wavelength of the laser light
depends on such an understanding; the present studies are directed to this end.
