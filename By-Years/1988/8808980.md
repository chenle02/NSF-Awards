A prototype methodology for multiprocessor simulations has been developed and
implemented on the Alliant computer. The research will incrementally automate
the steps required to simulate parallel numerical algorithms on a range of
multiprocessor systems. The ultimate goal is to construct a simulator that can
simulate any parallel program. Analytic models for performance prediction will
also be developed. These modelling and simulation techniques are expected to
lead to better parallel algorithms and partitioning techniques.
