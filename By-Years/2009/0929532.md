Dr. Hai Xiao of the Missouri University of Science and Technology and Dr.
Desheng Jiang of Wuhan University of Technology proposed a U.S.-China Workshop
on optical fiber sensors. The workshop will be hosted in the Wuhan University of
Technology, Wuhan, China on July 1-3, 2009. This is the first U.S.-China
workshop on this topic and brings together key fiber sensor researchers from the
U.S. and China to identify research and development challenges and collectively
define needs and opportunities for future collaboration between these two
countries. This workshop will be supported jointly by the National Natural
Science Foundation, Wuhan University of Technology and the National Science
Foundation.
