This project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division involves an investigation of a number of aspects of the
electronic structure of atoms and molecules with a focus on the structure of
reduced density matrices, the extended Koopmans' theorem, and the development of
analytic approximations to the electron-electron pair density. A goal is to
obtain more accurate descriptions of ionization energies and the ionization
process itself. Also being sought are improvements in the form of exchange-
correlation potentials for use in density functional theories of electronic
structure. %%% Descriptions of the electronic structure of atoms, molecules, and
solids typically involve highly mathematical formulations which make their
interpretations difficult. In this theoretical study ways are being sought to
simplify the descriptions without loss of rigor. A particular focus of the study
is the formulation of new mathematical descriptions of the important process of
the removal of an electron from an atom or molecule to form a positive ion.
