The Standard Model of particle physics has been a successful theory, agreeing
with decades of experimental observations involving weak, electromagnetic, and
strong interactions. The discovery of the Higgs boson at the LHC was further
confirmation of this success. However, the Standard Model remains an incomplete
theory. The precise measurements of the properties of the Higgs boson at the LHC
could provide insight into new physics beyond the Standard Model. This research
focuses on exploiting the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC) to search for new particles, study the decay of Higgs
bosons, carry out precision measurements of other Standard Model (SM) processes,
search for new Supersymmetry particles, and extend the capabilities of the CMS
particle-tracking detector to increase its acceptance and tolerance to high
collision rates. The research activity will also foster collaboration with high
school teachers and students through the QuarkNet and the general public through
the Cosmic Ray Observatory Project (CROP) project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research will search for subtle signatures of Beyond Standard Model (BSM)
physics using advanced methods for identifying rare signals and addressing
systematic uncertainties. The search in this award will concentrate on
identifying same-sign leptons in the event collisions. These can indicate a new
Supersymmetric particle (SUSY) or other exotic physics models of BSM physics.
This research will also extend the capabilities of the CMS tracking detector to
handle conditions at the High Luminosity LHC, extend its geometric coverage, and
add tracking information to the far-forward particle flow
analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
