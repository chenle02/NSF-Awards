Computer Lab Modules for Large Biology Courses This project provides a
stimulating, rigorous, and hands-on laboratory experience by constructing
innovative and multifunctional computer lab modules that students in
prepharmacy, agriculture, and nursing and allied health fields who require a
solid foundation in biological principals would use for data acquisition and
analysis, lab extensions, simulations, and delivery of instruction. These Bio
LabStations have been developed in the Computer Resource Center for courses
taught to biology majors. With some modification of the experiments carried out
with them, they can be used for these courses, as well. These Bio LabStations
replace several pieces of equipment: physiographs, oscilloscopes, pH meters, and
oxygen meters, and their function far surpasses that of this conventional
equipment. Although data can be collected with the conventional equipment, the
Bio LabStations not only perform this function, but they also permit analysis of
data, elaborate upon and extend the data collection process, simulate living
systems and processes, deliver instruction, and provide for review and some
testing. They have the further advantage of presenting to the students one basic
apparatus to be mastered, rather than several. Not having to adjust to entirely
new equipment with each new experiment should enable them to focus better on the
point of each experiment.
