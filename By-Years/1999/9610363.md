This research project deals with the development of methods and procedures for
predicting response of vibroimpact systems to random excitation. Typical fields
of applications include Engineering (response of moored bodies to ocean waves)
and Power Engineering, particularly Nuclear (flow- induced vibrations of fuel
bundles within channelling tubes; and of heat exchanger tubes impacting against
support plates). Other potential applications include Railway Machinery (vehicle
dynamics with impact-type wheel/rail interactions) and Rotating Machinery
(gearboxes with reversals of motion). A quasiconservative stochastic averaging
method is used together with a Fourier series expansion in a `rapid` time,
within a response cycle. In addition, a new approximation procedure is developed
and evaluated which is based on the dominating contribution of the impacts into
overall spectral density of response acceleration for lightly damped systems.
The model of a periodic excitation with random phase modulation is used to
predict subharmonic response of moored offshore platforms to ocean waves, and to
predict transitions between planar and whirling flow-induced vibrations of tubes
in heat exchangers. Fundamental theory of nonlinear vibration and control would
benefit through new analytical methods and procedures developed during the
course of this research and some new specific solutions obtained for (strongly
nonlinear) systems. Also, this research will assist in response prediction and
control, as well as predicting and/or testing reliability and developing design
guidelines for systems in offshore and power engineering.
