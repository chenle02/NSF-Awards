This project is an extension of an earlier Maine Audubon Society elementary
science project. The current activity will identify and motivate potential
leaders in science education and help them improve the teaching in their
district. Twenty elementary teacher and administrator teams will come together
in an intensive three- day seminar to focus on elementary science needs in their
systems, to build administrative support for an activity-oriented school
science, and to work on professional development plans to address local needs.
Once this planning is completed the teachers will participate in a two-week
summer institute to develop leadership skills and strengthen their science
backgrounds. During the following school year each lead teacher will plan and
implement local workshops and will work with peers to help them introduce hands-
on inquiry oriented science in their classrooms. The cost sharing for the
project will be 54% of the NSF portion.
