The Computational Discovery Laboratory, an interdisciplinary state-of-the-art
computer teaching laboratory, will provide biological, physical, mathematical,
and social science majors at Benedictine College with the technology to learn
and discover for themselves in a supervised environment. It will also support
faculty/student research. The Computational Discovery Laboratory, consisting of
eight Quadra 950s with appropriate software, will have a ninth mobile computer
which will serve as a projection platform in the Laboratory and allow for
demonstrations in traditional classrooms and laboratories. The Laboratory will
be used for a wide variety of applications, including interfacing with biology
instruments using MacLab, simulating chemistry experiments using Gantt, solving
symbolic mathematics equations using Mathematica in physics and mathematics
classes, writing computer programs in a structured laboratory setting in
computer science classes, and analyzing data using SPSS in psychology, political
science, and sociology classes. The computers will be networked with the
College's minicomputer, allowing students access other programming languages
and, providing access to Internet/Bitnet when that becomes available. The
Laboratory will serve as a model of how a group of departments at a small
college can share a facility in order to provide state-of-the-art computing
facilities for their majors.
