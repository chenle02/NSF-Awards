Title: Travel Scholarships for Frontiers in BioMagnetic Particles 2013

INTELLECTUAL MERIT: This proposal seeks support for travel awards for graduate
students, post-docs, and faculty from underrepresented groups to attend the
Frontiers in BioMagnetic Particles III Symposium inTelluride, CO, June 2-4,
2013. This will be a three-day symposium focused on the characterization and
control of magnetic carriers. The symposium will cover topics on magnetic
particles for: (a) biomedical imaging and sensing, (b) magnetic separations, (c)
drug delivery, hyperthermia, and biomedical applications. There will also be a
separate student session on career development with panelist from academia,
industry, and government. A well-structured agenda is presented in the proposal,
and appropriate lead speakers have been lined up for each session. This is a
crosscutting topic that benefits from input across the scientific, engineering,
and medical fields, and the symposium is well designed to facilitate meaningful
discussion among representatives of all of these communities.

BROADER IMPACTS: Scientific and technical broader impacts in the fields of drug
delivery, nanoparticle mediated therapies, and medical imaging are expected.
Financial support is requested to provide four travel awards at $1000 each to
support graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and young faculty. Awardees
will be selected on the basis outstanding scientific contributions, as judged by
submitted presentation abstracts, and the perceived level of need. At least two
awards will be reserved for women and unrepresented minorities. Funding priority
will be given to graduate students attending their first national meeting,
junior faculty giving an oral presentation, and researchers belonging to
underrepresented groups. The existence of potential funding for travel support
will be described in advertisements for the symposium. Requests for travel
awards will be accepted at the time of abstract submission and selections made
by the organizing committee.
