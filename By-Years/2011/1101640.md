This project focuses on problems in arithmetic groups and multiple Dirichlet
series, problems that are intimately related to automorphic forms. One part
addresses topics related to cohomology of arithmetic groups and allied areas,
such as the geometry of locally symmetric spaces and the conjectures linking
cohomology to arithmetic geometry and Galois representations. The second part
studies multiple Dirichlet series attached to Weyl groups, affine Weyl groups,
and principal homogeneous vector spaces, and their connections to combinatorics,
representation theory, automorphic forms, and mathematical physics. As writing
projects, the principal investigator will continue to work with F. Hirzebruch
and D. Zagier on updating their book "The Atiyah-Singer theorem and elementary
number theory." He will also work with W. Stein to prepare a revised version of
"Modular forms, a computational approach."

This proposal deals with the interactions between number theory and
representation theory. Number theory is the study of the properties of the whole
numbers, and is the oldest branch of mathematics. Representation theory is the
systematic study of symmetry, through the development of simple mathematical
objects that encode the fundamental irreducible pieces of symmetry. A principal
aim of the proposal is to explore relationships between these two subjects in
the spirit of the "Langlands philosophy," which predicts deep connections
between number theory and representation theory. Today the questions and
phenomena addressed by these subjects serve as driving forces in much of
contemporary mathematics research. Moreover, the subjects have contributed many
applications in such diverse areas as codes and data transmission, chemistry,
physics, and theoretical computer science.
