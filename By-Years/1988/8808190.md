The objectives of this project are: (1) to develop efficient algorithms for the
solution of generalized eigenvalue problem by using the multigrid method; (2) to
implement these algorithms on supercomputers and parallel processors; (3) use
the algorithms to investigate the dynamic response of large scale space
structures. The multigrid method (a fast, iterative linear matrix equation
solver) will be used to solve the matrix equations that arise in solution
algorithms. (The resulting algorithms will be implemented on a CRAY X-MP/48
supercomputer and various concurrent systems e.g., Alliant FX/8 and hypercube
configurations. The integration of new solution techniques for the eigenvalue
problem with state-of-the-art supercomputer technology will enable complex
structures to analyzed accurately and allow the full potential of these machines
to be realized.
