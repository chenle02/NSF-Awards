This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop new
thermostable bacteriophage and archaeaviral DNA polymerases for use as improved
reagents for DNA amplification, sequence analysis and single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) detection. This will be accomplished by direct isolation of
thermophilic bacteriophage and archaeaviral genomes from hot springs,
construction of expression libraries and screening for novel thermostable DNA
polymerase activities. The proposed approach is expected to be significantly
more rapid and comprehensive than traditional approaches that have been used for
enzyme discovery. These traditional approaches rely on the limiting intermediate
step of culturing a microbe and its cognate virus. In contrast, the proposed
approach on this project will allow screening of all expressible viral DNA
polymerases present, including those from unculturable phage that is believed to
predominate in the environment.

The primary commercial application of this project will be in the marketing of
novel thermostable DNA polymerases to organizations involved in genomics
research for use as improved reagents for specific molecular biology methods. .
