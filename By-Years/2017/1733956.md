This proposal supports 12 students for their travel to attend the 16th Workshop
on the Economics of Information Security (WEIS) held at the University of
California San Diego, on June 26-27, 2017. WEIS is an annual event that serves
as a leading forum for interdisciplinary scholarship on information security,
combining expertise from the fields of computer science and electrical
engineering, economics, social science, business, law, and policy. Student
participation in WEIS is a critical part of the educational experiences of
students with interdisciplinary interests related to security and privacy. WEIS
provides them an opportunity to interact with senior researchers and to be
exposed to leading work in the field. As such, it fits closely with the goals of
NSF's Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, which include socio-
economic approaches to information security.
