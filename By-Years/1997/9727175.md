Much of the evolutionary success of our species can be attributed to our
ability to procure, process and consume a wide variety of foods. However, recent
changes in our diet may lie at the root of many of the health problems that
confront our health care systems. If we are to understand and successfully cope
with the world population pressures and potential food shortages looming on the
horizon, we need every bit of information we can gather on diet and its
influence on our lives. Over the past twenty years, vast amounts of data have
been gathered on what we eat, how we eat and why we eat what we eat, not to
mention similar studies of our ancestors and the living great apes. This project
brings together researchers who use many different approaches to address issues
concerning the origins and evolution of human diet. These researchers will meet
and present papers during a symposium at the International Congress on
Anthropological and Ethnographic Sciences. An internet listserv and web site
will be set up to foster communications among these researchers and other
members of the scientific community. The result will be a multidisciplinary
approach to shed new light on issues concerning the origins and evolution of
human diet, and health-related implications of the discordance between what we
eat today and what our heritage has `designed` us to eat.
