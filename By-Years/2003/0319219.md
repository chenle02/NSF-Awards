This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase I project proposes to
develop, fabricate and test a sensitive array chip sensor for monitoring
biointeractions using the technique of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) imaging.
There are many methods to detect biomolecular interactions, but most require
that one of the molecules be distinctly labeled using fluorescence or other
approaches. Such labeling may inadvertently alter binding properties of the
molecules. SPR based technologies have the distinct advantage of being label-
free. However, despite continued improvement of SPR based instruments, the
detection limit remains insufficient for applications that require the binding
of small molecules. The vast majority of SPR instruments are also limited to a
very small throughput of 4 channels or less. This project will address both of
these limitations by employing a novel sensor array design based on the concept
of long range surface plasmons. Numerous model binding experiments involving the
attachment of small analytes to larger proteins immobilized on the sensor
surface will be performed to assess the improved chip performance.

The commercial applications of this project are very broad, ranging from
detection of biological warfare agents and environmental monitoring to drug
design and discovery.
