9526810 Zhao, Dapeng This research is to investigate the detailed 3-D crustal
and upper mantle structure and its relationship to the seismotectonics of the
Kobe, Japan, region. Data from the January 17, 1995 Kobe earthquake and its
aftershocks will be used. Preliminary results show a low velocity zone beneath
the hypocenter of the earthquake and one of the goals is to investigate
Poisson's Ratio in this zone to test a model of fluid triggering of the main
shock. Deeper upper mantle structure will also be determined to see how deep the
Philippine Sea plate is penetrating beneath this region. The results will be
important for understanding the triggering mechanism and rupture process of
large earthquakes, and provide a physical framework for understanding the
relationship between crustal earthquake activity, lateral variation of the
structure, and subduction and magmatic processes in the deeper areas. A better
understanding of these features is important for the log-term seismic hazard
assessment in this region, and provide useful references to other seismically
active regions. This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard
Reduction Program. *** ??
