This National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award will support the
construction of theoretical models of stars and the effects of radial and
nonradial stellar oscillation on stellar spectra. The principal investigator,
Dr. Steven Kawaler, will use these models, together with observations of
variable stars and techniques of stellar seismology, to understand the internal
structure and evolution of stars.
