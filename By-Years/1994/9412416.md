9412416 This grant is supported jointly by the Materials Theory Program in the
Division of Materials Research and the Mathematical Physics Activity in the
Physics Division. The theoretical research concerns several different mechanisms
that may play a role in generating spatial or temporal order in systems governed
by simple dynamical rules. The emphases are on controlling chaos in high-
frequency systems and spatiotemporally complex systems and on coherent global
oscillations and self-organized critical correlations in slowly driven dynamical
systems. Immediate goals include a more complete understanding of a novel
technique for controlling chaos using continuous feedback, the development of
tests for detecting this type of control mechanism in natural systems, and the
analysis of simple models of sandpiles that exhibit global oscillations and
novel forms of self-organized critical behavior. %%% This theoretical research
is in the general area of nonlinear science and is jointly supported by the
Physics and Materials Research Divisions. The work focuses on a class of
problems which are governed by simple local rules. The work may impact the
design of individual semiconductor laser devices, the design of feedback
mechanisms for inducing coherence in arrays of such lasers or arrays of
Josephson junctions, and better methods for characterizing the instabilities
observed in natural dynamical systems ranging from cardiac chaos to avalanches
in granular materials.
