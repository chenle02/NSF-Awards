As part of a special thematic semester in probability in 2018, the mathematics
department at the University of Connecticut will be holding research workshops
of national scope in three prominent areas of probability theory: &lt;br/&gt;1)
Recent Progress on Dimer Model and Integrable Probability, Aug 15-16 2018, Avery
Point campus; &lt;br/&gt;2) Mathematical Finance, Oct 12-13 2018, Storrs campus;
&lt;br/&gt;3) Functional Inequalities, Nov 2-3 2018, Storrs campus.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research workshops are supported by this grant and
complement the other activities in the special semester (including a public
lecture and colloquia series), funded by the department. Each workshop will
feature a group of invited distinguished leaders in the respective area. The
goals of the workshops are to bring together researchers from all parts of the
country and at all stages of their career to disseminate ideas, collaborate and
network, having direct access to the invited speakers. Particular focus,
attention and funding opportunities will be given to early-career researchers
and researchers from underrepresented groups. Specifically, this grant will be
used to support about ten early-career participants per workshop. Participants
will have the opportunity to contribute to the proceedings from the special
semester, to appear in a volume of the Birkhauser series Progress in
Probability. The workshops will be widely advertised online (e.g. IMS meetings
website and mathprograms.org), through email lists and networks, specifically
the Women in Probability network (womeninprobability.org) and the mailing list
of women probabilists in North America, as well as through announcements in
meetings, emails to colleagues, and posters. More details on the special
semester and the research workshops can be found on probsem18.math.uconn.edu
(temporary URL draft.probsem18.math.uconn.edu)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
