9528796 Soni The 5th International Conference on Numerical Grid Generation in
Computational Fluid Dynamics and related Fields is organized by the National
Science Foundation Engineering Research Center for Computational field
Simulation and the Aerospace Engineering department both at Mississippi State
University. This international interdisciplinary conference provides a joint
forum where mathematicians, scientists, and engineers from academia, industry,
and federal laboratories can communicate (exchange/assimilate) research ideas,
new algorithmic and software developments, and applications involving grid
generation strategies pertinent to a wide range of practical problems arising in
Computational Field Simulation. the primary objective of the conference is to
optimally fulfill the aforestated mission; but, at the same time to promote
research and education in mathematical, computational, and engineering analysis
of grid generation pertinent to Computational Field Simulations (CFS) and
provide graduate students and young Ph. Ds an opportunity to present their work,
meet researchers, and learn of recent developments in the interdisciplinary area
of grid generation.
