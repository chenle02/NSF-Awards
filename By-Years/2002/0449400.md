The objective of this research is to engineer biologically compatible
microsystems to study biomechanics and mechanotransduction of cells. Microscale
sensors and actuators offer the potential to make measurements and manipulate at
cellular and molecular levels with unprecedented sensitivity, spatial and
temporal resolution. Microsystems will be developed to analyze simultaneously
the mechanics, electrophysiology, and signaling processes of cells in real time;
studies which are currently impossible to integrate in a single experiment.
Goals of the research include: the real time study of single cells and layers of
cells under multi-axis force loading coupled with electophysiological
measurements and the integration of electromechanical and signaling measurement
devices into arrays providing instrumented, actively controlled scaffolding for
cell and tissue culture. New tissue-based control and measurement will be
enabled, including mechanical loading, cell deformations, strain rates, and
spatial variation of forces and electrical environments across tissues.
&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include development of new cellular and tissue
manipulation and measurement tools, calibration methodologies, and microsystems
for in vitro biomechanics and biochemical evaluation. Mechanically coupled cell
culture systems will enable a new understanding of mechanically gated functions
such as bone growth, wound healing, and diseases related to mechanosensory
malfunction such as arteriosclerosis and cancer - diseases affecting millions of
Americans each year. Microsystems and methods for interacting with cells and
manipulating biomechanics will be developed. Cell biomechanics related to
differentiation, protein expression, and biochemistry will be integrated into
accessible databases. The ultimate goal is the development of mechanically
active substrates tailoring cell development to create engineered living
tissues. &lt;br/&gt;
