Dr. Charles D. Sherrill has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship
in Chemistry. Dr. Sherrill received the doctoral degree from the University of
Georgia under the supervision of Professor Henry Schaefer. Dr. Sherrill will
continue research at the University of California at Berkeley under the
sponsorship of Professor Martin Head-Gordon. The postdoctoral research will
focus on the investigation of nonadiabatic energy flow between molecules and
metal surfaces. The approach will take into account nuclear-electronic coupling
to investigate nonadiabatic effects on gas-surface sticking, diffusion, and high
energy scattering. Also of interest is the process of laser-induced desorption
of gas molecules from metal surfaces, which involves nonadiabatic energy
transfer from conduction electrons to vibrational modes of the adsorbate.
Studies are aided by high-quality experimental data on laser-induced desorption
now available. The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is
viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge
and experience of new Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in
contemporary chemical research and teaching.
