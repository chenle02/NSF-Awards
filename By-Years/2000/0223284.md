This project involves characterizing the structure and function of tropical rain
forest canopies to assess their carbon budgets and annual carbon fluxes. A
variety of methods will be used at a variety of scales, ranging from scaled-up
estimates of total canopy photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration from the
forest floor to the canopy together with top-down approaches including eddy
covariance and remote sensing. The project will take place at La Selva Field
Station in Costa Rica. The measurements and modeling results will lead to an
understanding of the causes of interannual variability in tree growth and net
carbon exchange, will test models of carbon cycle in the tropical rain forest.
This work contributes to concerns about the effects of global climate change on
the carbon dynamics of tropical forest ecosystems.
