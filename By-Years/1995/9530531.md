This award will support hardware and software upgrades for sonar systems used on
deep-submergence vehicles. The present collection of &gt;10 units used in
processing will be replaced by an off-the- shelf workstation, decoder and
standard digital signal processor boards. Software will be developed to produce
user-friendly output, and to simply processing so that trained engineers are not
required. Finally, software will be developed to make data compatible for other
computer tool systems (MB and GMT), eventually allowing interactive processing
and display by users of IBM- and Macintosh-compatible systems.
