The 10th World Soybean Research Congress will be held in Savannah, GA in
conjunction with the 17th Biennial Molecular and Cellular Biology of Soybean
Conference from September 10th - 15th 2017. The shared conference provides
unprecedented opportunity for researchers, breeders and industry to convene and
share cutting edge information about basic soybean research that can be
translated to practical outcomes. Early stage scientists supported by this
project will be exposed to networks of international researchers, thus
encouraging training and exchange of ideas across borders and disciplines.

An important goal of the conference is to share cutting-edge science from an
interdisciplinary perspective. The program includes topics at the frontier of
research in pest and diseases, genetics and genomics, seed composition and
nutrition and biotic interactions. By supporting 25 early stage scientists,
including graduate students, post-doctoral researchers and early career faculty,
the conference will promote long-term training and will serve as an incubator
for new ideas and collaborations.
