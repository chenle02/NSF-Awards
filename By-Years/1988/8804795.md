A renewal of the REU site is requested in the interdescriplinary area of
particulate systems engineering. Twelve undergraduates (six from UMC and six
from other universities) will be selected to undertake a specific research
project in collaboration with a faculty advisor to develop student research
skills. The areas for research projects include engineering computation,
modeling, and large data bases for particulate systems, aerosol reactors,
particle motion in a viscous field, neutron activation analysis, and radon
captive and filtration. The purpose of the REU is to infuse bright undergraduate
students with enthusiasm toward research careers, including graduate level
education. The university shows a strong commitment to this program.
