9312854 Savage PI will collect brachiopod and conodont faunas of suspect
terranes in central Alaska and compare these faunas with known faunas in
southeastern Alaska and cratonic North America. The comparison of these faunas
will help determine the history of terrane displacment in Alaska. The field
effort will be coordinated with the U.S. Geological Survey.
