Machine learning has significantly advanced the state of the art in a variety of
applications. These successes have required massive labeled datasets for
training machine learning algorithms. The collection of these labeled datasets
usually involves human annotation. For instance, the training labels for
supervised learning algorithms are often obtained through "crowdsourcing" where
people label the data over the Internet in exchange for monetary incentives.
Most learning algorithms, however, are agnostic of this human-labeling process.
This project designs improved learning algorithms by incorporating the "human"
aspect of the data collection process in the machine learning
objective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, this project considers
supervised binary classification tasks where the labels for the training data
are obtained from people. The research involves design of learning algorithms
that jointly consider the human collection process -- including the interfaces
and incentives available to the human labelers -- and the overall learning
objective. Theoretical guarantees of optimality are derived and compared with
guarantees for algorithms which are agnostic of the human component. The
algorithms and guarantees are based on models of human behavior from psychology,
such as permutation-based models, that allow for maximal accuracy while making
minimal assumptions on how the human labelers behave. The theoretical results
are corroborated with practical implementations (open sourced) and real-world
experiments (data freely available online).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
