This award to James Bower will support continued development and distribution
of A General Neural Simulation System (GENESIS) for Computational Neurobiology.
The specific extensions and further development include the release of a new
version of the software, continued efforts to develop versions of the package on
parallel machines, continued documentation, development of an interface between
GENESIS and the simulator NEURON, and the extension of the development of
simulator performance measures to network. In addition, this award will allow
new collaborations with the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center and the Scientific
Visualization Laboratory at the University of Illinois Chicago. This package
will be used by both the research and the educational communities. The award is
being supported by the Computational Neuroscience Program, the Numeric,
Symbolic, and Geometric Computation Program, and the Computational Biology
Program.
