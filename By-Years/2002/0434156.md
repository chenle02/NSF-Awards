The next generation of wireless is in distributed sensor networks. Applications
in this area are a rapidly growing research area. The project will investigate
possibilities for coordinated action to improve the energy efficiency in
distributed sensor network on all levels, from software to component design to
system integration. The overall goal and impact of this will be the decrease in
the cost of sensor network, allowing wider, more capable deployments for
generalized information gathering and surveillance. A test-bed environment for
energy-efficiency and performance evaluation of reconfigurable hierarchical
networks of sensors will be established at the Center for Nanosensor Technology
at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Another anticipated benefit of such
intelligent surveillance sensor networks is the extension of the same principles
to everyday applications of distributed sensor networks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
