Research is currently being pursued on (a) digital optical computing; (b)
reconfigurable interconnection memories; (c) neural networks; and (d) parallel
computation models and computational complexity. Emphasis is placed on neural
networks and parallel computation models, specifically, studying the
implementation of learning algorithms, number representation including analog,
digital and bipolar numbers, and new optical architectures and architectural
issues such as hardware and time complexity, uniformity, and energy
requirements. Some of the neural network architectures developed are being
demonstrated experimentally. Finally, optical or hybrid optical/electronic
architectures based on parallel computation models are being developed. These
include an analysis of run-time performance of fundamental algorithms on the new
architectures, hardware and device requirements for their physical realization,
and experimental demonstrations of some of the architectures.
