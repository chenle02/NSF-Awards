Abstract Proposal Number: DMS-9803230 Principal Investigator: Jianguo Cao The
principal investigator studies manifolds of non-positive sectional curvature
with particular emphasis on isoperimetric inequalities and the minimal volume
problem. Dr. Cao intends to continue his work on Gromov's minimal volume gap
conjecture jointly with his coauthors. Using the F-structure theory developed by
Cheeger and Gromov, he would like to study the minimal volume gap conjecture for
complete aspherical manifolds. Cao also plans to continue his study on
isoperimetric inequalities on simply-connected riemannian manifolds of non-
positive sectional curvature. As an intermediate step towards understanding this
isoperimetric problem, he hopes to study the total Gauss-Kronecker curvature for
smooth compact convex hypersurfaces in Cartan-Hadamard manifolds. In addition,
Cao plans to continue his study of the sign of the Euler number of compact
aspherical manifolds, especially in the complex case. This project focuses on
the study of global geometric shape of non-positively curved spaces. The
examples of non-positively curved spaces include flat tires and surfaces with
more than two holes, such as pretzels. There are also examples of higher
dimensional non-positively curved spaces. Our universe can be viewed a
3-dimensional space of zero curvature. Dr. Cao is trying to investigate
diameter, volume, spectrum and other geometric data of those spaces. Cao has
also been interested in the study of the shortest closed curves on non-
positively curved spaces. He has already shown that two such surfaces with
possible cusps are isometric if and only if the data of lengths of all shortest
closed curves on the two surfaces are identical. The data of lengths of all
shortest closed curves on a closed surface M is called the marked length
spectrum of the space M. The study of marked length spectrum on spaces with
boundaries has a number of applications in modern industry and geologica l
sciences. In addition, the research of spaces of dimension 10 and 26 have played
a crucial role in the theoretical physics of the unification of four fundamental
forces in our universe.
