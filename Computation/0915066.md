As computer simulations are playing an ever increasing role in many branches of
science and engineering and are rapidly replacing much of the expensive
prototyping and testing phases in manufacturing and in science explorations,
fast and robust numerical methods are becoming an indispensable tool for many
scientists and engineers. The focus of this project is to design auurate, fast
and robust spectral methods for solving a large class of partial differential
equations, and apply them to investigate several important problems of current
interest. The proposed research will result in fast and accurate numerical
algorithms for a class of partial differential equations with applications in
acoustic and electromagnetic scattering, complex fluids and materials science.
In particular, the proposed numerical algorithms will make it possible to
directly solve some important high-dimensional equations which are currently not
treatable with existing numerical algorithms.

It is expected that the proposed numerical simulations will enable us to handle
challenging problems having stringent accuracy and/or memory requirements with a
reasonable cost in CPU and turn-around time, contribute towards better
understandings of the complex physical and mathematical problems, and provide
valuable information for the design of advanced materials and on the rheological
and hydrodynamic properties of complex fluids. Another important goal of this
project is to engage graduate and undergraduate students in learning necessary
skills of computational and applied mathematics so that they can pursue a
successful career in sciences and engineering.
