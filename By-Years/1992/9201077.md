A quantitative study of the low frequency absorbate-substrate vibrations will be
undertaken using new far infrared (FIR) spectroscopic techniques developed at
Michigan State Univeristy (MSU). Both the metastable molecular precursor and the
stable atomic species will be examined. Absorbate-induced changes in the broad
band reflectivity of the substrate will be studied quantitatively using the MSU
apparatus and FIR beamline at the National Synchrotron Light Source. Line shapes
of the low frequency modes, the effect of coadsorbed alkali atoms, and atomic
adsorption on semiconductor surfaces will also be investigated.
Electroreflectance vibrational spectroscopy will be used to probe the subtle
effects of applied electrostatic fields.
