This project will enable additional students and postdocs to attend the Seymour
Sherman Memorial Conference May 15--17, 2015, at Indiana University,
Bloomington. The conference will bring together and promote young researchers at
the forefront of different subfields of probability relating to Sherman's work,
mainly, statistical physics and probability. Both of these topics are extremely
active in the mathematical community and have enjoyed many recent breakthroughs.
Therefore ideas and materials resulting from the meeting will be of interest to
scientists studying a wide range of mathematical topics.

The majority of participants are recent doctoral graduates, including eight
postdoctoral researchers and four assistant professors. Furthermore, two of the
speakers are still Ph.D. students. Some of the main impacts of this conference
will be on these young researchers, providing them a venue to showcase their
work and to interact with others in a range of career stages.
