This planning grant will pursue streamlining the Duke University. The ECE
curriculum will be updated, with particular focus on the students" early years
in the core curriculum when retention issues are the most critical. The goals of
this effort are to maintain curricular flexibility while introducing a theme-
based structure focused on major concepts and principles, and to integrate this
theme throughout the core and the technical focus areas. This theme, Integrated
Sensing and Information Processing (ISIP), reflects the active research areas of
the majority of the ECE faculty, embodies the key concepts of all critical
components of electrical and computer engineering within an easily
understandable real-world framework, and reflects the future of electrical and
computer engineering. As such, it provides a unique and innovative educational
platform on which to educate Duke students, and thus it can become a model of
ECE education for years to come
