This award supports a unified research program of modeling, analysis and
computation to better characterize and understand granular flows, in particular,
granular flows in the presence of interstitial fluid. Dry granular materials may
be characterized as a fourth state of matter. Granular media can support
stresses like a solid, but also can flow like a liquid, or, under some
conditions, like a gas. While deforming, a granular sample may dilate or
consolidate, depending on packing conditions. These features lead to a dynamics
of granular materials whose richness and scope rivals that of fluid dynamics. At
the same time, particle materials used in technological applications are
becoming smaller, and, consequently, the presence of interstitial fluid is
becoming increasingly important. This is particularly true in the use of toner
powders in xerography, where the small size of the power particles means higher
quality copies. As they move, these small light particles (about 10 micron
diameter) are strongly influenced by the surrounding gas, and particle motion is
intimately coupled to fluid motion. Furthermore, owing to van der Waals
attraction, these toner powders are cohesive, often tending to clump. The
introduction of controlled fluid flow, through fluidization and vibration, is a
common mechanism for breaking the cohesive attractions and controlling particle
motion. In a very different application, new ideas for drying and coating larger
particles (about 500 micron diameter) use rapid vertical vibration of a flat
plate to accelerate a granular mass. Because of the large acceleration,
interstitial fluid again plays an important role in the motion of particles.
Theoretical and numerical techniques will be used to characterize state
diagrams, study the stability of layers of fluidized powder under tilting, and
study the onset of bubbling and clumping.

The combined flow of particles and fluid has many other industrial applications,
such as particle flow in pressurized vessels, cat-cracking, transport by
lubrication, and heat transfer. In these applications, transport and handling of
powders presents a significant difficulty. Without a better understanding of
particle-fluid flows, products that exploit new particle technologies may not
come on-line as quickly, nor with sufficient reliability. In this regard, it is
useful to note a study by the Rand Corporation showing that, because of an
inability to accurately predict powder behavior, solids-producing manufacturing
plants performed on average at 63% of design capacity, compared to 84% for
liquids-producing plants. The analysis and computations performed during this
project, together with experiments by other academic and industrial researchers,
will help to provide the needed characterization of these flows.
