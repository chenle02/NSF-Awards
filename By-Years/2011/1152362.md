Brian Space of the University of South Florida is supported by an award from the
Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms program in the Chemistry Division to
study the structure and dynamics of both liquid and porous material interfaces.
There are two major thrusts. The first is to develop and apply theoretical
descriptions of Sum Frequency Vibrational Spectroscopy that describe interfacial
vibrational line shapes measured experimentally. Resulting spectroscopic line
shapes will be interpreted for systems that are being actively investigated in
the laboratory including aqueous charged interfaces. A primary limitation in
realizing the promise of interface specific spectroscopy is in interpreting the
spectra - what molecular dynamics produce a spectral signature. The second
thrust is to understand sorption in metal organic framework materials that show
great promise for gas separation, storage and capture. The goal is to design
materials capable of selectively capturing targeted gases by rationally
designing and improving the materials. The plan is to describe these materials
and their interactions with sorbates using highly accurate force fields that are
under development. These new energy functions will provide detailed insights
into what topology and chemical functionality is required to produce superior
functional materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The motivation for the research is
to provide a fundamental understanding of what happens at interfaces at the
atomic level. These theoretical investigations will be performed cooperatively
with leading experimental groups performing cutting edge experiments and will
include undergraduate and graduate student researchers. The resulting work will
be of value in both energy and environmental applications where understanding
interfacial and materials properties are critical. &lt;br/&gt;
