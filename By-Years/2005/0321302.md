The Intelligent Systems in Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference is an
international meeting that provides a general forum for disseminating the latest
developments in biological informatics. The multidisciplinary conferences
alternate the venue between North American and non-North American Sites. The
overall focus is on real biological problems, not simply theoretical systems.
The effort would support students and young scientists at the conference.
Biological Informatics is highly international and interdisciplinary. The
meeting will present an opportunity for the students to gain experience a
variety of venues. ISMB has a peer-reviewed tutorial program to provide exposure
on a broad range of topics to the attendees. These tutorials cover everything
from statistical analysis to information management pipelines and database
interoperability. Awardees are also required to present a poster of their work.
The selection of candidates for travel support encourages the diversity of
participation of all groups in an emerging interdisciplinary field.
