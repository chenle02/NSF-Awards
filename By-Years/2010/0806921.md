ACCESS Engineering at Montgomery College seeks to increase the number of
underrepresented students earning bachelors degrees in engineering who start
their education at a community college. Expanding on best practices and
innovations involving subject-matter exposure in high school, intensive peer and
faculty support, and strong articulation agreements and programmatic
enhancements with select 4-year engineering programs, the project expects to
provide 150 scholarships and support to two cohorts during the grant period.
Recruited from high schools and college-level math and science classes, students
are being selected on the basis of academic potential demonstrated by cognitive
as well as non-cognitive correlates of academic success for non-traditional
populations. An advisory board including academia, industry, and upper-level
students is supporting a project management team of administrators, faculty
members, and student services staff.
