SI Diamond Technology, Inc., proposes to develop a novel buried layer
interconnect technology, based on the integration of the group V Sb with the
III-V semiconductor family. The remarkable compatibility of Sb with the III-V
semiconductors in a heterostructure is a consequence of the nearly identical
atomic surface nets in the (111) planes of each crystal. The technology will
provide the first true capability to produce ultra low resistance buried
interconnects, combined with undegraded semiconductor overgrowth capability,
therefore providing a technology for three-dimensional circuit architectures and
new generation devices such as high speed metal based transistors. An
interconnect capability, based on elementary GaSb/Sb/GaSb multilayers will be
demonstrated in Phase I. Devices, including a metal-based transistor will be
produced in Phase II.
