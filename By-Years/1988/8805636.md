This research involves three parallel and conceptually related studies to
explore the bases for heterogeneity and single-cell productivity in recombinant
microbial populations. It also seeks to develop quantitative understandings of
the relationships between genetic and environmental parameters and this
heterogeneity. The research involves very recent developments in experimental
methodology for rapid single-cell measurements and will contribute to further
expansion and broader application of these extremely efficient and informative
measurements. E. coli and yeast cells will also be studied using a set of
experimental systems which have been developed recently in the biotechnology
industry. Three graduate students will conduct the proposed experiments and will
be in direct collaboration with a local biotechnology company.
