This is a computational project aimed at developing scientific software for
analysis of Hopf bifurcation. Work in three distinct areas within Hopf
bifurcation theory is proposed. 1. Location and analysis of Hopf bifurcations in
delay differential equations, and the general eigenvalue problem for these
equations. 2. Numerical algorithms for continuation of periodic solutions of
delay differential systems. 3. Unfolding of Hopf bifurcations for ordinary
differential equations. The first project includes new methods for testing
linear stability of systems of delay differential equations and will build on
the existing software for the ordinary differential equations. Adaptation of
this software to the case of delay differential equations presents a number of
difficulties, one of them being the numerical computation of eigenvalues. The
second project aims at developing computational methods for finding families of
periodic solutions corresponding to various values of the parameter in the
equation. Methods such as piecewise polynomial approximation with collocation at
Gauss- Legendre points and a variant of LU decomposition will be used to solve
the problem. The third project involves calculating higher order expansion terms
of a germ fuction by possibly combining symbolic and numerical computing. All
three projects have some analytic components and applications to specific
equations arising in various other areas of research. One of the models included
in the investigation is the Hodgkin-Huxley current-clamped nerve conduction
model. These projects are intended to yield computer codes of wider
applicability than the specific systems studied. This research falls into the
general area of computational methods for mathematical analysis of problems
described by ordinary and functional differential equations. Such equations are
often used to describe dynamical phenomena in physics, engineering and biology.
