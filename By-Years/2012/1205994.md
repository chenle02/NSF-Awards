Gravity is the least understood fundamental force of nature - there is a 16
order of magnitude disparity between the energy scale of quantum gravity and
that of the other Standard Model (electro-weak) forces. The mystery can be cast
in another way: why is gravity so much weaker than the other Standard Model
forces? This award funds research on the characteristics of gravity at sub-
millimeter distances to be conducted through the use of cryogenic micro-
cantilever beams which allow measurements of gravitational forces at sub-100
micron length scales at the atto-Newton level. The force sensitivity of these
micro-cantilever experiments is limited by mechanical dissipation. To mitigate
this mechanical loss, we will develop a novel apparatus to trap and cool
dielectric nanospheres using lasers. By optically levitating the force sensor,
an exquisite decoupling from the environment is possible.

Studies such as ours could lead to exciting new discoveries of physics beyond
the Standard Model which has recently been famously validated by the detection
of what appears to be the Higgs boson. Our research program is at the forefront
of current knowledge and enhances the scientific competency of the state of
Nevada, which is currently under-represented in terms of scientific endeavor.
Additional efforts are undertaken to bring this exciting research to the general
university population through a series of scheduled lectures for incoming
college freshmen interested in the sciences. Also, public lectures are presented
to encourage young people in Nevada to pursue career in science.
