The primary structure of Earth's interior -- the dense iron-rich metallic core
surrounded by the less dense silicate and oxide mantle -- was established during
planetary accretion, when the vast amounts of energy released by large impacts
produced widespread melting, allowing the denser metals to segregate from the
molten silicates and form the core. The purpose of this research is to quantify
the fluid mechanical processes by which the core-forming metals partially mixed
with and later segregated from the mantle-forming silicates in the early Earth.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A series of laboratory fluid dynamical experiments will be
made using silicone oils and sucrose solutions to model the molten silicates and
liquid gallium and other dense fluids to model the core-forming metals in a
magma ocean. The experiments will measure the turbulent exchange of heat and
chemical tracers between the two fluids under gravitationally stable and
unstable conditions, respectively. Important outcomes of this research are
experimentally calibrated laws for turbulent heat and chemical exchange between
liquid metals and non-metals. We intend to extrapolate our experimental results
to the conditions of the early Earth, thereby placing constraints on the initial
state of the deep interior, including the initial partitioning of heat and
chemical species between the core and the mantle.
