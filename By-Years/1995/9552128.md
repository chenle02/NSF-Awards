The Department of Chemistry, the Department of Geography, Geology, and Planning,
and the Department of Biology are collaborating on an inductively coupled
plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) system. ICP-AES is a widely used
analytical technique that provides measurement of elemental composition for many
types of sample, including metals and alloys; geological samples including
minerals, rocks, ores, and soil; water, including groundwater, seawater, and
waste water; and agricultural and biological materials. The ICP-AES system is
being used primarily for upper-level laboratory courses and undergraduate
research. Within the Department of Chemistry, ICP-AES is being employed in
instrumental analysis courses to determine alloy composition and in an
environmental chemistry laboratory course to determine the quantities of heavy
metal levels in field studies of contaminated soil. In the Department of
Geography, Geology, and Planning, ICP-AES is being used in a mineralogy course
to determine the elemental composition of minerals, in a hydrology course to
measure metal content in ground water, and in a geochemistry field study project
to measure heavy metal contaminants in the land and streams near landfills. In
the Department of Biology, ICP-AES is being used to determine metal
concentrations in plants and in freshwater ecosystems. The ICP-AES system can
also be employed in a variety of undergraduate environmental research projects
aimed at evaluating the fate of heavy metals contaminants which enter streams,
the levels and distribution of toxic metals in environmental samples, and levels
of industrial pollutants on air quality.
