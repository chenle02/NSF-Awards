The focus of this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry Program is the chemistry of transition metal cluster compounds. Such
compounds are used extensively as catalysts in the chemical and pharmaceutical
industries and are also of increasing importance as precursors for the synthesis
of ceramics, alloys and electronic materials. The reactivity of cluster
compounds of second-row and third-row transition metals will be investigated
with an emphasis on the characterization of key intermediates. The specific
kinds of reactions to be emphasized include (a) the reductive elimination or
oxidative addition of C-H bonds involving one or more metal atoms in a cluster,
(b) the formation of C-H or C-C bonds by exposed carbide ligands in trinuclear
and tetranuclear compounds, and (c) the involvement of metal cluster radicals in
hydrogen or halogen atom transfer reactions.
