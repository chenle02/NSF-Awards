PI: Ramirez, Graciela Together, Educating All in Mathematics and Science (TEAMS)
is a project of the Laredo Independent School District supported by the
community's two institutions of higher education, a professional organization
and two local businesses to restructure the district's Pre-K-12 mathematics,
science and communications program aimed at significantly increasing minority
participation in the college-bound SEM pipeline. TEAMS will restructure the
district's elementary organization, the K-12 mathematics, science and
communications curriculum, instruction and staff development to produce a
totally aligned educational system. The Laredo Independent School District is a
minority-majority urban system in South Texas. About 98% of the students are
minority, 98% Hispanic and 0.1 Asian. TEAMS will address the current low levels
of Hispanic student participation and success on the SEM pipeline. Hispanic
students, on average, score well below white students on college entrance exams,
Advanced Placement exams and are much less likely to participate and be
successful in advanced level mathematics and science courses. TEAMS is a system-
wide initiative which will involve the 23,200 students in the district's 21
elementary, four middle, three high schools, and the Magnet School for
Communications and Fine Arts. Consistent with the CPMSA goals, all the students
in the district will benefit from an enriched curriculum, upgraded teacher
skills, and student enhancement activities. This comprehensive project will
systematically reform Pre-K-1 2 mathematics, science and communications programs
to upgrade significantly the quality of education in order to increase
successful minority (especially Hispanic) participation in the SEM pipeline.
