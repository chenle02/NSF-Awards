The 2018 Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)/International Federation for
Information Processing (IFIP)/USENIX International Middleware Conference will be
held December 10-14th, 2018 in Rennes, France. The annual Middleware conference
is a major forum for the discussion of innovations and recent scientific
advances in the design, implementation, deployment, and evaluation of
distributed systems, platforms and architectures for computing, storage, and
communication. Highlights of the conference include a high quality single track
technical program, invited speakers, an industrial track, panel discussions
involving academic and industry leaders, poster and demonstration presentations,
a doctoral symposium, tutorials, and workshops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Travel
grant support for this conference will enable a broader range of students to
attend. Support will be especially provided to increase attendance of under-
represented groups in computer science. This support will help introduce
students to important technical advances in the field and give them
opportunities to interact with professionals in both industry and academia.
Taking part in the educational experiences available at Middleware, including
tutorial sessions and a doctoral symposium, will provide these students with
important learning and mentoring opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
