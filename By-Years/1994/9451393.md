9451393 Lawrance First year biology curriculum will be revised to reflect the
revolutionary changes which have taken place in biology over the past two
decades. The freshman laboratory will serve as a foundation in a sequence of
three laboratory courses bridging molecular &amp; cellular biology, organismal
biology (a merger of our present offerings in botany &amp; zoology), and ecology
&amp; evolution (course already in place). The laboratory accompanying the first
of these three courses will focus not only on introducing molecular genetics and
attendant recombinant DNA techniques to freshman, but also on integrating this
knowledge with biochemistry and cell biology to provide a solid foundation for
the many diverse processes studied in subsequent courses. The equipment will
enable introductory experiments in quantitative analysis, tissue culture &amp;
microbiology, cell architecture, protein biochemistry and enzymology, DNA
structure, gene mapping, DNA sequencing, recombinant DNA techniques,
transformation &amp; phenotypic analysis. In addition to providing students with
a solid grounding in molecular and cellular biology, the laboratory experiences
will also enhance students' abilities and opportunities for advanced study in
these areas.
