The snowball Earth hypothesis proposes that during times of especially
widespread glaciation some 600 to 750 million years ago, the surface ocean
became completely covered with ice, resulting in the mass extinction of marine
life. The occurrence of such events has important implications for the Earth's
climate system as well as for the evolution of complex multicellular organisms,
which appear in the fossil record immediately after the last evidence of these
severe ice ages. The disruption of marine ecosystems called for in the snowball
Earth hypothesis should be recorded in the carbon isotopic values of carbonate
rocks deposited during the glacial event. Appropriate successions are present in
Namibia, Australia and the North American Cordillera, to test this prediction,
and provide insight into life in a snowball ocean. Initial results suggest life
was not terribly different than before the snowball event, thus challenging the
notion that sea ice was extensive enough to disrupt marine ecosystems. The data
collected in this study will also be used to test other hypotheses proposed for
these ice ages including the recent suggestion that post glacial massive
destabilization of methane clathrates was responsible for many of the peculiar
features of this record.
