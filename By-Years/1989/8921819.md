This award supports the study of the composition and taphonomy of Silurian and
Devonian faunas Prince of Whales and Somerset Islands, Canada, together with the
sedimentology and petrology of the sediments to provide an overall view of the
paleoecology and depositional settings of the vertebrate faunas. The taphonomy
will be studied to provide information about the extent to which the faunas have
been transported and to aid understanding of the depositional environments in
which they occur. Results of the sedimentological and taphonomic studies will be
integrated to provide a reconstruction of the environments in which the
vertebrates lived. This will then be compared with what is known of other
vertebrate faunas of this age in an attempt to provide a better understanding of
the environments inhabited by early vertebrates. As many of the vertebrates
studied belong to little known groups and as this area has previously been
identified as an evolutionary center at this period it is expected that the
phylogenetic implications of this work will be extensive.
