Elham Izadi will work on questions resulting from the Hodge conjectures for
abelian varieties and curves related to them. She will use correspondences to
produce concrete families of curves in abelian varieties. For abelian varieties
with actions of imaginary quadratic fields, she develops a concrete approach
using families of curves, deformations and specializations, and Hodge bundles at
the boundaries of linear systems. She will run a research group for students on
elementary questions resulting from this project. In the past, using such
research groups, she has been successful in bringing women to the University of
Georgia.

This research is in the field of algebraic geometry, whose main objects of study
are algebraic varieties. These are classically defined as the sets of
simultaneous zeros of polynomials. Abelian varieties and curves are special
algebraic varieties with applications in many areas of mathematics including
number theory and coding theory. Classically they appear in the work of Abel,
Jacobi and Riemann among others, who developed the theory of modular forms. They
make ideal testing grounds for important conjectures in algebraic geometry such
as the Hodge conjectures. These are deep conjectures with far reaching
consequences for the study of algebraic varieties. They were originally
formulated in the form of questions by Hodge, then reformulated and corrected by
others including some of the greatest mathematicians of this century such as
Grothendieck.
