This project will explore several topics in holomorphic dynamical systems. One
topic concerns the complex structure of domains arising naturally in holomorphic
dynamical systems. It is conjectured that a stable manifold of a hyperbolic
holomorphic automorphism is biholomorphically equivalent to complex Euclidean
space. Instead of studying stable manifolds for one automorphism, one can
translate the problem to the more general setting where an attracting basin of a
sequence of automorphisms is studied. This topic is related to open problems in
several complex variables and complex geometry. Another suggested topic is to
study the polynomial automorphism groups in three or more complex variables. In
two variables the structure of the polynomial automorphism group is known
exactly, which is extremely helpful to those interested in iteration problems of
polynomial automorphisms. A recent breakthrough by Shestakov and Umirbaev in
dimension three has renewed the interest in this classical problem. In addition
to discrete dynamical systems, the principal investigator will also study
Riemann surface laminations in complex projective space. Examples of such
laminations may occur by integrating holomorphic vector fields.

Dynamical systems are used throughout the sciences to model movement and change.
Many dynamical systems suitable for rigorous analysis are generated by very
special mappings, namely, by polynomials, rational functions, or other real
analytic functions. It is natural to extend such functions to the complex plane
so that the tools of complex analysis can be used to investigate these systems.
Often the study of the corresponding complex analytic dynamical system gives
valuable information regarding the original problem. This project considers
dynamical systems in several complex variables. The problems put forth in this
proposal are motivated by and related to problems in complex analysis, complex
geometry, and affine algebraic geometry, areas that have a broad range of
interest and application both within mathematics and within other disciplines.
