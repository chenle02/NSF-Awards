This project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, uses
unenhanced Raman spectroscopy to probe the structure and reactivity of
adsorbates at solid surfaces. Both electrochemical surfaces and surfaces
characterized in ultra high vacuum will be investigated in the work to be
carried out here. Technique development to extend the sensitivity of the method
and to address the detection of nontotally symmetric vibrational modes in the
adsorbates will be pursued. In addition, the work will focus on the
characterization of the polyimide-metal interface. %%% The use of unenhanced
Raman spectroscopy to characterize the structure of adsorbed layers at solid
surfaces is the focus of this research project. Both technique development
directed toward improving the sensitivity and applicability of this method, as
well as direct studies of the polymer-metal interface make up the research to be
carried out here.
