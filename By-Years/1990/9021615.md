Myelin, a substance formed by Schwann cells in the nervous system, provides an
insulating barrier around nerve fibers. During neuronal maturation, myelin is
formed by the compaction of membrane sheets and requires the precise
organization of a number of specific proteins. The long-term goals of this
research are to understand how membranes of myelin are held together at the
molecular level. The immediate goal is to investigate the Po protein, a major
constituent of myelin that has an essential role in the maintenance of myelin
shealth compactness. The Po protein contains adhesion domains that allow Po
molecules to attach to each other. Dr. Filbin will characterize the Po-Po
interaction by determining what manipulations of the Po molecule affect increase
adhesion in transfected Chinese Hamster Ovary cells expressing Po protein.
Experiments using Po-peptides and Po antibodies will be performed to determine
the amino acid sequences essential for adhesion. Results from this study will
help elucidate how Po functions in myelin.
