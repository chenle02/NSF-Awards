Because compilers are trusted components of almost every computer system, it is
important to have trustworthy proofs of their correctness. A new method of
proving compilers correct using higher- order abstract assembly language has
been developed recently. This project is to study how to extend such proofs to
more realistic compilers. Mechanical support for the proof process will allow
the resulting proofs to be more trustworthy by supplying independent
verification of the human prover's work. Three main areas of activities in this
project include: (1) the use of mechanical theorem- provers to support compiler
correctness proofs, (2) the extension of such proofs to optimizing compilers,
and (3) a cooperative development of a verified compiler for Scheme.
