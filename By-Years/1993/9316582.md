9316582 Opdyke PI, collaborator E. Irving, and colleagues in Australia will
conduct an accurate survey of the geomagnetic Kiaman events, associated with a
time of geomagnetic polarity stability. Goals are to test the synchroneity of
the base of the Kiaman (worldwide), establish its utility as a global
stratigraphic marker, and attempt to determine the broad-scale kinematics of
Pangea's assembly. Possible implications for idea of superplumes will be
assessed.
