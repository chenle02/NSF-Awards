With ever-increasing complexities of datasets collected in diverse application
areas, statisticians are compelled to entertain a plethora of different
statistical models with varying degrees of complexity. A primary motivation for
this research is to broaden the scope of classical shrinkage approaches to model
selection and inferential goals in new statistical problems by providing
computationally efficient and statistically accurate solutions. The methodology
developed in the project has broad applications ranging from genetic and
epidemiological studies to communication networks. The principal investigator is
committed to increased interactions and collaborations with the broader
scientific community to maximize the impact of the statistical methodology
developed through this project. The deliverables of the project include user-
friendly software packages that enable users in the scientific community to
analyze structured data sets in applications relevant to the project goals.

The principal investigator proposes a class of generalized shrinkage methods for
model selection and inference in structured high-dimensional models. Operating
in a Bayesian framework, the proposed approach shrinks the parameters of an
encompassing model towards a family of sub-models. Given a class of statistical
models, the principal investigator defines an encompassing model as one which
assigns a positive prior probability to arbitrarily small neighborhoods of any
model in the specified class, with the neighborhoods defined in terms of some
general statistical divergence measure such as the Kullback-Leibler divergence.
This general formulation enlarges the scope of traditional shrinkage mechanisms
by employing shrinkage towards potentially non-nested models. Model selection is
performed by post-processing the posterior summaries from the encompassing
model. The principal investigator develops novel post-processing schemes for
variable selection and clustering, tensor decompositions, tree-structured models
and network topology identification as various applications of the general
methodology. The principal investigator formulates information theoretical
techniques for studying non-asymptotic frequentist behavior of the encompassing
posterior distributions, with specific emphasis on providing theoretical support
for the model selection procedures developed in this project.
