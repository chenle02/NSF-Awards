ABSTRACT CTS-9423309 Ann Anderson The proposal is to support a planning study
for the PI to learn in depth the technological issues in the role of heat
transfer in the human body, and to plan an experimental program in bio-heat
transfer. Important applications presently exist in cancer therapy, tissue
freezing, cryosurgery, and human thermal comfort. This grant will aid in the
shift of an established researcher into this field. It will serve as the basis
for developing a Career Advancement Award or full proposal in this field in the
future.
