People's perceptual judgments and actions depend on the pick-up of informative
energy patterns arriving at the senses. As examples, a driver's detection of
certain optical variables informs the decision of whether it is safe to pass
another car; another variable might inform the driver whether the current
braking action will stop the car in time, or if force on the brake needs to be
increased. One key function of perceptual and perceptual-motor learning is to
change the variables that the perceiver-actor attends to in making their
judgments or in controlling their actions. Perceiver-actors educate their
attention to variables that permit more accurate judgments and more effective
motor activities. A central question, however, is how perceivers improve. While
experience can make clear that judgments and actions are not accurate and that
change is needed, until recently it has been unclear how (or if) experience
actually directs the improvement. A new theory, called direct learning, lays out
how change is guided by information. The current project explores: How should
one arrange a perceptual learning situation so that learning proceeds as quickly
and accurately as possible? Can perceptual learning be shown to be indifferent
to the probabilistic value of sensory information? Does learning to detect some
information entail exploratory movements that create it? If so, can goal-
directed movement also be aimed at information-production? The findings could
have broad practical applications to attempts to train perceiver-actors to
discriminate objects (letters, faces, aircraft), events (deceptive intention,
impending collisions), and to control movements (aircraft landing, skilled
athletic or dance performance).
