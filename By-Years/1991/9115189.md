This is a proposal to develop innovative curricular materials for computer
science. The new curriculum will include the development of introductory courses
that will provide introductions to computer science in contrast to beginning
programming courses. Laboratory courses in experimental computer science will be
developed to give the students direct experience and immediate feedback in
realistic systems. Throughout, the courses will be focussed on a tight
integration with the arts, including cooperative teaching and course
development.
