This proposal requests support to obtain powerful and highly sensitive CD
spectroscopic equipment. All of the projects involve the use of recombinant DNA
technology to generate recombinant proteins (nerve growth factor),
transcarboxylase subunits, glucokinase, and the retroviral nucleocapsid protein.
We propose to determine the structure and function of these recombinant proteins
and to compare them with the corresponding properties of the native protein; it
is clear that the structural properties must be evaluated before any functional
changes can be interpreted. Such studies require the comparison of CD spectra
from native and recombinant proteins, as well as functional studies. Thus we
require access to a spectropolarimeter capable of high sensivity and low
wavelength for quantitative evaluation of small amounts of sample (frequently of
the native protein). Sensitivity is also important for the monitoring of
nucleocapsid protein binding to nucleic acid by following the amplitude of the
CD band from the nucleic acid. Currently access to the requested CD
instrumentation is unavailable on campus, because the resident
spectropolarimeter is out of date and inadequate. The requested instrument will
be available to serve any other qualified user on campus, time permitting.
