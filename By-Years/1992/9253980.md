Undergraduate scientific education may fail the novice in several ways. One may
regard all introductory students as recruits to be readied for the more advanced
work of a major; others view the education of the non-major as an obligation and
offer material that does not attend to the needs of advanced instruction. We
propose ultimately to develop an alternative-- a two-year introductory program
in the analysis of human nature from the biological to the social. This
curriculum would parallel Columbia University's reknowned program in Humanities
that has been emulated by many colleges and universities. The course work in
this new program would consist of transportable but interdependent modules that
require careful reading and analysis of primary research papers. The readings
would open opportunities for a variety of complementary projects. The current
request is to fund a pilot program to develop and test a module in psychophysics
and expand the quantitative adjuncts of a second module, molecular biology. The
modules integrate lectures, peer discussion, demonstrations, field work, and
experimentation to forge a real grasp of the methods and results of science.
Students who complete the complete range of modules will be able to continue as
science majors in biology, psychology or the social sciences. The portability of
the modules will permit their use, individually or collectively, by other
institutions, and we will plan such export to other colleges and universities.
