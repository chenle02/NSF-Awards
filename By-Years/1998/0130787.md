With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program, the Department of Chemistry at CUNY City College will acquire a
Circular Dichroism Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a
number of areas including a) studies on DNA oligomers and duplexes; b)
investigations on the characterization of isolated fragments of variants of Trx
as a proxy for the unfolded state of the protein under non-denaturing
conditions; and c) development of biomaterials for nanoscale photonic
applications.

Circular dichroism spectroscopy is an extremely useful tool in modern analytical
chemistry. It provides a very reliable and sensitive method for assigning
absolute molecular configurations. The results from these studies will have an
impact in a number of areas including materials chemistry and biochemistry.
