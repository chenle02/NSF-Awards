At the Cascadia Margin accretionary prism along the coasts of Oregon,
Washington, and British Columbia, direct measurements of fluid discharge rates
from vent sites indicate flow rates 3-6 orders of magnitude greater than those
predicted by local porosity reduction in accreting sediments. This award will
evaluate two possible solutions to this discrepancy: fluid migration from depth
along a fault zone or near surface seawater recharge due to density-driven flow.
Migration along a fault zone will be evaluated through discharge tests to be
performed on boreholes drilled into the accretionary prism by the Ocean Drilling
Program. Surface recharge will be evaluated by measuring in situ permeability
around active vents on the margin. The field portion of this project will
utilize the research submersible Alvin.
