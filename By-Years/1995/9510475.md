9510475 Greene This project has as its goal the preparation and characterization
of high quality neodymium-cerium- copper- oxygen (NCCO) single crystals and thin
films and lanthanum-strontium-copper-oxygen (LSCO) thin films. Comprehensive
physical property measurements will be carried out with the aim of providing
reliable experimental constraints on the theories for high temperature
superconductivity and anomalous normal state properties of copper oxides. A
detailed comparison of the electron- doped NCCO system and the hole-doped LSCO
system will be made in order to better understand the transition between
insulating, metallic and superconducting phases as the cerium, strontium, or
oxygen composition is changed. %%% Many copper oxide materials are
superconductors at temperatures above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen (77K)
and have potential for applications. However, an understanding of why these
materials are superconductors at such high temperatures is lacking at present.
The goal of this project is to prepare and characterize some selected copper
oxide superconductors by improved methods. This is expected to lead to a better
understanding of how these materials work, and hopefully, to insights on how to
prepare materials which are better for technological applications. ***
