0135270&lt;br/&gt;Finn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award, provided by
the Office of Polar Programs (OPP) of the National Science Foundation (NSF),
provides support for a workshop designed to explore the future aerogeophysical
needs of the Antarctic community. A new airborne geophysical facility needs to
be developed for the Antarctic Program so that key scientific questions, ranging
from crustal structure and tectonics to ice sheet structure and glacial
dynamics, can be addressed in all regions of Antarctica. Interest from the
scientific community to study remote areas of East and West Antarctica as well
as look in detail at areas around exposed rocks require consideration of
airborne platforms such as long-range aircraft (C-130's, P-3) or helicopters in
addition to the Twin Otter. New instrumentation, such as swath-mapping systems
for high-resolution (1 m) airborne mapping of topography and imaging
spectometers (AVIRIS), has recently been developed. The loss of the SOAR
facility leaves the U.S. Antarctic program without a means to remotely map sub-
ice geology as well as ice sheet characteristics, thus limiting the ability to
address fundamental questions in Antarctic geology and glaciology. A workshop
tying the NSF Antarctic program goals and science targets identified in previous
workshops to the development of new airborne geophysics capabilities could
result in a focused program to combine broad science goals with the appropriate
airborne&lt;br/&gt;geophysical tools and platforms. This award will support a
workshop that will help define the type of airborne geophysical facility
(instruments and platforms) most useful for the Antarctic&lt;br/&gt;Earth
Science and Glaciology communities to use to address important science issues in
key target areas.&lt;br/&gt;
