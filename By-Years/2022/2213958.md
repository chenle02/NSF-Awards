The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation -
Technology Translation (PFI-TT) is to increase the consistency, reliability, and
repeatability of in vitro and ex vivo cell and organ testing methods before
sending experiments to the International Space Station. The technology seeks to
simulate various partial gravity conditions, including low Earth orbit and
Martian and lunar gravities. The project provides a platform to study cells and
organs in different gravitational conditions without significant expense. The
proposed technology seeks to provide an environment to study how prolonged
immobilization (pseudo-weightlessness) affects cells and musculoskeletal organs
and may have impacts on individuals sent to space. The creation of knowledge in
this area may benefit the drug development and rehabilitation efforts focused on
revitalizing deteriorated tissues after prolonged
immobilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project seeks to prototype a
technology that can simulate partial gravity conditions while culturing three-
dimensional (3D) tissues, tissue analogs, and ex vivo organs for the study of
human diseases and physiology under relevant mechanical and chemical conditions.
Currently, commercially-available partial gravity simulators culture two-
dimensional (2D) cell monolayers. This limits scientists' ability to study human
diseases and physiology under simulated partial gravity environments. The team
will conduct operational parameter-based and cellular-based functional tests on
various culturing systems with different complexities under a number of partial
gravity conditions. The proposed technology may advance regenerative medicine,
regenerative rehabilitation, and mechanobiology fields by offering a versatile
platform to study cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions within a three
dimensional(3D) matrix.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
