The growth and decline of voluntary associations is a contemporary social issue
of great concern; yet understanding the reasons for the viability of such
associations is a classic concern of sociological theory and research. This
investigator proposes to replicate an earlier survey of voluntary associations
and their memberships with significant extensions and improvements beyond
earlier NSF funded data collection and analysis. He is viewed as one of the most
creative and skilled sociologists in the field of complex organization. The
present proposal is a rich blend of several theoretical perspectives on
organizations, including ecological models of the competition among voluntary
associations and of their growth and decline, and an attractive set of planned
statistical analyses appropriate to the kind of data to be collected. The
results should further the PIs own cumulative development of a dynamic theory of
the growth and decline of voluntary associations.
