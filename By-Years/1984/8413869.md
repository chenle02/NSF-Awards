This research project will develop and verify models for two-phase flow in
turbulently agitated liquid-liquid dispersions. The results will have direct
utility for scale-up of interphase transport processes occurring in these
systems. The proposed model incorporates dispersed phase micromixing due to
coalescence and breakage of droplets. The turbulent momentum and energy balance
equations for the continuous phase are coupled to the dispersed phase through
the friction term. Simultaneous solution of the drop population balance equation
permits calculation of the local drop size distribution, dispersed-phase
micromixing, and the frictional losses of the continuous phase for a distributed
system. The hydrodynamic and dispersed phase models are coupled to the
conservation equation to model interphase transport. Experiments are conducted
for physically equilibrated liquid-liquid dispersions in vessels over two orders
of magnitude to measure spatially dependent drop size data for comparison with
model prediction. Measurements of mean flow and turbulence are made for
comparisons with and verification of the turbulence transport model.
