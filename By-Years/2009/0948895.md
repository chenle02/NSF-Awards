Testing a neutral model for the biotic effects of sea-level
change&lt;br/&gt;Stephen Holland, University of Georgia&lt;br/&gt;EAR-
0948895&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Modern ecological studies have demonstrated
how the area of suitable habitat governs the diversity of terrestrial organisms.
In addition, the ability of species to disperse over broad distances affects
diversity not only in local areas but also over broader regions. In the marine
realm, changes in sea level can directly control the area of shallow marine
continental shelf habitats and can also affect the distribution of habitat types
on a shelf. As a result, sea-level change has the potential to drive changes in
shallow marine biodiversity. Sea-level changes may therefore be responsible for
the changes in marine biodiversity seen over geologic time scales and have the
potential to affect marine biodiversity in the near future as global sea level
rises.&lt;br/&gt;This research will test how the diversity of shallow-marine
organisms responds to sea-level change, using a combination of computer
modeling, field study of diversity changes in response to sea-level change in
the distant geologic past, and database analysis of the marine fossil record.
Field work will be conducted in Late Ordovician (~450 Ma) rocks of the eastern
United States, building on data acquired in previous NSF-funded studies. This
research will apply Hubbell?s (2001) model, which makes quantitative predictions
about the relationship of diversity to habitat area and dispersal potential. The
combination of modeling, field, and database approaches will bridge current
research in ecology and paleontology, two fields that have historically had
little interaction despite substantial overlap in their focus. Funds from this
research will support the training of undergraduate research and a graduate
student. Statistical methods developed in this research will also be distributed
as freeware for use by scientists and the general public.
