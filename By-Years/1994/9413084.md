With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program this project by Professors Gust
and Moore of Arizona State University will design, synthesize, and study
multicomponent supramolecular species that are molecular triads and pentads
consisting of porphyrins, quinones, and carotenoids which perform as light
activated switches, OR gates, or NAND gates and other logic elements. Mimicry of
biological membranes using fullerenes covalently bonded to carotenoid polyenes
and incorporated into liposomes will also be explored. Various structural
permutations and combinations of porphyrins, fullerenes, quinones, and
carotenoids into supramolecular structures will be studied. This investigation
will build complex molecular structures from molecules similar to chlorophyll
and beta carotene found in plants to create light harvesting materials with
unique properties. Applications of these supramolecular compounds to the
transport of energy and in mimicking transistors will be studied.
