A new technique is being develop for minority isotope and trace element
analysis on solid surfaces. The apparatus is simple, reliable, and relatively
inexpensive. Direct recoiling of surface atoms results in complete reduction to
elemental ions. Molecular isobaric interferences are eliminated yielding an
uncomplicated mass spectrum. Orders of magnitude improvement are expected for
the already demonstrated PPM sensitivity for U and W. We anticipate the
simultaneously based on MSRI and secondary ion mass spectrometry.
