This project supports a graduate student in cultural anthropology who is
studying the changes in women's roles and status in an agrarian region of
Colombia. Using structured community surveys, intensive life history interviews,
and participant observation in two communities, the student will investigate the
hypothesis that women are increasing in control of valued resources, which will
affect their roles and status within the household. This research is important
because economic development often leads to a decrease in the status of women,
as men control more resources which yield money incomes. By studying a regional
economy where women may be increasing their economic status, the case will
contribute to our knowledge of how women's status may be maintained and improved
while maintaining economic development.
