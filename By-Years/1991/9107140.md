This project will initiate studies on the evolution of maternal effects.
Mathematical models will be used to determine how the strengths of maternal
effects (for example, lactation in mammals) evolve. We will study how these
characters respond to selection and develop methods to measure their selection
and inheritance in natural populations. Specific approaches that will be used to
meet these two objectives will be the extention of a quantitative-genetic model
recently introduced by the principal investigator and his collaborators, and the
development of new statistical methods for estimating the parameters that appear
in the models. Results form this work will specify the conditions under which
maternal care will originate and be maintained, and empirical methods for
testing the hypotheses generated by the theory.
