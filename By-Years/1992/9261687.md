An experimental and theoretical investigation is proposed for the use of metal
foams as heat transfer devices. The proposed research will address the following
areas: (1) Experimental determination of the utilization of metal foams as heat
transfer enhancement devices. (2) Development of a theoretical model for the
effectiveness of metal foams as heat transfer enhancement devices. (3)
Optimization of the effect of metal foam porosity on the heat transfer process.
