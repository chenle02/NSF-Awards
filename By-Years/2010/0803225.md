The research proposes to integrate theories and methods from computer-supported
collaborative work and learning (CSCW and CSCL) to promote better human-computer
intercultural interactions. The research will consist of three phases: 1)
identify and categorize intercultural communication problems and determine how
they impact group outcomes; 2) apply machine learning to automatically recognize
recognize when communication problems arise (or are likely to arise); and, 3)
develop and test interventions for improving intercultural communication that
could be triggered based on the automatic analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
work has the potential to improve the design of global on-line classroom
experiences and business collaborations. At the societal level, the research
will help improve intercultural communication and the effectiveness of
intercultural teams. This work will also advance the emerging field of automatic
collaborative process analysis, which until now has focused only on English-
speaking collaborations.
