Recent research indicates that approaches employing automated learning and
training are the most promising methods for developing robust, efficient systems
for processing natural language. The goal of this research project is to develop
symbolic learning methods to aid the construction of natural language systems.
Learning algorithms are being developed for constructing systems requiring
extraction of information from natural-language documents and subsequent
natural-language querying of the resulting database. A method for learning to
parse natural language database questions into a formal query language has been
developed and is being extended to automate the acquisition of the requisite
lexicon of word meanings. Techniques are also being developed for automatically
learning rules that locate relevant pieces of data in natural-language
documents. Together, these methods can be used to automate the construction of
systems requiring natural-language information extraction and querying. Methods
for intelligently selecting informative training examples are also being
developed in order to reduce the amount of annotated training data required. The
resulting methods are being applied to automate the construction of systems that
build a database from messages posted to an electronic newsgroup and then
respond to natural language queries, resulting in more natural and effective
access to electronic information.
