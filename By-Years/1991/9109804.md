The objective of this project is to develop methods for the verification of
highly complex communications protocol required for current and future network
engineering problems. The problem of protocol verification is computationally
complex. This research focuses on ways to employ scalable parallelism to provide
the necessary computational resources. Initial research has been conducted on
parallel protocol verification algorithms based on the relational algebra. The
project will expand on the earlier work by applying two level parallelism. New
algorithms will be developed and implemented on an Intel iPSC/2 hypercube. This
project will also investigate the specification and parallel verification of
protocols written in Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP). A prototype
system will be developed.
