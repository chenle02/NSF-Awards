Funding is provided to investigate equator-to-pole temperature differences and
high-latitude seasonality during the equable climate of the Eocene Period when
both were much smaller than they are today. These circumstances are difficult to
explain within the framework of the current understanding of climate dynamics.

The researchers seek to: 1) understand what factors control the critical carbon
dioxide level at which the convective cloud feedback activates and the magnitude
of the surface warming the feedback can produce; 2) determine the ability of
convective cloud feedback to provide warming in continental interiors as well as
over ocean, consistent with Eocene fossil and proxy observations; 3) constrain
the convective cloud feedback using modern observations; and 4) investigate the
possible implications of the convective cloud feedback for future climate.

The broader impacts are primarily the support of a postdoctoral scholar and
graduate student.
