This research project seeks to develop analytical and design techniques for the
control of noise. Two experimental techniques, acoustical holography and
structural intensity, will be combined with commercially available modal
analysis, frequency response simulation (FRS) and structural dynamic
modification (SDM) software. The main goal is to develop means to confidently
predict the required structural modifications to a noise source that will cause
desired reductions in acoustic field responses. Structural modifications to be
considered are the addition of damping materials and stiffeners to a vibrating
system. This research is expected to lead to improved diagnostic techniques and
design knowledge in noise control engineering***//
