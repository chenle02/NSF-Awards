ABSTRACT DMS - 0204985 PI: Borthwick&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal
investigator will study spectral geometry in three basic contexts.
&lt;br/&gt;For smooth infinite-volume hyperbolic manifolds (without cusps), he
will study &lt;br/&gt;the question of finiteness of classes of surfaces with the
same resonance set,&lt;br/&gt;refine techniques involving determinants that he
and his co-authors &lt;br/&gt;have already developed, and study resonances as
functions of the deformation&lt;br/&gt;space of a hyperbolic structure. For the
more general class of asymptotically&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic manifolds, the main
goal is to analyze the determinants and relative&lt;br/&gt;determinants and use
them to derive geometric constraints from resonance data.&lt;br/&gt;The
techniques developed will be applied to define determinants and
obtain&lt;br/&gt;constraints for exterior domains in two and three dimensions as
well.&lt;br/&gt;A final goal is to understand the basic spectral theory of a
broader &lt;br/&gt;class of negatively curved surfaces. Here the objectives are
to determine &lt;br/&gt;the essential spectrum and prove a limiting absorption
principle which will &lt;br/&gt;characterize the essential spectrum and lead
towards the establishment of a &lt;br/&gt;scattering
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geometric spectral theory lies at the interface of
the fields of differential &lt;br/&gt;geometry and mathematical physics. In
physical theories such as quantum &lt;br/&gt;mechanics or wave propagation, one
can draw a natural distinction&lt;br/&gt;between geometric properties of a
system, meaning the underlying structure,&lt;br/&gt;and analytic properties,
which reflect how the physics of the system behaves.&lt;br/&gt;Analytic
properties, of which the spectrum is a prime example,&lt;br/&gt;are generally
the aspects of a system most readily determined&lt;br/&gt;by experiment (for
example, component colors of light emitted by stars, or&lt;br/&gt;frequency
spikes in a radar scan). In many physical applications, &lt;br/&gt;the basic
goal is to derive information about the geometric structure from the
&lt;br/&gt;spectral data. The PI will pursue this goal in settings for which one
already &lt;br/&gt;has good sources of conjectures and mathematical tools.
&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the spectral theory of these cases&lt;br/&gt;will
provide new geometric invariants of interest in differential
geometry,&lt;br/&gt;while developing intuition for problems of a more applied
nature.&lt;br/&gt;
