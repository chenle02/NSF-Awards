Abstract 9630635 Martin The goal of this research is to gain a detailed
understanding of pathogen recognition and signal transduction events involved in
plant disease resistance. Two experimental systems in tomato are being studied,
resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (causative agent of bacterial
speck disease) conferred by the Pto gene and sensitivity to the fenthion
insecticide conferred by the Fen gene. The Pto and Fen genes are members of a
small gene family encoding closely related serine/threonine protein kinases. In
the proposed research several genes that have been shown to encode proteins that
physically interact with the Pto kinase will be characterized. These proteins
will be examined using biochemical techniques and transgenic approaches. In
addition, genes will be identified which are regulated by the Pto and Fen
kinases, and they will used to examine the pathways whereby plants defend
themselves from pathogens. These studies will aid in our understanding of the
molecular basis of recognition and signal transduction events involved in plant
defense against pathogens. ***
