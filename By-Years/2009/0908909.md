AST-0908909&lt;br/&gt;Mutel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The RESUN (Radio EVLA Search
for UHE Neutrinos) project is designed to search for ultra-high energy (UHE)
cosmic neutrinos by detecting short-duration Cerenkov radio bursts from the
Moon. The observational program uses the NSF's Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA)
radio telescope in New Mexico, with a high-speed data acquisition and pulse
coincidence detection system using specialized hardware developed at the Center
for Astronomical Signal Processing and Electronics Research laboratory.
Understanding the physics of energetic extragalactic sources is one of the most
important and intensely studied goals in current astrophysics. A large number of
experiments, currently operating or being planned, will search for ultra-high
energy neutrinos, using both the Moon and the Antarctic ice shelf as targets.
The RESUN project probes an energy range above the terrestrial-target
experiments and will provide at least a new upper limit on the neutrino flux
there, if not an actual detection. Any detection would be very exciting and
possibly transformative: even a limit will constrain certain models of the decay
of super-massive particles and of neutrino production by topological defects. A
pilot project has already demonstrated the viability of this
search.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The search for UHE neutrinos spans several
disciplines, including observational radio astronomy, and theoretical and high-
energy astrophysics. There is a definite benefit to training graduate and
undergraduate students in state of the art data acquisition instrumentation as
well as software and analysis techniques appropriate to current and planned
astronomical facilities.
