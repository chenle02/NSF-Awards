The work of three investigators is involved in this project. L. R. Taylor plans
to study induction theory (and applications to the algebraic K and L theory of
finite groups), certain cohomological questions about low-dimensional manifolds,
the modules over the symmetric group given by the cohomology of configurations
spaces, and the theory of approximate fibrations. W. G. Dwyer will study the
classification of finite loop spaces, realization problems involving Pi-algebras
and unstable algebras over the Steenrod algebra, homotopical questions related
to the Quillen-Lichtenbaum conjecture, and some conceptual properties of the
cotangent complex. E. B. Williams intends to study a general framework for
computing the homotopy type of spaces of homeomorphisms and diffeomorphisms of
manifolds, and various related questions about the linear and Hermitian K-theory
of discrete rings. The details of these three parts vary, but all are concerned
either with reducing geometric information to a subject for calculation or to
perfecting one of the principal algebraic tools used for this purpose. The
nature of the geometric information involved is the crux of the difficulty.
While questions about lengths, areas, angles, volumes, and so forth virtually
cry out to be reduced to calculations, it is far different with what are known
as topological properties of geometric objects. These are properties such as
connectedness (being all in one piece), knottedness, having no holes, and so
forth. All systematic study of such properties, for example, how to tell whether
two geometric objects really differ in respect to one of these properties or are
only superficially different, or how to classify the variety of differences that
can occur, all these have only truly been comprehended and mastered when they
have been reduced to matters of calculation.
