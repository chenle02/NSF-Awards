Murray 9302496 The PIs will use faunal, geochemical and stable-isotopic data to
reconstruct climatic changes in the Indian Ocean between 12 and 3.5 Ma utilizing
ODP core material. The study will lead to delineation of surface temperature
gradients, productivity, and the signature of biogenic sedimentation. It will
also provide a time series of monsoonal upwellinmg in the northwestern Indian
Ocean that may be associated with the uplift of the Himalayas and the Tibetan
Plateau.
