Non-intrusive Rayleigh scattering laser anemometry and a modular flow test
facility are used systematically to explore turbulent transport and entrainment
in a modular flow fixture that builds sequentially in geometrical complexity
from a simple free jet to a complex flow reactor. Secondary goals address the
evaluation of fine-wire thermocouple performance and the development of
appropriate methods to obtain complete two-dimensional field information from
sparse, point measurements. In the proposed work, the test matrix will be
concluded with a study of the central jet surrounded by a swirling coannular
jet, up to and including the complex flow model reactor. The program proposed is
directed to an enhanced understanding of turbulent mixing in recirculating
combusting flows, dominated by a high degree of swirl. The practical
significance of the proposed research is that the flows selected for study are
found in the majority of continuous combustion systems, such as gas turbine
combustors, boilers, furnaces, and incinerators. The understanding of the
turbulent mixing associated with these flows is timely in view of the growing
restrictions in operation such as fuel consumption, emissions, noise, and fuel
quality.
