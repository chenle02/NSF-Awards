ABSTRACT

The PI will investigate how systematic phenomena in the homotopy groups of
spheres is reflected in arithmetic phenomena occurring in modular and
automorphic forms. The stable homotopy groups exhibit chromatic layers of
periodic behavior. The PI will continue his work studying how the moduli space
of elliptic curves, and the theory of modular forms, detects the second
chromatic layer. The PI, with his collaborators, will investigate
generalizations that relate the higher chromatic layers to Shimura varieties,
and their automorphic forms. The unstable homotopy groups of spheres will be
investigated within a similar algebro-geometric framework using the Goodwillie
tower. The PI will study the relationships between ramification phenomena in
number theory and unstable phenomena in homotopy theory that arise.

The PI's work studies higher dimensional geometry using the theory of numbers.
The spaces of elliptic curves and their generalizations that the PI is studying
are central objects in number theory, playing a pivotal role both in Wiles'
proof of Fermat's last theorem and in Harris and Taylor's proof of the local
Langlands correspondence. Geometry in higher dimensions occurs in economics and
physics. The study of number theory gives rise to the encryption systems that
allow for the secure transmission of data, such as those used by secure web
pages. The links between the seemingly disparate fields of geometry and number
theory that the PI proposes to investigate will encourage dialog that breeds new
science, produce problems suitable for engaging students in research activities,
and stir public interest in the mathematical sciences.
