&lt;br/&gt;NEDG: MIMO Links in Wireless Edge Networks: Cross-Layer Protocol
Design&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wireless
networking has gained significant acceptance in recent years. In particular,
wireless local area networks (LANs) and mesh networks are increasingly being
deployed in the unlicensed bands of the spectrum. While the density of wireless
devices is likely to increase, the spectrum available for the devices remains
limited. Therefore, techniques to improve performance of wireless networks are
of great interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project will
explore the use of multi-antenna technology in wireless networks. A particular
focus will be on the design and evaluation of cross-layer protocols for multi-
input multi-output (MIMO) channel access. This project will address the
fundamental challenges of managing interference and intelligent use of MIMO
technology in wireless edge networks. The topics to be covered include design of
cross-layer protocols for MIMO-based wireless networks, development of accurate
simulation models for MIMO channels, and experimental evaluation of a selected
subset of protocols. Through these research activities, the project will
contribute to enhancing the performance of wireless
networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project has the potential
for broad and long-range impact to both the basic theory and practical methods
and protocols for wireless networks that exploit MIMO technology. The blend of
theoretical and experimental investigations in this project provides a unique
and invaluable opportunity for training of future networking researchers and
engineers. Selected results from this project will also be incorporated into
graduate and undergraduate courses on wireless communications and
networking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
