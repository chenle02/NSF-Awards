This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project examines a new
material, indium-thallium-phosphide (InTlP), which has been suggested as an
alternative to mercury-cadmium-telluride (HgCdTe) for long wavelength infrared
(8 to 12 micrometers) detectors for infrared focal plane arrays applications.
Theoretical calculations suggest that addition of Tl to InP can reduce the
bandgap of InP from 1.35 eV (0.9 micrometers) to less than 0 to 0.1 eV, i.e.,
around 8 to 12 micrometers. Though these theoretical predictions have yet to be
verified (since InTlP has not been made by any growth technique), preliminary
results for InTlSb have demonstrated that InTlSb films can be grown by
metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) and that addition of Tl to InSb
can reduce the bandgap to 0.15 eV (8 micrometers). InTIP is expected to have
properties superior to InTlSb, including complete solid solubility over the
entire alloy phase diagram, a near lattice-match to InP, and the potential for
integration of detector arrays and InP read-out circuitry. Further, InTlP offers
many potential advantages over HgCdTe and III-V quantum well infrared photo-
detectors (QWIPs); it has higher mechanical strength, lower substrate cost, and
better compositional uniformity than HgCdTe. In comparison to QWlPs, it offers
normal incidence detection and higher quantum efficiency. The objective of Phase
I is to demonstrate InTlP photoconductive detectors operating at two different
wavelengths beyond 2 micrometers(less than .5 eV). High performance detectors
based on Tl-based alloys will provide a low-cost replacement for HgCdTe infrared
focal plane arrays. In addition to yielding a new class of more economical IR
detectors, this material system can be useful for lasers operating in the mid-
wavelength infrared (MWIR) and long-wavelength infrared (LWIR) regions, and for
industrial and biomedical thermography.
