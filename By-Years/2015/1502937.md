The Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM) Program is a broad-based, community-
initiated research program on the physics of the Earth's magnetosphere and the
coupling of the magnetosphere to the atmosphere and to the solar wind. The work
of GEM is accomplished in a series of campaigns and focus groups that solve
specific problems leading to the construction of a global Geospace General
Circulation Model (GGCM) with predictive capability. This project will
contribute essential results to this goal pertaining to understanding a
fundamental and mysterious mode of magnetic storms termed Sawtooth oscillations.
Particularly, the project will investigate the potential role that heavy Oxygen
ions escaping from the upper atmosphere may play in this. In addition, the
project will support a graduate student participating in the research effort at
University of New Hampshire. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific goal of this
investigation is to perform a superposed epoch analysis of ion outflow observed
by the FAST spacecraft on the nightside during sawtooth events. The study will
utilize a publicized database of 122 sawtooth events, comprising nearly 500
individual oscillations, which occurred during the FAST era (October 1996 to
April 2009). About two thirds of these have coverage of the nightside aurora.
This constitutes a sufficiently large set of events to allow for a comparison
between the two main solar-wind drivers of Sawtooth events (SIR-driven and ICME-
driven events, respectively) and to be able to compare these with the outflow
from non-sawtooth events. Specifically, the superposed epoch analysis of the
FAST data will be used to determine whether the observed outflow increases after
each "tooth," driving the next tooth.
