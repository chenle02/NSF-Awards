One of the major goals of this project is to enhance the science education of
students enrolled in General Psychology through extensive experience with
contemporary and methodologically rigorous research in the discipline. The
Denison faculty is developing a microcomputer-based laboratory which will
provide students with first-hand experience in using the methodological
procedures necessary for conducting research in the major content domains of
psychology. A second major goal is to enhance students' ability to comprehend
human functioning from an integrated biological/behavioral perspective. The
configuration of equipment modules (microcomputer, interface, and physiological
instrumentation) enable sophisticated research for measuring cognitive and
behavioral variables. The use of this equipment provides students with
theoretical and methodological knowledge of human functioning from a bio-
behavioral perspective. The Denison faculty is making a significant contribution
to psychology education by returning to a vigorous experiment-centered freshman
laboratory.
