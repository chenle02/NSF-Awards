9600960 Dawson This award renews support of a collection of deer mice
(Peromyscus) used by government and academic researchers across the US. The
collection includes 6 species and about 30 mutants and inbred lines. Peromyscus
is important in a diverse set of areas of biological research, including
ecology, animal behavior, and population biology. Because the deer mouse is the
usual host for the hantavirus in nature, the collection has been of significant
use for research into human transmission of the virus since the Four Corners
outbreak in 1993. The virus has become common in wild populations of Peromyscus,
and use of the collection has increased as this threat to human health posed by
the use of wild-caught animals has become appreciated.
