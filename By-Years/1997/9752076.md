The Northwest Indian College, in collaboration with three other post secondary
institutes within the Pacific Northwest region, is carrying out the development,
testing, and transfer of an advanced technical education program in Native
American Environmental Technology. This two year AAS degree program meets a
critical need among area Tribes to increase the number of Native Americans
working within tribal natural resource and environmental management programs.
Northwest Indian College has brought together for this project those post
secondary institutes within the region that have a track record and commitment
of working effectively to meet the postsecondary education needs of Native
American students and tribal communities. These institutions include the
Evergreen State College, and Huxley College and Fairhaven College, both at
Western Washington University. In addition, Mesa State College and Navajo
Community College are providing assistance through their ATE grant which also
prevents duplication. The project model consists of curricula development, pilot
testing student internships, and articulation agreements with four year
institutes. Program methods have been developed specifically to support Native
American learning styles, and the need for development of transferable technical
skills that can lead to meaningful career employment, in the area of
environmental science and management. These methods include: hands-on learning;
emphasis on speaking and writing skills; group projects; multi-disciplinary
courses; and an internship program. The College is hosting a symposium in year
three to formally present the project findings and work products. This symposium
is open to tribal colleges and other post secondary institutes and tribal
organizations.
