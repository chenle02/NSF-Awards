This Research Coordination Network will employ a series of workshops, seminars
and other capacity-building activities to build out a "lightweight" (i.e.,
minimally burdensome or constraining, widely accessible and appreciated) network
organization whose participants seek to advance the design, adoption and impact
of digital technologies through sociotechnical research. A key product
associated with the network will be a cyberinfrastructure that enables deposit
and retrieval of useful assets (e.g., ideas, documents, data) for studying,
designing and managing sociotechnical systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
community-building and research-initiating goals of the RCN are to be achieved
through at least 33 workshops across five years of the effort. The workshops
will engage scholars and practitioners from a wide range of fields and
professional societies that address sociotechnical issues in knowledge sharing.
The workshop conversations will enable diffusion of state-of-the-art findings
and tools across disciplines and domains. They will also encourage communities
of researchers to collaborate across academic silos and to address questions
related to pressing problems in sociotechnical practice. Thus, broader impacts
will include both a shared research cyberinfrastructure and enhanced evidence
bases for improved sociotechnical practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding
how technologically mediated work is best accomplished, which is the focus of
this RCN, is of great importance both to the scientific community and to
nurturing a national innovation ecosystem that will enhance national
competitiveness and security. Scholarly research in this domain is currently
fragmented so could benefit greatly from integration and from diffusion of
knowledge, techniques and tools across disciplinary boundaries.
