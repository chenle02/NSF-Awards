This project will develop computational and manufacturing techniques that will
allow molecules to be mass produced in moderate volumes by molding processes.
This research will develop high performance computing algorithms to determine
the optimal part orientation and parting surface location for the easiest
production. It will refine the parameters in the algorithms on actual molecule
production tests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The molding of these complex molecules,
however, goes beyond what is typically undertaken in engineering manufacturing,
because these molecules are highly concave. They do not lend themselves well to
standard injection and separation techniques. Mold material can get into and
harden in some very deep places, and will thus serve as a latch that keeps the
outside of the mold from being separated. To make this work correctly, we need
to develop some semiautomatic algorithms and tricks.&lt;br/&gt;
