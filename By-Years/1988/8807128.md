Recent advances in atmospheric observing technology promise to greatly increase
in the number and variety of asynoptic observations that are available for
numerical weather prediction. These observations will be available at both
spatial and temporal resolutions that are much higher than present data. Current
operational data assimilation systems cannot fully utilize the information in
these high resolution data. Thus, the development of techniques to extract
maximum information from these new and diverse data sources and to produce the
initial fields required for numerical models presents a major challenge to the
atmospheric sciences community. Such developments also will have an important
impact on the quality of future research data sets. The goal of this research is
to develop for a regional model a four-dimensional data assimilation system
based on the Newtonian relaxation continuous assimilation or "nudging"
technique. The assimilation package will be developed for National
Meteorological Center's (NMC) Nested Grid Model (NGM). In the course of his
research, the principal investigator will examine adjustment processes within
the model, comparing analyses obtained via the nudging technique with those
produced with the current operational data assimilation system. The GALE
(Genesis of Atlantic Lows Experiment) data set represents an excellent set of
observations for this purpose. The data set contains observations at high
spatial and temporal resolution from observing systems similar to those that
will be used operationally in the near future. This project is part of a joint
program in basic research related to numerical weather prediction supported by
NMC (NOAA) and NSF.
