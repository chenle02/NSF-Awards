This project focuses upon lessons that can be learned from the Loma Prieta
Earthquake of October 17, 1989. The project is a one-year comparative study of
disaster impacts and initial community recovery activities in Charleston County,
South Carolina and Santa Cruz County, California. These two counties, which are
roughly comparable in population size, both recently sustained extensive damage
in two major natural disasters, Hurricane Hugo (Charleston) and the Loma Prieta
earthquake (Santa Cruz). The objectives of the study are to (1) document
disaster impacts and early recovery issues and activities in the two
communities; (2) develop a set of socio-economic indicators that can be used to
chart disaster recovery, and begin collecting data on those indicators; and (3)
conduct comparative analyses and develop hypotheses concerning factors that
explain outcomes in the recovery period. Data for the study will come from
archives, documents, community statistics, and other records, as well as from
in- depth interviews with representatives of key organizations in both
communities.
