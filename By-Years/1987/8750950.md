The objective of this project is to set up an exemplary automated test and
measurement laboratory for undergraduate education. It will include twelve
workstations using IBM PC/AT level microcomputers controlling an array of
Hewlett-Packard test instrumentation. Upon completion of this laboratory, all
manual test and measurement instruments in the curriculum will be replaced by
computer-controlled, multi-point instrumentation.
