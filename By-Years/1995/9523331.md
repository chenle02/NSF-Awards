This investigation deals with theory and data analysis related to kinetic
effects on magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) phenomena in the magnetosphere. When MHD
activity is strongly affected by particle kinetic effects such as finite gyro-
radius effects, trapped particle effects and wave-particle resonance effects,
traditional MHD approaches break down. The kinetic-MHD approach to be applied in
this study will provide a theoretical and observational basis for understanding
kinetic effects on MHD phenomena such as Pc 4-5 magneitic pulsations and
magnetospheric substorms. Formulae for computing plasma instability parameters
from the particle data will be obtained from this investigation. By comparing
theoretical calculations with the plasma stability paramters obtained from
space-based instruments, the investigators will be able to study the
relationship between observed plasma properties and MHD activity in the space
environment. If the theoretical kinetic-MHD stability analysis is verfied, one
can perform a real-time numerical stability analysis based on in situ satellite
particle and magnetic field data and realistic magnetospheric equilibria. Such
an excerise could lead to advanced warning f the onset of violent MHD activity
and the associated high energy particle flux that creates adverse space weather
conditions.
