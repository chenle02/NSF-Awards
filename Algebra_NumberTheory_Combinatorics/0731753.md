The PI and Co-PIs propose to organize a joint conference of two Workshops: the
Workshop on Algorithms and Models for the Web-Graph (WAW 2007) and the Workshop
on Internet & Network Economics (WINE 2007) at San Diego December 11-14, 2007.
The main theme of WINE focuses on the algorithmic game theory including various
aspects of computational complexity and applications such as auctions, pricing,
collaboration, competition, security and other Internet related economical
issues in general. In the past three years, there has been a great deal of
development in understanding the computational complexity of Nash equilibrium
and large scale economical games. WINE workshops have played a vital role in
this and have been an impetus to the developments of algorithmic game theory and
numerous applications.

WAW focuses on mathematical modeling and analysis of the dynamics of the
webgraph and related large complex social networks as well as algorithmic
applications in declustering, information retrieval and data mining. The series
of WAW workshops have contributed to the rapid developments on the graph-
theoretical and algorithmic aspects of the new science of networks.
