AST-0407351&lt;br/&gt;Ma&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate the
formation and evolution of dark matter halos and supermassive black holes. It
advances a cosmological kinetic theory for the formation and relaxation of dark
matter halos in hierarchical models of structure formation based on cold dark
matter. Substructure and mergers are followed in a statistical way. The theory
will be developed into the fully nonlinear regime and compared to N-body
simulations, leading to a deeper understanding of the physics of dark matter
dynamics. Work will focus on important, timely issues of galactic structure with
a level of detail that is both tractable and essential for advancing the
understanding of the role of dark matter in galaxy formation.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both of the main investigators have won awards for
teaching, and this research will involve both high school students and
undergraduates. An intensive five-week summer research institute focuses the
attention of high school participants. Any developed computer codes will be made
publicly available.&lt;br/&gt;
