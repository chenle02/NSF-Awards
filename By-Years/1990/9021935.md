A Lambda Physik LPX 105i CC excimer gas laser is to be purchased to improve the
ability to accurately measure the high temperature reaction kinetics of
chlorinated hydrocarbon oxidation and pyrolysis. The laser will be initially
incorporated into an existing laser photolysis/laser-induced fluorescence
elementary kinetics measurement apparatus. In addition to providing a clean
source of hydroxyl radicals, this pump laser will be used to vary photolysis
energy densities over wide ranges, allowing a more thorough evaluation of
secondary reactions. The acquisition of high temperature rate data and
mechanistic information will strongly enhance the currently sparse data base for
chemical kinetic modelling of combustion processes involving chlorinated
hydrocarbons. This information is required in order to understand, predict, and
control the formation of toxic emissions from the thermal treatment of wastes
and other industrial processes.
