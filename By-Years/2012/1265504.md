In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Michael J. Krische of the Department of Chemistry and
Biochemistry at the University of Texas at Austin will explore new strategies
for the formation of C-C bonds via hydroaminoalkylation. In such processes,
hydrogen exchange between amines and pi-unsaturated reactants generates
transient imine-organometal pairs that combine to form products of imine
addition in the absence of stoichiometric byproducts. Unlike classical imine
additions, direct amine-unsaturated C-C couplings (a) bypass discrete
preparation of stoichiometric main-group organometallics and, consequently,
circumvent generation of molar quantities of metallic waste, and (b) avoid
discrete imine formation to enhance step-economy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These
studies could offer more efficient, byproduct-free routes to important commodity
chemicals (plastics, foams, pharmaceutical and agrochemicals) through the direct
C-C coupling of basic chemical feedstocks. Byproduct-free catalytic methods for
chemical manufacturing eliminate chemical waste at the source and, hence, are
environmentally benign. In addition, this project will provide excellent
training of students, from pre-undergraduate to post-doctoral, including those
from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences.
