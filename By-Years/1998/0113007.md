The objective of this project is to capture physical properties of real world
phenomenon by analyzing photographs and video. The problem of capturing motion
of objects has emerged as a major research area in the fields of computer vision
and computer graphics with a wide range of possible applications. This project
will attempt to devise new computer vision techniques for capturing and modeling
the dynamics and physical characteristics of a number of differing objects in
different contexts. If successful, the new techniques will enable more accurate
3D motion estimation from a single video stream and other limited sensor data.
Finally, the project will explore potentially valuable application areas for
these research products.
