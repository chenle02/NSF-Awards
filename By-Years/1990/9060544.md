This proposal is interested in addressing the chemical aspects of microporous
membranes in the synthesis, purification, and structural characterization of
peptides. The following specific goals are to be accomplished: - Identify
synthetic membranes that are stable enough to withstand repeated synthetic
manipulations in organic and/or aqueous solvents. - Develop effective linkages
with suitable spacers to preserve the unique advantages of the microporous
membrance structure while improving the ease of ligand attachment and subsequent
synthetic steps. - Determine the optimum solvent systems for futher synthetic
elaborations. - Investigate the compatibility of newly developed techniques for
peptide cleavage resins to assess their applicability to removal of synthesized
peptide from the membrane.
