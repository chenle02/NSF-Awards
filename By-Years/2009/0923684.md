Unlike sports, or spelling, or even the arts, the general public has little
awareness of the process whereby the most mathematically talented high school
students in the United States are discovered and nurtured through math
competitions. Although millions of students each year take mathematics exams and
hundreds of thousands enter math competitions, the public has little
understanding of the passion, commitment, determination, talent, parental
involvement and coaching it takes to advance to the most difficult math
competitions. The MAA documentary Hard Problems: The Road to the World's
Toughest Math Contest tells the stories of the six high school students who
represented the United States in the 2006 International Mathematical Olympiad
(IMO) Competition in Ljubljana, Slovenia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With funding
from the National Science Foundation, the MAA will make the film available to
the public through syndication by American Public Television. Viewers will
discover that the exceptional young people who represent the U.S. at the IMO
team are talented and well-rounded, and are outstanding ambassadors for our
country. After watching this film, one can easily envision them as being team
leaders when they take their place in the academic/research community, in the
work force, and even starting their own successful companies, as many past
participants have.
