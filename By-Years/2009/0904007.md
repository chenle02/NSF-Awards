This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigator (PI) will
investigate the anomalous diffusion of energetic charged particles in fusion,
space, and astrophysical plasmas using a combination of theory, simulations, and
observations. He intends to focus on the role of non-classical (non-Gaussian)
phenomena in anomalous diffusion in the collisionless solar wind, specifically
the magnetic field-line random walk of energetic charged particles in the solar
wind. In this investigation, the PI will develop and test theories for the non-
classical magnetic field-line random walk and energetic charged particle
diffusive transport, including a numerical kinetic transport model to solve the
standard cosmic ray equation (modified to include fractional derivative terms
for non-classical anomalous diffusion).&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The PI will
recruit and supervise a graduate student to work on a Ph.D. thesis as part of
this project, and he will encourage minority graduate students to apply. The PI
plans to include this graduate student as an integral participant in the
analysis of non-Gaussian anomalous transport of energetic charged particles at
collisionless shocks. In this way, the project will link research and education
and contribute to the training of the next generation of space plasma
physicists.
