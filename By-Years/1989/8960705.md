Chiral pesticides generally exhibit enantioselective action, where only one
enantiomer is active and exhibits the desired biological activity. Despite
mounting evidence that chiral pesticides should optimally be developed and
marketed as single enantiomers, more than 90% of synthetic chiral pesticides are
marketed as racemic mixtures. The principal reason for this is the high cost and
technical difficulty of preparing chiral pesticides. Modern synthetic pyrethroid
insecticides are among the most potent and selective pesticides known.
a-Cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol, a cyanohydrin produced by the reaction of
hydrogen cyanide and 3-phenoxybenzaldehyde, is chiral and is a major component
of several commercially important pesticides. This project is directed at
testing the feasibility of a novel membrane-based enzyme-reactor system for the
production of enantiomerically pure (S)-a-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol. The
proposed system is readily amendable to scaleup and promises to produce
enantiomerically pure (S)-a-cyano-3- phenoxybenzyl alcohol at low cost. The
technical objectives of the Phase I project are 1) establish a knowledge base on
the membrane-based process and the enzyme-catalyzed reaction, 2) design and
construct a laboratory-scale system on the basis of the knowledge base, and 3)
measure the system's performance. The proposed process is applicable to the
synthesis of a wide range of valuable cyanohydrin enantiomers, which could be
used as intermediates for the preparation of chiral a-amino alcohols, a-hydroxy
acids, imidazoles, and heterocycles.
