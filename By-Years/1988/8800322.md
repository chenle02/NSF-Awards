This work seeks to document the existence of the laminar flame speed at
constant pressure and the conditions under which its existence is possible for a
range of common fuels. The method of approach involves detailed velocity and
temperature measurements at the tip and sides of a laminar premixed bunsen
flame. Comparison of the flame speeds in these two regions, under proper
conditions, yields the laminar flame speed at constant pressure. Velocity
measurements will be accomplished by use of a particle streak technique while
temperature measurements, obtained by fine thermocouples, will be supported by
either sodium line reversal, Rayleigh scattering or a laser-induced fluorescence
technique. The motivation for this project is primarily that there may exist a
fundamental laminar flame propagation phenomenon that has been largely
overlooked and that the resulting flame speed may help to explain in part why
the turbulent flame speed is so much larger than the laminar flame speed. Such
fundamental observations may lead to a reformulation of some of the basic
kinetic rates presently used throughout predictive combustion models.
