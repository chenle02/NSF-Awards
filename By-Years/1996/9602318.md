Funding from the ARI Program will provide Utah State University, with the
opportunity to improve the Atmospheric Surface Layer Turbulence and
Environmental Science Test (SLTEST) facility. This unique facility offers
researchers a permanent on-site infrastructure to accommodate multidisciplinary
research and sustained field trials in the disciplines of engineering,
meteorology, and environmental science. Research conducted at the facility
include critical areas such as: surface layer micrometeorology, engineering
studies associated with high Reynolds number turbulent boundary layers,
environmental testing, pollutant dispersion, and risk assessment investigations.
Funds will be used to install permanent power, on-site microwave communications,
and fixed equipment. Collaborative efforts by scientists from various
disciplines in academia, industry, and government will be enhanced by the
project. The infrastructure upgrade will provide the permanent capability to
explore surface layer phenomena and its relation to mixed layer dynamics in
greater detail than at any existing facility.
