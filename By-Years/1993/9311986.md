9311986 Brown Ohio State University requests support from NSF for the connection
of the following schools: Kent State - East Liverpool Campus and Lakeland
Community College to the Ohio Academic Resources Network (OARnet) which is the
NSF mid-level network that serves the State of Ohio. A primary goal of OARnet is
to facilitate collaborative projects and sharing of resources between
institutions, including those outside the state. OARnet will provide operations
management and information services and it will give the six universities a 56
thousand bit per second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million
bits per second) National Backbone network. The universities need greater
functionality and network speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries,
and make file transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail
system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the link. This is also a
unique opportunity for the schools to explore innovative educational resources.
