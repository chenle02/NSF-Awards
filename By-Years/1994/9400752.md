meeting between American and Japanese bridge engineers, which is conducted under
the auspices of the U.S.-Japan Panel of Wind and Seismic Effects of the UJNR
program. this 1994 meeting includes a two-day workshop with technical
presentations of the participants related to recent advances of bridge
engineering and a study tour of bridge structures and orginizations. The
workshop will be held at Lake Tahoe, Nevada in May 1994, and will be preceded by
a one-day meeting between American and Japanese researchers to investigate the
possibilities for further cooperative U.S.-Japan research on bridge engineering
issues. ***
