The primary objective of this U.S.-Poland cooperative research project between
Dr. Anna Podhajska of The University of Gdansk and her counterpart, Dr. Waclaw
Szybalski of the University of Wisconsin, is to study class IIS restriction
enzymes with the intent of determining their physico-chemical properties and
mode of action. Results may be useful in efforts to detect point mutations in
complex genomes. Funds for the project are awarded through the Maria Sklodowska-
Curie Joint Fund II, Warsaw, in accordance with established guidelines.
