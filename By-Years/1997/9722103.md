9722103 Goulden This is a 12-month award proposed by Dr. Clyde Goulden, Academy
of Natural Science of Philadelphia. This proposal requests funds for purchasing
a wireless communication (telephone) system for NSF supported biodiversity field
studies in Mongolia. Each summer a group of twenty research scientists and
students from the United States, Mongolia, Russia and Japan converge on Lake
Hovsgol in northern Mongolia to study the biology and ecology of the lake and to
develop this area for use as an international long-term ecological research
site. This is an outgrowth of NSF supported project to study the systematic and
ecology of Lake Hovsgol. Mongolia is a vast country without telephone and
communication infrastructure. There is an urgent need for a wireless
communication system for the research group at Hovsgol Lake. This project is
also an important trial for examining the suitability of wireless communication
for use in remote field studies in regions with little or no communication
infrastructure. The results can be useful for improving communication in many
similar field projects operating in remote regions of the world.
