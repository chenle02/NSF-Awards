Weather fronts in middle latitudes are represented as extended lines,
seperating air masses with contrasting properties, on synoptic scale weather
maps. A close-up view, however, shows the typical front as a transition zone,
covering tens of kilometers in the cross-front direction, while extending for
thousands of kilometers in the along-front direction. On the large scale, broad
and converging wind patterns bring streams of contrasting air into collision at
the frontal zone, tending to narrow and intensify it. Observations from
instrumented towers and aircraft reveal a rich microsture within the zone,
characterized by turbulence and large vertical motions. The small-scale
processes act to mix properties, and to dissipate and disperse kinetic energy
away from the zone, and thus tend to broaden and weaken the front. Blumen
proposes to study the relative roles of these processes, acting on widely
differing scales. Since there is, at present, no accepted conceptual model of
the complex circulation within the zone, Blumen's approach is to postulate a
simple (mathematically) set of dynamical models, representing both scales,
varying in the values of a few coeffi- cients. Solutions will be sought that
match the frontal zone to its ambient large scale flow regime. Such solutions
provide predictions of key features of the zone, viz., energy dissipation rates,
how energy is distributed among the smaller scales within the frontal zone, and
the width of the zone. These predictions will be compared with observations
collected during the STORM- FEST field experiment in 1992. The significance of
this study is related to improvements in the quality of large-scale weather
forecasting and climate simulation models. Currently available models do not
take account of dissipation within frontal zones because the small scales are
not resolved. The present approach is intended to provide some representation of
this important process that could be used in future models.
