The undergraduate field and laboratory courses in archaeology and physical
anthropology within the Anthropology Program at Kansas State University are
being up-graded. It is proposed to purchase a microscope video recorder and
monitor to be used with an existing binocular microscope as an innovative method
for teaching students edge-wear analysis of stone and bone tools in archaeology.
Additionally, it is requested that both a binocular microscope with camera
mount, a video-recorder/ monitor and a VCR/player be purchased for teaching
students to analyze bone wear and breakage as well as bone damage associated
with forensic analyses in physical anthropology.
