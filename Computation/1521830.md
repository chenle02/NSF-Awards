Many essential phenomena in physical science and engineering are modeled by high
frequency waves. Modern computational methods have become essential tools for
understanding these phenomena. In this project, the PI will continue his
research in this area, with an emphasis on time-harmonic equations. The
computational problems of high frequency waves are challenging. The PI will
develop effective preconditioners for time-harmonic high frequency wave
equations for several key areas. The research results can allow for highly
efficient solution methods and play important roles in applications. The
educational component of the project involves graduate and undergraduate student
training and curriculum development for modern computational mathematics. The PI
will develop effective preconditioners for time-harmonic high frequency wave
equations by combining the following ideas: (1) Waves often propagate in well-
defined directions. This often allows one to decouple the complicated wave
interaction into simple components, each of which is in a preferred direction
and can be compressed with low-rank and randomized techniques. (2) Accurate
discretization schemes should be utilized to capture the correct dispersion
relationship. (3) The sparsity of the time-harmonic wave operator should be
exploited even when the linear system from the numerical discretization is not
sparse. Using these ideas, the PI will address the following technical problems:
(1) Developing more efficient sweeping preconditioners by investigating more
efficient designs for perfectly matched layers, alternative factorization forms,
and recursive sweeping strategies; (2) Developing sparsifying preconditioners
for the Lippmann-Schwinger equation by effectively reducing the dense integral
system to a sparse form; (3) Developing sparsifying preconditioners for the
pseudospectral approximations of problems on periodic structures from
computational photonics and electron structure calculation; and (4) Constructing
directional preconditioners for the obstacle scattering problem via developing a
sparse representation of the boundary integral operator and introducing a new
kernel-independent directional fast summation methods.
