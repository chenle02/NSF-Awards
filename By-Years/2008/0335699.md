The overall focus of the project is to develop an empirically-based conceptual
framework operationalizing "culturally responsive evaluation", investigating the
efficacy and utility of this framework in a professional development workshop of
school personnel (principals and teachers), and critiquing the evaluation
designs which result from application of the framework. The Relevance of Culture
in Evaluation Institute (RCEI) includes a professional development workshop to
equip teachers and principals with basic skills in culturally responsive program
evaluation and an opportunity to utilize those skills in developing a design for
use in their school. The project additionally provides participating schools
with four months of technical support by an expert evaluator supporting
development of evaluation plans linked to the requirements of the No Child Left
Behind Legislation. The RCEI is based on a model developed and implemented by
Dr. Stafford Hood (Relevance of Culture in Evaluation Workshop RCEW) and
previously funded by NSF. Upon successful completion of this research and
development activity, the project will have significantly impacted capacity
within the field of evaluation by increasing both the number of evaluators who
employ evaluative practices that are culturally responsive, and the number of
evaluators of color practicing in the field. The project will also provide
beginning validation of a tool for building culturally responsive evaluation
capacity.
