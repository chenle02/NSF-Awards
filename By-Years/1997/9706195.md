9706195 Menke This research is a collaboration between Columbia University and
Yale University involving the investigation of different types of mantle
heterogeneity in the stable cratonic environment of the northeastern U.S. The
strong heterogeneity in this geologically old region is unexpected since lateral
temperature gradients - the main cause of heterogeneity in areas of active
tectonics - are probably very subdued. Travel-time anomalies correlate with
shear-wave splitting variations, so at least some of the heterogeneity is
probably due to lateral changes in the orientation of mantle fabrics. This
research will test the hypothesis that "anisotropic domains," coherent volumes
of strained mantle rock related to past tectonic activity, are the primary
source of traveltime heterogeneity. The data are to come from seismograms
recorded by the recent high density of fixed and portable stations in the
northeastern U.S. to form a dataset of body wave traveltimes and shear wave
splitting measurements. ***
