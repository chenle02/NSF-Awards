The aim of this proposal is to determine whether different levels of genetic
relatedness between pollen donor and recipient affect pre- and postfertilization
stages during reproduction in individuals from a population of radish, Raphanus
sativus. The project is organized into three objectives: (1) The effect of
inbreeding on fruit and seed development and the growth and reproduction of
inbred progeny will be analyzed for five different levels of genetic relatedness
shared between pollen donor and recipient. (2) Pollen/style interaction will
also be examined as a function of five levels of inbreeding. (3) Inbreeding
effects will be examined statistically to analyze patterns of genetic structure
within several natural populations. This research will be the first to
investigate in detail the effects of inbreeding in a self-incompatible plant
population and thus will provide valuable data relative to the analysis of
realized mating patterns and the general study of microevolution in self-
incompatible plants.
