This project comprises two efforts: electron-nuclear double resonance (endor)
investigations of metalloenzymes and studies of long-range electron transfer
within protein complexes. An endor experiment provides an nmr spectrum of those
nuclei that interact with the electron spin of a paramagnetic center, and with
appropriate isotopic labelling it can characterize every atom of a metalloenzyme
active site. Long-range electron transfer within a protein-protein complex can
be studied by replacing the heme of one partner with a zinc or magnesium
protoporphyrin. Electron paramagnetic resonance (epr) techniques are of major
importance in the study of metalloprotein structure and function. In large part,
the information epr provides about the composition, structure and bonding of a
metal center is contained in the electron-nuclear hyperfine couplings of the
metal nuclei, endogenous ligands and bound substrates. Unfortunately, for most
metallobiomolecules the hyperfine splittings are not resolvable in ordinary epr
and the information is lost. Endor spectroscopy recovers this information.
Electron transfer reactions are central to biology and chemistry, but only
recently have techniques been developed to study long- range biological electron
transfer without the complication of second order processes, through use of
modified proteins which hold an electron donor/acceptor redox pair at fixed
distance.
