This research project concerns questions at the interface between number theory
and physics, in a topic called geometric representation theory. The research
uses techniques from algebra and number theory to investigate conjectures in the
Langlands program, which is building bridges connecting number theory, analysis,
and theoretical physics. The project involves arc spaces, mathematical
structures originally designed to study spaces with singularities and recently
discovered to have fruitful applications in the Langlands program.

Recent work of the investigator provides a new way to apply techniques of
infinite dimensional geometry in geometric representation theory. This project
aims to employ these results in a sheaf-theoretic approach to objects with
representation theoretic significance that are known to be difficult to analyze
on the level of functions. In a related project, these new tools will be used to
construct a p-adic function-sheaf dictionary. In another direction, the research
project explores a geometric approach to Lafforgue's "kernel of functoriality."
Such a construction will have applications both to the classical and the
geometric Langlands programs.
