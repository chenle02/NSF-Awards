9724254 Safinya Optical imaging instrumentation consisting of a laser scanning
confocal microscope with real-time video-rate capability and a micromanipulation
system will be acquired by the University of California at Santa Barbara. The
instrument will support real- time studies of novel biomolecular materials,
confined complex fluids, ceramics, alloys and composites. It will be housed
within the Materials Research Laboratory at UCSB, where it will be accessible to
all campus researchers. %%% Acquisition of this instrumentation will impact
research and research training in an interdisciplinary program at UCSB in the
general area of complex materials that involves about 30 graduate students, 15
post doctoral associates and 11 faculty. ***
