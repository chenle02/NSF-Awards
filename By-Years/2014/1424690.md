We know that financial markets play an important role in determining exchange
rates between different national currencies. This award funds research to
develop a new model of how financial markets affect exchange rates. In the real
world, financial markets do not always fit into the framework of perfect
competition. One major reason why financial markets are imperfect is that
financiers have a limited ability to bear risks. The researchers will build and
analyze a model of global capital flows that includes global financiers as the
intermediaries for capital flows between countries. The research team will
develop predictions from this model and then test the predictions against data.
They will also explore policy implications, especially policies for periods of
dysfunctional financial markets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project provides a
full general equilibrium model of exchange rates in the presence of imperfect
financial markets. The team starts with a basic theory of exchange rate
financial determination in a two-period two-country model where capital flows
are intermediated by financiers. Exchange rates are jointly determined by
capital flows and financiers' capacity to bear currency risk. They then expand
this framework to a richer model that combines financial forces such as risk
taking and financial intermediation in imperfect capital markets with the
traditional real economy analysis of production, import and export.
