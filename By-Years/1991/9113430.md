The proposed program is designed to strengthen the existing Masters Degree
Program in Applied Mathematics at Hampton University, to increase the
interaction of faculty members with undergraduate students, to support the
research activities of junior level faculty, to provide a solid foundation of
research activities within the department to help progress to the goal of
instituting a strong Ph.D. program in Applied Mathematics, and to allow for
increased access to professional activities for minority students and faculty
members.
