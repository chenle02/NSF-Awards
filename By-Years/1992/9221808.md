9221808 Leonard Numerical models of atmospheric processes are valuable tools for
producing operational forecasts and to assist researchers in understanding
fundamental interactions between various physical processes. An important
component of any numerical model is the accurate mathematical representation of
atmospheric processes. As computer power has increased and the spatial
resolution of atmospheric forecast, climate and research models has improved, so
the need for more accurate numerical advection schemes has increased in
significance. This is because higher spatial resolution allows representation of
sharper gradients and changes in gradients. The Principal Investigator will
pursue the development of a highly accurate, computationally efficient scheme
for advection-dominated flows typical of atmospheric processes. Specific
objectives include extending to three dimensions the Principal Investigator's
previous work on a third order, one-dimensional advection scheme. He also will
investigate the development of a multidimensional universal limiter. Successful
completion of this research should result in improved representations in
numerical models of a variety of atmospheric phenomena. ***
