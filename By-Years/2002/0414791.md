The issues involved in designing efficient checkpointing and recovery techniques
for distributed/parallel computations have been extensively studied and are well
understood; efficient solutions exist for this problem in this area. However,
the issues related to checkpointing and recovery in distributed and mobile
database systems as well as distributed object-based systems are not well
understood. This project focuses on these issues. More specifically, this
project will develop a theoretical framework that addresses the issues related
to developing efficient checkpointing and recovery techniques for distributed
and mobile database systems as well as distributed object-based systems. Based
on the framework, efficient non-intrusive asynchronous checkpointing and
recovery techniques will be developed for such systems.&lt;br/&gt;The important
expected broader impacts of this project are: &lt;br/&gt;(i) an improved
understating of the issues related to the design and implementation of fault-
tolerant distributed and mobile database systems as well as distributed object-
based systems; &lt;br/&gt;(ii) availability of efficient checkpointing and
recovery techniques for building fault-tolerant distributed and mobile
information systems as well as distributed object-based systems would help in
building such systems; (iii) involvement of graduate students in the project
will enhance their understanding of the issues related to the design and
implementation of fault-tolerant distributed and mobile information systems and
also help them acquire the tools and techniques for building such systems; (iv)
the research results from the project will be presented in international
conferences and also published in international journals which will benefit the
researchers in both academia and industry; (v) the research results will also be
integrated in a graduate level course.&lt;br/&gt;
