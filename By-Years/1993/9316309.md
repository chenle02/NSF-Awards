9316309 Harrison This project addresses phase equilibria and aqueous
solubilities of ferroan calcites and calcian siderites on the CaCO3 and FeCO3
binary join. The project involves an experimental study of ferroan carbonate
minerals at temperatures between 100 to 500oC and pressures between 1 bar and 5
kilobars. From these experimental measurements, thermodynamic properties and
solid solution mixing models can be derived and used to predict the controls on
equilibrium precipitation in shallow crustal environments. These thermodynamic
results are fundamental parameters for computer simulations of diagenetic
reactions and their control on the porosity and permeability evolution of
sedimentary rocks.
