EIA-0323261&lt;br/&gt;F. C. Wellstood&lt;br/&gt;University of Maryland College
Park&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Demonstration of Entanglement in Coupled Josephson-
Junction Qubits&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This project is a first step
toward a scalable solid-state quantum computer with implications for
cryptography, national security, and scientific computing. Under this project,
the energy levels, coherence times, state manipulation, gate operations, and
quantum behavior of systems composed of current-biased Josephson junctions are
being examined both examining experimentally and theoretically. Building upon
prior spectroscopic studies of two capacitively coupled qubits, the entanglement
of two or more qubits, not only coupled capacitively but also coupled by means
of switchable active elements are being investigated. Switchable coupling may be
crucial for the gate operations of a quantum computer with its large number of
qubits. Theoretical analysis is aiding in designing experiments and interpreting
results. This project supports training of graduate and undergraduate students
and provides opportunities for women, minorities, and high-school students to
participate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
