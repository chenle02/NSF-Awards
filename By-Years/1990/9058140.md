Many physical systems require nonsmooth mathematical models to capture their
dynamical behavior accurately and easily. The nonsmooth characteristics may
arise due to specific system elements such as relays, saturation, dead zone,
backlash or they may result from a simplification in the modelling process. In
many applications, these nonsmooth nonlinearities are the major stumbling-block
to model reduction, stability analysis, and control design. New methods will be
developed to analyze and design control systems with nonsmooth dynamics. Model
reduction techniques such as singular perturbation theory will be extended to
handle these types of systems. Both the stability criteria and the control
design procedures will be investigated to analyze specific nonsmooth
characteristics. The characteristics targeted will include both continuous and
discontinuous nonlinearities and those found in power systems and in
interconnected flexible structures.
