Dr. Thanh Truong has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Truong's doctoral degree was from the University of Minnesota
under the supervision of Professor Donald Truhlar. Dr. Truong intends to
continue research at the University of Houston under the sponsorship of
Professor J. Andrew McCammon. Dr. Truong's area of postdoctoral training and
research will be theoretical and computational studies on many-body simulations
of chemical processes in biological systems. A specific goal is the effect of
tunneling and the protein environment on the dynamics of the carbonate-
bicarbonate interconversion in carbonic anhydrase. The Postdoctoral Fellowships
in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural program designed
to broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D's and attract them into
meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and teaching.
