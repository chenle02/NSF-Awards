The purpose of this research is to determine the net biologically produced
oxygen flux and extent of nutrient recycling in the surface waters of the ocean
using the concentrations of oxygen, argon, nitrogen and the &amp;180 of
molecular 02. These tracers will be sampled monthly for one year at the JGOFS
time-series station near Hawaii and incubation methods will be developed for
determining the community respiration rate and respiration isotope fractionation
factor. These studies will take advantage of the high level of precision that
has been developed so far in Dr. Emerson's upper ocean research. Measurements
from the subarctic Pacific during the summers of 1987 and 1988 indicated that
the net biological oxygen production determined by his methods agree with
summertime dissolved and particulate nitrogen mass balances. The &amp;180-02
measured in surface ocean suggested a new production ratio of 0.2 which is in
accordance with the new production estimated derived from gas concentrations and
14C incubation estimates of primary production. The respiration isotope
fractionation factor in the upper thermocline appears to be 6-7% less than that
observed in the euphotic zone. Preliminary results at the JGOFS time-series
station suggest similar isotope trends.
