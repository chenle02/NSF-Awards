This award supports studies of long-term (Pleistocene and Cenozoic) climate
change aimed at developing a plausible physical model to account for the
simultaneous time-evolution of many climatic variables (e.g., ice mass, CO2,
ocean state and surface temperature and their spatial distributions). The
studies involve statistical analyses of the relevant time-series records as well
as theoretical studies based on both "deductive" physics (using general
circulation models and statistical-dynamical models) and "inductive" low-order
models (using qualitative physics, structured by the theory of dynamical systems
analysis). This work will enlarge upon our present theory of
Pliocene/Pleistocene climatic evolution by (a) extension to Pre-Pliocene
changes, (b) extension to a two-dimensional geography, (c) incorporation of
explicit ocean dynamics, (d) explicit treatment of the continental biosphere,
and (e) establishing closure relations between the fast and slow response
variables by systematic GCM studies.
