This is a study of the globalization of environmental degradation using time-
series and panel regression analyses of cross-national data. It will compare a
variety of theories, including neo-Malthusianism, modernization theory, world
system/dependency theory, ecological-evolutionary/human ecology theory, and
state-centric theories of political development. Dependent variables will
include rates of greenhouse gas production, deforestation, air pollution, toxic
wastes, and other measures of land, soil and water degradation. This research
will contribute greatly to our understanding of how social factors contribute to
environmental degradation, thus providing information and insights for policy
makers concerned with protecting the environment. In addition to this valuable
contribution to public policy, the study will advance social science by testing
several of the major competing theories of how society operates.
