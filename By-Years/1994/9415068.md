This award will provide funding for the renovation of space for the Biochemistry
Department at the Medical University of South Carolina. Vacated space, located
in the Basic Sciences Building, will be renovated into modern research
laboratories and biochemical support units. Renovations will include asbestos
abatement, improving the HVAC system and installing new casework and fume hoods
to construct modern research laboratories, with accompanying shared biochemical
support areas, and a transgenic animal facility. The project is the first step
in the re-building of the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology into
a strong central core resource that will significantly enhance many diverse
disciplines including genetics, physiology, kinetics, immunology, pharmacology,
organic chemistry, and biophysics. The renovation will be a vehicle in
recruiting a structure- function biochemist and other faculty with expertise in
areas such as protein biochemistry, enzymology, crystallography, and micro-
sequencing synthesis. Because of the fundamental nature of biochemistry as a
discipline, the improved research infrastructure will impact researchers at all
levels of education. The university's proactive participation in research
training programs for postdocs, graduate students, undergraduates, and high
school teachers and students will be augmented through the re-building of its
biochemistry program.
