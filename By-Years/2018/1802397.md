This award supports participation in the Atlanta Lecture Series in Graph Theory
and Combinatorics, which will be held November 3-4, 2018 and March 30-31, 2019
at Georgia State University and Georgia Institute of Technology, respectively.
Combinatorics and graph theory have undergone dramatic development in the past
few decades. These two conferences will feature the latest research developments
and themes in the areas of structural graph theory, extremal graph theory, and
probabilistic combinatorics. The series has become a major event for the
combinatorics community, providing opportunities to strengthen collaborations
among researchers and institutions within the southeast region of the United
States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each conference features two one-hour lectures by a
distinguished researcher, four one-hour lectures by established researchers
mainly from the southeast region, and four 30-minute talks by early-career
researchers and graduate students. The meetings provide opportunities for
interaction among established researchers and rising stars; this award supports
the attendance of graduate students, early-career researchers, and invited
speakers. Additional information concerning financial support and the conference
schedule is maintained at the lecture series websites at two hosting
institutions, respectively:&lt;br/&gt; http://mathstatt.gsu.edu and
http://www.als.math.gatech.edu/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
