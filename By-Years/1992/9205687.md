The statistical part of this project will be to study a number of estimation
methods using nonparametric approaches. In particular kernel estimation and
related areas of nonparametric and density estimation applications will be
studied, and the smoothing parameter selection problem addressed. Problems to be
considered include those of discontinuities or rough density functions,
selection for ridge regression, and the effect of discretization. The modelling
part of this project involves new developments of the theory and applications of
Markov models in both discrete and continuous time. The investigator will
concentrate on rates of convergence results and on state and history dependent
criteria for such stability. These results will be incorporated into a new
approach to Markov decisions processes where the state space is extended to
include the decision set into the overall Markovian structure. Stability
properties of such general processes will then be established in quite complex
environments. Probabilistic modelling and statistical estimation techniques
encompass two separate parts of the same activity. The first part endeavors to
describe, in manageable terms, models of real and often complex systems in such
a way that the inherent randomness in the system is properly represented. The
second endeavors to use these models, and data gathered to describe real
systems, in such a way that one can estimate the parameters that actually
describe what is happening in practice. In the modelling part of this project
the investigators will study important models in operations research, time
series, and finance and economics, with a focus on developing methods for
stability of such systems. In the statistics part of the proposal, the
investigators will look at a number of computer intensive ways of estimating
parameters with a goal of finding methods which give good estimates quickly.
