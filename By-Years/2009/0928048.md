All living organisms respond adaptively to the opportunities and constraints
presented by their fluctuating physical environment. For example, (1) a
bacterium that survives attack by antibiotic drugs can flourish where others
fail; (2) an eye that adapts to the overall level of illumination can provide
vision either by night or day, enhancing an organism's prospects for survival;
(3) a decision-making system, like the brain, that integrates prior experience
can make better decisions about what to do with new incoming sensory
information. These three examples cover a range of levels of biological
organization, and have traditionally been studied by specialists who have little
contact with the other levels. However, living organisms implement adaptation,
learning, and decision strategies at all levels of organization, subject to some
overarching rules from probability theory. Thus the study of behavior at a
single level can improve the understanding at other levels. This proposed
research will analyze experiments done at all three of these levels in a common
framework of information theory. New techniques will be developed to extract
meaning from experimental data. These tools will be used to assess the extent to
which single-cell organisms, the retina, and the brain all implement common (or
related) decision strategies. These new tools will be useful to researchers in
many other fields, and they will be disseminated broadly. The project includes
training for several graduate, undergraduate, and postdoctoral students. The
project's investigators will perform a number of outreach activities, most
notably the creation of an interdisciplinary undergraduate textbook addressing
the newly emerging field of systems biology for students in
science/technology/engineering/and math fields.
