9357931 Kirchner This young investigator proposes to extend recent advances in
watershed geochemistry by developing new techniques for inferring mineral
weathering rates; to develop and apply methods for inferring spatially averaged
long-term erosion rates from cosmogenic isotope abundances in alluvial
sediments; and to infer coupling among topography, runoff, weathering, and
erosion from patterned terrain. He will continue his research at the University
of California at Berkeley.
