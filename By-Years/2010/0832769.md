The research to be conducted here centers around models for the structure and
evolution&lt;br/&gt;of giant planets which can be used to relate observations of
giant exoplanets to&lt;br/&gt;fundamental properties such as mass and radius.
First, a modeling effort will be&lt;br/&gt;undertaken to compute the thermal
evolution of young giant planets over a range of&lt;br/&gt;masses in a self-
consistent way, i.e., coupled with core accretion models, rather than
with&lt;br/&gt;the arbitrary initial conditions currently used. From these
models, both spectra and colors&lt;br/&gt;will be calculated to allow for more
accurate determinations of the masses of young&lt;br/&gt;objects found orbiting
other stars. A second project will explore recent revisions in
the&lt;br/&gt;equation of state for hydrogen to evaluate the corresponding
changes in model radius. It&lt;br/&gt;is suggested that this change leads to
larger radii at a given age and that the wide spread&lt;br/&gt;in radii seen
among transiting extrasolar giant planets may be understood in terms of
a&lt;br/&gt;large range in interior heavy element abundances versus the need for
internal energy&lt;br/&gt;sources.&lt;br/&gt;This work will improve the return
of future space missions to locate extrasolar planets as&lt;br/&gt;well as
efforts from the ground by enabling more accurate determinations of
basic&lt;br/&gt;properties from observations. The models here will also serve as
a stepping stone to the&lt;br/&gt;eventual detection of Earth-like planets. The
results of this work will be posted on the&lt;br/&gt;SETI Institute website and
disseminated to the public through articles in popular journals.
