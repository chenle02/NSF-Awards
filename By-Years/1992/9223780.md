The impacts of climate change are possibilities that should be considered in
decisions involving long-term commitments for resource planning and management.
Such decisions are now being weighed by the International Joint Commission
concerning resource management of the Great Lakes basin. This study develops a
modeling system and decision framework to address the Great Lakes decision
problem. The model will provide insights into the effects climate change may
have on the basin and into the more general process of how this information is
used and valued. The project addresses three issues: (1) the effective provision
of climate change information for Great Lakes management decisions; (2) the
evaluation of management flexibility and the worth of better information given
the uncertainties surrounding climate change; and (3) the evaluation of how
better information affects users and their understanding of resource management
for the Great Lakes.
