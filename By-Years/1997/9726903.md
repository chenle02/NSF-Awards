Polak 9726903 The goals of the proposed work are to elucidate the mechanistic
and genetic bases of resistance against parasitism in an insect host. Previous
ecological research has shown that the parasite (a macrochelid mite) damages
multiple reproductive traits of its host (a drosophilid fly), providing the
rationale for asking specific questions about the evolutionary potential of
parasitism in this natural system. Laboratory experiments, using genetically
distinct resistant and control lines of flies and integrated behavioral and
physiological techniques, are proposed to determine (1) the magnitude of genetic
variability underlying resistance in the natural host population, (2)
constraints on the evolution of resistance, (3) effects of loss of genetic
variability (through controlled host inbreeding) on rates of parasitism, and (4)
traits of the host that confer resistance. Most of what is known about patterns
of genetic variability in resistance against parasites and pathogens, and their
effect on the distribution of disease in nature, comes from studies of plants
and their natural enemies. Only by acquiring the requisite information in animal
hosts can we begin to develop a general theory of the evolution of parasite
resistance, and sound approaches to disease control. The proposed study is aimed
at attaining this goal using an insect-ectoparasite model whose ecology is well
known. The results should have broad-ranging implications because ectoparasites
are ubiquitous, are know vectors or transmissible parasitic disease in numerous
species, and because the mechanisms expected to mediate susceptibility to
ectoparasitism in the present system have strong parallels with that in other
taxa including birds, mammals and other invertebrates.
