This project sits at the interface of the mathematical subfields of harmonic
analysis, representation theory, and combinatorics. The project is expected to
have applications to the classification of knots in three-dimensional space. It
is also expected to have connections to theoretical physics. At the center of
the project is a family of algebras, introduced by the PI in the middle 1990's,
that have two actions by a symmetry group. These algebras are known as double
affine Hecke algebras and they have found uses in several areas of mathematics,
starting with their use in the proof of a conjecture of Ian Macdonald about the
properties of certain orthogonal polynomials that arise from the study of
symmetry.

The major themes of the proposed work are expected to be the following: (1) the
theory of invariants of torus knots using the structure of double affine Hecke
algebras (abbreviated DAHA), (2) a new theory of Rogers-Ramanujan identities
based on nil-DAHA, (3) a surprising formula for the minimal number of creation
operators in terms of non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials, and (4) the action of
the absolute Galois group on the ramified covers of elliptic curves associated
with perfect DAHA modules.
