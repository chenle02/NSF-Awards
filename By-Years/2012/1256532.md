This ethnographic study of Wisconsin dairy farmers examines how emerging
biotechnologies and industrial practices are changing ethical considerations.
Cows are producing unprecedented amounts of milk due to infrastructural,
nutritional, hormonal, and pharmaceutical interventions and these changes entail
new kinds of daily interactions between farmers and their cows. While dairy
farmers take pride in their expertise in cow care, the industrial logics and
market pressures that pervade the dairy industry create tensions between ethics
of care and drives for productivity. This empirical study will investigate these
tensions through fifteen months of ethnographic research with dairy farmers,
veterinarians, dairy engineers, and children's groups such as 4-H.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project include a Ph.D.
dissertation and several articles, public lectures and presentations at
professional conferences, the creation of networks among scholars, industry
professionals, and farmers who are working on issues pertaining to animal care
in dairy farming, and contributions to policy work on animal care ethics.
