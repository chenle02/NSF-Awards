In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Lindsay and Lombardi will continue their study of the Raman
spectra of mass-selected small metal cluster species in rare gas matrices in
order to obtain structural information. The species of interest are produced by
sputtering from a solid target, and the products are trapped in low temperature
matrices and interrogated using absorption, excitation, fluorescence, and
resonance Raman spectroscopy. Investigations of transition metal clusters will
be followed by studies of alkaline earth species. The results of these studies
will provide structural information that will aid in understanding the bonding
properties of small metal clusters as a function of position in the periodic
table. Such information is of interest to chemists and materials scientists who
are trying to synthesize new metal-containing compounds for materials
applications.
