I/UCRC for Smart Ocean Technology (SOT) will utilize the technological advances
in computing, communication, control, devices, instruments and platforms to
provide persistent observations and exploration capabilities for aquatic
environments. The scope of the Center research includes diverse
interdisciplinary areas, ranging from ocean renewable energy systems and
underwater acoustics to maritime security and ocean data visualization.
Underwater/aquatic systems are not only important for basic scientific research
(oceanography, limnology, etc.) but also for commercial exploration (undersea
and coastal oil/gas) and national defense (border security) applications. SOT
will emphasize the integration of intelligence/awareness at various levels of
aquatic systems design which will impact the robustness, persistence and cost
efficiencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SOT Research Center will focus on
creating novel technologies in the areas of communication, power, sensing, and
platform systems that are well-aligned with the interests of potential
industrial partners. Educational outreach to various community organizations
(schools and science/technology museums, notably) is expected based on products
- data, images and streaming video - resulting from the work conducted at the
Center. The Center will help create a pipeline of skilled engineers and
researchers to meet the future demand from multiple industry sectors as the
proposed technologies mature.
