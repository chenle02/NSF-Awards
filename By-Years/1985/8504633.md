This research suggests enhancements to relational database systems which will
allow them to effectively support expert system applications with a large
knowledge base and/or database. The basic premise of this research is that
relational database systems (with some modest extensions) may offer superior
performance and ease of expert system constructions in some applications. These
applications are characterized by a very large knowledge base or database. The
study investigates extensions to relational database systems which will
facilitate their application in such environments. Research is performed on how
to optimize such an extended relational system so it will be able to offer
superior performance compared to other programming environments in which one
might construct large expert systems.
