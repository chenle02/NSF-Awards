Professors Bernstein and Kelley are supported by the Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program in a collaborative study of vibrational energy dynamics in
excited electronic states of small solute/solvent clusters and of solute dimers
formed in a supersonic molecular jet expansion. These measurements will help
elucidate the relative importance of various radiationless processes involved in
redistributing the initial energy into other degrees of freedom. Optical
excitation will prepare the clusters with known amounts of vibrational energy in
the first excited singlet state of the solute chromophore. The vibrational
dynamics will be monitored by picosecond spectroscopic studies of the rise and
decay times of the population in specific vibronic levels of both the pumped
parent cluster and the free molecule resulting from predissociation.
Measurements will include time-resolved emission, two color ionization, and two
color stimulated emission pumping. The solute chromophores will be aromatic
azines, and the solvents will include ammonia, water, methane, deuterated
methane, argon, and carbon tetrafluoride.
