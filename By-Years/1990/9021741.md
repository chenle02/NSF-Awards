This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to Reed College for the replacement of
the Chemistry Building which houses the research and research training
activities of the Chemistry Department. This building was constructed during
World War II and has not been renovated since that time. Its replacement is
fully justified and cost-effective. The ARFMP grant of $816,000 and $1,149,525
provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize these research
and research training facilities. This project will address the need to improve
the current research infrastructure by providing support for that portion of the
construction of an upgraded space which represents replacement of the old
facility, complete with the installation of adequate electrical and heating,
ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and fume hoods. This award
contributes to the infrastructure of science by providing an improved
environment for the conduct of research and for the training of quality
undergraduate students in a liberal arts college well known for the high
percentage of its graduates who go on to receive doctoral degrees in the
sciences.
