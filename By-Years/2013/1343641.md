1343641&lt;br/&gt;Chen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this NSF/FDA
Scholar-in-Residence proposal is to advance the development of phantom-based
test methods and computational tools for elucidating and evaluating the
performance of novel NIR oximetry devices. This will involve: 1) Development and
validation of a portable NIRS system; 2) Characterization of the tissue optics
of the main phantom material specified in the IEC/ISO fNIRS draft standard and
evaluation of its use as a matrix material for tissue-simulating phantoms, based
on homogeneous slabs and samples with vessel-like inclusions; 3) Development of
3D printed phantoms based on the acquired vascular network volume; and 4)
Development and implementation of a 3D model of light propagation based on the
vascular network volume to study the effect of device and tissue parameters
on&lt;br/&gt;sampling sensitivity.
