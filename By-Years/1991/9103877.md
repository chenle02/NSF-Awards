Spatial and temporal patterns of recruitment can strongly influence both the
abundance and distribution of animals, as well as the evolution of life history
characteristics. Larvae of most benthic and demersal fishes arrive on reefs with
well-developed swimming and sensory capabilities and therefore, have the
potential to strongly influence the pattern of recruitment by controlling where
and when they settle. This research will experimentally examine the role of
larval behavior in determining the pattern of settlement of a benthic fish
common to oyster reefs. The naked goby was chosen because its larvae undergo a
demersal schooling phase prior to settlement. Larvae of this species are
extremely abundant and can be easily observed. Dr. Palmer and collaborators will
focus on two aspects of larval behavior (1) how larval behavior influences pre-
settlement distribution and dispersion patterns, in turn, influence spatial
patterns of settlement. These two processes are extremely important to the
ultimate patterns of recruitment because they can determine which other species
influence larval survival and movement, the spatial distribution of recruits,
the need for post-settlement dispersal and the importance of density-dependent
interactions.
