The goal of the project is to increase awareness among social science majors of
international relations and foreign policy decision-making. Undergraduate
students at the University of Connecticut participate in the simulation by
communicating through a central computer located at the University of Maryland
via electronic mail and a real-time teleconferencing network.The International
Communication and Negotiation Simulation offers students the opportunity to
learn the principles of international negotiations: how to bargain, when to
compromise, what are the risks and who will benefit. To be effective, the
students must learn the importance of teamwork and specialization. Political
scientists at the University of Connecticut will also use the microcomputer-
simulation facility to assist in the introduction of more international studies
into the state high school social studies program. The initial phase of the
project will involve high school students working on simulation exercises in
collaboration with undergraduates at the University of Connecticut
