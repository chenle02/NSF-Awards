Today, simulation is the de facto method for studying multicore cache
hierarchies. But simulation is costly due to the combinatorial design spaces
involved, especially as multicore processors scale to 100s of cores and 100+ MB
of on-chip cache. Reuse distance (RD) analysis can help architects evaluate
multicore memory performance more efficiently. Unfortunately, locality in
multicore processors depends on how per-thread memory reference streams
interleave. Reliance on memory interleaving makes multicore locality profiles
architecture dependent, limiting their ability to analyze different
configurations. For loop-based parallel programs, however, threads are typically
symmetric and exhibit similar locality characteristics. Such thread symmetry
makes multicore RD analysis tractable: locality profiles remain stable with
respect to cache capacity scaling, and change systematically with core count and
problem size scaling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is exploring several
research directions related to multicore RD analysis for loop-based parallel
programs. First, it is characterizing how Concurrent RD and per-thread RD
profiles for symmetric threads vary with processor and problem scaling. Second,
it is developing techniques to predict these profile variations. Simple
prediction techniques such as reference groups, as well as more sophisticated
parametric and non-parametric learning approaches, are being studied. Finally,
it is applying the new RD analysis to explore large-scale multicore design
spaces, identifying good cache hierarchy organizations. It is also using the RD
analyses to improve existing memory performance enhancement techniques such as
multithreading and locality optimization.
