This award supports the participation of 16 U.S. scientists in a U.S.-Japan
Photoconversion/Photosynthesis Seminar on Molecular Photophysics of Organized
Assemblies. The seminar, which will be held March 14-18, 1993 in Palm Springs,
California is being co-organized by Professor Pill-Soon Song, Department of
Chemistry, University of Nebraska, and Dr. Iwao Yamazaki, Department of Chemical
Process Engineering, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan. The seminar will focus
on new aspects of research in the biophotophysics of photoconversion/
photosynthesis, the biological relevance of newly acquired information on the
structure and dynamics of the excited states of biomolecules and their
assemblies (both artificial and biological systems), and the current
understanding of the molecular mechanisms of light energy conversion and signal
transduction (both signal generation and amplification) in living organisms.
Seminar sessions are organized around the following topics: photophysics of
molecular assemblies, photosynthetic systems: primary photoprocesses and
electron transfer, magnetic effects and organized molecular magnetism,
photoconversion and photo-signal transduction, and photon energy capture and
transfer. The goal of the seminar is to provide opportunities for in-depth
discussion, which could lead to further research collaboration between U.S. and
Japanese scientists.
