9614633 Lindsay Through a collaboration of the DuPage Children's Museum, Argonne
National Laboratory, and National-Louis University, a three-element project is
being conducted focusing on the following: 1) a research component that studies
children's naive perceptions of the phenomena of air and wind energy, 2) an
exhibition component that uses the project research to design, develop, and
construct a 3- 4,000 square foot "process" oriented exhibition with a 2-story
exhibit tower and 12-15 replicable exploratory workstations, 3) a program
component that offers explorations for children adapted for museums, preschools
and elementary school classrooms. Target audiences include young children and
their parents, pre- and in- service early childhood teachers, and museum
professionals interested in reaching very young children.
