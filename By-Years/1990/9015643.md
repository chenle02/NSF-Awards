The research will review the gaging process at a roller bearing company and
modernize its gaging strategies in an optimal manner. The analysis will account
for the use of state-of-the-art technologies, theories and philosophies. Several
areas will be addressed in this study including design, inspection, production
capability, proper maintenance and training, as well as the enhancement of
current standards to enable improved quality assurance. The resulting production
system should demonstrate increased efficiency and an improved capability. The
results from this project may be further applied to several other bearing lines;
and eventually to a wide variety of manufacturing processes.
