With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and Chemistry
Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) programs, the University of
Hawaii will acquire an integrated ultra-high-performance liquid chromatograph
(UHP-LC) and high-resolution mass spectrometer (HRMS) with quadrupole time-of-
flight (Q-TOF). The system will be used to analyze the composition of materials
obtained from various sources including samples obtained from chemical
reactions, natural products and biological sources. The liquid chromatography
system (LC) separates a mixture into its individual components. Mass
Spectrometry (MS) then ionizes the components and determines their mass by
measuring the mass to charge ratio (m/z) of the ions. The selected configuration
will enable accurate mass determination, with the capability to resolve and
characterize the components of complex mixtures. This is a widely used
analytical tool to identify the composition of a mixture or material. The
instrument will be used by students in their research, training them with
sophisticated, modern instrumentation. Students in laboratory courses will be
trained to use this tool preparing them for their advancement into graduate
study and careers in chemistry and allied fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mass
spectrometry system will be used in research including areas such as (a)
synthesizing phosphaalkene-based ligands and the application of their
corresponding transition metal complexes to problems in small molecule
activation, homogeneous catalysis, and alternative energy processes; (b)
pursuing total synthesis of natural products and the development of new bond-
forming processes; (c) studying mechanisms of radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)
enzymes that generate C-S bonds; (d) studying elastin protein; (e) developing
technologies for membrane protein expression and crystallization; (f) developing
total synthesis and synthesis of bioactive small molecules and (g) identifying
small molecules in complex biological samples.
