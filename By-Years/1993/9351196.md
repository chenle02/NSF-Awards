The project will purchase computer equipment to introduce computer-aided
molecular modeling into the undergraduate chemistry curriculum. Students will
develop the ability to view and manipulate 3-dimensional molecular structures in
a variety of formats as applied to organic and biomolecular structure.
Ultimately, the approach will extend throughout the curriculum. In the context
of discovery-based problem and laboratory assignments, students will build
molecular models on these systems and submit the data files over the network for
computational analysis. They will employ the workstations' graphics capabilities
to analyze their results. In the process, they will put this tool to the same
exploratory uses as does the research chemist: to better understand structure,
and to predict and rationalize molecular reactivities.
