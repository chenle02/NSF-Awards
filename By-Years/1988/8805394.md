The FCCSET Committee report on a National High-Performance Computing Initiative
was delivered to the United States Congress on November 20, 1987, although the
basic content of the section on Networking had been widely known since early
summer. The report recommends creation of a national data network to support
scientific research and scholarly activities in a three-tiered approach that
coordinates and expands existing networks of the Federal Agencies that support
research, while carrying out the research, development, and pilot deployment of
the "gigabit network". Community support, in the broadest sense, will be needed
to carry out so large a project successfully. In this proposal, Richard
Mandelbaum of NYSERNET, Inc. proposes to hold a large- scale planning conference
with collaboration from EDUCOM, to plan various aspects of design, construction,
and use of the network including, for example: * appropriate level of access,and
relationship to commercial X.25 networks; * suitability of SURANET or NYSERNET
as a model for a national net; * models of industrial participation; and *
funding mechanisms, including the partition of funding among the Federal
government, state and local governments, and end-users. Participants will
include university presidents and provosts; representatives of industry,
especially telecommunication companies, financial institutions, and firms with
large R & D investments; and government officials from national laboratories,
public utility commissions, state boards of regents, and legislative committees.
