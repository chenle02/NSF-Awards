This research involving experimental studies of the fluid dynamic behavior of
supersonic jets of multiphase fluids and applications to understanding explosive
volcanic eruptions. Laboratory analogs will allow controlled study of the
mechanisms of transport of mass, momentum, and energy in transient jets of
multi-phase fluids. The influence of reservoir and vent geometry, particulate
loading, and phase changes will be investigated. The effects of nucleation and
boiling during decompression of resevoirs under hydrostatic pressure will be
investigated.
