9708552 deMenocal This award supports a conference to define the timing,
amplitude, and regional signatures of Holocene climate variability and discuss
possible causal mechanisms based on the paleoclimatic record, synoptic
climatology, and climate modeling studies. This meeting will serve as an
opportunity to present new Holocene terrestrial, marine, and ice core
paleoclimate data, and to evaluate these records within the context of modes and
mechanisms of modern climate variability. Contributions from the climate
modeling community will address ocean-atmosphere climate model responses due to
prescribed Holocene boundary condition changes. Quantifying Holocene climate
variability is particularly relevant since it is unlikely that the full range of
natural "warm climate" variability is reflected in the last century of
instrumental data.
