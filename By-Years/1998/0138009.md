This low temperature project seeks to understand the unique properties of helium
films and to use these films to address problems of interest in Condensed Matter
Physics. A primary objective is to study new aspects of the He-3-He-4 mixture
film system. This work would include confirmation of two-dimensional Fermi
liquid parameters and a search for a new superfluid state in the two dimensional
3He atop a 4He film at very low temperatures. Experiments are also conducted
with helium films on patterned substrates in one and two dimensions. Topics of
interest include two-dimensional localization and a possible shift of
universality class due to an implied film flow. Experimental techniques include
quartz crystal microbalance resonance, heat capacity studies of the thermal
properties of He-4 and He-3-He-4 mixture films, and third sound studies of
helium films on patterned substrates. In addition to contributing to progress in
understanding the behavior of helium films themselves, the work has relevance to
phenomena such as Fermi systems, localization, and two-dimensional phase
transitions. It also provides excellent training for graduate students and
undergraduates. The students gain experience in cutting edge technology and
fundamental concepts that prepare them for careers in academe, government or
industry.

This research investigates the remarkable properties of liquid helium. Such
study provides unique insights into nature that are not available by the study
of any other substance. Study of the wave character of thin helium films on
surfaces, that have been deliberately patterned, allows an enhanced
understanding of how waves can be trapped in novel environments and of how an
imposed flow can modify this behavior. The study of thin film mixtures of the
two naturally occurring forms of helium is motivated by theoretical suggestions
that a new kind of superfluid film may be found. These studies with mixture
films also allow insight into the physics of two-dimensional systems. Students
involved in this work gain hands-on research experience with sophisticated
instrumentation. This training prepares them for careers in academe, government
or industry.
