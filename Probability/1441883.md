This award supports participation in the Seventh International Conference on
High Dimensional Probability (HDP VII) taking place during May 26-31, 2014 at
the Institut d'Études Scientifiques de Cargèse (IESC), France. High Dimensional
Probability theory is the mathematical root for the analysis of Big Data, and
developments in the theory and its connections to other disciplines will benefit
science and society as a whole.

The topics of the conference will include Limit Theorems, Empirical Processes
and their Applications, High Dimensional Statistics, Statistical Learning
theory, Spin Glass Methods, Convex Geometry and Applications as well as Random
Matrices and Additive Combinatorics. The meeting will consist of a mix of formal
and informal discussions and presentations. It is not only intended to present
the current state of the art in the field, but also to point out important open
problems and to set new directions for the field. The information exchange
taking place during HDP VII will enhance cross-pollination among the disciplines
of mathematics, statistics, machine learning, and computer science. Particular
attention has been paid to bring as speakers and participants, and ultimately
into the future leadership of this conference series, junior researchers and
researchers from under-represented groups.
