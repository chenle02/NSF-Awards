9405503 Halliday This award provides partial funding to support a technician
assigned to assist with the operation and maintenance of the Radiogenic Isotope
Geochemistry Laboratory in the Department of Geological Sciences at the
University of Michigan. The technician will be responsible for maintaining the
electronic and mechanical operation of two multicollector thermal ionization
mass spectrometers. In addition, he will also aid in the installation and
development of laser sources for a newly designed inductively-coupled plasma
magnetic sector multicollector spectrometer. The research and graduate teaching
applications of the Radiogenic Isotope Geochemistry Laboratory include studies
of crustal fluid flow, silicic magma systems, mantle geochemistry,
paleoceanography, and arc tectonics. ***
