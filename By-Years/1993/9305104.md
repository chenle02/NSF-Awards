The principal objective of this research project is to construct a metamorphic
fluid flow budget for a portion of the Grenville Province of southern Ontario.
The results of the study will provide information on metamorphic rock
permeabilities and on the potential for heat and mass transport by metamorphic
fluids, and thus will ultimately find application in constraining models for
fluid flow in mid-crustal settings. The study will be based upon field mapping
and results obtained from mineral thermometric calculations and stable isotope
analysis. Aspects of interest include metamorphic temperatures and thermal
gradients, metamorphic fluid compositions, the nature of fluid fluxes and flow
paths, and the mechanisms of fluid- rock interactions.
