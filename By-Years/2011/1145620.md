This proposal supports U.S.-based participants attending the "Young Geometric
Group Theory" meeting to be held at the Banach Center in Bedlewo, Poland from
January 9-13, 2012. There will be four senior speakers giving mini-courses on
fundamental topics, as well as seven outstanding postdocs giving short talks on
their work. The planned talks cover basic examples in geometric group theory
such as Artin groups, CAT(0) groups, limit groups, and lattices in Lie groups;
the mini-courses make connections with other fields of mathematics including
representation theory, projective geometry, geometric measure theory, and
logic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geometric group theory is a fairly young and dynamic
field studied by an international community of researchers. Most of the workshop
attendees will be early-career mathematicians; the schedule is designed to
maximize the interactions among young researchers, as well as to give them
extended contact with leading experts in the field. A website for the conference
