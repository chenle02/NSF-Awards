Professor Kenneth Showalter is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to continue his studies on nonlinear dynamics in
chemical systems. Research will be conducted in three specific areas: 1) he will
develop and characterize new chemical wave behavior in open and closed chemical
systems; 2) he will develop feedback methods which are capable of controlling
chaos in chemical systems; and 3) he will study chemical waves on membranes in
capillary tubes. The work will incorporate both experimental and theoretical
studies. %%% Nonlinear dynamics has blossomed in the past decade to become what
many regard as a genuine scientific revolution, and it is now recognized
throughout the natural sciences as a powerful tool for understanding complexity
in nature. Chemical systems have played an important role in advancing the field
because they are especially amenable to experimental and theoretical analysis,
and hence serve as ideal models of more complex biological systems. With this
grant Showalter will pursue experimental and theoretical studies to develop a
better understanding of dynamical complexity of chemical systems.
