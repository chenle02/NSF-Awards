This is a Minority Research Initiation Grant for developing a proposal on
increasing human resource productivity in public sector organizations, working
under civil service regulation. The proposed research involves the design of
field study which will test alternative theories of worker incentives. The
lagging increase in productivity in the service sector is becoming of increasing
concern. One fundamental issue involves the design of incentives and other
structures, that increase human resource productivity. The award will lead to a
research proposal involving research in field settings which will test and
evaluate the impact and effectiveness of alternative incentive theories.
