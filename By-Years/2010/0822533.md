U.S.-Brazil Planning Visit: Development of a device for real time interaction
with the brain. &lt;br/&gt;0822533&lt;br/&gt;Diego Restrepo, University of
Colorado at Denver, HSC&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed planning visit will
establish a bilateral collaboration between U.S. and Brazilian scientists to
develop novel engineering solutions for the study of brain function in awake
behaving animals in real time. The hosts for the planning visit are Drs. Fátima
de Medeiros, José da Graça, and Marcelo de Souza from Brazil's Universidade
Federal do Ceara. Researchers at the University of Colorado at Denver's Health
Sciences Center have applied computerized technologies, such as olfactometers,
extracellular multiunit recording, and cerebral microstimulation to study the
brain and olfactory behavior in awake mice. The proposed collaboration will
expand upon previous work to study real time interaction with the brain where
extraneous circuits evaluate neural output and affect neuronal firing in real
time. The Brazilian collaborators will provide computer expertise to improve the
speed and real time efficiency of the olfactometer.&lt;br/&gt;
