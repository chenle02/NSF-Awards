The investigator and his collaborators analyze and implement techniques to
tackle several problems in differential equations and matrix analysis. The
following topics are studied: (1) smooth orthonormal factorizations of parameter
dependent matrices and connected applications,(2) computation of Lyapunov
exponents with applications, (3) stability and bifurcations of invariant tori,
(4) computation of matrix exponential and other functions of a matrix, and
Riccati equations. In all cases, theoretical analysis and extensive
computational testing are undertaken, and codes for the outlined tasks are
developed. Specific aims include implementation of techniques to compute QR and
SVD of fundamental matrix solutions, techniques to update invariant subspaces
factorizations and SVDs of parameter dependent matrices, and applications
connected to such techniques; implementation of methods to compute Lyapunov
exponents and related stability information of continuous dynamical systems;
techniques to compute the Lyapunov type numbers of Fenichel and use these
quantities to monitor continuability and bifurcations of invariant tori;
approximation of the exponential of a matrix in case the matrix is block
triangular, and other aspects of computation of functions of a matrix.

To model physical phenomena in a compact way, differential equations are
probably the most powerful tool we have. Differential equations can model
complicated chemical interactions and biological phenomena, manufacturing
plants, robot and satellite motions, transport properties of materials, and a
host of other phenomena of interest in the applied sciences. However, typically
one can only guarantee that differential equations have a solution, but it
cannot be provided in closed form. Moreover, in a typical situation, there will
be uncertainties in the phenomenon under study, and these will show up as
parameters in the differential equation model. Loosely speaking, the fundamental
question is then to understand the stability of solutions (as parameters
change). Now, suppose that we have obtained (at a high price) detailed
information on the solution to our model for a certain parameter value in the
model. We may hope that if we change the parameter just slightly, we will be
able to obtain detailed information for the new parameter value at a fraction of
the cost we previously paid. Basically, this expectation forms the principle of
so-called "continuation techniques." The investigator studies approximation
techniques to solve differential equations which aim at assessing the stability
of the solutions and at exploiting continuation techniques. The goal is to
eventually obtain approximation of a differential equation model in a way which
will give the complete picture of solutions of the model as its parameters vary
inside a certain (physical) range. This goal finds its concrete realization in
the study of quantities which serve as indicators of stability (the so-called
Lyapunov exponents) and in computer programs which approximate these quantities.
The investigator also uses these Lyapunov exponents for predicting bifurcation
phenomena and assessing error propagation when solving differential equations.
Finally, the investigator studies continuation techniques for matrix
factorizations and produces computer programs for continuation techniques.
