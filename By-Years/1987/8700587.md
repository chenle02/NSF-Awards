Immortal antibody producing hybridomas are produced by the fusion of antibody
producing spleen cells with myeloma cells. The widely used chemical fusion
procedures are time intensive, require large amounts of valuable antigen and
provide relatively low yields of the desired hybridomas. Conventional chemical
fusion results in the random generation of hybridomas, most of which are not
producing the desired antibodies. This proposal is directed towards the
development of methods which will add antigen specificity to the cell fusion
process. Myeloma cells are first coated with the antigen (or hapten). These
labeled cells are then incubated with spleen cells from an immunized mouse,
whereupon they bind to complementary antibody. Fusion between the two cells can
then be intiated either chemically or by electrofusion. Results from the Phase I
project have indicated that: 1) It is possible to label the surface of myelome
cells with haptens or antigens, 2) Under proper conditions, the labeled cells
are viable, 3) Upon incubation with spleen cells, surface labeled myeloma cells
can find complementary lymphocytes by molecular cell selection, and 4) The
targeted myeloma.lymphocyte dimers can be fused to yield hybridomas. It was also
demonstrated that high speed flow cytometry provides a sensitive method for
monitoring these processes. Now that feasibility has been demonstrated, Phase II
would provide support to investigate optimal conditions for producing hybridomas
via targeted electrofusion. The PI wishes to exploit the technique of targeted
cell electrofusion for more efficient hybridoma production. Conventional
chemical cell fusions result in random generation of hybridomas, most of which
are not producing the desired antibody. The PI here proposes to exploit the
antigen.binding properties of B.lymphocytes to increase the specificity of the
cell fusion process. This would overcome an important limitation to the
commercialization of custom hybridoma production.
