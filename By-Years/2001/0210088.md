The purpose of this study is to capitalize on several mature technologies to
obtain regional and global maps of ionospheric irregularities and some of their
statistical properties (e.g., second moment) by use of diffraction tomography.
In utilizing the GPS signals for 3D mapping of ionospheric irregularities, we
are taking advantage of (1) the growing number of space receivers recording GPS
phase and amplitude data while occulting behind the ionosphere, (2) the very
dense regional networks and large global networks of GPS ground receivers
providing over 30 million links per day through the ionosphere, (3) advances
made in ionospheric tomography and data assimilation techniques, (4) advances
made in diffraction tomography.
