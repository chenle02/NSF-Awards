Dr. Decowski and two undergraduate students from Smith College will participate
in an important, forefront experiment to be carried out at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC). This experiment will provide extensive, high-quality
data on the spin structure of the proton and neutron, structure functions of
critical importance for our understanding of the quark-gluon structure of the
nucleon. Dr. Decowski and his students will be involved in most aspects of the
experiment, including `hands-on` work on improving the detection system during
the summer months. Some data analysis will be carried out by the students at
Smith College during the academic year. This proposal affords an opportunity for
young women at one of the premier womens colleges in the U.S. to participate in
scientific research at the cutting edge.
