9315449 Payne This project is to examine a non-capital-intensive enzymatic
approach for selectively and efficiently removing phenolic contaminants from
intermediate chemical process streams. The approach involves two steps in which
phenol is first converted to its quinone by the enzyme tyrosinase. The quinone
is then adsorbed to a chitosin adsorbent through strong covalent interactions.
The advantage of this approach is due to the substrate specificity of tyrosinase
for phenol, and the strength of the quinone-chitosin adsorption. This process is
thought to be readily adaptable to existing manufacturing operations for
specialty and commodity chemicals. ***
