Proposal Number: ECS-9727208 Principal Investigator: Panos Datskos Title: Novel
photon detectors based on the photo-induced stress of semiconductor
micromechanical devices Abstract The proposal is to use photo-induced stress in
cantilevers fabricated from narrow-gap semiconductors as a means of detecting IR
photons. Either optical or capacitance sensing of the cantilever deflection can
be used as a measure of the IR signal. The work has important potential of being
extended to arrays of cantilever-based detectors.
