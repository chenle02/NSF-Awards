This research interprets seismicity and geodetic data in terms of the geometry
and stressing of locked fault zones which will rupture in large earthquakes. The
studies will be carried out in the framework of the asperity model which regards
a portion of a seismically active fault zone as being effectively locked against
slip, except in large earthquakes, while adjacent portions of the zone slip
aseismically, or with lower level seismicity, and do not accumulate comparable
stress. The initial focus will be on modelling of the Shumagin Islands
subduction segment in Alaska, and the Parkfield region along the San Andreas
fault. This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction
Program.
