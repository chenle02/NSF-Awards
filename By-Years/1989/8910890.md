In this project in the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Richard H. Smith at
Western Maryland College will study "Triazoline Hydrolysis: The Chemistry of
Cyclic Triazenes". Triazenes are a family of organic compounds whose key
structural feature is a chain of three consecutive nitrogen atoms. Triazenes and
their related derivatives are of interest as important substrates for physical
organic chemical and pharmacological studies. The results of these studies will
afford a better understanding of the mechanisms of triazene metabolism and
degradation in cellular systems. The hydrolysis of triazolines, a general model
for cyclic triazenes, is being studied and compared mechanistically to the
corresponding reaction of acyclic triazenes. The mechanism of the hydrolytic
decomposition of triazolines is being systematically explored through kinetic,
product, and structure-reactivity experiments. A new reaction, the cyclization
of 2-haloethyltriazenes leading to the formation of triazolines, is also being
explored through kinetic and product studies. This reaction leads to new classes
of compounds which include tetrahydro-1,2,3-triazines and
tetrahydro-1,2,3-triazepines.
