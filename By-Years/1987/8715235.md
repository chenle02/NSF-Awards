The goal of this project is to research and build a parallel input/output (I/O)
system for a shared-memory multiprocessor. The main applications intended for
this system are parallel database operations with a target performance of 1000
transactions per second. This project is a natural extension of work done at the
University of California, Berkeley in shared-memory multiprocessor architecture
(SPUR project) and database management systems (INGRES and POSTGRES). While many
research results have been obtained in the area of processor and memory design
by a number of research groups, considerable less effort has been directed
towards the issues of I/O design. As processor speeds increase, it becomes more
obvious that I/O operations constitute the bottleneck of parallel systems. Disk
technology is now at the stage where it can provide cost effective high I/O
bandwidth. The specific research objectives are: (1) to investigate new ways to
couple large numbers of I/O devices to multiprocessors without affecting the
limited memory system bandwidth; (2) to explore architectures for I/O
processors; and (3) to implement hardware assists for database applications such
as stable memories, string manipulation co-processors and hardware coherency and
logging mechanisms. This proposal is strongly recommended for funding because:
(1) the principal investigators research records are excellent and the research
environment is extremely stimulating--thus there is a high chance of success;
(2) there is a great need for research in the parallel processing area covered
by this project and it is expected that the impact of this research will be
significant.
