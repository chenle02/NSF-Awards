SRI International proposes to perform three experiments of aeronomic interest.
We will use our new ability to access the quartet manifold of NO for the purpose
of studying the kinetics and spectroscopy of NO (a4>). We will use a beam
technique to make it possible to measure all the vibrational levels of NO(a4>)
up to the dissociation limit. NO(a4>) is a species that is generated in the
terrestrial and Venusian atmospheres by atom recombination, yet is almost
totally unknown in laboratory studies. We will develop a stimulated emission
pump/dump technique, involving high vibrational levels of the NO(B) state, that
will enable us to measure vibrational levels in the NO ground state up to at
least v = 35, well above present limits.
