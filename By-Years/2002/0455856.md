This resource development project would produce two professional development
modules for middle school science teachers, one on Force and Motion (emphasizing
teaching English learners) and the second on Energy and Chemical Change
(emphasizing the integration of literacy). Guides for staff developers would
accompany the resources. These modules will incorporate design principles used
in a previously developed set of elementary science teacher resources. The pilot
and field test populations include teachers of diverse student populations.
Science content, ELL and literacy experts are in included in the review process.
The leadership team benefits from the prior development work. A commercial
publisher has expressed interest in publishing the
resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
