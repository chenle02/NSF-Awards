The results of previous systematic studies of Old World monkeys using
morphological and molecular techniques have been in disagreement. Many possible
relationships have been proposed for members of the tribe Papionini (baboons,
drills, mandrills, macaques and mangabeys), but no previous studies have been
based on nucleotide sequences. The question of these relationships will be
addressed using cytochrome c oxidase (COII) mitochondrial gene nucleotide
sequences to derive phylogeneic hypotheses. This gene is ideal for a study of
Papionini systematics due to its rate of change, lack of recombination, and ease
of study. The results of this study should provide two kinds of valuable
information. First, a better understanding of the phyletic relationships among
Old World monkeys should be possible. Second, by comparing Papionini gene
sequences to those of other primates and non-primate mammals, a better
understanding will emerge of the rate of change in the mitochondrial genome.
This is important since the rate affects conclusions regarding the order and
timing of branching events, and consequently interpretations of the fossil
record both for these primates and for other primate lineages.
