Earth scientists today have unprecedented online access to collected data on
rock compositions. This work aims to expand the capabilities and access to
modeling tools whereby such data can be compared to hypotheses about the Earth.
The alphaMELTS software package provides a flexible, powerful, easy-to-use
interface to a set of successful models and algorithms that apply the theory of
classical thermodynamics to understanding melting and crystallization of igneous
rocks. This grant will enable the creation of the next generation of the
software, interaction with users to implement requested features and support
their modeling efforts, testing and demonstration of new features, optimization
of the package for use in teaching, and publication of its educational features
to encourage wide adoption. The award will fund a Database of MELTS Examples
(DOME) to facilitate quick start-up and reproducibility of results; new solid
solution models; a family of routines for seamless incorporation of alphaMELTS
functionality into any Fortran, C++, Matlab or Python code; Visualization and
analysis tools through coupling to MATLABTM; and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award will enable significant outreach by alphaMELTS developers to the broad
geological instruction and research communities. It will fund two "MELTS camp"
short courses to introduce new users to the software and demonstrate its
capabilities. All software developed under this work will be released free of
charge for use by the community and support under this award will enable dynamic
interaction with the user community for support and implementation of user-
requested features.
