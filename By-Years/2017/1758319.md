This Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program capacity-building project aims to
address the shortage of secondary STEM teachers and the disparity in
underrepresented minority STEM teachers in Chicago and the surrounding
metropolitan area. Dominican University (DU, a private, four-year Hispanic-
serving institution in suburban Chicago) will partner with Triton College (a
public, two-year Hispanic-serving institution) to design a replicable pathway
for potential STEM teacher preparation students to transfer from Triton to DU. A
parallel pathway for high school students interested in teaching careers in STEM
fields will be developed, with the help of STEM teachers from Proviso Math and
Science Academy and Benito Juarez Community Academy, high-needs high schools
with strong STEM programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faculty members from DU's School
of Education and the STEM departments in its Rosary College of Arts and Sciences
will participate in workshops with Triton College STEM faculty members, with the
goal of developing curricular alignment and articulation agreements between the
two institutions. STEM teachers from the Proviso Math and Science Academy (part
of the suburban Proviso Public School District 209) and the Benito Juarez
Community Academy (a Chicago Public School), both of which have high Hispanic
enrollments and strong STEM programs, will engage in partnership-developing
activities such as classroom presentations and campus visits with DU STEM and
Education faculty members. These activities will increase awareness of STEM
teaching as a career option for high-achieving high school students, as well as
DU as a destination university where they could pursue this career path. This
project aims to lay the groundwork for a subsequent Noyce Track 1 Scholarships
and Stipends proposal by developing DU's capacity to recruit, enroll, and
graduate diverse students in STEM fields who could also pursue secondary
teaching licensure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
