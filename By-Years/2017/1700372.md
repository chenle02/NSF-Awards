This research project addresses questions in algebraic combinatorics and
algebraic geometry, areas of mathematics concerned with the description of
symmetry and with the solution of multivariate polynomial equations. The project
involves the study of "state sums" -- a catchall term from statistical mechanics
to describe certain sums of products (typically of polynomials) -- and the study
of topological quantum field theory, which arose in physics and has turned out
to have connections to several areas of modern mathematics. Many important
quantities in algebraic combinatorics can be computed as state sums; these are
often sums over all the labelings of a quadrangulated surface with compatible
tiles, like assembling a jigsaw puzzle. The remarkable fact is that these totals
are frequently independent of the quadrangulation, suggesting that they may have
some more fundamental definition. This project investigates a source from
topological quantum field theory that might unify these state sum results, while
suggesting ways to probe them more deeply. Specifically, changing a
quadrangulation on a surface relates to evolving it through space, which
suggests exploring both higher- and lower-dimensional analogues. This program
has many subprojects suitable for graduate students in mathematics and
statistical mechanics, who will be involved in the research.

This research program comprises two projects. The first project uses inspiration
from quantum field theory and geometric representation theory in an endeavor to
elucidate polynomial formulae arising in algebraic combinatorics. Formulae for
interesting polynomials often take the form of sums of products of linear
polynomials. For example, the "Schubert polynomial" associated to a permutation
can be written as a sum over certain 2-d diagrams for the permutation. The
project will look more deeply into these polynomial formulae, in two steps. The
first step is to see a polynomial as a matrix coefficient inside a time-
evolution operator in a (1+1)-dimensional quantum field theory. Since long-time-
evolution is a composite of many short-time evolutions, the matrix might be
expressed as a product of simpler matrices, giving exactly the sum over
products. The second step is to regard the Hilbert spaces of these quantum field
theories as homology groups of certain algebraic varieties, after the manner of
geometric representation theory. This would naturally imply some commutation
properties of these matrices, such as the Yang-Baxter equation. The second
project aims to develop a generalization of Schubert calculus to chains of
linear subspaces.
