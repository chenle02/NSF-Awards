This award will maintain the Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory (TUNL) as
a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site. A diverse research program
in low-energy nuclear physics is conducted at TUNL by researchers from the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, North Carolina State University,
and Duke University where the laboratory is located. This REU summer program
provides undergraduate students with a realistic and active research experience
through the completion of a self-contained 10-week project. The students
collaborate with faculty, postdoctoral and pre-doctoral research staff from the
three major research institutions, and are exposed to the graduate programs at
these institutions. Through active research, seminars, lab tours, and discussion
groups, the students are exposed to various aspects of nuclear physics research
and its impact on other areas of research. The student acceptance process mainly
targets students from small colleges and universities across the country who
have limited opportunities to be involved in active research programs.
