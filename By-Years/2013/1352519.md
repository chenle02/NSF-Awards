Redshifted emission from the 21cm hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen has
gained considerable attention as a unique tracer of the primordial intergalactic
medium. This award will enable the PI to develop the foundation of a next
generation of 21cm cosmology instrumentation, incorporating techniques and
principles learned from his current Precision Array to Probe the Epoch of
Reionization (PAPER) experiment. The PI will construct three prototype multi-
element experiments that will allow him to study three distinct cosmological
epochs: the cosmic dark ages, the epoch of reionization, and the onset of baryon
acoustic oscillations. The antenna designs and digitization electronics from
these experiments will in turn provide invaluable information on techniques to
remove contaminating astrophysical foregrounds in future instruments.

The birth of the first luminous objects (stars, black holes) in the universe
that ultimately stems from the Big Bang is one of the last unexplored phases of
cosmic evolution. The instruments that will be produced as part of this award
will facilitate transformational science in this area, and will provide key
constraints on the large-scale structure of the universe, as well as the
evolution of cosmological expansion. The award will also enable the PI to train
the next generation of instrument builders by offering internships for students
at UC Berkeley's Radio Astronomy Laboratory. Finally, the PI will produce
numerous public-domain pedagogical videos, which will enable a cadre of
instrumentalists and students to quickly acquire basic proficiency in radio-
astronomy instrumentation.
