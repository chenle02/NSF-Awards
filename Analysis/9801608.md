DMS-9801608 Alexander R. Its The research project is focused on the analytical
aspects of the theory of integrable systems related to the Riemann-Hilbert and
isomonodromy methods. The problems under consideration include the asymptotic
analysis of the correlation functions of exactly solvable quantum field and
statistical mechanics models, the investigation of the double scaling limits in
the theory of random matrices and orthogonal polynomials, and the global
asymptotic analysis of the solutions of integrable differential equations of the
Painleve' and KdV types. The theory of integrable systems is an expanding area
which plays an increasingly important role as one of the principal sources of
new analytical and algebraic ideas for many branches of modern mathematics and
theoretical physics. Simultaneously, it provides an efficient analytic tool for
the study of some of the fundamental mathematical models which play a central
role in numerous applications arising in modern nonlinear science and
technology. Specifically, the research directions indicated above deal with the
mathematical models which form the theoretical basis for the following fields:
condensed matter, high energy and plasma physics, nonlinear hydrodynamics, and
high bit-rate telecommunication systems.
