The project will fund a workshop on the social aspects of data science using
historical, philosophical, and social scientific methods. It will be held at Cal
Poly in the fall of 2016. The workshop will bring together historians,
philosophers, anthropologists, and sociologists of data science. They will work
together to design a science and technology studies research agenda for data
science. Faculty and students engaged in social, historical and ethical studies
of data science will be invited to participate. The workshop will contribute to
the advancement of knowledge about data science. It will further understanding
of social and cultural aspects of data science. It will professionalize and
train students. The workshop's publications will increase society?s
understanding of data science by discussing the how, what, who, where and why of
data science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will establish of a
multi-disciplinary, multi-generational, and multi-institutional science and
technology studies (STS) research agenda on data science. It is designed to be
an agenda-setting workshop involving both experts and the general public to
produce a research strategy and agenda. The workshop will focus on data
science's communication patterns, tools, styles of work, analytical habits,
standards, visual strategies, and professional ethics. Presentations will
document the emerging social facets of data science research cultures by using
historical, philosophical, and social scientific methods. The workshop will
offer an opportunity for STS to apply its methods to a new scientific profession
and provide STS with a chance to situate itself as a key stakeholder in the
professionalization process. The workshop will increase the documentation and
understanding of data science beyond the technical profession.
