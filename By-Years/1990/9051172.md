Seminole Community College is developing a laboratory course in DNA science, in
which lower division nonscience and science majors perform exciting experiments
in modern molecular biology. Using gel electrophoresis equipment,
microcentrifuges and a shaking water bath, students make and analyze recombinant
DNA molecules and transform E. coli cells with recombinant plasmids. Students
verify transformations by replicate plating and by isolating, purifying, and
analyzing the plasmid DNA in the transformed cells. Using a white light/camera
system, students can accurately visualize and record their results. In this
course students learn the basics of an exciting new technology while mastering
the scientific method. During the semester length course, there is enough time
to grasp theoretical concepts, perform basic molecular biology experiments,
analyze data, critically evaluate the experimental design, and discuss the
potential risks of such techniques. The college will contribute 106% of the NSF
award.
