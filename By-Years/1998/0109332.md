With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor
Richard C. Larock, of the Department of Chemistry at Iowa State University, is
studying novel palladium migration chemistry. Intramolecular palladium migration
from an alkyl group to an arene or from an aryl group to another aryl group in
biphenyl derivatives, followed by subsequent functionalization, offers promise
for the synthesis of a variety of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and
heterocycles. Professor Larock is exploring the generality and scope of these
novel migration/functionalization processes. Palladium also migrates "through
space" from a vinylic position to an aryl position, affording access to
9-alkylidenefluorenes. Additional migration reactions can lead to synthetically
useful pi-allylpalladium complexes, acylpalladium intermediates, and
imidoylpalladium species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Palladium is arguably the single
most versatile metal employed in modern organic synthesis. A remarkable array of
organopalladium species have been generated and shown to undergo a multitude of
synthetically useful processes. This versatility is being broadened still
further by the work of Professor Richard C. Larock, of the Department of
Chemistry at Iowa State University. With the support of the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Larock is exploring novel reactions
in which easily accessible organopalladium species undergo rearrangement through
migration of the palladium atom to new sites within a molecule. In this way, new
intermediates are generated, from which may be prepared a variety of cyclic
organic compounds. By virtue of the unique structures afforded by these reaction
sequences, new synthetic strategies for the preparation of the complex molecules
forming the basis of the modern chemical industry are presented.
