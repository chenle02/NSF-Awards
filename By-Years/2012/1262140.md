The goal of this project is to obtain further understanding of the structure of
complete noncompact manifolds. The general theme is that understanding the
solutions of some partial differential equations in terms of curvature can be
used to obtain more information about the geometry and topology of the manifold.
In this context, the PI will study bounds on the bottom of spectrum of the
Laplacian in terms of the Ricci curvature and use the spectral information to
study the structure of the manifold. The PI will also study geometric and
analytic properties of complete gradient Ricci solitons, aiming at a better
understanding of the singularities of the Ricci flow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed project will lead to a better understanding of the shape and structure
of infinite geometric objects. These objects, called manifolds, appear
frequently in science because physical laws can be modeled by certain partial
differential equations on manifolds. Understanding the structure of manifolds is
important in many fields, such as black holes and worm holes in physics, the
structure of molecules in chemistry or the motion of liquid crystal in
engineering. Partial differential equations have been a fundamental tool in
geometry, for example the Ricci flow has been used to classify the shape of all
three dimensional manifolds. Further advances in the study of geometric partial
differential equations on manifolds would lead to new discoveries applicable to
many areas of mathematics and science.
