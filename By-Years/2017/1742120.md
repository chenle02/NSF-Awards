Palo Alto College (PAC) will provide scholarships for 39 academically talented
biology and bioscience students and address the challenge community colleges
face in providing experiential research opportunities to students. The project
combines scholarship support, faculty mentoring, and peer tutoring with Projects
of Discovery (PODs), a course-based approach to involving community college
students in interdisciplinary research. This method of instruction, involving
both STEM and non-STEM classes, is expected to improve students' self-efficacy,
making it more likely that students will persist in their major. PAC is a
federally designated Hispanic Serving Institution, and this work will provide
significant insights into recruiting and retaining HSI students into STEM
careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to increase the number of
academically talented biology and bioscience majors who transfer from a
community college and graduate with a bachelor's degree in a STEM field within
six years. Integrating research on the best practices in persistence and
retention strategies for Hispanic STEM majors, the project will address key
academic, cognitive, and socio-cultural factors that influence Hispanic
students' success in STEM degree attainment and will advance understanding of
these issues while promoting teaching, training, and learning through faculty
mentorship, peer interactions, and cohort building activities. The PODs
developed will require only minor changes to established course modules and will
assist other community colleges in implementing similar PODs-based research
opportunities to support STEM majors in gaining the self-confidence, science
identity, and cognitive skills that undergraduate research experiences provide.
The knowledge generation activities will examine how course-based undergraduate
research opportunities engage students at a Hispanic-Serving Institution, and
improve persistence and completion outcomes at a Hispanic-Serving community
college.
