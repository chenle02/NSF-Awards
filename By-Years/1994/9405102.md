9405102 Proakis This research will investigate and demonstrate solutions to
known problems in indoor wireless systems. Solutions will be demonstrated
analytically and experimentally, at a wireless multiple-access testbed under
development at Northeastern University. Both the baseband transmitter files and
acquisition attributes for this testbed are fully programmable, and the
researcher can demonstrate novel transmission and reception techniques on actual
radio frequency data directly in the Matlab environment. For the duration of
this grant, the investigator will address low-cost antenna diversity techniques,
low-complexity demodulation schemes for dynamic fading channels, the
localization of transmitters within the antenna field, the prediction of deep
fades via localization, and the prediction and cancellation of intrabuilding
interference (from office equipment and other wireless transmitters). During the
24-month period, the research associate will specify novel multiuser
communication system architectures with application to hospital patient
monitoring and to general indoor wireless networks. Broader applications will
also be devised, including the development and implementation of multiuser
detection algorithms, wavelet-based signal design, and channel waveform design
for asynchronous multiple-access systems. ***
