Analysis of atmospheric infrared absorption spectra and recent developments in
infrared laser technology has lead to the development of a new and innovative
laser hygrometer. The proposed new laser hygrometer offers an outstanding
combination of accuracy, sensitivity, and response speed, coupled with high
reliability and repeatability in harsh environments, non- cryogenic operation,
compact size, low power consumption, and modest cost. The Phase I research
objectives include design and construction of a proof-of-concept laser
hygrometer, verification of its principal of operation and response function,
plus research on a Phase II hygrometer design and Phase II work plan.
