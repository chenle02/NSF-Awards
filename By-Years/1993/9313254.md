9313254 Lawley Semisolid alloy slurries can exhibit thixotropic behavior.
Thixoforming is an innovative technique for the net shape processing of alloys
and composites with attendant integrity of microstructure and mechanical
properties. The study will use spray cast materials which exhibit a fine
equiaxed grain structure devoid of dendrites. The goals of the proposed
experimental-analytical-computational research program are to understand the
physical mechanisms of flow in spray cast materials in the semisolid regime
under conditions that simulate semisolid processing operations, develop a
constitutive model that will accurately represent this behavior, develop
computational procedures that will facilitate the analysis, design and
optimization of semisolid processing of spray cast materials and assess the
microstructural integrity and mechanical properties of thixoformed alloys and
metal matrix composites. ***
