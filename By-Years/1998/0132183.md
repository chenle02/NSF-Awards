This proposal will support two workshops between Chinese and US researchers in
the digital library area, to work towards a major international collaboration in
the creation of a very large digital book collection. The workshops will provide
coordination in scanning technology, the choice of materials to be scanned, the
organization of the delivery of the material to be scanned, and the disposition
of the resulting digital content.
