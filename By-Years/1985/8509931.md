Supercritical fluid solvents which exhibit pressure-dependent dissolving power
will be investigated for the fractionation of refractory polymers whose
performance characteristics can be enhanced markedly if the molecular weight
ranges can be narrowed. In the Phase I research, functionally-terminated
polysiloxanes, polysilanes, and functionally-terminated perfluoroalkylpolyether
polymers used as high performance surfactants, photo-resists, and liquid crystal
precursors and considerably lower polydispersities were achieved by
supercritical fluid fractionation. Additional polymers of interest will be
identified in phase II and a continuous fractionation process for these polymers
will be developed. For polymers of particular interest, distribution
coefficients of various polymer fractions between the feed solvent and the
supercritical extraction fluid also will be measured. These coefficients will be
useful for the design of future commercial plymer fractionation processes.
