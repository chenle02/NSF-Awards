The conference/workshop PREPARING FOR A NEW CALCULUS is bringing together eighty
leaders in mathematics curriculum reform, including calculus reform, school
mathematics reform in light of the NCTM Curriculum Standards, and educational
technology initiatives. The deliberations of this conference will focus on the
implications of the emerging calculus courses on school mathematics training,
and on how recent developments in content and methods in high school mathematics
will impact the calculus courses. The primary product of this conference will be
a set of action oriented recommendations addressing these issues and
strengthening the ties between these reform movements. A proceedings document
will be distributed nationally to disseminate these recommendations.
