The proposal provides travel support for students from educational institutions
in the United States to attend the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) Week 2018 in
Porto, Portugal, from 10-13 April 2018. CPS Week is an annual international
multi-conference event for the cyber-physical systems researchers. It is the
premier event for the global CPS research community where the latest advances in
theory and applications are discussed. This year the week-long event hosts four
major multi-day conferences, twelve one-day workshops, five one-day tutorials,
and three CPS competitions.

CPS is an active and dynamic research area that is rapidly growing. This
proposal provides travel for U.S. students to attend CPS Week, which provides a
unique opportunity for the students to learn about the state of the science and
technology in CPS research. They have the opportunity to attend keynote lectures
and presentations, discuss posters with the authors, see demonstrations of
advanced CPS technologies and, generally, engage with CPS researcher leaders in
academia, industry and government.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
