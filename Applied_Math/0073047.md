This project addresses several topics at the interface between mathematics,
physics, and materials science. One theme is epitaxial growth, particularly the
task of linking microscopic and macroscopic descriptions of growth. A second
theme is the interaction of bulk and surface energies, which determine the
structure of defects and the selection of patterns in diverse systems such as
stressed films and dielectric fluids. A third theme is the analysis of composite
microstructure, where methods developed for image processing seem to offer fresh
opportunities.

Materials have structure on many length scales. The tasks of (a) predicting this
structure, and (b) understanding its consequences, are among the major
challenges of modern materials science. Mathematical methods such as
homogenization, asymptotic analysis, and multiresolution methods can help. This
project will develop and apply such methods in the context of specific material
systems, leading to enhanced understanding of those systems and improvement of
the mathematical methods themselves
