This project is an investigation into the fundamentals of flows involving free
liquid-liquid or liquid-air interfaces where surface tension effects are
dominant. The approach adopted is four-pronged and consists of modeling,
analysis, computations, and comparisons with experiments, and it aims to
establish theoretical and physically realistic models that are capable of
describing phenomena of technological and strategic interest. Interfacial flows
where surface tension is dominant arise in a plethora of classical and novel
applications, including ink-jet printing and related technologies (DNA assays),
solder-jet technologies and related advanced manufacturing processes, industrial
emulsion processes, coating technologies, microfluidics and lab-on-a-chip
technologies, and, micro- and nano-encapsulation techniques with applications to
pharmaceutical slow drug release systems.

This project aims to contribute to understanding of such flows and in particular
to incorporate, model, and analyze the effects of electric fields on the spatio-
temporal interfacial dynamics which can lead to interfacial rupture (this is
manifested as a singularity of the mathematical models). Another scope of the
project is the use of electric fields in micron-sized multi-fluid systems where
a controlled outcome is desired, for example enhanced mixing as in lab-on-a-chip
technologies, or stabilization of capillary instability leading to longer
threads as in extrusion processes or crystal growth liquid bridge geometries.

The research will develop novel nonlinear mathematical models capable of
describing the phenomena referred to above and will use these to find
mathematical solutions and describe their structure close to possible singular
events. These solutions will in turn be used to guide and evaluate direct
numerical simulations of the full problem with the aim of establishing simpler
yet physically meaningful models that are highly efficient computationally,
opening the way for large parametric studies of the phenomena. The mathematical
study will also be used to obtain simple observable quantities, resulting from
complex dynamics, that can be useful in experimental efforts.
