Jay Switzer, Department of Chemistry, University of Missouri-Rolla, is jointly
supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
and the Solid State Chemistry Program for studies of nanostructured metal oxide
semiconductors. Using various electrodeposition techniques, Switzer will prepare
magnetic metal oxide superlattices, size-and shape-focused metal oxide
nanostructures and epitaxial metal oxide layers on single-crystal silicon, gold,
copper and indium phosphide. The metal oxides of interest include copper oxide,
zinc oxide and iron oxide. Electrodeposition allows control of the applied
potential, current and solution pH during electrodeposition, leading to control
of the composition as well as the size and shape of the growing crystalline
nanostructure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These nanostructured crystalline metal
oxides have widespread potential applications in electronics, specifically giant
magnetoresistance, spintronics and anisotropic electronic components. This
interdisciplinary research area will also provide training for students and
research associates in the important area of nanoscience.
