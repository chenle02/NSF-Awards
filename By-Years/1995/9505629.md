Sposito 9505629 Simulation methodologies developed recently by the Principal
Investigator and his coworkers will be applied to perform Monte Carlo (MC) and
molecular dynamics (MD) calculations of molecular configurations at the
interface between 2:1 clay minerals and aqueous solution. Quantum chemical
calculations of clay mineral molecular structure also will be performed to
examine the accuracy of the potential functions used in the simulations. The
project objectives are: (1) to perform and evaluate MC and MD simulations of
hydrated Li+, Na+, K+, Cs2+, and Mg2+-saturated 2:1 clay minerals to deduce the
configurations, mobilities, and reactivities of adsorbed water molecules and
counter-ions; (2) to perform ab initio quantum chemical calculations of the
counter -ion-clay mineral potential energy surface for monovalent and bivalent
cation-saturated 2:1 clay minerals to improve the accuracy of the MC/MD
simulations. The results will be compared with a variety of experimental data,
and will provide general comparative insights as to the structure of the
interface between 2:1 clay minerals and aqueous solutions that are relevant to
low-temperature geochemical weathering processes.
