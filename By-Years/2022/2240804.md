The NSF travel grant will allow the Society for Social Studies of Science (4S)
to support graduate students by way of travel awards to attend its annual
professional conference. These meetings are the primary scholarly event in the
interdisciplinary academic field of science and technology studies (STS) and
serve as a locus of professionalization and network-building beyond the
student’s local departmental. The 4S annual meeting brings together a range of
international and interdisciplinary scholars who share the common goal of
understanding the development of science, technology, and medicine and the way
they interact within varying social contexts. Participation in these meetings
expose graduate students to professional networks, allowing them to receive
feedback and mentoring from senior scholars in their field; keep abreast of
developments in their area; and disseminate the results of their own research,
ultimately supporting the next generation of scholars in STS. Travel grants
ensure that access to the conference is equitable and produces a diverse cohort
of graduate student attendees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of graduate
student participation in the annual meeting also extends beyond the field. Past
NSF travel grants have funded students in a wide range of disciplines, including
religious studies, history, medical and cultural anthropology, sociology,
innovation and technology management, veterinary science, psychology, geography,
communication and media studies, and gender studies. In this way, the benefits
of NSF funding are wide–ranging-encompassing not just those working directly
within science and technology studies. Facilitating student attendance at the
annual meeting is critical for creating engaged and informed teachers,
researchers, and policy makers, potentially impacting countless undergraduate
students and the direction of social policy. STS graduates go on to work in a
variety of settings–from universities to start-ups to the Office of Science and
Technology Policy–bringing knowledge of the social factors necessary to bring
about sustained and equitable science and technology innovation in our
society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
