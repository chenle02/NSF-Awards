This proposal is for two one-week workshops for 20 social scientists, each
covering techniques of exploratory data analysis using a statistical package
particularly suited for graphical data analysis, Stata. Participants will
develop skills in using and teaching robust statistics, analytical graphics, and
data transformations. Exploratory data analytic techniques, such as data
smoothing, median polishing, re-scaling, and transforming data using the ladder
of powers, five number summaries, box and whisker plots, and stem and leaf
charts, will be emphasized. The workshop will also illustrate pedagogical
methods for teaching EDA techniques at the undergraduate level. The significance
of the project to undergraduate faculty and students lies in the use of
exploratory data analysis techniques as interesting and useful alternatives to
traditional confirmatory statistics. Faculty who have training through the level
of multiple regression will be accepted for one week, while a two-day longer
workshop will accept faculty whose training is up to the multiple regression
level. In both cases, faculty will have responsibility for the required
methodological courses in their disciplines.
