This award provides one-half the funds necessary to acquire an automated X-ray
diffraction spectrometer system for use with powdered samples. The equipment
will be installed and operated by the Geophysical Laboratory of the Carnegie
Institution of Washington. The Carnegie Institution is committed to providing
the remaining funds. The primary use of the equipment will be to identify and
characterize samples of minerals and related synthetic materials in connection
with research in mineral physics, crystallography, experimental petrology,
geochemistry and biogeochemistry.
