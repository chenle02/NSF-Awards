The submitted proposal is to request funds from the National Science Foundation
in support of organizing the Optoelectronics Industry Development Association's
(OIDA) 2004 Annual Forum. The object is to share information between academic
researchers and industrialists, thus leading to timely feedback between the
participants that will lead to increased industrially related fundamental
research. This integrated approach will ensure seamless exchange and optimal
fulfillment of the needs of both industry and academia.

NSF, DARPA, and OIDA will jointly sponsor the OIDA annual forum for the purpose
of discussing industrial trends and needs, new technology breakthroughs and
public policies with an audience consisting of industrialists, government
policymakers and academia. This extensive exchange of information will promote a
smooth transition of technologies, adaptation of policies to meet the real needs
of both industries and academia. In addition, students in training will be given
an early vision of their possible careers.
