This award supports the research in Automorphic Forms of Professor Michael
Harris of Brandeis University. Dr. Harris's research project is to study the
number-theoretic properties of holomorphic and nonholomorphic automorphic forms,
and relations with special values of L-functions. His principal tool for attack
of his chosen problems will be the cohomology of the toroidal compactification
of Shimura varieties. Non-Euclidean plane geometry began in the early nineteenth
century as a mathematical curiosity, but by the end of that century,
mathematicians had realized that many objects of fundamental importance are non-
Euclidean in their basic nature. The detailed study of non-Euclidean plane
geometries has given rise to several branches of modern mathematics, of which
the study of Modular and Automorphic Forms is one of the most active. This field
is principally concerned with questions about the whole numbers, but in its use
of Geometry and Analysis, it retains connection to its historical roots.
