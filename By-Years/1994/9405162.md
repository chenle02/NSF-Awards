9405162 Wiltschko In many fold and thrust belts faults are found more commonly
in weak lithologies such as mudrocks. Despite this, little is known about the
micromechanical behavior of mudrock, principle because of the very small grain
size and the difficulty of performing laboratory experiments with the material
this project is designed to determine the characters and mechanics of mudrock
deformation is natural, small displacement, thrust fault zones using a
combinations of observation techniques ta several scales. Results will be
compared to data sets on mudrock fabrics that are the result of burial
diagenesis, and with a set of experimented deformation of mudrock samples. This
work is expected to help understand in a more quantitative way the mechanical
properties of natural thrust fault zones.
