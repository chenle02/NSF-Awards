Multilayer coatings vastly improve the performance of most x-ray optical
elements and allow operation at angles and wavelengths otherwise inaccessible.
They have been used successfully in analytical instruments, astronomical
telescopes on satellites, and in plasma diagnostic instruments, and will likely
be an important component of x-ray microlithography exposure systems in the
semiconductor industry. Multilayers made by conventional techniques are not as
reflective as theory predicts. They do not reflect the short wavelength x-rays
of interest in medicine and nondestructive testing. To solve these problems, we
propose the fabrication of multilayers by using atomic layer epitaxy to produce
thinner layers with smoother, more abrupt interfaces than can be made by
traditional methods.
