"Big Science" in which scientific research most typically must be carried out
by a large team of scientists and technicians and which frequently is organized
around extraordinarily expensive and large instruments has been a part of some
sciences for centuries. The great expeditions of exploration of the 18th and
19th centuries -- Darwin's voyage on the Beagle, for example, or the Lewis and
Clarke Expedition or the voyages of discovery of Captain Cooke in the South
Pacific -- are in a sense "big science" projects. The large telescopes built in
the 19th and early 20th centuries represent another kind of "big science." The
current paradigm of big science, however, is represented by the giant particle
accelerators in high energy physics. In truth, however, big science is becoming
pervasive throughout science and it has become increasingly clear that to
establish a more effective policy for science, we need a better understanding
how "big science" works and how it affects the social organization of science.
Historians of science have increasingly become interested in the development of
big science since World War II and there is now a substantial group of scholars
at work on topics in this area. Dr. Peter Galison, one of the leaders of this
area of study in the history of science, has organized a working conference in
order to compare and synthesize findings from several different case studies.
From these case studies, he hopes to discuss methodological issues and the wider
implications of this work, and to bring together science administrators and
historians of business and technology with historians of science in order to
gain a broader perspective on this problem. The conference will be held August
25 to 27 at Stanford University. The results will be published.
