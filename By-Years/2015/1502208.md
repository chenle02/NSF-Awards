This award supports the US CLIVAR Project Office (USCPO) for the next five
years. US CLIVAR (ClImate VARiability and predictability) is a long-term
research program which seeks to&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Understand the role of
the oceans in observed climate variability on different timescales.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Understand the processes that contribute to climate
variability and change in the past, present, and future. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*
Better quantify uncertainty in the observations, simulations, predictions, and
projections of climate variability and change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Improve
the development and evaluation of climate simulations and predictions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Collaborate with research and operational communities
that develop and use climate information. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds from this
award cover USCPO staffing, travel by US scientists to participate in US CLIVAR
meetings, costs associated with open science workshops, and outreach and
communication efforts necessary to communicate US CLIVAR findings and
opportunities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal
enables development of new community-driven scientific plans, coordination of
research activity implementation, and provides assistance to US research
programs so they can more effectively engage with the research community and
address shared research goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;US CLIVAR has broader
impacts through its work in organizing the research community to pursue topics
which are of societal relevance as well as scientific interest. US CLIVAR
research is motivated by a desire to anticipate forms of climate variability and
change that have important human consequences. In addition, US CLIVAR activities
include efforts to work with stakeholders, decision makers, and long-range
operational forecasters to ensure that research results of interest to these
communities are effectively communicated.
