The goals of the proposal research are to (1) develop key technologies in two
critical areas of nanofabrication: ultra-high resolution electron beam
lithography and reactive ion etching; (2) use the existing nanofabrication
technologies (sub-30 nm) developed in the PI's group to fabricate various
innovative high- speed nanoscale devices, such as lateral resonant tunneling
transistors, quantum waveguide transistors, and single electron transistors; and
(3) use these devices as research vehicles to study ballistic, quantum
transport, and Coulomb blockade in nanometer devices, develop new device
concepts, and explore new device functions and revolutionary IC architectures.
