This work is to make available a multiple-stimulator tactile array device
mounted on a mouse. This device will provide a capability for the finger to
sense patterns, texture or variations in the surface of an image. It is designed
specifically to provide tactile perception of surface texture in images derived
from a scanning tunneling electron microscope (STM). The electrical potentials
generated by the scanning tip of an STM are translated into multiple-colored
pictures portraying surface geometry. This device will augment visual output to
enable multi-sensory perception in STM and it will be useful in many other
human-computer interacton environments.
