This award provides continuing support for a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates Site in the Department of Bacteriology at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison. The program will provide an intensive summer research
experience for ten undergraduate students in microbiology, molecular biology and
related fields. Extra effort will be taken to recruit qualified students who are
women, minority or disabled, and/or who otherwise have limited research
opportunities at their own institution. The goal of the program is to stimulate
promising young scientists to pursue careers in research. The Department of
Bacteriology has an internationally recognized research faculty, committed to
both undergraduate and graduate education, who will direct individual laboratory
research projects. Participating students will work as part of a dynamic
research team who are investigating basic questions in these areas of biology.
Students will become familiar with the research techniques of microbiology
molecular biology and biochemistry using modern equipment and facilities. The
Department has an established record of providing research opportunities for its
own undergraduate students and has successfully managed a summer research
program for REU students (and related students) in 1988.
