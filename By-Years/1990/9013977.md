This award will support collaborative research in applied mathematics between
Dr. George Baker, Los Alamos National Laboratory and Professor P.R. Graves-
Morris, Bradford University, West Yorkshire, England. The objective of this
investigation is to develop the theory and practice of approximation methods,
based on Taylor series expansions which go beyond the first Riemann sheet. The
proposed work will be based on approximations by the solution of differential
equations. The investigators will apply recently developed theoretical
techniques, develop new ones and supplement them by numerical investigations.
The results of this research are expected to have wide applica- tions. One case
in point is the theory of critical phenomena, which has suffered from lack of
methods to interpret adequately the complex singular structure at some of the
harder critical points. Both Dr. Baker and Dr. Graves Morris are established
mathematical physicists, who have made important contributions to the theory of
applications of Pade approximants.
