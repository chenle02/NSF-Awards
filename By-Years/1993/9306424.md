9306424 Navia This Phase II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project
deals with the development of crosslinked enzyme crystals (CLEC) and their
catalytic applications to organic synthesis. Specifically, crystalline esterase
and lipase enzymes will be crosslinked with glutaraldehyde to form immobilized
enzyme particles which can be lyophilized and stored. These CLECs will remain
catalytically active and retain their mechanical integrity under harsh
manufacturing conditions. CLEC particles are individual crystals and will not
require inert support structures. Their well-defined facets will promote the
formation of monodisperse suspensions that will facilitate the scale-up of
enzyme-based processes to commercial volumes, particularly in organic solvents.
The research will focus on CLECs of lipase and esterase enzymes used by the
chemical industry in the manufacture of chiral intermediates and
pharmaceuticals. %%% This SBIR Phase II project will continue the advances
initially started in the Phase I studies. An important goal of the SBIR Program
is the ultimate conversion of NSF-supported research into technological
innovation and commercialization. ***
