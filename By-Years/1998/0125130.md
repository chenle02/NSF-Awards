Mathematical Sciences (21)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Materials are being developed
for an activity-based college geometry course using Geometer's Sketchpad. The
project addresses the DUE themes of teacher preparation and integration of
technology into education. Subsequent work will develop a textbook for the
geometry course required for teacher candidates at various institutions. This
idea has been discussed with the acquisitions' editor at Key College Publishing,
the distributor of Geometer's Sketchpad. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than ten
years experience each using an activity-based approach, cooperative learning,
and mathematical software to teach calculus, discrete mathematics, and abstract
algebra has demonstrated the effectiveness of these approaches. This project
applies these pedagogical strategies to college geometry. The course materials
are engaging students in exploratory activities designed to develop their
intuitive understanding of geometric concepts. Students use interactive geometry
software to construct geometric figures, make and test conjectures about these
constructions, and create proofs based upon their constructions. Through
productive group interactions, students are being guided toward constructing
increasingly robust mathematical proofs. Most students served by this course are
future teachers. Since teachers often teach as they were taught, it is important
to model pedagogical strategies consistent with the recommendations of the
National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM). The project materials model
such strategies, and are suitable for an introduction to formal mathematical
reasoning in a first or second proof-course. This is a valuable course for any
mathematics student, but particularly so for those intending to become teachers
of mathematics.
