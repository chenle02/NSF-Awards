Sensors that are biocompatible and biodegradable and are mechanically flexible
and conform to soft tissues and organs in the human body are highly desirable as
they provide a means to measure and monitor activity. In this research,
biodegradable silk will be engineered and fabricated for testing of measurement
feasibility of biomarkers that are indicative of pathology.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will investigate various electrochemical
biosensor designs (1D wires, 2D sheets and 3D blocks) using biodegradable silk
and conducting polymers in flexible and conformable formats for measuring such
model biomarkers as acetylcholine, C-reactive protein, vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF). The innovation proposed is the method of fabricating
functional biosensors comprising the conducting polymer poly
(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and silk
proteins (fibroin and sericin) via techniques developed by silk protein
lithography. The structure-property relationships of fabricated biosensors will
be investigated through the following specific aims. (1) Investigate the
compositional relationships that enhance electrochemical response and mechanical
properties, and enable their selective detection, and (2) Investigate sensor
fabrication strategies for sensors in multi-scales and dimensions (1-D wires, 2D
sheets, and 3D scaffold network) so that they can conform to soft tissue.
Appropriate recognition elements (antibody and aptamers) will be immobilized on
electrode surface against the target analyte. Sensor response and mechanical
properties will be engineered for conformable attachment to the target soft
tissue while minimizing cytotoxicity. Feasibility sensor experiments will be
conducted in vitro using stock seeds of cells under physiological conditions.
Reproducibility of sensor response will be characterized and sensor design will
be modified to accommodate required sensitivity, selectivity, and
reproducibility. Education and outreach activities are proposed. Haptic and 3D
printed models of micro and nanoscale objects will be fabricated to give
students a direct visualization and textural feel for the various kinds of
sensor architectures. Sharing of these in annual outreach activities organized
by the PI will help inspire young students into engineering and science careers.
