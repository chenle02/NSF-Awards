This is a Minority Research Initiation planning grant proposal. The proposed
research will explore acousto-electricity as an alternative method for analyzing
stress/strain of loaded structural members (i.e. to locate regions of high
stress where failures may initiate). This method of measurement is contactless
and would possess certain advantages over present methods which require contact.
The planning grant will provide funds to support a well-trained minority
scientist to plan and write a competitive proposal for submission to the MRI
research initiation component. During the planning process the investigator will
conduct an exhaustive literature review, establish consultative relationships
with appropriate scientific experts, and evaluate the feasibility of the
proposed project from results obtained from preliminary small scale experiments.
