The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program is supporting Prof. K.
Ruedenberg at Iowa State University. The research to be carried out over the
next two years will focus on the development of a new quantum chemical theory
that will result in corresponding new computational chemistry codes. The
objective is the quantitative determination of atoms in molecules within the
framework of rigorous ab-initio theory, and the quantitative expression of
binding energies in terms of interactions between such atoms. The deformed atoms
are determined through their optimal wave functions in terms of orbitals
restricted to the full-valence-space MCSCF molecular orbital space. Oriented
quasiatomic orbitals, maximally involved in specific bonds and with unambiguous
electron populations, are determined through a density matrix analysis. The
binding energy appears as the sum of contributions due to intra-atomic promotion
and inter-atomic non-bonded repulsion, electron sharing and charge transfer. The
energy gain due to charge transfer is identified by determining the optimal
molecular MCSCF wave function without charge transfer. The covalent energy gain
is derived from the configurations representing electron migrations between
atoms. The analysis applies to non-equilibrium as well as to equilibrium
geometries and will be extended beyond the full valence space. Although for two
centuries chemical experimentation has been effectively guided by the concept of
molecules being built from atoms, major unsolved problems have persisted to this
day regarding the theoretical foundation of this well established empirical
model and it has not yet been quantified within the context of rigorous quantum
mechanical calculations. This is because the atoms-in-molecules concept is, in
fact, not a fundamental one in basic theory. Recently, the Ruedenberg research
group has developed a new analysis that is able to identify atomic sub-units in
rigorous molecular calculations. With the help of this theoretical approach,
atoms, as well as the interactions between them, will be quantitatively
determined in molecules. The method to be developed is expected to make the
results of theoretical computations more useful for practical chemical work by
relating them more directly to the intuitive reasoning of experimentalists.
