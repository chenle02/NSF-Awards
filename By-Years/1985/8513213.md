The overall goal of this project is to assess and improve robustness in chemical
plant design and control. Robust plant designs were developed, based on singular
value sensitivities of robustness indices. At the same time, robust
decentralized control systems for interconnected process systems were also
developed. Current work includes extension of previous research to large-scale
systems, and its application to non-linear control systems.
