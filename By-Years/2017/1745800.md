This grant supports student travel for select students to participate in the
Doctoral Consortium (DC) at the International Conference on Automated Planning
and Scheduling (ICAPS), to be held in June 2017 in Pittsburgh, PA. ICAPS is a
top-tier conference for researchers and practitioners to share and learn from
each other in the field of planning and scheduling using artificial intelligence
techniques. This consortium is oriented on research and career development for
students who have identified their PhD topics and are just embarking on that
independent research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sponsoring student travel to ICAPS
fosters a community of research in theoretical and algorithmic advances in
planning and scheduling, as well as a range of applications of such automated
planning, such as in manufacturing, health care, logistics, space systems,
software engineering, robotics, and entertainment. The entire event provides an
opportunity for students to engage in discussion with scientists from around the
world and to explore new research directions and topics.
