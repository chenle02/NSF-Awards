Routine bulk quantitative analysis of rocks and minerals presents unique
problems. Many of the analytical techniques currently used for this purpose
require extensive sample preparation involving dissolution of the material in
question. This is unsatisfactory since it potentially introduces errors
resulting from additional sample handling and preferential dissolution of some
analytes. Glow discharge mass spectrometry (GDMD) utilizing a direct current
discharge source overcomes the problem of sample preparation because it a direct
solid sampling technique. There are however, no commercially available GDMS
instruments which can analyze insulating samples such as geological materials
without first mixing them with a conducting binder. This practice is undesirable
since it reduces the sensitivity of the measurement, and introduces potential
spectral interferences. Using a GDMS instrument employing an rf discharge source
provides the analyst with the means to directly analyze nonconducting samples
with little or no sample preparation, and minimal matrix dependency.
