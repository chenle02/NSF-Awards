The University of South Alabama will initiate a four-week, residential Young
Scholars project in Archaeology for 15 students entering grades 11,12. This
project will involve high school students in archaeological research at the site
of Old Mobile, the first long-term French colonial settlement in the United
States, dating from 1702 to 1711. Students will work closely with the
professional team of archaeologists during excavation and laboratory analysis,
and will devise individual research projects. Participants will pursue these
projects throughout the academic year, with support from the project staff, with
the goal of presenting their results at science fairs or state Academy of
Sciences meetings. One focus of the project will be to explore career
opportunities in archaeology and related fields of science.
