The 6th International Conference on Nanostructured Material is to be held in
Orlando, FL on June 16-21, 2002. This is the latest in the series of
International Nanostructured Materials held for the first time in US. The
objective of the meeting is to exchange information on the latest developments
and new trends in nanostructured materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The topical
areas range from theory and modeling to synthesis and processing as well as
design and characterization of various nanostructured materials. The fabrication
of various structural, functional and specialty materials for diverse
applications will be discussed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The work shop will involve
most countries with active research in nanotechnology with about 800
international attendees.&lt;br/&gt;
