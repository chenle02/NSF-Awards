This research represents a coupled atomistic and continuum mechanics study of
the mechanical properties and response of interfaces in bicrystals. Computer
modeling will be used extensively. Although the emphasis is on grain boundaries,
the results will also relate to bi-material interfaces, such as in composites.
Atomistic calculations using many-body potentials will be compared with the
results obtained by a continuum mechanics treatment in order to determine the
required interface continuity conditions. Later, the research will concentrate
on grain boundary cracks. A major objective of this research is to develop the
ability to incorporate interfacial properties into the continuum treatments of
interfacial cracks.
