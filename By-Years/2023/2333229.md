Females of Vision et al (FoVea) is a group whose mission is to enhance the
success, visibility, and impact of women in vision science. Over the past eight
years, FoVea has launched several initiatives to broaden participation of women
in Vision Science, including (1) a Travel and Networking award program for
junior scientists; (2) professional development workshops at the Vision Sciences
Society annual meeting; (3) a speaker list highlighting female vision
scientists; (4) a “playbook” to ensure the longevity of FoVea activities and
generational knowledge; and (5) joint activities with Visibility and the SPARK
Society to promote the professional development of a wide range of historically
excluded scholars. The award includes an external evaluation component to assess
implementation and stakeholder perceptions of FoVea activities. These efforts
complement NSF’s goal of increasing participation of women, persons with
disabilities, and underrepresented groups in STEM.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
