This award is for a study of the relationship of the morphology of galaxies to
their interactions and associations. Both continuum radio radiation and the 21
cm line of neutral hydrogen will be utilized to investigate galaxies int he
local supercluster and beyond. The principle investigator is a leading expert in
this field, and will allow a number of undergraduates at his institution to
participate in this research, offering them an unusual opportunity to enhance
their education.
