It has been known for some time that factors which result in stress can alter
immune competency most probably via complex neuroendocrine mechanisms. It is
becoming increasingly evident that the two major integrative networks of the
body ( the immune and neuroendocrine systems) are inextricably linked, and that
internal modulation of these systems is paramount to the organism's abilities to
respond appropriately to external stimuli. Drs. John McNulty and Gary Schneider
are well versed in the fields of immunology and circadian rhythms. Their
research is designed to test the hypothesis that the pineal gland, a part of the
brain, regulates immune functions, especially with respect to chronobiological
changes that occur over a 24-hour light:dark cycle. The pineal gland mediates
various physiological effects of environmental lighting via the production of
the hormone, melatonin, over a circadian cycle. These researchers will also test
the idea that the pineal gland is an important link in communications between
the immune system and central nervous system. Stress is an important phenomenon
in our daily lives. The research to be performed is attempting to understand the
very basic biological mechanisms which occur due to environmental changes which
stress an organism. This work has far-reaching implications with respect to
basic mechanisms of homeostasis as well as clinical applications.
