This research project is designed to increase our understanding of when price-
fixing cartels form and how cartels price. The primary modeling innovation is to
take account of a key goal of any illegal cartel - to avoid the appearance that
there is a cartel. Existing models of collusion will be adapted by introducing a
detection technology - whereby the level of prices and the change in prices
influence the likelihood of creating suspicions - and antitrust penalties in the
form of damages and fines. The analysis is then substantively dynamic in that
past prices influence detection and also the level of penalties (as damages are
calculated using the prices set by the cartel). Deploying dynamic programming
and using both analytical and numerical methods, the properties of cartel
pricing dynamics will be characterized. Results will be developed showing how
cartel formation and the cartel price path depend on the form of antitrust
policy, the method of detection, and industry traits such as market structure,
cost and demand variability, demand seasonality, and buyer concentration. As
recent cases such as lysine, graphite electrodes, fine arts auction houses, and
vitamins exemplify, price-fixing remains a serious antitrust problem. The
ultimate implications of this project are in providing the necessary knowledge
to more effectively deter the formation of cartels and, in the event they do
form, to better detect their presence. Thus far, the antitrust authorities have
been largely reactive with respect to price-fixing; responding to customer
complaints, internal whistleblowers, and the like. By identifying the properties
of cartel pricing dynamics - what to look for - this project will help lay the
foundation for a more pro-active antitrust policy that seeks to investigate
industries which may be colluding. Furthermore, a more developed understanding
of how antitrust policy influences the profitability of collusion will provide
the basis for new innovative policies that are more effective at deterring the
formation of cartels.
