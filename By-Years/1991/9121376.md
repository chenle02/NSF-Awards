A compensatory movement called optokinetic nystagmus functions to stabilize
vision when the surrounding visual world is moved. This reflexive eye movement
is controled by structures of the brain located both in " higher centers" such
as the cerebral cortex and in "lower centers" such as the nucleus of the optic
tract, the dorsal terminal acessory nucleus and the lateral terminal acessory
optic nucleus. In this award to Dr. Roland Giolli, studies will be conducted to
determine how these different areas are interconnected by tracing the
neuroanatomical pathways between them. In addition, the precise localization of
the neurotransmitter GABA, which is involved in inhibitory responses of these
pathways, will be identified by immunocytochemical methods. This research will
contribute basic knowledge about the role of the brain in control of eye
movements.
