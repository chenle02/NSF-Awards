9321407 Wahlen This award is for support to investigate, in detail, the timing
between changes in temperature (indicated by the isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen
in the ice, as well as the accumulation rate) and atmospheric carbon dioxide
(from measurements of occluded air) in the high resolution Greenland Ice Sheet
Project Two (GISP2) ice core from central Greenland. The carbon dioxide
measurements will be performed over periods of rapid climate change, such as the
last glacial to interglacial transition and during the glacial interstadials,
the Eemian and the previous glacial. The determination of leads or lags between
temperature and atmospheric carbon dioxide will help to understand the interplay
of carbon dioxide and climate. The carbon isotope composition of atmospheric
carbon dioxide will also be analyzed for these periods in order to gain more
information about the mechanisms and processes responsible for carbon dioxide
and climate variations. ***
