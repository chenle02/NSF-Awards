The Task Force on the general chemistry curriculum appointed by the Division of
Chemical Education of the American Chemical Society is considering three
approaches to the reform of general chemistry instruction: 1. Laboratory-based
revisions in which new topics in chemistry would first be introduced in the
laboratory. 2. A subject area approach that selects the content and method of
general chemistry on the basis of the chemistry one needs to know to grasp
socially significant substances and processes. 3. A modular approach that
teaches an irreducible core and supplements that with coherent material that is
customized for the student audience. The Task Force will make recommendations on
alternative general chemistry curricula, produce and publicize new materials
through public presentations and publications, provide tested instructional
materials, and conduct workshops on how to implement new curricula. The aims of
this proposed project are to carry on two symposia at national scientific
meetings and to hold a summer 1991 workshop involving the whole Task Force that
will produce a report of accomplishments of the first two years.
