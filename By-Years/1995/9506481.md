9506481 Brearley The objective of this project is to study in detail the
mechanisms of the high pressure mantle phase transformations of the Mg2SiO4 and
(Mg,Fe)2 SiO4 under a range of PT conditions relevant to the model mantle
geotherm and subducting oceanic lithosphere. The study will continue efforts to
delineate the pressure-temperature regimes over which different transformation
mechanisms may operate in the Earth's mantle and identify what factors may cause
changes in the transformation mechanism. The results have important geological
implications for upper mantle, dynamics, especially the rheological behavior of
subducting oceanic slabs and the mechanisms of deep focus earthquakes. The
project will involve high pressure kinetic experiments using a multi anvil high
pressure apparatus coupled with detailed microstructural studies using optical
and electron microscopy. Special emphasis will be placed on the use of
transmission electron microscope techniques, particularly electron diffraction
and high resolution electron microscopy to elucidate the transformation
mechanisms.
