This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to
develop a MEMS wavefront correction device for ophthalmic adaptive optics. The
use of adaptive optics in ophthalmics shows great promise, but the lack of
suitable cost-effective solutions has hindered the advance of research and the
development of associated commercial markets. The proposed work will leverage
the most sophisticated surface micromachining technology available to design and
deliver, for the first time, a MEMS wavefront correction chip that addresses all
of the requirements specified by the vision science community.

The commercial application of this project will be in the area of ophthalmology.
Ophthalmic equipment suppliers need low cost wavefront correction devices for
use in next generation phoropters and autorefractors, LASIK preview systems, and
high resolution fundus imaging systems. The ophthalmic market for low cost
wavefront correction devices, once such devices are available, is projected to
be at least $20 million per year. Such devices may also have utility outside of
ophthalmics. Optical coherence tomography, confocal microscopy, portable
military imaging systems, free space optical communication systems, and
semiconductor lithography are other potential application areas for wavefront
correction devices.
