Field-aligned currents play an important role in magnetosphere-Ionosphere (M-I)
coupling. These currents can act as the source of free energy for a number of
kinetic instabilities which lead to plasma energization. The instabilities may
also lead to the formation of plasma density cavities or enhancements, and these
in turn play a role in the escape of heavy ions from the ionosphere. All of
these factors affect plasma transport properties in the M-I system, and the high
latitude ionospheric plasma must also respond to both magnetospheric and
corotational electric fields. This study will examine the role of kinetic
instabilities to M-I coupling and plasma transport processes. A multi-scale
model will be used to generate simulations which can be incorporated in other
global models, such as those used in space weather research and forecasting.
