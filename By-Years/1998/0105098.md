Proposal Number: DEB-0105098&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Dissertation Research:
Games Plants Play: Intra- and Inter-specific competition as an
ESS&lt;br/&gt;PIs: Joel Brown &amp; Erin O'Brien&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The way a
plant grows roots in response to soil nutrients and the roots of other plants
has important consequences with respect to its fitness (i.e., growth,
survivorship, and reproduction), competition among plants, and plant community
organization. The proposed research models and tests how root allocation can
provide an indicator of competitive ability in different species. A three-pot
design with two split-root plants provides each plant with the choice of
proliferating roots in an exclusive space versus a shared space. Differences in
competitive abilities between pairs of plants should manifest in predictably
different strategies for allocating roots to the exclusive and shared pots.
Garden plot experiments will then verify that the plant's rooting strategies
predict outcomes of competition. The entire approach aims to show that plants
may be much more animal-like in their behavior than previously
thought.&lt;br/&gt;
