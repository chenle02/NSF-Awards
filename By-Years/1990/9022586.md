Light echoes from supernova SN1987A, the closest supernova in nearly four
centuries, are powerful tools for studying a wide range of processes in stellar
evolution. The echoes allow us to map the three dimensional distribution of
matter around the supernova, perform direct simple measurements of the
scattering properties of interstellar dust, reobserve the ultraviolet pulse that
resulted from the supernova shock breaching the progenitor's stellar surface,
and determine the temperature and density of gas with direct measurement of
recombination times. With these tools Dr. Crotts will map the three dimensional
structure of the interstellar medium in a large volume of the Large Magellanic
Cloud, and correlate this structure with the large scale motion of gas and sites
of active star formation. He will also investigate the past mass loss from the
supernova progenitor itself, and describe in detail the evolution of the star's
mass loss behavior prior to the explosion. He will study the process of the
supernova shock accelerating the progenitor's surface, both by observing the
echoed flux from the event, and by mapping in detail the surrounding material
that will interact with the highest velocity ejecta on the order of a decade
from now, so that the pattern of ejection from the stellar surface can then be
inferred.
