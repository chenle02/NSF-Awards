Abstract&lt;br/&gt;EPS 071956&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EPS proposal
request support to conduct four day workshop in a tribal college setting. The
objective of this planning meeting will be to bring together universities in
three EPSCoR states and Tribal Colleges/Alaska Native serving Institutions
(TCU/ANSIs), with a focus on developing plans for teaching and research
collaborations in the basic sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics
(STEM). The strength of this workshop will be the participants that are Native
American serving institutions with a TCU/ANSI focus. The collaborative effort
will be led by Salish Kootenai College (SKC) faculty with other participants
which include Oglala Lakota College (OLC), Southwestern Indian Polytechnic
Institute (SIPI), University of Montana (UM), South Dakota School of Mines and
Technology (SDSMT), and University of New Mexico.&lt;br/&gt;The workshop fits
the parameters of the EPSCoR Workshop solicitation well; however, a special
condition will be made to ensure participation by underrepresented groups. These
are:&lt;br/&gt;1. Workshops will address multi-jurisdictional efforts that need
collaboration for optimum success. Speakers from non-EPSCoR institutions can be
involve in the workshop through logistical support for their participation, but
funding cannot go to non-EPSCoR institutions.&lt;br/&gt;2. Workshops will
address major regional themes of relevance to EPSCoR's goals/objectives and
NSF's mission.&lt;br/&gt;3. The goal of the workshop will be the development of
high quality collaborations that are capable of competing for
multi/interdisciplinary perspectives now common to major initiatives in science
and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;4. Workshop will have appropriate representation by
underrepresented
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
