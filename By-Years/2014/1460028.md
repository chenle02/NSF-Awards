The National Research Council's (NRC) Board on Testing and Assessment is
conducting this study to determine the best available methods to assess student
skills in teamwork, communication, self-regulation of behavior, academic
tenacity, and grit. These skills, also known as interpersonal and intrapersonal
competencies, have begun to gain recognition as important to student success in
college generally and in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics
(STEM) specifically. Indeed such factors may be as important to college success
as traditional thinking and reasoning skills, which already have a deep research
base to guide instruction and assessment of student performance in STEM. The
report resulting from the study will be able to provide guidance to researchers,
practitioners, and policymakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To conduct the study, the
NRC is convening a committee of experts to identify and analyze the current
state of knowledge of this field. This work builds on other NRC reports, such as
Education for Life and Work: Developing Transferable Knowledge and Skills in the
21st Century (NRC, 2012), which identified three broad domains of competence:
cognitive (e.g., thinking, reasoning), interpersonal (e.g., communication
skills), and intrapersonal (e.g., self-regulation). The committee's report will
establish principles and priorities for the development and use of assessments
related to the range of interpersonal and intrapersonal competencies.
