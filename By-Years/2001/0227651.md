University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Digital Government: The Virtual Citizen:
Identity, Autonomy, and Accountability&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will
apply Camp's unusual multidisciplinary expertise (Engineering and Public Policy
Ph.D.) in the area of trust, an area with both technical and social
implications. She will use this small grant to develop government relationships
relevant to preparation of a workshop in this area and to place the issue of
"trust" within a government context.
