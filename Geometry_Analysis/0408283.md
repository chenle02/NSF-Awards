Naichung Leung, Tian-Jun Li

The Yamabe Memorial Symposium to be held at the University of Minnesota in
September 2004 will be devoted to discussions of recent advances in differential
geometry, representing the variety and depth associated to the work of the late
Hidehiko Yamabe.

Graduate students and junior researchers are particularly encouraged to apply
for travel and per diem support. Information on participant support and
conference planning is available through the conference Web site,
