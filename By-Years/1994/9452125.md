9452125 VanderWeele The proposed project involves an improvement of laboratory
opportunities for courses in psychology at the institution. The college has a
diverse student body among whom the sciences, particularly psychology, are
popular majors, with about half of graduates in psychology and psychobiology
going on to graduate or professional school. The courses affected by the project
include physiological psychology, learning, motivation and emotion,
psychophysiology, and experimental psychology. In particular, the project has
allowed the development of a student laboratory to accompany the
psychophysiology lecture course, and the expansion of lab exercises in learning,
motivation and emotion, and physiological psychology. Equipment primarily
includes four-channel polygraphs, micro-computers, video cameras, open field and
operant chambers, and stereotaxic instruments.
