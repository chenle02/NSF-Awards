An investigation of the properties of Levy-driven CARMA (continuous-time ARMA)
processes will be undertaken and efficient methods of inference developed. The
results will be applied to the study of stochastic volatility models with Levy-
driven CARMA volatility and to the further study of COGARCH models. Time series
in which the parameters are constant over time-intervals between ``change-
points'' constitute an important class of non-stationary time series which has
been found particularly useful in hydrology, seismology and finance. Properties
and applications of a new estimation technique based on the minimization of the
minimum description length of a model that includes the number of change-points
and their locations as parameters will be developed and extended to cover a
general class of processes with structural breaks of various types. Estimation
techniques for all-pass models driven by non-Gaussian noise will also be
developed. These techniques, including maximum likelihood and minimum dispersion
estimation, will be applied to the problem of identification and estimation for
non-causal or non-invertible ARMA models.Adaptive techniques for efficient
estimation of such models will be explored.

In the last fifteen years, there has been a widely-recognized need for the
development of new models and techniques for the analysis of time series data
from scientific, engineering, biomedical, and financial applications. Some of
the features required of these new models are nonlinearity, complex dependence
structures, strong deviations from normality and non-stationarity. The current
proposal addresses these needs. It seeks to enhance understanding of the
physical and economic processes represented by the models. The development of
efficient estimation and simulation techniques will be an essential component of
the research.
