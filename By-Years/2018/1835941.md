This proposal is for the ship operator selection of RCRV # 2. The monetary value
of the proposal has no relation to the first year operational costs, and the
selection process does not entitle the awardee to any ship operation funds until
transition to operations has occurred. The awardee will enter into a contract
with OSU under the MREFC phase of construction and
delivery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
