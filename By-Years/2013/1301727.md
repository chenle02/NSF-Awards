The main themes of the project are the analytic side of free probability and
almost-normal operators modulo the Hilbert-Schmidt class. This will involve on
the one hand further study of the "free Riemann sphere," a highly noncommutative
analogue of the Riemann sphere, and of corresponding highly noncommutative
functions. On the other hand, the almost-normal operator questions are related
to the study of certain Banach algebras of operators on Hilbert space and their
K-theory. The operator theory part of the project also has connections to
noncommutative probability, since the operator algebras considered appear
naturally in noncommutative potential theory and the analogue of Fisher
information in free probability involves, in the simplest cases, almost-normal
operators.

Free probability is a probability framework adapted to deal with random
variables that exhibit the highest degree of noncommutativity. The theory has
important connections with operator algebra theory, with random matrix theory,
and with certain topics in combinatorics. Studies in free probability often
benefit from these connections and, in return, may be of interest in these other
fields. In particular, users of random matrices in certain models of multiuser
wireless communications and in certain physics models have found the free
probability approach to random matrices useful.
