This award supports the research in Combinatorics of Professor James Lawrence of
George Mason University. Dr. Lawrence's project is to investigate the concept of
a Radon partition of a finite set in Euclidean space, and to generalize and
extend this concept in the context of oriented matroids. This research falls in
the broad category of Combinatorics, which is one of the most active fields in
today's mathematics. Fundamentally, Combinatorics represents a systematization
of the very first of all mathematical activities, counting. In its modern
development, however, Combinatorics has gone beyond just counting to make use of
a wide variety of advanced mathematical techniques, and although its roots go
back several centuries, the field has had an explosive development in the past
few decades because of its importance in communications and information
technology.
