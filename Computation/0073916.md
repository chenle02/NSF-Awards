Abstract:

We propose to develop an innovative numerical coarse grid model for two-phase
flows in strongly heterogeneous media. The development of this coarse grid model
consists of two steps. The first one is to develop a PDE-based adaptive mesh
strategy to capture the dominating flow features using an adaptive coarse grid
mesh. Using the adaptive mesh, the dominating flow features such as high
velocity flow and strong shear flow can be accurately captured. The second step
is to use the multiscale finite element method to model the effect of small
scale components. The main idea of our multiple scale finite element method
consists of the construction of finite element base functions which contain the
small scale information within each element. In fact, we construct the base
functions from the leading order differential operator of the governing
equation. An important feature of the multiscale finite element method is that
they can be used to reconstruct locally the small scale velocity within each
coarse grid block. Since the dominating flow structures are already well
captured by the adaptive coarse grid solution, the remaining small scale
components are relatively small in amplitude. And we can effectively model the
effect of these small scales by incorporating averages of high order moments.
This gives rise to a robust coarse grid model for two-phase flows in strongly
heterogeneous media. Generalization of this idea to the Navier-Stokes equations
will also be considered.

Many problems of fundamental and practical importance contain multiple scale
solutions. The direct numerical solution of the above multiple scale problems is
difficult even with the advent of modern super computers. The major difficulty
of direct solutions is due to the scale of computation. To get an accurate
solution, all scales contained in the problem need to be resolved. Therefore,
tremendous amount of computer memory and CPU time are required. The requirement
can easily exceed the limit of today's computing resources. On the other hand,
from an engineering perspective, it is often sufficient to predict the
macroscopic properties of the physical systems and to capture the averaged
effect of small (and random) scales on the large ones. Therefore, it is
desirable to develop a method that can capture the small scale effect on the
large scales using a relatively coarse grid. If this can be done, this can lead
to enormous economy saving. The factor of saving could be as high as ten
thousands. This would enable us to perform many simulations very efficiently.
The proposed research is to develop such a coarse grid model by incorporating
the small scale features in the underlying physical problem to construct
multiscale building blocks (bases). These multiscale building blocks (bases)
capture the effect of small scales on the large scales locally. In order to
increase the robustness of the multiscale modeling, we propose to introduce an
automatic (PDE-based) adaptive mesh generator to generate the underlying coarse
grid. The adaptivity is controlled by the local flow rate, using a finer mesh in
high flow region. The idea of combining adaptivity with multiscale modeling may
have a significant impact on a number of applications which go beyond the scope
of this proposed study.
