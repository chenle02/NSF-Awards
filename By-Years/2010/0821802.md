With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program Mary
Cloninger from Montana State University (MSU) will develop and commission two
fluorescence spectrometers: one primarily for high throughput screening and
imaging work and the other primarily aimed at UV applications. The instruments
will operate routinely in the microplate format with temperature control of the
plate. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop instruments on which
researchers can routinely produce high quality fluorescence lifetime data. The
instruments will use technology acquired through an industrial collaboration
with Fluorescence Innovations. Eight research projects by an equal number of
researchers will be developed: (1) multivalent protein-carbohydrate
interactions, (2) fluorescence lifetime imaging of 2D gels, (3) surface antigens
on activated blood leukocytes detected by specific monoclonal antibodies, (4)
genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors, (5) viruses and protein cages, (6)
protein-protein complexes, (7) single-transient, receptor-potential mutants of
normal and modeled disease-like prion protein and (8) interactions of proteins
with small molecules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fluorescence spectroscopy is a type
of electromagnetic spectroscopy which analyzes fluorescence from a sample that
has been irradiated by a beam of light that excites electrons in molecules and
causes them to emit light of lower energy. These measurements are of great
importance in Chemistry, Biochemistry and Life Sciences and provide
understanding of chemical and biochemical processes. The instrument development
process will involve a large group of investigators including professors,
graduate and undergraduate students, some of them from underrepresented groups.
