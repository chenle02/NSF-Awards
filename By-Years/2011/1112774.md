The International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA) is a premier forum
for presenting, discussing and debating new and innovative architectural ideas
and techniques for advanced computing and communication systems. This symposium
brings together researchers in fields related to processor architecture,
compilers, chips and systems, for technical exchange on current areas of
architectural challenge. This proposal aims to support this highly regarded
conference by obtaining travel support for students in order to defray the costs
of attending and participating in the ISCA conference June 4-8, 2011 in San
Jose, California as part of the Federated Computing Research Conference (FCRC).
&lt;br/&gt;Up to 30 U.S.-based students (averaging $500 each) to be supported by
the award. The majority of the awards to be granted to Ph.D. students. Priority
will be granted to students who have authored papers accepted for presentation
at the conference or its joint workshops, in particular those students without
existing travel support.
