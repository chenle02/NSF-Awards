0429590/0429595&lt;br/&gt;Collaborative Research: Well-Founded Behavioral
Software Contracts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robert Bruce Findler&lt;br/&gt;Matthias
Felleisen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MacIlroy's vision of a marketplace of software
components requires enforceable contracts. Such a contract describes the
expectations and obligations of a contract; its enforcement system decides whose
fault it is when a program breaks a contract. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first
goal of this project is to investigate the nature of behavioral contracts and
mechanisms for monitoring contracts for all kinds of component mechanisms,
including classes, mixins, aspects, modules, and related constructs. The second
goal is to study how contracts can help improve static analyses and how static
analyses can partially verify contracts. Finally, the project team will conduct
an experiment with a component marketplace to test their software contracts and
contract monitoring systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the long term, this
research may help establish a truly competitive marketplace of software
components. In this marketplace, components will come with open-source
contracts. Alternate suppliers can then produce components with near-equivalent
contracts, and consumers can choose from an array of interchangeable components.
