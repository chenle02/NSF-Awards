The Department of Physics at Indiana University of Pennsylvania will purchase a
sputtering system and associated equipment which will become a part of a new
high vacuum system. The present system, purchased with local funds, contains
resistive heating and electron beam evaporators. The addition of the sputtering
system will allow students to learn about this important technique and to study
properties of amorphous thin films, properties of optical coatings, the
preparation of interesting Hall effect films, the fabrication of semiconductor
devices, and to use materials which have not been accessible with present
techniques.
