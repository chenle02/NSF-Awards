Considering the popularity and wide adoption of social network systems and the
competitive edge these systems provide, there has been a rapid growth in use of
these systems to access, store, and exchange personal attribute information in
distributed and/or federated environments and this trend is expected to
continue. Efficient, secure, and user-centric techniques are important for the
successful deployment of such systems. Our goal in this project is to develop a
comprehensive and compelling framework SNGuard (Social Network Guard) that
satisfies diverse privacy properties, access control issues, identity management
requirements, and usage patterns. The vision of dynamic social networks is a
complex and highly sophisticated one that requiring ongoing research and
analysis to continue concurrent with the changing role and face of digital
information creation and usage including personal information and contents in
social networks. The principal intellectual products resulting from this project
will be the development of novel frameworks to facilitate user-centered privacy
management, content management and risk-aware access control, thereby making
SNGuard solutions more trustworthy, more reliable, and less vulnerable. This
research effort will have broad societal impact by providing a key mechanism to
enable new business and community models for the sharing of personal attributes
including identity information to safely, easily, and quickly establish social
networking environments in cyberspace. In addition to these potential benefits,
other anticipated, broad-based benefits to be facilitated by this research
include significant influence to K-12 education, international collaboration,
and industrial and government partners.
