The threat of the COVID-19 virus has not been clearly understood by a
substantial portion of the U.S. population. Many people have been slow to adopt
attitudes and behaviors that will serve to mitigate the risks of the pandemic.
With all the publicity that the virus has engendered, how can this be so? The
researchers hypothesize that these failures to change attitude and behavior stem
from three factors: failures to realize the impact that this disease has,
failures to realize how quickly it will be transmitted, and failures to
appreciate the dire consequences it will have on the health care system. In this
study, the researcher will examine factors underlying these failures and ways to
improve delivery of information relevant to COVID-19. Results and suggestions
for improving communication and comprehension are expected to be disseminated
widely and expeditiously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to investigate ways of
improving the understanding of the risks involving COVID-19, the researchers, a
highly experienced and inter-disciplinary team, propose three lines of research.
They will examine (a) how different ways of presenting information about the
proliferation of the disease affects people’s estimates of its incidence and
rates of death, as well as intended future social behavior, (b) how individual
differences among individuals and countries along demographic and trait
dimensions will influence their estimates of the spread of the disease, and (c)
how people are reasoning about the impact of the disease on the viability of the
healthcare system. Methods will include measuring the ability to predict risk
and consequences of the disease as well as the impact of “flattening the curve”
as functions of several variables, including mode of information presentation,
numeracy, motivation, health status, and other demographic and trait
variables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
