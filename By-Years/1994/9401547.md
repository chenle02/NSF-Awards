Professor Xu will work on the geometry and topology of Calabi-Yau manifolds as
well as higher dimensional projective varieties. In particular, he wants to
study rational curves on Calabi-Yau threefolds. He also intends to work on
adjoint linear series and pluricanonical series on projective varieties of
higher dimension. Finally, he intends to work on higher dimensional sphere-
packing problems. This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, yet it
directly connects to two of the great advances in theoretical physics in this
century--quantum mechanics and general relativity. Algebraic geometry itself is
one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a
revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origin, it treated
figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely
polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only from algebra, but
from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding application in those
fields as well as in physics, theoretical computer science, and robotics.
