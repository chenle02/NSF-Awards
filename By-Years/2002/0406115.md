ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;PI: Merlise A Clyde&lt;br/&gt;PROPOSAL:
0406115&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators propose new advancements for the
problem of variable and model selection, one of the most fundamental and
widespread problems in statistics. Bayesian methods are appealing for this
problem, due to the natural probabilistic framework which addresses both model
and parameter uncertainty. The implementation of Bayesian methods, however,
becomes challenging as the number of models or variables grows, an all too
common problem where massive data sets provide many potential predictors. The PI
and co-PI investigate two major challenges in the implementation of Bayesian
model selection and model averaging: prior specification and posterior
calculation. They investigate new families of automatic objective priors that
have desirable risk properties, adapt to unknown degree of sparsity and also
permit tractable computation for large scale model search. To implement the new
methodology, they develop efficient software for stochastic search and model
averaging for high dimensional model spaces. Applications in industrial and
biological problems will be developed using the new
methodology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finding and using models to describe
relationships between variables in massive datasets is a fundamental problem in
both statistics and the sciences. Bayesian methods have been shown to be very
successful for this problem, however, the implementation of Bayesian methods
becomes challenging in applications where the number of possible models is
astronomical. The PI and co-PI develop innovative new methods and software in
statistical computing and modeling for selecting and combining models. These
methodological developments are driven by applications in industrial and
biological problems. The automatic procedures proposed by the investigators for
selecting and combining models have applicability to many other important
application areas where variable selection is utilized.&lt;br/&gt;
