0428573&lt;br/&gt;Vazquez&lt;br/&gt;This project will specifically develop an
original microfluidic network (the uStar) to study the effects of multivalent
nanosensors on the fundamental cell process of chemotaxic migration. The system
will enable single-cell imaging and quantitative analysis of nanosensor dynamics
once inducted within viable fibroblast cells in real-time. Nanosensors will be
developed to target the intracellular protein, Growth Factor Receptor Bound-2
(GRB2), known to initiate chemotaxis signaling cascades when activated by the
chemoattractant growth factors studied in this project.
