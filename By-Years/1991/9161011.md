This project will concentrate on the design of a socket for a lower-limb
protheses which can be adjusted by the user. This highly innovative idea will
use a bladder-like lining in the socket-stump interface. The bladder will be
filled with a fluid and subsequently hardened after the stump is inserted into
the socket. The hardness will be a function of the temperature if the substance.
A material will be chosen so that it will return to a gel-like state upon
reaching a certain temperature so that refitting of the socket-stump interface
by the user will be possible. If successful this prosthetic design could have a
tremendous advantage over classical lower limb prosthetic devices which require
that adjustments be made by prosthetist.
