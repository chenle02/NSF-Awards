This is a collaborative effort between Professors M. Karpovsky at Boston
University and D. Pradhan at the University of Massachusetts. The
proposedinvestigations are two.fold. The first concerns fault detection by
acompression of test responses. Errors (manifestations of faults) are definedas
the component.wise exclusive OR between actual test responses and fault.free
responses. Faults are masked if the observed signature (compressed testresponse)
is equal to the reference. Thus, depending on the statistics of theerrors, an
optimal compressor is the compressor that minimizes a probabilitythat the test
responses are compressed into the reference. The design ofoptimal compressors
when the distribution of ones contained in error sequencesis known for a given
circuit under test is being investigated. This work isalso based on single error
correcting codes over a finite field. Second isboard.level diagnosis by
signature analysis. The objective is to analyzetradeoffs between the hardware
complexity of the redundant chips on the boardand test time. Two techniques,
based on compression of test responses, arebeing pursued. These are; space.time
compression of test responses, anextension of previous research in space
compressors; and board diagnosis byHamming codes over a finite field. Professors
Karpovsky and Pradhan, are outstanding researchers with solidrecords of
accomplishment over the past decade, and that they are very likelyto continue
first class research. The research topic, test response analysis,is important to
industry, and is a high.priority category within the Design,Tools and Test
Program.
