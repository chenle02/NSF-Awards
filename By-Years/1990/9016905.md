This award will continue an ongoing research project to explore the
implementability and utility of Equational Logic Programming . The project has
already produced a compiler for an equational programming language, in which a
program is a set of equations, an input is a term, a computation is a derivation
of certain logical consequences of the equations in the program, leading to the
output of a term in normal form equivalent to the input. Novel features of the
language include a total refusal to compromise semantics for performance,
leading to a uniform use of "lazy" evaluation-- a technique in which precisely
the information demonstrably relevant to the final output is automatically
computed-- and a lazy input/output facility, which gives the consumer of a term
dynamic control of its computation. The current version of the compiler uses
partial evaluation of intermediate code as an optimized compilers for C.
Continuing research will include the study of more sophisticated evaluation
techniques to improve performance, the performance implications of applying
those techniques to other languages, theoretical advances to extend the class of
equational programs that can be compiled, the semantic ramifications of
introducing modular programming constructs, and experimentation with advanced
user interfaces, including structure editor interfaces.
