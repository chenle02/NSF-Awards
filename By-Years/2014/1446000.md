This project, led by the Mathematical Association of America (MAA), is to bring
together leading national stakeholders in the mathematics education enterprise
to reconsider long-standing traditions, both curricular and pedagogical, of the
process of undergraduate mathematics education. The outcome from this workshop
will lead to a roadmap for modernizing the undergraduate mathematics curriculum.
The primary goal of this initiative is to develop a shared vision in the
mathematical sciences community of the need to update the undergraduate
mathematics program, especially the first two years. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
MAA is partnering with other professional societies to evaluate how a
modernization of programs in the mathematical sciences would better prepare
students for the demands of the 21st century workplace. The project aims to
catalyze widespread adoption of curricula and pedagogies that are (1) geared
toward developing a broad base of intellectual skills and competencies to better
prepare students for the workforce and (2) simultaneously endorsed by a broad
cross-section of the mathematical sciences community. Another major objective of
the project is to highlight alternative pathways through the general education
mathematics requirement, including alternatives to traditional remedial
mathematics courses, for entering students not adequately prepared for college
mathematics. These alternatives could more effectively prepares students for
their future careers and studies in STEM disciplines.
