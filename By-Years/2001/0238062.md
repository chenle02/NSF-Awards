CAREER: A Composition System for Computer Graphics

Abstract

Engineers and artists approach problems in a very different manner. The terms
engineer and artist are used in a very broad way; engineers are people who
primarily build things and tend to approach problems by asking how something can
be done. Artists, on the other hand, create content and focus on what
information they are trying to convey. Both of these approaches are important,
and it is often the intersection of the two that produces the most compelling
results. Computer graphics has been fortunate in that a large artistic community
is actively involved its development. Unfortunately, software design is still
largely in the hands of the engineers.

The goal of this proposal is to bring the artistic approach into existing
software and to bridge the communication gap between artists and engineers. As a
maturing field, computer graphics is ready to address the problem of purposeful
display - not just how to render an image from a model, but how should it be
rendered so as to convey specific information about that model.
