This project by Andrzej Rajca at Kansas State University within the Organic
Dynamics Program, is aimed at the development of organic compounds with
superconducting and ferromagnetic properties. Very few examples are currently
known, with such properties most often confined to inorganic solids. The use of
organics with metallic-like properties will provide a wealth of possibilities
due to ease of fabrication and subsequent modification of properties by standard
methods of organic synthesis. Because the electronic structure and bonding of
molecules and solids is affected by topology (and symmetry), a topological
approach to organic superconductors and ferromagnets will be employed. Multi-
carbanions, radicals, and radical anions of pi-conjugated hydrocarbons with
highly degenerate highest occupied, non-bonding molecular orbitals will be
prepared. The degeneracy and unique delocalization of these orbitals have a
topological rather than symmetry origin. First, theoretical predictions about
the impact of the special topology on the charge distribution, ground state
multiplicities, and other molecular properties will be tested. Second, solids
will be prepared; density of states at the Fermi level, band width, and other
important solid state properties will be obtained and compared to their
molecular counterparts. Finally, the solids will be examined with respect to
ferromagnetism and superconductivity.
