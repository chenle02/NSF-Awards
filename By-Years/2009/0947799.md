The National Center for Genome Resources is awarded a grant to develop a Virtual
Plant Information Network (VPIN). VPIN will be based on such middleware
platforms such as BioMOBY and will significantly empower plant biology research
by providing powerful bioinformatics capabilities for integrative and
comparative biology. It will combine the data and analysis tools from TAIR
(www.arabidopsis.org), DargonDB (antirrhinum.net), LIS (www.comparative-
legumes.org), Gramene (www.gramene.org), TIGR's Genome Annotation
(www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/mta1) and Medicago Gene Indices (www.tigr.org/tigr-
scripts/tgi/T_index.cgi?species=medicago) and the CGIAR's Generartion Challenge
Prgram via IRIS (http://www.iris.irri.org/) and IWIS
(www.cimmyt.org/research/wheat/iwisfol/IWISFOL.htm).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically this project will (1) merge Semantic MOBY and
MOBY Services into a single unified Semantic Web Services platform for biology;
(2) develop protocols that enable registration of plant information resources
with the Semantic Web Services platform and establish an operational Virtual
Plant Information Network; and (3) develop interfaces that will allow biologists
to discover data and invoke services across web-based plant resources using
semantically based concepts. VPIN will extend web technology developed
previously under NSF funding and enable better access to available information
resources by biologists with a single point of entry. Students at various stages
of their education will be involved in the design and development of this
system. The VPIN will serve a broad range of biologists from plant breeders to
computational biologists.&lt;br/&gt;
