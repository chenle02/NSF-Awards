Abstract

Award: DMS-0505795 Principal Investigator: Gregory J. Galloway

The Isaac Newton Institute for the Mathematical Sciences is running a semester
long program on Global Problems in Mathematical Relativity (GMR) in Cambridge,
England from August to December, 2005. The purpose of this award is to provide
partial travel and subsistence support for U. S. participants. The general aim
of the GMR program is to bring together experts in the field, along with early
career researchers and graduate students, to discuss recent striking advances in
mathematical aspects of general relativity and related theories of gravity, and
to address existing problems and challenges. The program consists of three
focused conferences: (1) New Directions in Numerical Relativity, (2) Global
General Relativity, and (3) The Constraint Equations, together with a series of
thematic workshops that will run throughout the course of the program. The GMR
program coincides with the 100 year anniversary of Einstein's Special Theory of
Relativity. General Relativity, Einstein's geometric theory of gravity, which
incorporates the special theory, has proven to be an extraordinarily accurate
theory of gravity at both the local astrophysical and cosmological scales. The
results of the collaborative research and analysis to be carried out during the
program will have a significant bearing on various fundamental physical
problems, such as the issue of the final state of gravitational collapse, and
its implications for the detection of gravitational radiation. Participation of
graduate students and recent PhD's is a key component of the program, and is
crucial to the continuing vitality of the area.
