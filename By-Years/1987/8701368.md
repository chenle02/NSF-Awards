The purpose of the workshop is to assess the current status of research and
technology and to identify specific topic areas for future research needs in ice
mechanics. The workshop is scheduled at the Sixth International Symposium on
Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering to be held in Houston, Texas, March
1-6, 1987. It is planned to invite several foremost world leaders in ice
mechanics research from the United Kingdom, Finland, Japan, Canada, and the
United States. The invitees will prepare written review papers on the state of
research in each country and the papers will be published in the Applied
Mechanics Review. Following the formal presentations, the research needs will be
discussed. This workshop is timely and would provide future research direction
for ice mechanics. An award is recommended.
