In this study in the Theoretical and Computational Program of the Division of
Chemistry methods are being constructed, implemented, and tested for the
rigorous interpretation of molecular electronic wavefunctions. Of particular
interest are electronic densities in organic free radicals. Rigorous definitions
are being obtained for charge-transfer components of bond energies and for
electronegativities of atoms in molecules. %%% The description of the bonding of
atoms to form molecules is being advanced in this program of theoretical and
computational chemical studies. New ways are being developed for defining the
contributions to bond energies and the properties of bound atoms.
