The biology teaching assistant project (BioTAP) will create a network of
academics to inform best practices for biology graduate teaching assistant (GTA)
professional development, with an eye toward fostering practices aligned with
reformed biology courses. To improve GTA professional development on a national
scale, this RCN-UBE network will first identify the instructional skills needed
by GTAs to teach reformed biology courses, and then gather and study
professional development models from institutions across the nation to identify
those which may serve as standards of best practice.

Intellectual Merit: BioTAP will foster national dialogue to improve collegiate
biology instruction, and expand and promote the project at network and
professional meetings. The project will enhance the communication among national
professional organizations, biology faculty, laboratory coordination staff,
teaching and learning centers, and GTAs to reduce duplication, unify resources,
and promote the instructional strengths of biology GTAs.

Broader Impacts: BioTAP aims to be the premier resource guiding biology GTA
professional development in the nation. The findings of the network will be
disseminated via articles and conference presentations, and by using the
existing networks of other RCN-UBEs and professional organizations. By the end
of the incubator funding, new members of the Steering Committee will broaden the
representation of institutions and academic experiences, and a list of potential
network participants will be compiled. The findings of the project will be made
available to this network through a file sharing site. BioTAP will inform
professional development practices across the nation to better prepare GTAs for
their roles as future faculty members and improve their ability to deliver
reformed biology courses.

This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences
and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate
Education as part of their efforts towards support of Vision and Change in
Undergraduate Biology Education.
