9512008 Weiss This is a proposal for a three-day interdisciplinary workshop of
leading scholars to develop a systematic program of research dealing with
nontreaty mechanisms, that is, nonbinding legal accords, for dealing with
important problems of international environmental or global change. The workshop
will identify questions, develop and refine hypotheses, critically examine
assumptions underlying existing work in the field, and consider alternative
research methodologies. It will also identify key players in and establish links
to the policy community. The workshop will yield publishable papers that will
set out the research agenda developed. %%%% This is a proposal for a three-day
