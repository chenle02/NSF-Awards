Fostering Mathematics Success of English Language Learners (ELLs), a 4-year
DR-K12 project, is an efficacy study of the Fostering Geometrical Thinking
Toolkit (FGTT) previously developed with NSF support. FGTT is a 40-hour
professional development intervention focusing on properties of geometric
figures, geometric transformations, and measurement of length, area, and volume.
The study addresses four research questions, three examining participating
teachers and one examining the impact of teachers' professional development on
ELL students. It tests the hypothesis that geometric problem solving invites
diagramming, drawing, use of colloquial language, and gesturing to complement
mathematical communication and affords teachers opportunities to support ELL
learning. The research design uses a randomized block design, with 25 pairs of
professional development facilitators matched according to their district?s
demographic information.
