The National Research Council, Department of Education, and National Science
Foundation have all identified training in chemistry as an area of national
concern. According to the American Chemistry Council, the nation?s chemical
industry is responsible for more than 880,000 American jobs, makes 37 million
American jobs possible (27% of all U.S. employment), and is among the nation?s
largest exporters (10% of all exports). In keeping with the nation?s interests
in creating a highly trained workforce that reflects the growing diversity of
the U.S. population, the NSF REU program in Chemistry and Biochemistry at the
Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) will enroll visiting
undergraduate students in an immersive summer research experience and thereby
equip them with tools and encouragement to embark on graduate studies in the
laboratory sciences. The program will build on previous successes in enrolling
substantial numbers of women and underrepresented minority students. Each summer
(2009-2011), ten undergraduate participants will work with a faculty advisor and
their research group on a significant research problem. The program also
includes team-building activities, regular group meetings, a seminar/workshop
series on ethics, presentation skills, graduate opportunities, research
frontiers, etc; two research symposia; and field trips to industrial and
government laboratories. These provide a perspective of chemical research in a
scholarly, entrepreneurial, economic, and ethical framework. Research
initiatives in the School have attracted major funding from federal agencies and
industry. The School?s research portfolio includes a broad set of initiatives
(e.g., solar cells, biofuels, disease prevention) in areas which will contribute
to the well-being of this nation and its people.
