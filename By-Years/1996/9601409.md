This is a mathematical study of the diffusion of collective action. It develops
mathematical models of the diffusion of collective action in cycles or waves of
protest, with a particular emphasis on the diffusion of collective violence and
disruptive collective protest and the ways these are affected by cycles of non-
disruptive protest, the formation and institutionalization of movement
organizations, and the social control efforts of regimes. Recent advances in
event-history models of diffusion are used as the basis for further development
of diffusion models which capture temporal and spatial heterogeneity and which
adequately capture the ebbing phase of a cycle as well as its rise. Multiple-
equation models are developed for the interplay among different forms of action
and between regimes and dissidents. Computer simulation technologies are used to
investigate the full response surface of all models, showing how the incidence
of various forms of actions varies with the full range of possible combinations
of independent variables. Models are developed to represent important phenomena
for which there is a body of solid empirical data, including several waves of
collective violence, and the protest cycles of the US Civil Rights Movement in
1950-1990 and the "new social movements" of Europe in 1975-1990. These models
are parameterized to be consistent with known data, but include variables and
relationships which remain speculative and unobserved in published accounts.
Alternate explanatory mechanisms are rigorously explored and tested for goodness
of fit against available data. %%% This project is a contribution to abstract,
mathematical sociology. It will develop rigorous formal theory which is capable
of identifying general patterns and mechanisms which transcend specific cases
but which can be meaningfully tested against empirical data. Thus it will
strengthen the fundamental intellectual basis upon which more applied or policy-
oriented studies must rest.
