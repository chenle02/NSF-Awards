Within the past decade it has become apparent that there are numerous non-
lymphocytic cytokines that have profound effects (either directly or indirectly)
on virtually every aspect of vertebrate defense responses. These mediators,
which include interleukin 1 alpha and beta, tumor necrosis factor, transforming
growth factor beta, chemotactic factors, colony stimulating factors, interferons
alpha and beta, interferon beta 2 (IL-6), and others may also play a role in
normal physiological processes related to growth, development aging, and
homeostasis in general. The objectove of this symposium is to bring together the
outstanding international junior and senior scientists working in the general
area of the biology and biochemisry of non- lymphocytic cytokines to discuss the
following topics: 1. the molecular biology, biochemical characterization and
biological properties of the various non-lymphocytic cytokines, 2. their
synthesis, processing and release, 3. the physiologic and pharmacologic actions
of these cytokines at the molecular, cellular, tissue, organ system, and
organism levels, 4. the biochemistry of cytokine receptors and post-receptor
events, 5. the interactions of non-lymphocytic cytokines including various
feedback loops (both positive and negative) and potential synergistic actions,
6. the practical applications of cytokines and agents that affect their
synthesis, release, or actions. This symposium will promote the interaction and
exchange of information among investigators actively pursuing this important and
rapidly developing subject.
