Abstract ATM-9408836 Foley, Jonathan University of Wisconsin Title: Climate and
Terrestrial Biosphere Interactions: Investigations with Coupled Models
Interactions between the terrestrial biosphere and the atmosphere will be
investigated with a suite of numerical models. A land surface model (LSX) is
coupled to a global ecosystem model, DEMETER, which was developed at the
University of Wisconsin. DEMETER describes the structure and dynamics of global
vegetation communities and terrestrial carbon pools. The PI is investigating the
interactions (biophysical and biochemical) between the atmosphere, biosphere and
land surfaces for the following climatic regimes: (1) the current climate, (2)
the mid-Holocene and (3) a 2xCO2 scenario. This research is important because it
seek to understand and model fundamental processes related to climate change.
The project is funded under the USGCRP CMAP initiative.
