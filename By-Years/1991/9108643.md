This project tracks income differences in men aged 50 through 80, comparing
predictions about the amount of income inequality derived from three theoretical
perspectives. These predict, respectively, that inequality will increase,
decrease, or remain constant during the retirement years. Results will improve
sociological understanding of stratification and aging, and have implications
for various programs such as Social Security, which aim at affecting the
distribution of income in later years.
