9625408 Horwitz, Susan Association for Computing Machinery Special Project:
Group Travel Grant for Faculty at Minority/Female Institutions to Attend PLDI 96
As a step toward improving the representation of women and minorities in
computer science, the ACM Special Interest Group on Programming Languages
(SIGPLAN) is working to improve the computer science background of faculty
members from colleges with a large minority and/or female student enrollment.
This travel grant will provide partial support for selected individuals from
such institutions to attend the annual conference on Programming Languages
Design and Implementation (PLDI). In addition to the Conference, the
participants will attend tutorials targeted specifically to teachers from non-
research oriented institutions. For the selected participants, SIGPLAN will pay
the tutorial and conferences fees and NSF funds will provide for travel and
subsistence costs. ***
