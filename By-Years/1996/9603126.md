Projects are proposed in two areas of nuclear theory. The first area concerns
the structure of nuclei above the threshold for emitting constituent nucleons.
Development of nuclear models for this energy region provide a means of
analyzing and correlating data from nucleon scattering experiments and
experiments in which a nucleon is knocked out from a nucleus by a variety of
probes, such a electrons and mesons. These investigations provide information on
the structure of nuclei at high excitation and the distribution of nucleons
within nuclei. The second area is hypernuclear physics. Hypernuclei contain at
least one baryon with non-zero strangeness or charm. Although their lifetimes
are very short, hypernuclei provide a laboratory for determining the interaction
of exotic baryons with nucleons and with each other. They also provide the only
practical means for studying a particular decay mode for the strange baryons.
This decay mode, unlike the decay of a free strange baryon, is one in which no
mesons are produced. Investigations are proposed for both determining the
interactions of these exotic baryons and the mechanism for non-mesonic decay.
