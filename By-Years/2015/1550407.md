University of Alaska, Fairbanks (UAF) proposes to support technical services on
R/V Sikuliaq, a new, 261-foot, general purpose research vessel operated as part
of the US Academic Research Fleet. The vessel is owned by NSF and operated by
the University of Alaska, Fairbanks. For basic technical services, UAF will
provide three shipboard technicians on each cruise on R/V Sikuliaq to support
seagoing research projects and to maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified
users items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation. This is the
first proposal written for technical services for this vessel. Ordinarily, the
various institutions that support vessels in the Academic Fleet operate under
5-year continuing grants. In order to maintain the same proposal cycle among the
various institutions, this award will be the first of a two-year continuing
grant. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of
the present report is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines
(NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the
vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded
oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by
the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and
operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any
US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their
research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of
potential researchers,
