Measurements of isotopic ratios of nitrogen and oxygen will be made to evaluate
the global significance of denitrification. Recent studies suggest the
prevailing view that most marine nitrous oxide arises from nitrification may be
in error. It is expected that Monterey Canyon and adjacent waters will provide a
representative site for testing this hypothesis. Nitrous oxide is formed as an
important intermediate in the marine nitrogen cycle, and all parts of the ocean
contribute to the "greenhouse effect" by the evolution of this gas. Laboratory
examination of the ratios of N-15/N-14 and 0-18/0-16 also will shed light on the
question of whether or not globally significant denitrification can occur in
water with oxygen concentrations greater than 2.5 micromolar.
