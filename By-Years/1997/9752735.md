Digital signal processors, made possible through advances in integrated
circuits, have added a new element to the environment of digital signal
processing (DSP). They have found their way into a number of applications
including communications and controls, graphics, instrumentation, speech, and
image processing. These processors are found in cellular phones, modems,
automotive and security/identification systems, noise cancellers, etc. They have
emerged as a response to the ever-increasing number of real-time DSP
applications across a wide range of disciplines. This workshop addresses the
need to add or integrate DSP techniques into courses such as Digital Signal
Processing, Controls, Signals and Systems, Senior Design Project, etc. It will
combine both the lecture and laboratory components of DSP, with a special
emphasis on the laboratory component to provide the participants valuable hands-
on experiences. While a theoretically oriented DSP course can be found at a more
convenient location to the participant, the strength of this workshop is derived
from its laboratory emphasis. The faculty participants will implement a wide
range of experiments and mini-projects on finite and infinite impulse response
filters, adaptive filters, and the fast Fourier transform using both simulation
and real-time techniques. DSP tools and techniques will be provided to the
participants who will quickly realize how software and hardware experiences can
be used to motivate their students. They would then be able to integrate these
software and hardware experiences at their home institutions.
