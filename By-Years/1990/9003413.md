The American Federation of Information Processing Societies is conducting a
Workshop on Computational Science for Faculty of Undergraduate Institutions
without doctoral programs at the University of North Carolina, Asheville, during
the week of August 6 through August 12, 1990. Sixteen well qualified individuals
have offered to help in the organizing, planning and conduct of the Workshop.
Approximately 30 participants will be selected. Of these 30 participants, at
least 20 will come from those schools which traditionally accommodate
undergraduates from populations under-represented in the mathematical and
physical sciences. The objective of the Workshop is to assist the faculty
members to enhance their curricula and attract students to courses in sciences
such as computer science, mathematics, physics and chemistry. During the one
week of the Workshop, it is intended to illustrate a generic model of a one
semester course on "Introductory Computational Science". This will be
accomplished by lectures, demonstrations, video presentations and hands-on
experiences using IBM personal computers, Apple Macintosh computers and remote
supercomputers.
