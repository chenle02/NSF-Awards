This proposal requests funds for the purchase of a high- resolution high-mass
spectrometer complete with MS/MS. The instrument will be located in the mass
spectrometer center, an analytical and bioanalytical resource that provides
state-of-the- art capability in mass spectrometry. Specifically, the instrument
will provide: exact mass measurements to provide elemental composition for
unknown organic compounds, high- mass- range scanning at low resolution for use
with newly developed soft ionization methods, and linked scans for the analysis
of metastable, daughter, and granddaughter ions and neutral transitions as an
aid to structure elucidation using MS/MS. The users are involved in research on
allelochemicals and humic substances from soil, synthetic and mechanistic
organic chemistry, composition of fossil fuels and naphthenic acids, proton
affinity, biosynthesis of phytoalexins, oligo- and polysaccharide recognition
process, protein identification and gene cloning, structures of polymer
networks, metabolism and identification of retinoids, hydroprocessing of liquid
fuels, elucidating fungal toxins, and electron transport chain and ubiquinones.
The instrument will also be used by the surrounding community of mass
spectrometrists.
