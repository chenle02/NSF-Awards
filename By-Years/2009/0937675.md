All humans, irrespective of education, share a "number sense" that helps us
understand mathematics. Even 5-month-old infants have this sense and can
recognize the numeric difference between 6 and 12 dots on a screen. Yet there
are many questions about the number sense for which we do not yet know the
answers: 1) Do people vary in how accurate their number sense is across the
lifespan? 2) Do these differences predict mathematics achievement? 3) Can
interventions improve number sense and thereby strengthen performance in school
mathematics? The aim of this project is to create a freely available assessment
software that will return a standardized estimate of the accuracy of any
person's number sense, filling a crucial hole in our current science.

This software will be refined from existing methods that successfully
demonstrate precise estimates of students' number sense and reveal correlations
between number sense and performance in school mathematics. Guided by the input
of an advisory board focused on both basic mathematics research and mathematics
education in the classroom, the software will be used by researchers and
educators who provide feedback for its enhancement. The new knowledge created by
these users will be shared with the public. The final impact of this project
will be to greatly enhance research on math abilities through the creation of a
common measure of number sense accuracy that will ultimately be felt in the
classroom. This software will be particularly useful in identifying children at
risk for difficulties in mathematics due to a specific deficit in number sense
accuracy.
