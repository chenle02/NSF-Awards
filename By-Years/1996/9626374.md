9626374 RABALAIS The Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON)will
operate the R/V PELICAN during 1996 as a general oceanographic vessel in support
of NSF-sponsored research projects. The PELICAN is a 105' general research
vessel constructed and operated by LUMCON. The vessel is scheduled for 99
operating days in 1996, of which 23 days are in support of NSF-sponsored
programs. The ship operates primarily in the Gulf of Mexico. This vessel is part
of a fleet used by the National Science Foundation to support oceanographic
research projects. Most oceanographic research projects require highly
specialized equipment and extensive support from a ship's crew members. An
increasing number of research projects require equipment that must be
permanently installed on a ship and for which the ship must be specifically
designed. Such equipment also requires highly trained crew members for
maintenance and operation. These vessels do not operate in the same manner as
general cargo or fishing vessels, and therefore, NSF supports the operation of a
variety of vessels specifically dedicated to oceanographic research. These
vessels are operated by universities and research institutions around the
country.
