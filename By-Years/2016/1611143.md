As a part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments,
the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program funds research and
innovative resources for use in a variety of settings. This conference will
convene Informal Science Education researchers, practitioners, policymakers, and
others focusing on generating engagement and new initiatives for Latinos. The
goals of the conference are to assess the current state of the field in
providing effective ISE experiences for Latinos, identify needs and gaps leading
to collaborative research, and synthesize effective strategies that enrich STEM
learning for Latinos. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will gather 100
participants face-to-face in September 2016 at the Exploratorium in San
Francisco, CA. A follow up workshop for another 40 participants will be held in
October 2017 at the Association of Science-Technology Centers annual meeting.
Conference outcomes include: identification of areas of future research; new and
strengthened partnerships between practitioners and researchers; and a set of
principles and guidelines for designing effective informal learning experiences
for and with Latinos.
