This project is to provide financial support for the 6th International
Conference on Structural Safety and Reliability (ICOSSAR '93) to be held in
Innsbruck, Austria on August 9-13, 1993. The ICOSSAR conferences are
international in participation and significance and also cover all technological
areas with regard to problems of structural safety and reliability. The
forthcoming conference will emphasize simulation, system identification, and the
implementation and application of reliability-based design and analysis. This is
expected to help establish methods of mitigating the potential loss of property,
human life and societal productivity arising from the functional and physical
failure of civil infrastructure and other critical engineering systems under
service usage as well as due to multiple natural and man-made hazards.
