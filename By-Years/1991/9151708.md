This project includes the introduction of several experiments into the
Department of Chemistry's Instrumentation curriculum. Two experiments are
proposed for advancement of the Instrumental Analysis course: The Identification
and Quantification of Pollutants in Ambient Air, and The Quantification of
Toluene in Soil. One experiment is proposed for introduction into the Advanced
Inorganic laboratory curriculum: Calculation of Carbonyl Force Constants in
Manganese Pentacarbonyl Bromide. Three other experiments are proposed for
enhancement of the Undergraduate Research Course. All of these experiments and
research projects feature FTIR analyses and technology.The Department of
Chemistry's undergraduate research program is involved in the enhancement
project. Projects featuring FTIR technology include the following: Coordination
of Nitric Oxide to Cobaltous Phthalocyanines, Characterization of Non-benozoid
Aromatics, and Polyurethane Foam as Absorbents for Organic Contaminates. Two of
these experiments feature surface reflectance analysis utilizing FTIR
technology.Incorporation of these experiments and research projects into the
current curriculum will serve to strengthen the Department of Chemistry's
undergraduate program by expanding and modernizing laboratory experiments and
projects which will better prepare its students for successful careers in both
industry and educational research.
