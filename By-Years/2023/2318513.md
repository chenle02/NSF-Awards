Indigenous environmental justice (EJ) movements increasingly use citizen science
(CS) for environmental monitoring. This project examines how as part of CS, EJ
movements strategically incorporate water science to produce new knowledge, and
whether and how the incorporation of water science shapes the outlooks and
capacities of Indigenous water defenders to address potential threats to
Indigenous communitiesâ€™ health, livelihoods, and territories.

This participatory project is a collaboration between a political
anthropologist, a biosystems engineer, an environmental chemist, a medical
geographer, Indigenous community organizations and governments and allied-NGOs,
as well as community scientists. Interviews will be conducted to examine how
Indigenous EJ movements use water science to not only address development, but
to also shape the knowledge, ethics, and skills of movement participants. The
project supports community access to water science and environmental mapping,
develops a collaborative methodology for training community scientists, provides
substantial graduate student training, organizes local meetings and conferences,
and shares findings with environmentalists, academics, professionals, government
agencies, and international audiences.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
