9730846 Ruppel Rates of gas hydrate fromation remain unquantified. This
modeling study will fill the gap in our knowledge of the gas hydrate systems
through the development of 3-phase (liquid- gas-hydrate) model for porous marine
sediments constrained by empirical temperature, pressure, salinity, stability of
seawater and hydrate data. Temperature gradients in marine sediments will also
be taken into account. The model will then be applied to determine how climatic
change in pressure (sea level fluctuations) and bottom water temperature affect
hydrate stability zone.
