Work supported by this award focuses on problems arising in the mathematical
theory of complex function theory. Three primary research themes will be
followed. The first concerns angular derivatives of conformal maps, that is,
mappings of domains in the complex plane which are univalent and analytic. It
has been a long standing problem to determine whether or not a conformal mapping
of a simply connected region onto the unit disk has an angular derivative.
Although many special cases are known to be true, only recently has the
techniques of extremal length been developed to the point where a general
existence result is now possible. It has been possible to obtain a precise
statement about the existence for the heretofore unknown case of strip domains.
More work remains. A second area of work will focus on the continued refinement
of numerical algorithms for conformal maps. A fast, reliable program has been
developed and used primarily for finding experimental properties of maps. Work
will now be done to understand convergence properties and use them to study the
classical corona problem for triply-connected domains. Finally, efforts will be
made to determine whether the class of interpolating Blaschke products generate
the entire space of bounded holomorphic functions on the disk. It was shown in
1976 that if one uses all Blaschke products, the statement is true. The
interpolating products are much less likely to occur, yet have more regularity
and therefore are a better class to use as approximates. Complex analysis, the
study of differentiable functions of a complex variable, lies at the heart of
vast areas of mathematics stretching from number theory through potential theory
and on to linear algebra and numerical analysis. This particular project
combines some long-standing problems and methods with new applications of
computational geometry and graph theory.
