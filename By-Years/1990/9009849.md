Research planning will be carried out for needed measurements of excitation
functions of stable and long lived- isotopes at the Harvard Cyclotron
Laboratory. The emphasis will be on isotopes of interest in astrophysical
research. Coupled with accelerator mass spectroscopy techniques, understanding
of the excitation (or production) mechanisms can be used in tracking (or dating)
processes such as the constancy of the solar cosmic ray flux over geologic time
periods.
