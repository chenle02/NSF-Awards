The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I is better outcomes and lower costs for people with major
neurological or psychiatric conditions. The proposed technology will offer a set
of tests for assessment of cognitive function. Millions of Americans suffer
persistent emotional, cognitive, or sensorimotor dysfunction after experiencing
traumatic brain injury. The proposed system will operate on standard mobile
devices to facilitate easy diagnosis and treatment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will establish the
feasibility of developing a battery of visuotactile tests to assess mental
domains. The proposed study will yield stimulus-response data (psychometric
functions) based on novel visuotactile measures and compare them to analogous
functions based on gold-standard measures that are much less accessible.
Personalized testing will maximize interpretability by customizing stimulus
parameters for each individual and testing session, thus minimizing the
likelihood of floor and ceiling effects. The feasibility aims will be achieved
if psychometric trends for the proposed measures match those found for analogous
gold-standard measures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
