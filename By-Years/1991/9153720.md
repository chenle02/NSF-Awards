The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) AMP proposal seeks funds to
support the creation of an alliance between eight historically black colleges
and universities (Tougaloo College, Miles College, Alabama A&amp;M University,
Oakwood College, Talladega College, Stillman, Alabama State University, and
Tuskegee University) in the "Deep South" with UAB serving as the lead
university. Alabama A&amp;M is the only institution listed other than UAB that
offers a doctorate degree in an NSF fundable academic area. The UAB AMP also has
considerable business support with the Coca-Cola Foundation, Rust International
Corporation, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company already on board. The
fundamental goal of the proposed alliance is to increase significantly the
number of minority scholars that complete the B.S. degree in NS&amp;E areas. The
UAB AMP Program will attempt to increase the number of science and/or
engineering students on the nine campus alliance by using a comprehensive and
longitudinal approach involving thirteen programs that focus at different points
along the "academic pipeline". The P.I. is requesting support for five of these
programs. Many of the other programs are currently supported by off campus
sources ( including businesses, Federal government, local sources) or from UAB.
The five programs to be supported in part from NSF are: o AMP Scholars, o Summer
Research Internship Program, o Science and Engineering Drop-in Centers, o High
School and College Science Campus, and o Instructional Enhancement Program. UAB
AMP will couple these five programs with the existing programs. The P.I.
presented a unique diagram tying together all the elements in the UAB AMP
pipeline programs. The complete list follows: o The Titusville 200: Partnership
for excellence program, o Grade School and Middle School Science Camp, o Pre-
college Summer Research Internships, o High School Summer Research Internships,
o HBCU Summer Research Internships, o College Summer Research Internships, o
Undergraduate Scholarship, o AMP Scholars, o Science and Engineering Drop-in
Centers, o High School and College Science Camp, o Instructional Enhancement
Program, o Graduate Fellowships, o Postdoctoral and Visiting Faculty
Fellowships, and o Faculty Recruitment, and Faculty Retention activities. The
UAB AMP programs are located in a region with a high minority population; the
potential impact of this alliance is significant.
