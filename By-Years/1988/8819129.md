The mechanism of induction of ACC synthase, the key regulatory enzyme in the
ethylene biosynthetic pathway in plants, by various plant hormones and
environmental stimuli is poorly understood. Recent experimental evidence
obtained by Dr. Theologis' laboratory using DNA sequences complementary to the
ACC mRNA indicates that enzyme inducers such as IAA, wounding and Li ions act at
the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. Studies on the structure of
the ACC synthase gene in Cucurbita are proposed herein to gain insight in the
future into the details of the biochemical mechanism that regulates its
expression. The specific aim of this proposal is: Structural characterization of
genomic sequences to ACC synthase mRNA in Cucurbita. To achieve this goal the
following experiments are proposed. Genomic libraries will be constructed into
the cloning vector EMBl3 using DNA from Cucurbita pepo seedlings. The genomic
sequences of the ACC synthase will be isolated by plaque filter hybridization
using the already isolated Cucurbita cDNA clone pACC1 as probe. The organization
and structural analysis of the gene(s) will be investigated in detail. %%%
Ethylene is one of the simplest organic molecules with biological activity. It
is considered to be the fruit ripening hormone and is known to regulate many
aspects of plant growth, development and senescence. ACC synthase is the key
enzyme in the synthetic pathway of ethylene.
