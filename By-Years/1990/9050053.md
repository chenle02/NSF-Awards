The National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) has designed a plan for a
national reform in the scope, sequence, and coordination of secondary school
science programs which spreads the teaching of science through all six years of
grades 7-12 and which emphasizes the progression in teaching and learning from
the concrete to the abstract. The reform effort, which is already under way on a
small scale under Federal funding, is to be tested in a number of sites(pilot
centers) throughout the country. This project is designed to enable NSTA to
become the coordination center for the reform effort. NSTA will coordinate
activities of the pilot centers including assessment, evaluation, and
documentation. In addition, NSTA will be working with six curriculum committees
to design, compile, and disseminate project materials to be used by pilot
centers in their curriculum restructuring efforts. NSTA will serve as the hub of
a network which links the pilot centers through meetings, newsletters, and
computer conferencing.
