This project will support the expansion of a computer laboratory which will be
used to introduce science, engineering, and mathematics students to scientific
computing on powerful workstations using symbolic manipulation programs and
locally developed software. It is being funded under the Instrumentation and
Laboratory Improvement (ILI) Program, which has the goal of improving the
quality of the undergraduate curriculum by supporting projects to develop new or
improved instrument-based undergraduate laboratory and/or field courses in
science, mathematics, or engineering. In particular, the objective of the
project is to incorporate computing into a third semester calculus course which
is taken by engineering, science, and mathematics students and to improve the
existing use of computers in upper division mathematics courses for students in
these fields.
