Boss, Alan&lt;br/&gt;AST 0305913&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will
improve the understanding of the formation of binary, brown dwarf, and sub-brown
dwarf stars. The discovery of companions to pre-main sequence stars with a
frequency at least equal to that of main sequence stars requires that binary
star formation occur prior to the pre-main-sequence phase of stellar evolution,
i.e., during the protostellar collapse phase. While brown dwarf companions to
solar-mass stars appear to be rare, the number of known free-floating brown
dwarf stars is large and growing. Brown dwarf binaries are common, and several
sub-brown dwarfs may have been discovered with masses in the range generally
associated with gas giant planets. Binary stars are hypothesized to form by
fragmentation during protostellar collapse, a process that can lead to the
formation of increasingly smaller mass protostars. This project will further
develop the theory of protostellar fragmentation, through detailed models of the
collapse of molecular cloud cores. The models will result in an improved
understanding of binary and multiple star formation, as well as of the minimum
mass of a newly-formed protostellar fragment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
impact of this work centers on the PI's efforts to communicate the excitement of
scientific discoveries to the public, through frequent interactions with
journalists, giving public lectures, helping museums with exhibits, and writing
articles for popular magazines. The PI also mentors undergraduate students as a
part of an NSF REU program.&lt;br/&gt;
