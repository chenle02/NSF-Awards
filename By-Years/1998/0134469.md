The PI investigate the effects of controlling the surface microstructure on the
single phase flow and heat transfer in microchannels, using whole field
temperature measurement techniques. If successful, the research could lead to
improved performance of MEMS devices and a variety of small scale, high heat
flux devices, such as heat sinks for microprocessors, wearable air conditioners
for harsh environments, and portable cooling units. The work could also clarify
the sometimes contradictory and inconsistent body of experimental data that
exist for heat transfer and fluid flow in microchannels. The educational plan
includes the development of Cross Educational Research Teams involving graduate
students, undergraduates and high school studens working with the faculty member
as a coordinated team.
