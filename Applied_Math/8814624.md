This project has three distinct parts: (1). A stopping rule for least squares
identification is proposed. It is so designed that with any degree of accuracy,
the recursive procedure will terminate if the iterates are inside a confidence
ellipsoid with high probability. (2). The robustness problem of some stochastic
approximation type algorithms will be investigated. The necessary and sufficient
condition for convergence is expected to be derived. (3). The problem of open
queueing network with parallel observers will be studied. Nearly optimal control
and a suitable numerical algorithm are expected to be obtained. These represent
areas in which mathematics may be used to solve problems related to the control
of mechanical and electrical systems.
