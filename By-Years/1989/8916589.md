This research is to investigate the transition zone structures in the upper
mantle with emphasis on the 400 km and 670 km discontinuity. Recent advances in
mineral physics have given a new urgency to the accurate characterization of
elastic structure for such boundaries, as well as to the search for other
discontinuities. By using broad band seismograms for a number of deep focus
earthquakes, and incorporating a suite of reflected and converted phases with
varying ray parameters, the work will separate the effects of wave speed and
density contrast, as well as measuring sharpness. The results have important
implications for global geodynamics and mantle convection, the driving force of
the crustal plates.
