Ergodic theory is an active, central area of Modern Analysis. Its origins lie
in the theoretical formulation for classical statistical mechanics at the end of
the nineteenth century. The modern point of view derives from the profound
mathematical theory of recurrence and ergodicity, as developed by Poincare,
Birkhoff, von Neumann and other giants earlier in this century. As the subject
has evolved and sophistication continually increased, ergodic theory has
acquired close relationships with other branches of mathematics, such as
dynamical systems, probability theory, functional analysis, number theory,
differential topology, and differential geometry, and with applications as far
ranging as mathematical physics, information theory, and computer design. The
principal objects of study in ergodic theory are transformations, or flows, on
an underlying set or space, and the ultimate goal is to determine long-term
behavior. Professor Ellis is a leading expert in topological dynamics, which
involves the study of continuous flows. He is a master of the abstract,
transcendental viewpoint, using his special insights to obtain deep, fundamental
results. His recent work shows how to subsume much of ergodic theory under
topological dynamics. This equivalence of ergodic and topological properties
effects a great unification by which general theorems from topological dynamics
are carried over directly to measure theoretic situations, proofs are
simplified, and considerable generalization is obtained. In his current project,
Professor Ellis proposes to utilize his new viewpoint to investigate many
significant topics of major impact in ergodic theory and dynamical systems.
These include Furstenberg's theory of Poisson boundaries, Moore's ergodic
theorem, and the Margulis-Mostow-Zimmer-Ratner rigidity type theorems for
various geodesic flows on manifolds.
