9308246 Bock This research investigates the environmental dispute in rural and
urban Oregon regarding the survival of the Northern Spotted Owl. The owl has
come to represent a focal point in debates between environmentalists and loggers
over the management of old growth forests that remain on federal lands. This
award enhances on- going dissertation research investigating the psychological
and moral components of this debate. The project uses field methods from
cultural anthropology and the analytic tools pertinent to social psychology
studies of emotion. The results are expected to help bridge the gap between
psychological and cultural approaches in the field of risk perceptions. ***
