This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of chemical sensors. During the tenure of this three-year
continuing grant, Professor Bright and his students will build upon results
derived from previous studies supported under NSF grant CHE-8921517 and employ
excited state fluorescence decay kinetics to study the immobilization of active
antibody fragments and their interaction with a soluble antigen. The overall
goal of this research is directed toward improving our understanding of
biological and synthetic chemical recognition elements (receptors) immobilized
at an interface. %%% This research will yield fundamental information on the
thermodynamics and dynamics of surface-immobilized receptors (artificial and
biochemical) thereby providing valuable insights to guide the development of
interfaces suitable for chemical sensing in complex milieu and enable the
rational design of a variety of technologically important receptor-based sensing
devices.
