9704116 Gracia-Rill The overall goal of this program project is to develop and
evaluate multiple, new, synergistic strategies for intervention and
rehabilitation after spinal cord injury. The premise of this application is that
any approach to successful intervention and rehabilitation after SCI will
require the utilization of a variety of different strategies. Thus, this program
project grant will utilize three different interventions and test their
effectiveness in the recovery of motor function in spinalized cats. The strength
of his project is that it integrates careful studies on the functional
integration of the neural transplants as well as pharmacological and electrical
stimulation on the enhancement of mobility.
