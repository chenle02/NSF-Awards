Dr. Wilson and his team will carry out a research program to analyze and
understand recent data taken with their 1mm wavelength bolometer camera (called
AzTEC) to measure millimeter continuum dust emission from submillimeter galaxies
(SMGs) within, or lensed by, galaxy clusters in the COSMOS field (a region of
the sky that has been studied extensively at many wavebands). This is the
largest survey to date of the SMG population. The team will study hierarchical
structure formation and evolution via the evolution of the SMG population in
cluster environments. The work will utilize panchromatic observations resulting
from a number of radio, millimeter, and optical telescopes. The resulting
dataset will guide numerical simulations and semi-analytic structure formation
theories. The project will also map the small-scale Sunyaev-Zeldovich emission
in a suite of large clusters in order to quantify the importance of mergers.
