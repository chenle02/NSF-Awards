This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, is
directed towards the development of electrochemical methods to study chemical
and biochemical problems. During the tenure of this three-year continuing grant,
Professor Allen J. Bard and his students at the University of Texas at Austin
will gain insights into protein structure, binding constants, stoichiometry, and
develop biosensors by exploiting the interaction of electroactive agents with
biomolecules. Changes in current and electrochemiluminescence responses caused
by interactions of biomacromolecules with these agents will be used to probe
reactions involving enzymes, antibodies, and DNA. In addition, scanning
electrochemical microscopy (SECM) will be used to detect fast heterogeneous and
coupled homogeneous reactions and to investigate electron and ion transport
across liquid-liquid interfaces, thus allowing characterization of polymer films
and self-assembled monolayers. Electrochemical approaches have been used for
generations to measure the composition, concentration, and reactivity of
numerous metal, organic, biological and semiconductor species. These techniques
are used routinely in industrial and clinical industries to make simple
determinations such as the pH of water in swimming pools, contaminants in
drinking water, and the identification of complex, trace level hormones in the
body which signal pregnancy. Professor Allen Bard and his students at the
University of Texas at Austin have been leaders in the field of
electroanalytical chemistry and will be spearheading new analytical and surface
analysis methods useful in such fields as biotechnology, environmental analysis,
and advance manufacturing.
