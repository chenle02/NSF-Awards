9305201 Hervig The secondary ion mass spectrometer (SIMS or ion microprobe) at
Arizona State University will be modified to improve the performance of the
primary ion beam (smaller diameter and, hence, better analytical spatial
resolution). A better vacuum will also be achieved, resulting in a lowering of
detection limits, especially for light volatile elements. The instrument
modifications will be designed, built and tested in-house by the Principal
Investigator and colleagues. The improved ASU ion microprobe will be available
to on-campus and off-campus researchers, and will be used primarily in earth
sciences projects to determine isotope and trace element compositions of
geological and meteorite samples with a spatial resolution on the order of
several micrometers. ***
