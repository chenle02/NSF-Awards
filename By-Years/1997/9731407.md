This project will contribute to our knowledge of gibbons (the lesser apes) in
several ways. First, new DNA sequences will be generated for all of the gibbon
species. These new sequences will be used to construct an evolutionary tree for
the gibbons, and this tree forms a base from which to study other evolutionary
questions. A tree of the four subgenera and nine species of gibbons will be
constructed using three independent DNA sequence data sets: one from the
mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit II gene, one from the
glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase gene encoded on the X chromosome, and one from
the zinc finger gene encoded on the Y chromosome. Levels of DNA sequence
divergence will also be used to assess taxonomic status of species and
subspecies relative to other well-accepted primate pairs. These data also will
be used to estimate the date of the split of gibbons from the great apes, and
the subsequent gibbon radiation. Morphological, vocal, and behavioral characters
will be mapped onto the tree to study aspects of character evolution. Finally,
species-specific diagnostic sites will be identified, which may assist in
conservation efforts since several gibbon species are classified as endangered.
