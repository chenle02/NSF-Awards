University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Digital Government: SGER: LOCKSS Government
Documents&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will explore the usefulness and
appropriateness of a distributed peer to peer network-based storage and
archiving technology for the long-term (decades) maintenance of Federal records.
Using a system known as LOCKSS, the PI will collaborate with the Government
Printing Office and its group of 55 Federal Depository LIbraries. The hope is to
provide new options to the current model of a central archieve with off-site
backups.
