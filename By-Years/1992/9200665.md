Aerogels of litania and zirconia are prepared and evaluated as supports for
sulfate-ion superacids. The aerogels are synthesized using a sol-gel process in
conjunction with supercritical laying. The stability and crystallization
behavior of these materials in response to heat treatments, both with and
without the addition of sulfate ions, are studied by nitrogen adsorption, X-ray
diffraction, and differential thermal analysis. Acid properties of sulfate-
promoted aerogels are characterized with Hammett indicators, thermogravimeteric
and infrared measurements of adsorbed pyridine, and the reaction of isobutane.
Superacids (acids stronger than what can be obtained in water) are essential to
many operations in several industries. A number of liquid and gaseous superacids
are available, but they invariably present serious occupational or environmental
hazards. Solid superacids are much easier to control and contain and their
development is a major objectives in the striving for a safer industrial
environment. //
