The major thrust of this project in the physical chemistry program concerns
state-to-state dynamics of photochemical reactions involving simple, easily
spectroscopically characterized chemical species. The research seeks to answer
the question of how the initial energy of reactant influence the dynamics and
eventual outcome of chemical events. The proposed experimental approach consists
of preparing gas phase reactants with well defined nonequilibrium properties by
polarized laser photoselection in a cold supersonic jet. The quantum state of
the nascent products will be completely characterized by laser excitation,
polarization and Doppler spectroscopic techniques. Results of such experiments
provide stringent tests for many of the current theories and hypotheses of
reaction dynamics.
