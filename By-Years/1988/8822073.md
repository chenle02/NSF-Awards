The 18o/16o ratio of the ice in a core through the central part of the Greenland
ice sheet provides a uniquely detailed record of paleoenvironmental conditions
that may extend back as far as 200,000 years. This project will study the
18o/16o ratio to determine the characteristics of the major global climate
cycles and the cause and effect relationships between the various environmental
parameters, such as temperature, concentration of CO2 and CH4, dustiness, and
cation/anion concentration, that change with climate. A better definition of the
processes that determine climate change will provide better predictions of
future climate change. The location of intervals of major and/or rapid climate
change will be the focus of detailed multiparameter studies, This study will
provide a preliminary isotope stratigraphy of the core. The 18o/16o research is
part of the multiparameter multi-investigator GISP II project. A special
collaboration with J.W.C. White, University of Colorado, will provide a record
of deuterium excess (d").
