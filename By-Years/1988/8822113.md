This conference will bring together 20 philosophers of biology, developmental
biologists, evolutionary biologists, and theoretical biologists to examine a
number of philosophical and conceptual issues which arise in developmental
biology and its implications for evolution. The three focal areas will concern:
1) the place of theory in developmental biology; 2) self- organization and
selection as balancing and collaborative processes in development and evolution;
and 3) implications of a proper theory of development for evolution. Some of
these issues are not new, others have never been addressed. In particular, the
intertwined roles of self-organization and selection constitute a large new
problem area never confronted in physics, nor yet well formulated in biology.
The group which will come together includes expertise in a variety of areas of
philosophy and biology which bear on the issues raided. The aim is to produce a
clear statement of research programs to advance in each of the three domains.
The results of the conference will hopefully be published in the Quarterly
Review of Biology, and also will likely be published in a single volume from the
Santa Fe Institute.
