9528787 Macdougall This grant provides $301,000 as partial support of the costs
of acquiring a new thermal ionization mass spectrometer (TIMS) with high
abundance sensitivity, multiple collectors and negative ion capabilities.
Scripps Institute of Oceanography will provide 40% of the total equipment
acquisition costs. This instrument will allow these investigators to continue
there present work is applied isotope geochemistry as well as expand into
systems which require the mass resolution and negative ion capabilities for
which their current single collector TIMS is not suitable. These increased
capabilities include, Re/Os isotope systematics of marine sediments which have
implications for paleotectonics, climate, weathering and oceanic hydrothermal
activity, and U/Th series isotopes in igneous rocks, which can be used to gain
insight into the time scales and processes of magma genesis and transport as
well as the chemical composition of source materials for mid-ocean ridge
basalts, island arc andesites and rocks from other tectonic settings. ***
