This award from the Science in Developing Countries - Latin America program will
support a regional research symposium on Mathematical Logic, to be held in Bahia
Blanca, Argentina in July 1992. Organizers are Dr. Richard A. Shore of Cornell
University and Dr. R. Cignoli of the Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina. The
goal of the symposium is to encourage the development of logic and its
connections with computer science in latin America by presenting current work
and research problems as well as developing opportunities for collaborative
research between U.S. and Latin American logicians. As part of the symposium,
six U.S. participants will present the results of recent research. The areas
that will be emphasized include set theory, algebraic, categorical and
nonclassical logic and the relations of the last two to computer science. The
benefits to both U.S. and Latin American participants are the development of new
areas for regional research cooperation and the potential for improving the
nations' scientific infrastructure.
