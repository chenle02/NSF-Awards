9731284 Lake Working with existing projects such as the SSI, Mathematics
Teacher/Resource Collaborating for Collaboration in the Classroom (MTRC3), and
others, this project forms linkages across schools and districts throughout the
region. It engages teachers in teams, facilitated by mentors, to reflect on how
their practice relates to state standards. It helps develop teachers' assessment
skills and, in the process, improves student outcomes and classroom practice.
Features are Web-based telementoring tools, Mentor Center, and an Exchange, all
used to link K-12 educators, mathematicians and scientists. In the first year
teachers form teams from existing projects mentored by other teachers. Central
themes include constructing rubrics for assessing student work related to
standards, understanding qualities of good student learning, and adopting
effective instructional strategies. In the second year this expands across grade
levels and projects. In the third year, new teachers are mentored by experienced
teachers, and the project teams develop guides. Cost sharing is 33%.
