This REU Site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the
NSF REU program. This award supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates
(REU) Site led by Professors Osvaldo Cox and Beatriz Zayas both at Universidad
Metropolitana in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The REU Site is located at four campuses
of the University of Puerto Rico and the Arecibo Observatory. The research
projects supported at these Sites entitled, "Research Training in Cross-
disciplinary Chemical Sciences" will engage disadvantaged Hispanic STEM students
and will to bring together five institutions and a multidisciplinary mentoring
team to increase the research competitiveness of these chemistry students and
improve their numbers in the STEM pipeline in the chemical sciences.

This REU Site anticipates an increase in chemistry majors who will experience
research competitiveness, gain confidence, and develop an interest in graduate
schools, as well as become professionals who are prepared to enter the STEM
workforce. This REU will also benefit the entire community of chemistry students
at UMET who can also participate in the REU developmental activities during the
academic year. It brings together five institutions and a mentoring team who
will increase the research competitiveness of these students and positively
impact the STEM pipeline in the chemical sciences.
