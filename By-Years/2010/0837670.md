Engineering - Electrical (55)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing
new course materials to teach quantum mechanics to junior engineering students.
The course materials include course lectures, laboratory experiments and a
textbook. The materials are being developed using a bottom-up approach that
begins with the analysis of quantum dots and then moves on to two-dimensional
and three-dimensional quantum objects. The new course utilizes some educational
materials in nanoscience and nanoelectronics developed under the NSF
Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education program. The new course is designed such
that it could replace the third physics course that is common in electrical
engineering curricula. The course also serves as a gateway to senior level
elective courses in nanoelectronics and related areas. The project includes a
detailed formative and summative evaluation plan led by an independent
evaluator. The evaluation plan is designed to assess the quality of the
materials being developed and their impact on student learning. The course and
lab materials are being disseminated through conferences and a web site. The
project includes outreach to high schools through an established summer
workshops for high school students program.
