This Integrative Graduate Education and Research (IGERT) award supports a Ph.D.
training program at the Colorado School of Mines to pursue integrative research
and education in Intelligent Geosystems. Graduate students will be trained to
add real time, adaptive, sensing capabilities to the monitoring of natural or
engineered earth structures, e.g., an earth dam, a ground water system, or a
geoconstruction site (tunneling, urban excavation, highway); the sensor networks
employed will allow a geosystem to sense its environment, diagnose its
condition, and make decisions to improve the management, operation, or objective
of the geosystem. The goals are to advance the development of the "intelligent"
geosystems while educating and training a new generation of leaders who are able
to operate effectively in this emerging interdisciplinary area. The proposed
IGERT program will institute an interdisciplinary and holistic approach to
trainees. Key components of this IGERT award include: (1) a multi-disciplinary
collaborative research team framework to foster team development and
interdisciplinary innovation in intelligent geosystem concepts; (2) a leadership
and teamwork development program to train the next generation of geosystem
leaders for industry, academia and government; (3) a PhD minor in
social/environmental ethics &amp; policy to broaden trainee understanding beyond
the technical challenges to the social, environmental and political aspects of
intelligent geosystems; (4) a self-paced cross-disciplinary technical course
using modules in intelligent geosystems; and (5) an internship with a government
laboratory or industry in intelligent geosystems. These five components of this
IGERT program will produce diverse, highly skilled leaders with the strong
social and environmental awareness required in multidisciplinary environments.
IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S.
Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep
knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal
skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to
catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new
models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for
collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.
