This project investigates epidemiological, hormonal, demographic, and cultural
variables pertaining to pregnancy-related sickness in rural Bangladeshi women.
Data were collected from a prospective reproductive survey of 708 women in
Bangladesh in 1993. Twice weekly interviews and urine specimens collected across
gestation from 203 pregnant women will be used to 1) examine the prevalence,
maternal age pattern, and gestational timing of pregnancy-related sickness: 2)
determine the relationship between hormone profiles (estrogen, progesterone, and
human chorionic gonadotropin) and the presence/absence and gestational timing of
pregnancy-related sickness: and 3) determine the relationship of pregnancy
outcome (live birth vs. miscarriage) with pregnancy-related sickness, while
simultaneously controlling for the effects of maternal age, hormone profiles,
and parity. Immunoassays will be used to quantify hormonal concentrations across
gestation. Descriptive statistics and event history analysis will be used to
examine the relationships among pregnancy-related sickness and the variables
discussed above. This work will be used to evaluate hypotheses on the etiologic,
ecological and evolutionary bases of pregnancy-related sickness.
