ABSTRACT The Engineering Coalition of Schools for Excellence in Education and
Leadership (ECSEL) will focus on the following which are grouped into the three
major programmatic areas: 1. Learning by Design: This task has three main
components: (i)Industry-driven, interdisciplinary design projects for upper-
level students; (ii) a comprehensive assessment program developed in partnership
with industrial allies and professional associations to identify actual
knowledge and skill needs of engineers and engineer technicians, and yielding
authentic curricular design criteria and (iii) the formation of a new type of
collaborative curriculum development and dissemination environment. These
components wil be combined with ongoing efforts to expand, enhance, and further
validate the design-centered ECSEL experience. 2. Our Role in the K-14
Community: A comprehensive program will be launched to break down the barriers
that prevent the infusion of engineering and technology into K-14 curricula,
while simutaneously preventing the infusion of talented youth into the
engineering and technical workforce. Engineers, teachers, professional
societies, unions, and K-14 educators will work together to create new
mechanisms whereby: (i) teachers learn to design alongside engineers; (ii)
engineers are provided pathways to become teachers; (iii) doors are opened
between engineering and engineering technology programs; and (iv) ECSEL
innovations are made available within the richly diverse community college
environment. 3. Student and Faculty Development: ECSEL's work in building the
infrastructure and human support networks necessary for students and faculty to
become effective agents of reform will be bolstered and broadened by a variety
of mechanisms, including (i) shared responsibility and leadership in all ECSEL
activities, with continued and enhanced leadership roles for our students; (ii)
creation of new programs to attract and retain underrepresented groups in the
engineering professoriate; and (iii ) exchanges, workshops, and programs for new
and veteran faculty to promote ECSEL's theme of learning by design. The seven
members of this Coalition are: City College of New York Howard University
Massachusetts Institute of Technology Morgan State University Pennsylvania State
University University of Maryland, College Park University of Washington ??
