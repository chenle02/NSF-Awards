This research activity is designed to develop a non-invasive technique for the
monitoring of plasma reactors. The basis for this approach is the phenomenon of
Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) which can be used to conduct three-dimensional
mapping of the plasma properties. This will be analyzed to provide quantitative
information on constituent species, detection of appearance or disappearance of
species and contaminants, and end point detection. The technique will also
develop innovative methods to perform rapid scanning with a high degree of
accuracy and sensitivity. The technique can be used to provide reliable
monitoring to enable process control of the dry plasma process. The dry plasma
process is widely used for the manufacturing of semi-conductor devices. The
ability to implement closed loop control will have significant impact on the
yield and efficiency of the process with large benefits to a vital industry
segment.
