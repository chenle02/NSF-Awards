This project, at the University of Toledo, creates an I-Corps Site at an
institution that has a track-record in moving projects from the lab to
commercialization. The UT entrepreneurial efforts focus on students and involves
coaching, mentoring and innovation curriculum. In addition, this institution
will designate physical space to the I-Corps Sites activity. This new I-Corps
Site builds on the University of Toledo?s Innovation Enterprises (UTIE) which
developed a technology commercialization paradigm called ?Lab to Launch.? Lab to
launch engages stakeholders at various points along the tech transfer,
prototyping, commercialization, seed/venture funding and market entry continuum
of business creation. The UT Site is student-centric and there is strong
integration of faculty-student interactions. The facilities currently provided,
and that will be expanded, are substantial and provide a strong foundation for
an I-Corps Site. In addition, the broader impacts may be significant, impacting
on economic development in the region and matching well to the mission of the
I-Corps Site goals.
