With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging program in the National
Science Foundation Division of Chemistry, and partial co-funding from the
Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research, Professor Anyin Li’s
group at the University of New Hampshire (UNH) is exploring the fundamental
processes underlying electrospray ionization mass spectrometry - one of the most
important analytical methods used for characterization of organic, biological,
and biochemical systems, including drug discovery and quality control. The
methods being developed target improved analytical figures of merit, providing
new opportunities to solve fundamental problems as well as to enhance UNH’s
interaction with local industry and education partners. The research activities
train graduate, undergraduate, and high school students, thereby increasing the
talent pool for a stronger STEM workforce. K-12 science teacher participation
produces contemporary science teaching materials to engage student interest. The
research group is also hosting summer workshops for broad dissemination of
science and technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Existing electrospray ionization
(ESI) methods have onset ionization currents on the order of nanoamps, much
higher than needed by most mass analyzers. They are often plagued by non-uniform
ionization efficiency, formation of nonspecific adducts, and (for small
emitters) clogging. To address these issues, the Li group is advancing and
characterizing ESI in the femtoamp range, with flow rates on the order of
picoliters/minute. The developed methods can extend the linear dynamic range to
both lower and higher concentrations, while improving spectral quality and
reducing matrix interferences and variations in ionization
efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
