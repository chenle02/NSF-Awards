National college and career readiness standards call for integrating engineering
practices into science and mathematics instruction. Very few models for doing
this have been implemented and studied. This Engineering Teacher Pedagogy
project implements and assesses the promise of an extended professional
development model coupled with curriculum enactment to develop teacher
pedagogical skills for integrating engineering design into high school biology
and technology education classrooms. Professional development is provided to
twenty high school biology teachers and twenty technology education teachers in
the Baltimore County Public Schools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The professional
development consists of two five day sessions in two consecutive summers and
follow up in two academic years as the teachers learn content, pedagogical
content knowledge and classroom management skills. The project investigates the
teachers' learning trajectories using validated instruments. A longitudinal
study investigates teachers' change in practice and its role on student learning
through classroom observations and examination of student artifacts. The study
also investigates whether the change in practice persists over time and the
extent to which the change in practice transfers to other learning environments.
This study should elucidate the issues of teaching science concepts through the
use of science and engineering practices.
