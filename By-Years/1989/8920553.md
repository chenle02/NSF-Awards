Professor Peter Wolynes is supported by a grant from The Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to continue his studies in the nonequilibrium
statistical mechanics of condensed systems. He is applying theoretical
statistical mechanics and numerical simulation techniques to studies of electron
transfer in biomolecular systems, and to solvation dynamics and chemical
dynamics in glassy systems. The results obtained from such studies provide a
molecular level interpretation of important physical and biological processes.
Professor Wolynes is conducting theoretical research in two specific areas.
First, he is investigating electron transfer and recombination reactions in
biomolecules, using path integral simulations appropriate for studying the deep
tunneling regime. His studies in this area will help to determine the role of
real time quantum interference effects and dephasing in such rate processes. The
second area of research involves a continuation of his studies of glass
transitions using computer simulation and renormalization group approaches. He
plans to examine the problem of the glass transition in systems of confined
geometry and make comparisons with NMR experiments as well as tribological
experiments.
