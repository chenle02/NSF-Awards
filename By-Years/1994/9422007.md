9422007 Beveridge This award is to purchase two shared-memory multiprocessor
systems, one with accelerated 3D graphics as required by the following research
projects: 1) Computer Vision and Graphics; 2) Combinatorial Optimization Using
Local and Global Search; 3) Machine Learning for Classification and Control; 4)
Planning Agents in Dynamic Simulated Environments; 5) Comparing Functional
Programming Languages. Essential to these projeats is the computational power of
the multiprocessors. The equipment will provide a means to gain experience
mapping algorithms onto coarse grain parallel hardware. Many parallel algorithms
in these projects require a shared memory multiprocessor architecture. The
vision, graphics, learning and planning projects explicitly benefit from the 3D
graphics capability of the hardware. In addition to the above projects, this
equipment will be available for exploration of new areas of research. ***
