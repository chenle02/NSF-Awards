With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at McMurry University will upgrade their CW proton NMR
Spectrometer to proton/C-13 Fourier Transform NMR. This equipment will
facilitate enzyme binding site activation studies and natural products chemistry
research. This upgrade will also enable much faster scan times, and therefore
allow classroom use. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation
of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to
characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the
dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-
art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier
research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in a number of
areas, especially biochemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
