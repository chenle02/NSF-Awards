The proposed research concerns the geometry and topology of dynamical systems
with impact: classical billiards, billiards in magnetic fields, outer billiards
and other systems defined by variational principles or geometrical
constructions. The research focuses on the number and structure of periodic
orbits, stability properties of these systems, rigidity of integrable dynamics
and related problems of geometry and topology. The techniques include
variational principles (in particular, Morse theory) and related methods of
algebraic topology and geometry, in particular, topological study of various
configuration spaces. Applications to other areas are concerned, in particular,
topological issues of the motion planning problems in
robotics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main emphasis of the proposed research is in
the interrelations between seemingly distant ideas and approaches from geometry
and topology, on the one hand, and dynamical systems, mechanics, electrodynamics
and robotics, on the other. The proposed research will make an impact on
undergraduate research in mathematics via the Mathematics Advance Studies
Semesters program (MASS) at Penn State of which the PI is the Director.
