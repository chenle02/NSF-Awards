Nova Technology, Inc is investigating the use of a laser beam to illuminate a
microscope specimen and a reference surface in an optical setup similar to a
Twyman-Green interferometer. The scattered light from the specimen is mixed with
the scattered light from the reference surface at the image plane of the
microscope. By monitoring the speckle intensity with a CCD array, the phase
change in speckle is detected for surface displacement measurement.
Intermittently the reference illumination is blocked off so that surface
deformation can be mapped using a speckle pattern correlation technique. In
addition, the microscope can be illuminated by an incoherent light source for
conventional imaging. The images from three different operating modes are then
processed and integrated for display.
