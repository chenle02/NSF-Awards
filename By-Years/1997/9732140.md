This project involves the development and enhancement of scanning force
microscopy (SFM) for imaging of biological specimens. New technical capabilities
for SFM will be explored to improve methods to investigate multi-protein-DNA
complexes by SFM in air, including a novel method to label these complexes for
SFM studies and a method to determine protein-induced DNA bending. In addition,
an SFM-based nanomanipulator instrument will be developed and methods for the
production of sharper probes will be explored to improve the spatial resolution
of the SFM. The combination of these enhancements should greatly expand the
applicability of SFM to biological systems.
