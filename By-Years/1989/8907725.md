This project will assist NSF in compiling, standardizing and analyzing baseline
data on the stock and employment of scientists and engineers for selected
countries (Italy, Canada, Sweden, Taiwan, and South Korea). Foreign census and
labor force data will be used to provide estimates of scientists and engineers
wherever possible by detailed fields and selected characteristics such as sex,
age, educational qualifications and branch of economy and industry. The National
Science Foundation has primary responsibility within the Government for
collecting and providing statistics and analysis of information on scientific
and technical personnel resources. NSF has established a data base of such
information for four large industrialized countries--Japan, West Germany,
France, and the United Kingdom (agreement number SRS-8813944). This project
would expand that data base to include data on additional important
industrialized and newly industrializing countries. This type of information is
sought by decisionmakers in the pubic and private sectors and is needed for
Congressional- ly mandated reports such as Science and Engineering Indicators.
