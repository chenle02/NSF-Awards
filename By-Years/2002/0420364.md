Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0420364&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amr Baz and Chung
Fu&lt;br/&gt;Univ Maryland/College Park&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an
equipment grant proposal for distributed sensor systems to map the deflection
and strain fields of an infrastructure, such as a bridge system. The output
signals will be wireless transmitted to the control station via the equipment to
be acquired for the mapping. The field experiment will be conducted in
collaboration with the Maryland State Highway Administration. The project will
lead to a new class of wireless distributed sensors for monitoring of a wide
class of civil infrastructures, and help to develop a foundation for training of
students and engineers through education programs at the virtual reality lab at
the college Park campus.&lt;br/&gt;
