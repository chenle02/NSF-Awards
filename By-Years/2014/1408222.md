Control of large power grids today is largely performed by centralized computer
programs run at centers like the Independent System Operators (ISO). In order to
cope with the growing stress and difficulty of these computations, as more
renewable energy and more complicated users of power come on line, this team
plans to develop new systems for distributed computation, both for scheduling of
power supply and demand, and for balancing decisions which maintain stability of
the grid in real time. The research feeds into an active power education effort,
including special efforts by the PI in Women in Engineering and in summer
engineering programs for girls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work fits within the
growing new effort to take advantage of distributed or parallel computing, after
the speed of classical sequential computers has hardly improved at all for many
years. The distributed scheduling here will be based on multi-stage DC optimal
power flow, though the team plans to move ahead to the nonlinear case of
realistic AC flows as soon as they are able. The real-time balancing will try to
balance dispatchable and nondispatchable generation and loads based on a
consensus-plus-innovation approach
