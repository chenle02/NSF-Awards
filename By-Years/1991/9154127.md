VideoGraph is an instructional tool created for use in introductory physics
laboratories at the high school and college levels. It allows students to
videotape motion events, and using the graphing capabilities of a microcomputer,
to simultaneously examine and analyze the motion. In this revision of the
initial software package, which received the Ohaus Award in 1989, the developers
are enhancing the original capabilities of the program, including high quality
color images and support for access to videodiscs. In addition, it will allow
students to save previously recorded events, whether recorded on videotape or
played from a videodisc, and "draw" events using paint applications or
programming language. In this way, students will be able to analyze previously
recorded events or even simulated microworlds in which the laws of motion are
preprogrammed into the system. In addition to developing the software, this
project will conduct classroom studies to facilitate its integration into
traditional classroom, laboratory, and homework activities. It is also refining
a previously developed test of student skills in motion graph interpretation,
and plans to develop observational schemes and alternative assessment methods to
verify that the materials are having an impact on student understanding.
