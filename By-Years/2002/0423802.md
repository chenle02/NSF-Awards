The Museum of Science will partner with four other informal science education
institutions to plan a nationwide distributed research project that will explore
universal access to informal learning of science, technology, engineering and
mathematics (STEM) in museums. This planning project will determine domains of
access-related research, establish a core set of advisors to assist with the
development of the research agenda, coordinate the selection of topics for
investigation and define areas where a shared research protocol might be
appropriate for studies conducted at partner institutions. Research initially
will be focused on visitors with disabilities who have traditionally been
marginalized from many museum experiences.
