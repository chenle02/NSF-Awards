The antibiotics represent an extremely important class of biologically active
molecules, some of which bear strong chemical and structural similarities to
certain carbohydrates. This grant in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
Program is directed toward utilizing them as cheap and efficient starting
materials for certain classes of antibiotics such as the streptovaricins. The
general objective of this research program is to develop the efficient use of
readily available carbohydrate derivatives in organic synthesis. The testing
ground is the ansa chain of streptovaricin A. Two different approaches are
described. The first, in progress, involves a process known as pyranosidic
homologation in which the sugar is elaborated into a bi- and thence a tri-
pyranose, whose continuous carbon backbone /provides the required number of
stereogenic centers. The second approach is a convergent process, which plans to
make use of a remarkable aldol condensation that has been uncovered in earlier
work. The substrate, a 3-keto pyranoside, is itself remarkable in that it shows
no inclination toward beta elimination. This unexpected stability is merely one
of several idiosyncracies encountered in the course of these investigations,
which reveal striking differences between carbohydrates and carbo-cycles that
are not satisfactorily "explained" by current theories. A substantial effort is
therefore directed toward a systematic investigation of these idiosyncracies,
employing a combination of theoretical and experimental methods, buttressed by
appropriate computer-assisted modelling techniques.
