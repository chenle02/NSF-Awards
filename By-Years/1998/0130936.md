With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
(CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Florida will
upgrade a 300 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to
carry out studies on a) cyathane diterpenoids; b) chemoenzymatic synthesis; c)
organometallic chemistry of group 6 imido diamide complexes; d) nucleic acid
chemistry; e) linked phenoxide ligands as rigid platforms for the preparation of
large constructs; and f) synthesis of carbosilane/siloxane segmented polymers.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies will have an impact in a number of areas including biochemistry and
materials chemistry.
