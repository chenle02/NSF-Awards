This project investigates domain specific parallel computation for the adaptive
solution of partial differential equations. The decomposition of parallel
programs is achieved with the aid of a family of annotation languages that
enable the user to annotate programs written in various programming languages.
The synthesis of parallel computation relies on the description of an overall
computation done in a simple configuration language in terms of interactions of
programs and their fragments created by annotations. The decomposition by
annotations and synthesis through configuration simplify the process of (1)
determining the grain size for efficient parallel processing, (2) data
distribution, and (3) run time optimization.
