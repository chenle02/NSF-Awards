Support is requested for an international conference on the subject of neural
networkds. This subject deals with the modeling of behavioral and brain
processes, and the application of neural modeling concepts to technological
problems. Those topics have provided much stimulus in research areas such as
vision and image processing, sensory-motor control and robotics, associative
learning, self-organization, and cognitive information processing. The
Conference is sponsored by the International Neural Network Society, which
comprises researchers from diverse disciplines (engineering, psychology,
neuroscience, mathematics, computer science, and physics). A principal goal of
the meeting is to encourage students and younger faculty to learn about and
contribute to the field; the NSF funds will be used to provide travel grants for
them.
