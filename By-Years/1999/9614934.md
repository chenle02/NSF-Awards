9614934 Scott When speciation occurs, different populations of a species have
diverged enough that they become genetically isolated. Males and females of the
new species do not mate with each other. In this project a quantitative genetic
analysis will show the genetic basis for variation in male courtship signals,
which are pheromones, and female responses to the signals, between two strains
of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. These two fruit fly strains have
partial behavioral reproductive isolation and so are a good system for study of
the earliest stages of speciation. Specific segments of the chromosomes of one
strain will be introgressed into the other and the resulting lines will be
analyzed for alteration of male signals and female responses. This approach will
ultimately allow the identification of genes involved in the male and female
components of mate selection. Speciation is a basic process in the generation of
biodiversity. In addition to elucidating the early stages of speciation, this
research is relevant to integrated pest management techniques using pheromones.
Knowledge about the fruit fly gained from this study will help to determine
whether resistance to pheromone-based pest management techniques are likely to
evolve in related pests, such as mosquitoes, medflies and tsetse flies.
