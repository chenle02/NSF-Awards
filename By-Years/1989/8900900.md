Using a strong experimental research program in the principal areas of civil and
environmental engineering, this REU site activity will permit undergraduate
students to be involved in hands-on laboratory experiments. Six civil and
environmental engineering laboratories are available for undergraduate research:
(1) concrete and construction materialsb, (2) environmental engineering, (3)
geotechnical, (4) hydraulics, (5) remote sensing, and (6) structural
engineering. The laboratory experience well motivate the students to consider
advanced studies and research in engineering. Eight students will participate;
four from outside the host institution. Research projects include: (1) neutron
radiography applied to concrete, (2) effects of carbon dioxide exchange rate on
neutralized acid lakes, (3) soil dynamics and liquefraction of soil due to
earthquake loadings, (4) gas transfer in streams with surface instabilities, (5)
remote sensing digital image analysis, and cold-formed steel and reinforced
concrete.
