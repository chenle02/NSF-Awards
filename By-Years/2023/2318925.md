Detecting rare events of anomalies using high-dimensional real-world data with
mixed-type multivariate response, sparse and unknown signals and a large number
of missing values is very challenging. The architectural integration of domain
knowledge and data with spatial and temporal variables significantly improves
the model reliability, interpretability, and prediction accuracy. For predicting
anomalies, the investigator plans to develop efficient and effective posterior
sampling algorithms and apply these methods to various real-word data with
interdisciplinary collaborations. Students, including those from
underrepresented groups, will be involved in education and outreach activities
featuring real world problem-solving.

The research aims to develop novel anomaly detection algorithms. These will
leverage hybrid information from the domain knowledge (represented as prior
distributions) and regularization constraints to establish an efficient and
effective search direction. Data information embedded in likelihood functions
and regression models will reduce the search space for parameter estimation.
