Contemporary information technology is ever more central to science and society
in the midst of the deluge of complex data. The impact on bioscience is notable,
where the pace of production and the data complexity means that a large amount
of data is often not adequately analyzed by the data producers, yet researchers
expect rapid dissemination of such types of data. To ensure effective impact, a
solution promising to be transformational is to open "big data" analysis to the
broader community. An avenue is provided by modern IT and the explosive growth
and democratizing impact of the Internet, which, following the digitization of
information and communication, has changed the pace of information exchange and
opens up new channels for disseminating data and for engaging disparate
disciplines in extended, productive collaborations. The result of this will be a
platform with a customized pre-build interface that will significantly reduce
the downside of the form-based data input approach. The input interface will be
small, easy to use and readily accepted by users but still relevant to what a
user might want to input. The interface will provide strong search ability to
the controlled vocabulary and provide users with this information through "input
hint", dropdown lists or auto-completion, according to what is most efficient
for the specific extension and provides an effective, readily followed and
precise process. Sustaining the free text input section will provide users with
maximum freedom of data input. By enabling community collaboration via Web
access and implementing a database resource linked with the knowledge collection
interface together with free text entry format, this system will provide a venue
for researchers among many communities, including those located at non-research
intensive universities, community colleges and minority-serving institutions, in
this Nation and worldwide, to contribute their insight to experimental research
observations that currently requires expensive specialized equipment only
available in a few centers around the world.
