This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will determine the
feasibility of a process for producing pure hydrogen and electricity at low cost
from the oxidation of organic wastes. This program will measure oxidation and
eduction properties of the chemistry, efficiencies of oxidation for model
organic materials, and effects of other species. This should result in the
identification of an effective chemistry and establishment of the technical and
economic feasibility of the proposed process. Commercial application of the
process will result in lower pure hydrogen costs, increased energy efficiency,
lower fossil fuel use, pollution prevention, reduced greenhouse gas emissions,
and a safer environment.
