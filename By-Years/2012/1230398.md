This is a fellowship project to carry out a statistical study, case studies, and
simulations of electromagnetic energy transfer via ULF waves that will place
important constraints on the amount of energy that can be transported via ULF
waves globally and in different frequency bands. In situ estimates of the energy
transfer will be made using electric and magnetic field measurements from the
Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions During Substorms (THEMIS)
five satellite constellation. the results will be interpreted in terms of
magnetospheric energy transfer modes using case studies and magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) simulations. The work will be conducted at the University of Michigan in
the Atmospheric, Oceanic, and Space Sciences (AOSS) Department under the
mentorship of Professor Mark Moldwin.

The project will have broader impacts as it includes a commitment from the team
to disseminate their research to a broad audience at local K-12 schools and
outreach events as well as develop new outreach materials that communicate the
importance of energy transfer via ULF waves. In addition, Some ULF wave modes
can interact with radiation belt electrons, creating energetic particles that
pose a threat to satellites. The study of energy transfer via ULF waves,
therefore, may have important societal impacts in helping to improve space
weather radiation belt modeling.
