Two coordination workshops, and supporting organizational meetings, are proposed
for United States federal agencies that have programs currently funding research
into scientific virtual organizations. These efforts support an emerging
"Science of Team Science" that seeks to understand the sociotechnical
infrastructure required for successful distributed eScience practice. Partnering
with the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD)
Program, these proposed workshops will bring together agency leaders, program
officers, and staff from organizations as diverse as NIH, NSF, NIST, NASA, DOE,
DARPA, and DHS for dialogue about their needs, visions, and funding plans for
Science of Team Science research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first workshop,
tentatively scheduled for Winter 2012, will be a planning and coordination
session among key Washington, D.C.-based agency stakeholders. A second
integration workshop, targeted for Spring/Summer 2013, will be a broader, more
inclusive event incorporating staff from all relevant agencies and national
labs. These workshops will be supported by a series of organizing meetings and
will result in a draft NITRD/NSF report.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Distributed
eScience is the rapidly realizing future for almost all scientific inquiry. The
goals of this project are to better understand the public policy underlying this
transformation and to enable the super additive effects of coordinating funding
efforts across multiple agencies. The promise of developing a clear, unified
agenda is a more rapid maturation of both scientific methods and policies in
support of eScience.
