Assumptions about learning styles and cognitive abilities inform the nation's
STEM educational curricula and standards. The proposal is aimed at addressing
fundamental unanswered questions about the construct, including the neural
correlates of individual differences in visual, verbal, and spatial cognitive
styles. The PI will examine whether cognitive styles reflect learning and
reasoning strategies rather than abilities, which has important implications for
the way in which individuals? needs are met in classrooms and other learning
environments. Through a series of experiments, the PI will study the behavioral
and neural correlates of cognitive styles as well as its effects on memory and
attention. These experiments will address such specific questions as: Do
cognitive styles represent orthogonal dimensions rather than opposing ends of a
spectrum? What neural mechanisms underlie these styles? Does general fluid
intelligence relate to an ability to switch flexibly between styles as dictated
by task context? Will those who have a propensity towards a particular cognitive
style show better memory retention for information presented in their preferred
modality? Is successful encoding correlated with activity in predicted brain
regions? At the time of encoding, does one tend to convert information presented
in a non-preferred modality into a preferred modality? The project will
culminate in series of experimental interventions design to study the
effectiveness of training participants to adopt a new cognitive style and apply
it to an untrained task. The promise of this project is that it will help
synthesize and make more coherent current theories and findings on cognitive and
learning styles and, supported by solid scientific methodology, lay the
foundation for improved pedagogical techniques.
