EAGER: Geological and Paleontological Exploration of the Southern
Weyto&lt;br/&gt;Basin, Ethiopia -- A Potential Dataset for Climate Change
Impacts on a Plio-&lt;br/&gt;Pleistocene Mammalian
Fauna&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;David DeGusta&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0937501, Stanford
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;The southern portion of
Ethiopia's Weyto Basin (aka Chew Bahir Basin) appears to contain substantial
sedimentary deposits with potentially significant mammalian faunas. This
characterization is based on geological maps, remote sensing data, and very
brief ground survey. PI plans to systematically survey southern Weyto to
determine its geological and paleontological attributes. If the preliminary
indicators are accurate, this area may provide deposits useful for testing
multiple important hypotheses in paleobiology and geology. Funding is requested
here for a one month geological and paleontological survey of the southern Weyto
basin to evaluate the potential of these deposits for testing three main sets of
hypotheses: the relationship between climate change and mammalian evolution, the
biogeographic divergence of the Afar and Omo-Turkana Basin faunas, and the
relationship between rifting, uplift, and aridification in East Africa.
