Investigators observe effects wave-driven fluctuations on composition and
thermodynamics of the polar middle atmosphere and the lower thermosphere, which
may reflect effects of tidal, planetary or gravity waves. They differentiate
gravity-wave driven disturbances from those due to tides and planetary waves by
periodicity and persistence of observed wave-like modulations of upper
atmospheric quantities. However, they are conducting coordinated measurements
from four polar stations located at different longitudes, since they cannot
differentiate migrating tides from non-migrating tides at a single polar
station. In investigating MLT disturbances, they are coordinating these polar
sites airglow observations and detailed model calculations of tidal and
planetary wave effects on airglow brightness and temperature. Supplementary data
is collected from radars and lidars, integrated with airglow measurements
whenever the former two are available, providing the vertical structure of
different wave modes. This research lays groundwork for future support of TIMED
missions.
