Dust and molecular gas play a strong role in the lives of galaxies, affecting
star formation over cosmic time. At the same time, as the galaxies age, the
properties of the molecular gas and dust change in response to the history of
star formation within them. This project will simulate the formation, growth,
and destruction of dust and gas in large cosmological simulations of the growth
of galaxies. The simulations will be used to determine how observations and
detection of gas and dust can be used to learn about the histories of
galaxies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will used cosmological hydrodynamic
galaxy evolution simulations to learn about the origin and evolution of the dust
mass function in the redshift range z ~ 2-6. These simulations will incorporate
a new self-consistent model of the formation, growth, and destruction of dust.
These models will also include detailed chemistry, thermal physics, and
radiative transfer that dictates the microphysics of molecular cloud evolution.
The gas and dust models will also be included in the "grackle" code environment
that can be used by many of the most common galaxy formation codes in
use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
