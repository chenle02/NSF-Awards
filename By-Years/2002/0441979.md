This landscape sculptor will observe Antarctic land ice forms, often with NSF-
funded glaciologists, to continue his work of creating indoor sculptures and
large outdoor interpretive ice sculptures using stainless steel, aluminum, Cor-
Ten (weathering steel), and bronze. The completed pieces will be displayed at
galleries and in other venues in the United States and explicated, among other
places, on the artist's web site at http://art-farm.net. The sculptures will be
created in the United States upon return. In the field, the artist will sketch,
draw, paint if possible, keep journals, photograph, converse, and open his mind
to the unexpected.
