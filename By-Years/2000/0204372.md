ABSTRACT 0204372 Michael Gleicher U of Wisconsin-Madison

As the dangers of our world become more apparent, and our desire to prepare for
them increases, there is a growing need for virtual experiences: simulated
environments that convey to a participant the sense that they are in a
situation, not just a place. A virtual experience can provide an opportunity to
explore a situation that is too dangerous to rehearse, too impractical to
create, or too inconvenient to attend. They may be used for training, for
example to give first hand experience to emergency response personnel in
directing panicked crowds; for design, for example to determine how people
interact with a space before it is constructed; or for entertainment. The key to
a virtual experience is that they combine environment and situation. Simply
creating a visually compelling virtual environment is insufficient. Our vision
is to use compelling virtual experiences in training, research and
entertainment. To be effec- tive in these applications, virtual environments
must be authored to meet specific pedagogical and commu- nicative goals.
Realizing this vision, therefore, requires technologies for both simulating and
rendering the worlds and enabling an author to specify behavior effectively.
