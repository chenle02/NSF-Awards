Benedictine University faculty and student researchers will use the
spectrofluorometer/microscope system to initiate projects that involve the
detection of rapid changes in the fluorescence state of molecules in response to
their chemical environments. This work allows researchers to investigate
contemporary issues in the fields of physiology, molecular biology, and
biochemistry by using high-tech instrumentation to acquire real-time measures of
cell physiology and signaling without damaging the cells. Undergraduates,
including those from underrepresented backgrounds, have the opportunity to
participate in research and gain a solid foundation for careers or graduate
school. This work also supports an internship program involving both pre-service
and K-8 in-service teachers, enabling them to learn first-hand the excitement of
investigation and achievement in science that they then bring to the next
generation of students.

Researchers in the biology and chemistry departments at Benedictine University
will use the spectrofluorescence system to advance their scientific research
programs in four biochemistry projects: (1) Regulation of paracellular
permeability and ion transport in epithelial cells; (2) Anti-estrogenic effects
of metals in osteoclasts; (3) Structure/function properties of G-protein
signaling; (4) Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-monitored phage
display system for the targeting of signal proteins. By promoting
interdisciplinary work at Benedictine, these projects together improve the
competencies of students by providing access to classical and state-of-the-art
techniques in cellular biology and chemistry, such as in the capstone
biochemistry and molecular biology cell laboratory. Students gain first-hand
experiences and opportunities to conduct original science, with extensive
planning, data analysis and reporting, that can potentially lead to new
discoveries. The projects contribute to the integration of science processes and
quantitative reasoning with Benedictine's curriculum.
