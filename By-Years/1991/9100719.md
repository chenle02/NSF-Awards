This grant to a University of Washington faculty member will support an
extension of measurements of the neutron electric dipole moment using cold
neutron beams at the Institut von Laue-Langevan High Flux Reactor. The
measurement is of fundamental importance in establishing limits to parity and
time reversal symmetry violation. In addition, measurements will be undertaken
to study the parity violating interaction of neutrons with helium nuclei by
measuring the parity nonconserving neutron spin rotation in a liquid helium
target.
