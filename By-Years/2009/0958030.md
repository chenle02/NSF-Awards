This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to
University of Colorado Boulder is to provide partial support for the attendance
of graduate students, postdocs and young faculty members at a symposium on
?Engineering Biomaterials for Regenerative Medicine?. This symposium will be
held as part of the Materials Research Society Fall Meeting in Boston,
Massachusetts from November 30 to December 4, 2009. Scientific themes of the
conference include: a) bio-inspired scaffold design, synthesis and modification;
2) interactions between stem cell and materials; 3) nanotechnology including
nanoparticles and fibers; and (5) development of new technology for biomedical
applications and microfabricated devises. The&lt;br/&gt;objectives of the
proposed conference are: a) to highlight recent advances in the design,
synthesis and application of materials for fundamental understanding of cell
biology and practical applications in tissue engineering; b) to provide a
platform for material scientists, bioengineers, and biologists from academia and
industry to establish connections, collaborations and exchange of ideas; and c)
to facilitate opportunities for women, minority and junior faculty, postdoctoral
fellows, and graduate students to present their research results, and establish
collaborations and interactions for future
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact of the conference is to bring
together students, junior scientists and leading researchers from USA and abroad
to present their recent research. The conference is expected to advance the
knowledge base for design and development of new materials and technologies in
the field of tissue engineering. In addition, this conference is expected to
create interactions and collaborations among current and future researchers from
academia and industry in this field. &lt;br/&gt;
