Superior shape and surface quality have a visible impact on new product design
and industrial competitiveness. Decreasing the need for human, heuristic
intervention when modeling surfaces is a precondition for accurate engineering
simulation and high-quality geometry processing and it reduces effort, time,
cost and variability. Characterizing and creating surfaces that withstand
scrutiny in the detail is a fundamental unresolved challenge to applied
differential geometry and geometric design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
will characterize high-quality surfaces and develop tools for their creation.
The effort centers on surfacing schemes that are computationally efficient,
finite and affine invariant, and generate fair, curvature-continuous, parametric
surfaces that are representable in a standard rational or polynomial form. The
starting hypothesis is that a blend between multiple primary surfaces is good if
it does not create curvature features that were not present in the defining
data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will analyze why the existing techniques
fail to generate satisfactory curvature distributions, develop a practical
notion of surface quality, repair existing techniques or declare why they are
fundamentally flawed and develop new approaches to be tested against a carefully
chosen obstacle course of joins of multiple primary
surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
