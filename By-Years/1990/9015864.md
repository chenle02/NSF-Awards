This research is a collaborative effort between an experimental NMR research
group and a theoretical chemistry research group to investigate the dynamics of
glassy polymers. The experimental group will combine existing techniques of
modern solids NMR with new experiments (rotational-echo, double-resonance C-13--
F-19 NMR and rotational-echo dephasing H-1 NMR) to investigate the dynamics of
180o flips of the main-chain phenyl rings in polycarbonates and polycarbonate-
like plastics. These systems will be investigated under a variety of physical
conditions including high external hydrostatic pressure. Chains will be examined
in bulk and at polymer-polymer interfaces. Phenyl ring flips are of interest
because they monitor the slow density fluctuations of the solid, which are
related to physical properties such as toughness. To understand these density
fluctuations in detail, a parallel set of computational experiments using a
Generalized Langevin Dynamics simulation technique will be undertaken. This
method of computer simulation has been specifically developed to allow the
simulation of slow motions in a glassy solid.
