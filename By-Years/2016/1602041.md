The objective of CanSec (formerly Greater Kansas Area Security Workshop or
KanSec) is to provide a regular forum for researchers and students across
several Midwestern states (Kansas, Missouri, Colorado, Iowa, Arkansas, Oklahoma,
Nebraska, Texas, and Indiana) to present research and educational activities,
and to promote interactions and collaborations. The workshop was initiated by
three NSA/DHS National Centers of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance
Education (CAE/IAE) and IA Research (CAE/R) in the State of Kansas: the
University of Kansas, the Kansas State University, and the Fort Hays State
University. In 2013 and 2014, they met as KanSec; in 2015, they have renamed the
conference CanSec, and broadened the scope to other Midwestern states.

This grant provides support of students to attend CanSec, where they can
interact with peers and faculty from across the region.
