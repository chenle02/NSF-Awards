The project supports 5 scholarships to enable attendance by students and junior
faculty of the diversity workshop organized by the PI along with the upcoming
SoSP conference. The workshop will be held on Nov 3 in Farmington, PA. The goal
of the workshop is to strengthen the pipeline of systems students, providing
them with advice and networking opportunities that they might not otherwise
receive.
