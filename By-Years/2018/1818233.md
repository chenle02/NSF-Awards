This proposal is for support of a travel IEEE (Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers) PerCom 2014 to be held in Athens, Greece, March 19 - 23,
2018. The purpose of this trip is to support approximately 15 - 20 students in
the field of Pervasive Computing and Communications. PerCom 2018 will provide a
leading edge scholarly forum for researchers, engineers, and students alike to
share their state-of-the art research and developmental work in the broad areas
of pervasive computing and communications.

This conference will provide the students with the opportunity to attend
presentations of cutting-edge research results representing the state-of-the-art
in pervasive computing, systems and applications. The attendees are offered a
diversity of interactive forums, technical sessions, targeted workshops,
interesting poster sessions, and exciting demonstrations. Students will have the
opportunity to interact with the world's leading researchers in pervasive
computing.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
