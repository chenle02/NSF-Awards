This publication subsidy will partially offset the anticipated cost (and loss)
of publishing the first taxonomic volume of the Flora of the Venezuelan Guayana.
The Flora, planned to comprise 9 volumes, has 170 contributors, and treats 9300
species, of which more than half will be illustrated with line drawing. Research
for the Flora was supported by two NSF research awards. Missouri Botanical
Garden, the PI institution, will provide 50 copies to Latin American
institutions that would otherwise not be able to purchase the volume. The
Venezuelan government will 50 copies to distribute to botanical institutions and
government agencies. This 650 page volume is the beginning of a major flora of
Venezuela which will enhance our understanding of Latin American floral
diversity and have a significant impact on research and education in Latin
American botanical disciplines.
