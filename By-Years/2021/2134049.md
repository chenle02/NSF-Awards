The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve
prediction of vehicle tire failure and enable systems for vehicle preventative
maintenance. The proposed technology may be used to power smart vehicle tire
sensors that will give alerts for tire maintenance and replacement. This
technology will improve the functionality of the current tire pressure
monitoring systems and improve the safety of automobile travel. Each year in the
U.S. there are tens of thousands of motor vehicle crashes due to tire failures.
Tire failure is also responsible for a significant portion of roadside
emergencies which also cause financial loss, time delay, and safety concerns.
The proposed technology may help address these problems and enable improved tire
failure prediction which is not possible in conventional tire pressure
monitoring systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project develops a
flexible nanowire-based piezoelectric energy harvester that can effectively
convert the mechanical vibration or strain of a vehicle tire into electric
power. The system can retain the piezo-electric properties even at the high
operating temperatures experienced by the tire. As a result, the batteryless
energizer can be used to power evolving families of smart tire sensors that can
monitor various vehicle and road conditions. By functioning as a stable energy
source with improved power budget compared to many battery-based solutions, the
proposed energy harvesting platform may provide more flexibility and support
advanced tire sensing features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
