With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Porter of Duke
University will explore the mechanisms of reactions involving organic free
radicals. These rather transitory intermediates are having increasing impact on
both the organic and the chemical community at large. More specifically, free
radical induced polymerization of monomers is a major commercial pathway to
useful products. Moreover, control of the chirality of these polymerization
reactions at the evolving stereogenic centers represents a very significant
advance. This proposal addresses these issues very creatively. Discovering means
to control organic reactions so as to produce desirable and useful products in a
significant goal to have major impact. This grant outlines an investigation
which, if successful, will discover new ways of controlling the reaction of free
radical polymerization monomeric subunits. Since these subunits are natural
resources, this work prescribes a methodology whereby a significant improvement
can be made in their use. This means an increase in the efficiency and a major
saving of resources.
