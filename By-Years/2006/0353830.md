This award provides support for an REU Site at Worcester Polytechnic Institute
for three years. Eight students per year will be recruited from throughout the
U.S. for an eight-week summer experience in research related to environmental
and transportation engineering. The program will serve to encourage
undergraduates to pursue advanced degrees in engineering and thus impact the
nations need to increase the number of U.S. citizens and permanent residents
engaged in research-related careers. It is also anticipated that this REU Site
will have a Broader Impact on the nations need to have broader participation in
the research enterprise of citizens and permanent residents from demographic
groups traditionally underrepresented in science and engineering.
