This award supports the purchase of an Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer, an
Autoanalyzer, and related peripheral equipment for the stable isotope laboratory
at Boston University. The laboratory provides service for a significant number
of researchers at the University and at other institutions in the area who use
stable isotope analysis to answer questions in ecosystem ecology, animal
physiology, marine food web dynamics, coastal biogeochemistry, and paleo-
oceanography. Besides increasing basic knowledge in these areas, the data to be
obtained will contribute to the management of highly eutrophied coastal areas
and to pest control practices in agriculture.
