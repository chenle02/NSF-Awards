This research focuses on enhancing the understanding of molecular intense-field
photodynamics by carrying out photoionization experiments using an ion mass
spectrometer that clips out a tiny, micron-sized, three-dimensional volume from
a laser focus and enables detection of ions created only inside this volume.
Because the number of molecules in this confined volume is fixed, and the
intensity inside it constant, the measured ion signal is a true measure of the
photoionization probability for one single intensity. The broader impact
involves education of students and outreach to the community via a monthly
science column with student progress on projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
