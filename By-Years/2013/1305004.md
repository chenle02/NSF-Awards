The project aims to expand on the investigator's study of compactifications of
moduli spaces of maps from curves to a large class of GIT quotient targets.
These compactifications, called moduli spaces of stable quasimaps, produce new
curve-counting invariants, which are expected to be related by wall-crossing
formulas with Gromov-Witten invariants. In recent work with Kim, the PI has
found such wall-crossing formulas in genus zero and they turn out to give a
significant generalization of Givental's toric mirror theorems. The PI will work
to extend the theory in several directions. First, the wall-crossing formulas
should extend to curves of higher genus, and the resulting theory for Calabi-Yau
three-folds is conjecturally equal to the BCOV B-model theory of the mirror
Calabi-Yau, but WITHOUT changing coordinates by the mirror map. The PI plans to
prove this conjecture at least for local Calabi-Yau targets. Other projects will
provide extensions to orbifold targets (with applications to the Crepant
Resolution Conjecture), and to Landau-Ginzburg models (with applications to the
Calabi-Yau/LG correspondence). Further applications, such as a proof of the
general Abelian/Non-abelian Correspondence in Gromov-Witten theory are also
expected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is in the field of algebraic
geometry, an old and highly developed branch of mathematics, which at its core
is the study of geometric shapes defined by polynomial equations. Moduli theory
is concerned with how these shapes deform. The moduli spaces studied by the
investigator have deep connections with the mirror symmetry phenomenon
discovered in string theory, a very active area of theoretical physics. In the
last two decades, the results and techniques from algebraic geometry, especially
the theory of moduli spaces, have been successfully employed in string theory.
On the other hand, ideas from string theory have opened up new directions of
research in mathematics by suggesting striking conjectures and at the same time
putting old unsolved problems into a new light. The project will continue this
fruitful interaction by offering new insights on mirror symmetry at higher
genus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by the Algebra and Number
Theory and the Topology programs.
