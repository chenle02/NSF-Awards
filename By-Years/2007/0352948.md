0352948&lt;br/&gt;Sen&lt;br/&gt;This award will enable US PI Gautam Sen, Florida
International University to collaborate with Arijit Ray and Dalim K. Paul of
Presidency College in studying the earliest phase of Deccan Trap activity. One
of the most spectacular episodes of volcanism ever to have occurred took place
on the Indian subcontinent. The Deccan Trap activity, the eruption of about 3
million cubic kilometers of basalt lave, started in the northwestern Kutch area
and progressed to southwestern India near Mumbai. The researchers will document
the beginning of this activity using a combined field, petrologic, and
geochemical study of the lavas, intrusives, and the deep-seated mantle rock
fragments (xenoliths) from Kutch. The petrologic and geochemical portion of the
study will involve electron microprobe analysis of the minerals and some Sr-
isotope analysis of the plagioclase phenocrysts using a mass spectrometer. The
Division of Earth Sciences, Petrology and Geochemistry Program is jointly
funding this research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
