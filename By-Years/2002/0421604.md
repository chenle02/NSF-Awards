This project aims to exploit for gene discovery purposes the mechanisms by which
nature has tinkered with the genomes of biodiverse plant species to enable the
evolution of important economic traits, such as seeds. This approach involves a
unique collaboration of scientists with diverse areas of expertise in species
evolution, genomics and bioinformatics located at sister institutions in New
York: New York University, The New York Botanical Garden, The American Museum of
Natural History, and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
approach involves the identification of key plant species in which a trait first
evolved and the subsequent sequencing of large portions of the coding regions of
these genomes. The next step is to develop and use bioinformatics tools that
enable the comparison of large numbers of genes conserved across a set of
species which have the trait compared to each other and to their closest related
species who do not have the trait. This approach enables the identification of
genes and gene characters whose DNA history correlates with the evolution of the
species containing the trait. The candidate genes are then tested for their role
in determining the trait using comparative studies of gene expression in the
biodiverse species, and by mutant analysis in model species such as Arabidopsis.
The working example of this approach is to identify the sets of genes that
enabled the evolution of seeds, an important evolutionary innovation in plants
with important implications for agriculture. This involves the sequencing of
portions of the genomes of the most primitive living seed plants, the non-
flowering Gymnosperms, on earth since the Mesozoic era. This research transcends
and unites genomics and systematics to produce a deeper understanding of seed
evolution, while revealing genes involved in important agronomic traits involved
in seed development. The findings will have implications for improving seed
quality, as much of today's agriculture - from food to textiles- depends on seed
products. This project also has systematicists and genomicists working together
to train a new class of biologists with interdisciplinary expertise in these two
complementary areas. Finally, the approaches and bioinformatics tools developed
in this project will be applicable to comparative functional genomic studies in
any species, plant or animal. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
