This project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
is in the area of host-guest chemistry. The project is directed toward an
understanding of the interaction of flexible hosts with a variety of guest
molecules. For the hosts, focus will be on liquid clathrates and calixarenes.
Fundamental understanding of the ability of guests to organize hosts will be
investigated. A comparison of the polarity of the cavity and that of the solvent
will be sought for a range of systems. Heavy reliance on single crystal X-ray
diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and molecular modelling
will be necessary to characterize the structures and interactions. The
development of flexible hosts as models for clay minerals and for bioinorganic
molecules is planned. For the latter, calixarenes will be functionalized using
standard synthetic organic procedures. Aminocalixarenes will be synthesized and
their complexation of transition metal ions will be investigated. Information
derived from studies of flexible hosts will be applied to problems of separation
science. This study is expected to provide important fundamental information
about interactions between species in solutions and about the kinds of
interactions which are involved in the recognition of substrates by enzymes. The
study may also lead to new methodology for the separation of mixtures of
chemicals.
