Target Science is a project designed to develop a replicable model for
revitalizing the teaching of K-12 science in highly impacted urban schools. The
goals of Target Science are to (1) provide replicable methods for science
teachers and their private sector, university, and community partners to
collaboratively identify needs for improving instructional delivery, and then
develop strategies that will successfully respond to these needs, and (2)
provide replicable methods to channel science-rich community resources to
science teachers in a manner that will facilitate and stimulate positive and
enduring change in the delivery of K-12 science instruction. Target Science is
designed to meet these goals by creating a model that (1) builds an environment
to nurture and stimulate change (K-12 Service Dialogues, Science Forums, and
Family Science Workshops), (2) establishes methods for improving science teacher
knowledge bases and instructional delivery techniques (Mini-grants, Science
Center Grants, Professional Development Grants, K-12 Science Workshops and
IISME) and (3) enhances communications in general and information exchange in
particular (TELEventure). Cost sharing by the partners will total 738% of the
NSF funding.
