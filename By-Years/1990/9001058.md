This award provides continued NSF support for the Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) program in Evolutionary Biology at the American Museum of
Natural Hi story. Drawing on the research and teaching expertise of the Museum's
scientific staff, the program revolves around projects carefully designed to
introduce undergraduate level students to the excitement and challenge of
original research in Evolutionary Biology. Included in the program structure is
a series of weekly meetings at which students will discuss their research,
present informal progress reports, and take part in discussions and seminars on
graduate and research career opportunities. A special lecture series, in which
eminent evolutionary biologists will be invited to address the REU students has
been planned to supplement their roundtable discussion series. At the end of the
program, students will participate in a seminar where they will give a formal
presentation of their work. Students will be encouraged to continue regular
contact with their Project Supervisors and prepare their research results in the
form of joint authored papers for submission to professional journals. The AMNH
will institute a follow-up program for REU participants aimed at encouraging
them in careers in science.
