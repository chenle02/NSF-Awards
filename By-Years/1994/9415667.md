9415667 Dickey The University of Southern California will undertake a project to
facilitate development, testing, and calibration of new and existing sensors and
systems for ocean science research on a testbed mooring near Bermuda. The goal
of this project is to test various sensors for long-term deployments as part of
the Bermuda Atlantic Time-Series (BATS), JGOFS, and GLOBEC global change
research projects. The project will make use of an existing mooring, Altomoor
II, that is sponsored by the Office of Naval Research. The testbed mooring will
serve two important functions: 1) to provide a platform for developing and
testing emerging interdisciplinary sensors and systems and 2) to provide high
frequency, long-term interdisciplinary data to sample variables relevant to
upper ocean physics, optics, biology, biogeochemistry, and carbon fluxes at a
site regularly sampled using ships and sediment traps. The project will
initially focus on optical and acoustic instrumentation and will foster a
stronger working relationship between instrument developers and ocean
scientists.
