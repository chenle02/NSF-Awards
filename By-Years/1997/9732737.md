Abstract 9732737 Greene This award to San Jose State University Foundation will
provide instrumentation for Oceanographic Research for use on R/V Point Sur, a
research vessel operated by Moss Landing Marine Labs as part of the University-
National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. Specific instruments to
be acquired include a computer and computer components, a deionized water
filtration system for scientific use, a portable liquid scintillation counter,
and a bottom finding pinger. The shared-use instrumentation supported here will
assist marine scientists in conducting studies from R/V Point Sur in the eastern
Pacific Ocean, in 1998 and in future years.
