Project Summary Samson/ATM-9410716 The purpose of this research is to
investigate the interaction of solar radiation with a planetary atmosphere and
to provide absolute cross sections for each of the specific interaction
processes as a function of wavelength. The results of solar radiation incident
upon a planet's atmosphere depend critically on the wavelength of solar
radiation: while Rayleigh scattering of the visible light causes a blue sky,
more energetic radiation can cause dissociation, ionization, and dissociative
ionization of the atmospheric molecules. Modified components of a planetary
atmosphere may react with the ambient species to form a new source of molecules
in the atmosphere, while the results of ionization produce the atmosphere.
