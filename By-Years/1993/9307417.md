9307417 Skorin-Kapov The main objective of the research is to increase the
solvability of nonlinear integer programming problems. The primary direction of
research is the development, enhancement and efficient implementation of
heuristic search approaches for some NP-hard combinatorial optimization
problems. Specifically, ideas and methods from artificial intelligence, such as
informed best-first strategies and AND/OR graphs, will be utilized within the
framework of integer programming algorithms. Special emphasis will be given to a
design of parallel algorithms. The work on heuristic methods will include a
design of improved criteria for measuring the quality of the heuristic solution.
In this context the impact of changes in the initial data on the heuristic
solution will be investigated. Increasing the solvability of nonlinear inter
programming problems and placing them in a dynamic environment by studying the
impact of data changes on the solution, will broaden the applicability of such
mathematical models to a number of problems arising in engineering and modern
technology.
