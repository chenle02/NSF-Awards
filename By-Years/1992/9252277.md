There is general agreement that exploration of the physical world can be more
effectively taught utilizing modern computer technologies. The ability of the
computer to quickly acquire and analyze data will allow more time for the
student to focus on the concepts being taught. This project utilizes computer
data acquisition, analysis, and scientific report writing to better teach
concepts in the physics laboratory through cooperative and discovery modes of
learning.The major instruments needed to accomplish the above aim are 14
computer stations with the necessary hardware and software to perform the
functions of data acquisition, analysis and scientific report writing.A major
goal of this project is to reach out to women and Native American students and
make physics concepts more accessible to them by using cooperative and discovery
modes of learning.There is a national effort in physics teaching to teach
fundamental concepts using computers. Avoiding the emphasis on repetitious data
acquisition will make the field more applicable to the student's needs and
therefore more exciting. There is the general realization that since the
computer has become an indispensable tool for the practicing scientist, it must
also be integrated into the teaching of physics.
