The objective of this `applied algorithm` project is to continue the
establishment and study of the interrelationships between formal language theory
and the structure and behavior of the informational macromolecules. The formal
representation of recombinant behaviors exhibited by double stranded DNA in the
presence of specified sets of enzymatic activities is of crucial interest. This
project includes the continued investigation of splicing systems and the
languages they define. The fact that DNA occurs naturally in both linear and
circular forms, which interact through recombination, has motivated the
initiation of a unified theory of interacting linear and circular words. This
project includes further development of this theory with emphasis on splicing. A
treatment of languages of bi-infinite words and semi-infinite words is made,
which will initiate the integration of these theories with the theories of
languages of circular and finite words. This project directs special attention
to the sofic shifts, which are a class of languages of bi-infinite words that
play a major role in dynamical systems. This project is significant in that it
establishes and clarifies relations between formal language theory and molecular
biology. It develops an additional source of suggestive problems and imagery for
formal language theory. Also, over a time scale of decades, it is expected to
suggest questions and contribute precision to biochemical thought about
informational macromolecules and their behavior. Additionally, the project
provides new problems and approaches to the study of symbolic dynamics. This
project combines theoretical computer science, biology and dynamical systems in
a mutually stimulating and reinforcing way.
