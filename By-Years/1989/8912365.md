The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports the research group of
Professor Pratt in a continued investigation of high-resolution electronic
spectroscopy of large organic molecules. The information gained from these
investigations is leading to significant quantitative tests and dramatic
qualitative improvements in our understanding of intermolecular energy flow in
large molecules. At the studied excitation energies of 3-4 eV and the
spectroscopic resolution of a few MHz, the discrete spin-rotation-vibration
energy levels of excited electronic states are imbedded in a higher density
manifold (or even a quasi-continuum) of levels belonging to one or more lower
electronic states. Couplings between these manifolds permit rapid occurrence of
chemically interesting processes; the research attempts to extract information
about these couplings from eigenstate-resolved spectra.
