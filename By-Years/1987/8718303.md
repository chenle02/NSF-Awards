This investigation seeks to elucidate the mechanism of carbohydrate allocation
in source leaves of sugar beet subjected to water stress. Specifically, the
study will determine the effect of cellular turgor on sugar efflux across the
mesophyll plasmalemma. Under drought conditions, both osmotic adjustment and
export compete for limited assimilate supply. Based on previous work and
assuming the apoplastic sucrose loading postulate, sucrose release from
mesophyll cells appears to be a potential site of control for carbon allocation
in leaves. The role and nature of turgor effect on sugar transport across
plasmalemma of isolated mesophyll cells will be investigated in vitro in
relation to its effect on export and osmotic adjustment.%%% Plant response to
water stress has serious economic consequences. This project will provide the
basis for new fundamental information needed to identify control points,
limiting steps and possible interventions to mitigate drought conditions in
plants.***//
