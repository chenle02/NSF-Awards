Quantum computing harnesses properties of quantum states to enable computations
that would be intractable using classical computing. It is widely established
that, in the future, quantum computing can revolutionize the way one performs
and thinks about computation and serve as the backbone of groundbreaking new
technologies for scientific discovery, engineering design, national security,
and business development, to name a few. Currently, the key barrier in the
development of quantum computing is the error induced by the noise in the
hardware. The research goal of this project is to develop methods to model the
error propagation in quantum computing algorithms and filter the resulting noise
in the outcomes. This study will help enhance the performance of general quantum
computing algorithms in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The educational goals
of this effort are to prepare students for interdisciplinary research and
promote STEM participation and equity among underrepresented groups. Outreach
activities also involve K-12 students.

The investigator will develop new uncertainty quantification methods in the
following four directions to understand and alleviate the effect of noise on
quantum computing algorithms: (1) describing propagation of gate error and
readout error using epistemic uncertainty models; (2) mitigating errors using
constrained optimization methods and Bayesian approaches; (3) analyzing
asymptotic behavior of the propagation of the error; (4) developing an open-
source software package to implement the uncertainty quantification algorithms.
These new methods will leverage Bayesian inference approaches, tensor
decomposition techniques, asymptotic analysis tools for stochastic differential
equations, and high-performance computing packages to build the foundation of a
"quantum numerical analysis" framework from a probabilistic perspective. This
framework is general, and it can be used to assess the performance of real-world
quantum processors and evaluate the suitability of specific quantum computing
hardware architectures for a wide range of applications. This project is jointly
supported by the Division of Mathematical Sciences: Computational Mathematics
Program and the Division of Computing and Communication Foundations: Foundations
of Emerging Technologies Program.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
