In view of the growing evidence that passive listening is an inefficient way to
learn physics, this project is developing new hands-on learning experiences in
modern and traditional optics. Both of these closely related topics are of
increasing technological importance and can play a significant, positive role in
the training of public school teachers. In particular, this project involves two
major developments: a self-contained laboratory course in modern optics and a
concomitant design change of the traditional optics lecture and laboratory
courses, aimed at prospective teachers, which will emphasize interactive
learning and conceptual understanding. The Physics and Astronomy Department is
particularly well positioned for this project since it houses the teacher
certification program of general science majors. This project also is developing
collaborations with high school teachers, resulting in an integrated and
enhanced program in optics consisting of two theory courses, two laboratory
courses, and a facility for undergraduate research projects. The new modern
optics laboratory course includes seven regular experiments and three
undergraduate research projects emphasizing concepts, related theory,
measurements, and technological applications. The lab is being equipped with
lasers, optical components, and optical and electronic instruments. This course
provides a glimpse into the richness of laser physics beyond its visual
aesthetics. The experience gained through the lab course can prepare students
for directed undergraduate research projects and for employment in optics-
related industries. This course also exposes in-service and preservice teachers
to important concepts in modern optics and helps diffuse these concepts to
students in public schools. The significance of this course cannot be
overemphasized at a time when the optical fiber is in the information network,
optical computers are on the horizon, and electronics is giving way to
photonics.
