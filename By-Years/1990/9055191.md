The Harry S. Truman College, in collaboration with Argonne National
Laboratories and the Chicago Board of Education, will initiate a seven-week,
commuter Young Scholars project in Ecology for 60 students entering grades
10,11. The program, "Chicago as an Ecosystem," will introduce participants to an
understanding of the systems -- water, solid waste, air, parks, nature preserves
-- and their symbiosis that undergird the city, through a combination of
classroom, laboratory and field work.
