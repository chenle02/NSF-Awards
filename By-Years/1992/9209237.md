A pivotal issue in developmental neuroscience pertains to the mechanisms
regulating the choice of the correct target by a nerve cell. This issue will be
addressed by examining the embryonic assembly of a functional neural circuit in
the medicinal leech, Hirudo medicinalis. The stereotyped adult circuitry of the
leech heart excitor motor neurons that drive precisely coordinated rhythmic
contractions of the heart tubes is particularly well understood. However, this
stereotyped circuitry arises as result of initial axonal projections to several
target regions followed by a retraction of the incorrectly positioned axons. The
processes of initial outgrowth and later retraction of these axons will be
investigated using light, laser and electron microscopic visualization, as well
as intracellular electrophysiology. Parallel experiments will determine the
developmental time course of functional synaptic connectivity between central
interneurons that ultimately drive the coordinated behavior and the heart
excitor neurons. The simplicity of this system will allow exploration across
several levels of analysis, from morphology to behavior, of the developmental
interactions that occur during the assembly of a simple, but behaviorally
relevant neural circuit. It is expected that an understanding of the principles
that underlie the development of specificity in this system will pertain to more
complex systems, since the developmental strategy of initial axonal exuberant
growth followed by retraction is commonly used by embryonic neurons in higher
species as well.
