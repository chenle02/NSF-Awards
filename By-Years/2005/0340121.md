This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop thin films of nanoparticle/polymer composites for use as artificial
dielectric materials. These artificial dielectrics have the potential to have
high dielectric constants while maintaining the low temperature processing
ability, adhesion, and flexibility of polymers. The shape, size, and orientation
of nanoparticles in the polymer matrix will be controlled at the nanometer scale
in order to tune the particle's behavior as dielectric enhancers in the
insulating matrix. Nanoparticles having spherical, cubic, and wire shaped
geometry and dimensions in the range of 0.4-100 nm will be dispersed into
polymer resin and formed into thin film capacitors for testing.

The commercial applications of this project will be in improved capacitors for
the electronics industry. Such practical, high capacitance materials will enable
embedded capacitors for printed wiring board applications. In addition, high
energy density capacitors are needed for temporary backup power and pulsed power
in electrons, hybrid vehicles, and space applications.
