In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Robert Curl of Rice University will investigate the high-
resolution infrared spectra of reactive free radicals using infrared kinetic
spectroscopy. The two species of particular interest are propargylene (HCCCH)
and hydroxymethyl (CH2OH). New methods for high resolution infrared spectroscopy
using difference frequency mixing of two laser sources will also be developed
and applied. A sensitive high-speed infrared detector based on sum frequency
generation will also be developed. Several sources of laser radiation in rugged,
portable form currently exist in the visible and near infrared spectral regions.
The techniques and detectors being developed under this research program will
extend the accessible spectral wavelengths into infrared, which is important as
a `fingerprint` region where different chemicals can be uniquely identified.
Such radiation sources will be useful in many applications, from species
monitoring in refinery and petrochemical industries to monitoring of the
environment. The latter application is particularly unique because it allows
high sensitivity detection without requiring coolants and is not affected by
large amounts of environmental infrared background radiation.
