This Phase II SBIR project provides for the development and demonstration of
novel applications of an ultrahigh vacuum compatible, microwave discharge source
of chlorine and fluorine atoms. Chemically assisted etching of semiconductor
materials with halogen atoms in conjunction with photon, electron, and ion
stimulation will be investigated. The Phase I project was successful in
demonstrating that a previously developed fluorine atom source could be modified
so as to produce chlorine atoms.
