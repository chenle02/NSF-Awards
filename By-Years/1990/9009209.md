This is a Research Planning Grant to enable Dr. Budriene to initiate
independent studies in the area of bacterial colonial organization. These
studies will be based on some novel and intriguing observations she has made
regarding pattern formation in colonies of motile bacteria which are mutant in
their ability to respond chemotactically to certain nutrients. It is anticipated
that this award will help Dr. Budriene obtain the preliminary results necessary
to launch an independent research career.
