The PIs will conduct a five-year study using measurements to the Global
Positioning System (GPS) of the tectonics of the Indonesian archipelago. In the
first year they will study deformation associated with oblique plate convergence
in Sumatra. Specifically, they will examine the mechanism of decoupling of the
oblique slip into normal subduction and shear slip on faults parallel to the
convergent margin, by measuring the deformation both southwest and northeast of
the Sumatran fault zone. The long-range goal is to extend GPS measurements
across the entire Indonesian archipelago, concentrating on specific tectonic
problems such as the distribution and rates of slip associated with arc-
continent collision in the Banda arc. GPS is the only available technique that
will provide information on the rate of subduction of the Australian continental
lithosphere at the Timor trench. The PIs will begin transfer of GPS technology
to Indonesia under a cooperative arrangement between U.S. and Indonesian
scientists sponsored by the National Science Foundation, the Indonesian
government, and the World Bank.
