The investigators continue their observations of temperature and sodium density
in the mesopause region with a wind/temperature lidar. They are improving the
lidar's accuracy and robustness with a daytime and wind capability, with enough
data in three years to reveal seasonal variations of the data. In addition to
exploring climatology and trends, this long data set reveals information on
variability from climatological mean, tidal and gravity waves, heat flux,
horizontal winds, and temperature-sodium density correlation. Continually
collected, analyzed data can provide interesting results with the lidar. For
instance, plotting monthly mean temperatures at each altitude over seven years,
investigators observed a 3-4 year warming trend (peaking in 1993), believed to
be the first evidence of Pinatubo impacting the atmosphere as high as 100
kilometers.
