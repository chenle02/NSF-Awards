This award supports collaborative research between US and Chinese astronomers
who will focus on the study of supernovae and supernova remnants. The US
principal investigator (PI), Dr. Richard McCray of the University of Colorado at
Boulder and the Chinese PI, Dr. Qu Qinyne of Nanjing University, have defined a
research plan to address one ofthe great themes of astronomy: how the deaths of
stars contribute to the evolution and ecology of galaxies and the universe. The
research will incorporate both development of theoretical and numerical models
as well as comparison of current observations of supernova remnants with ancient
historical records kept by Chinese astronomers since as early as 1054 AD.
