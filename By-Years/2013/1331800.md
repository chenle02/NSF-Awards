Urban metabolism (UM) is a term that captures the essential functions of cities
and their inhabitants: flows and transformations of materials and energy, the
movement of people, commerce, the creation of capital, the maintenance and
renewal of facilities, and the generation and use of services. In order to study
UM, large amounts of heterogeneous data need to be accessed, integrated, and
analyzed. This project will investigate the feasibility of a framework for UM
that encompasses: (1) The application of appropriate metrics to UM trends to
establish whether regime shifts are indicative of greater or lesser sustainable
urban states; (2) The identification and integration of disaggregated data for
the inputs and outputs of urban systems through their life cycle stages and at
various geographic scales. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interdisciplinary team
consists of six investigators (a computer scientist, a civil engineer, an urban
planner, an environmental engineer, a medical doctor, and a public health
scientist) and of four international collaborators (three computer scientists
and one environmental engineer). Broader impacts include providing unique
opportunities to educate students in the analysis and design of sustainable
urban regions in a variety of socio-cultural contexts. Further, by revealing the
connections between physical flows and environmental, social, health, and
economic impacts, this research aims to demonstrate the critical need of an
integrated systems approach to urban planning, instead of focusing on the end-
of-pipe and post-crisis management, as the current paradigm.
