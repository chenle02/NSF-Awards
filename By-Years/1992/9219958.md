This renewal proposal will apply the Sr, Nd, Pb, and Os radiogenic tracer
systems to mantle-derived mafic and ultramafic rocks to further delimit the
character of mantle reservoirs, their location in the mantle and their mode of
origin and evolution. The P.I.s propose extensive Os isotope studies of oceanic
basalts from localities where the end-member mantle reservoirs DMM, EMI, EM 2
and HIMU are most strongly evident. Ultramafic xenoliths from EM 2 and HIMU
islands will be analyzed to compare with the associated basalts. The recognition
of a new mantle reservoir, proposed to be lower mantle, will be explored by Os
isotope tracer studies of basalts from the islands of Ascension and the Cameroon
Line. The early stages of mantle evolution (2.5 - 3.7 b.y.) will be studied by
Sr, Nd, Pb and Os studies of primary magmatic minerals from Archean mafic rocks.
An to utilize the inherent strengths of the Re/Os system in studying both early
mantle processes (accretion and core formation) and present-day processes
(derivation of plumes from ancient oceanic crust stored in the lower mantle),
the P.I.s propose to study the parameters which control the geochemical behavior
of Re and Os. This will involve both natural studies of the Re and Os
partitioning between magma and mantle minerals (silicate, sulfide, oxide and
metal), and experimental studies of Re - Os solubility and partitioning between
metal, silicate melt and sulfide liquid.
