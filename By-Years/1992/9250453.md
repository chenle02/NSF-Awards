The goal of this project is to complete the development of a two course sequence
(Semiconductor Device Physics and Introduction to Microelectronics) which
provide the foundation for semiconductor devices by adding a laboratory course
which emphasizes test and characterization. Upon completion of the present
courses, the student has an understanding of the basic physics of pn junctions,
bipolar transistors, and both junction and metal oxide semiconductor field
effect transistors. This new laboratory will provide the student with the tools
required to characterize and evaluate the performance of these devices. This
will, in turn, provide the student with the basic test skills required to work
effectively in industrial organizations developing and manufacturing
semiconductor devices and circuits. The current laboratory lacks the capacitance
voltage apparatus which is essential for the characterization of MOS based
devices, which dominate present integrated circuit technologies. With the
equipment being acquired through this project, the development of the
semiconductor device physics course sequence will be able to be completed.
