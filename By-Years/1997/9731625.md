Danchi, William AST-9731625 Dr. Danchi will carry out a program of high-angular
resolution observations of dust and gas surrounding evolved stars, with the
scientific goals of providing a detailed description of the morphology,
kinematics, and physical conditions of material in the circumstellar regions out
to 100 stellar radii away. The program will make use of the UC Berkeley Infrared
Spatial Interferometer to provide very high spatial resolution observations at 8
- 12 microns, and a non-redundant aperture masking technique in the near-
infrared on the Keck telescope. Results from these observations and their
analysis will provide information on the process of mass loss in evolved stars.
