Tropical geometry is a young and rapidly growing area in mathematics, rooted in
algebraic geometry, complex analysis, commutative algebra, and combinatorics,
with applications in computer science, biology, and statistical physics, in
addition to other areas of mathematics. The recent decade has seen tremendous
development in the subject that both established the field as an area in its own
right and unveiled its deep connections to numerous branches of pure and applied
mathematics. Moduli spaces are spaces of parameters that classify algebro-
geometric mathematical objects, such as varieties, maps between varieties, and
vector bundles. This research project aims at providing a new combinatorial
perspective on classical moduli spaces and their interplay with nonarchimedean
analytic geometry. Computational challenges in this direction are its driving
force. The primary goal is to deepen understanding of these objects and develop
new techniques to analyze such abstract spaces through concrete computations in
tropical geometry. Several topics investigated in this project witness the
interdisciplinary nature of the subject and are suitable for research in
collaboration with graduate students.

Tropical geometry provides a framework for solving algebro-geometric problems
using concrete combinatorial tools: algebraic varieties are replaced by
weighted, balanced polyhedral complexes. These objects preserve just enough data
about the original varieties to remain meaningful, while discarding much of
their complexity. Their combinatorics depends strongly on the embeddings of our
varieties. By contrast, the Berkovich space or the space of valuations is
independent of all such choices. By choosing appropriate coordinates, the
geometry and topology of these valuations are reflected in rich combinatorial
properties on the polyhedral side, including connectedness, shellability, etc.
Thus, the intricacies of the original space turn into exciting combinatorial
problems. Tropicalizations resulting from these nice embeddings are said to be
faithful. The project aims at developing certificates for local faithfulness by
means of initial (Groebner) degenerations of the variety. The notion of
faithfulness near that point then turns into desirable properties of this
degeneration. Not surprisingly, validating these properties requires a deep
understanding of the combinatorics and geometry of the initial degenerations.
Thus, the need to find effective methods for constructing or detecting
faithfulness is at the core of tropical geometry. The project will develop such
program for several important classes of examples: Grassmannians, moduli of
curves, del Pezzo surfaces, Fano schemes and cluster varieties.
