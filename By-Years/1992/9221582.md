In this research, neural network and schemalevel models of visual- motor
conditional learning in monkeys will be extended to cover a wider range of
reaching and grasping behaviors. These models will then be used as a basis for
robot learning, including such paradigms as reinforcement learning, staged
learning, focus of attention, and learning by showing. The resulting neural net
strategies will then be used to enable a robot to learn to use visual and
tactile input to grasp arbitrary objects, to construct assemblies of blocks, and
to coordinate the motion of two arms. Existing tools for neural network
simulation will be interfaced with software for robot sensing and control.
