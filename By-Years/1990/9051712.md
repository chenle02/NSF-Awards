Aim: Reinforce learning between analytical, empirical and case study methods of
architectural study. Comparison of analytical results (algorithm and/or computer
simulation) to physical testing of scale models and field measurements of
existing building. Major Instruments: Microcomputer with data acquisition
interface, data logging capability and interface to basic and spreadsheet
software. Computer output to VGA and composite video for VHS video tape
documentation. Computer will read and record environmental data from sensors
attached to scale architectural models under controlled conditions. Remote data
monitoring equipment will be used for case study measurements. Software for
computer simulation, data translation and analysis as well as instrument control
also employed. Application: Scale architectural models are suitable for
schematic design level study of daylighting, solar access, cross ventilation,
acoustical and other technical areas influenced by the architect's design
decisions.
