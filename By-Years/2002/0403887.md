The objective of this research is the synthesis and characterization
of&lt;br/&gt;novel mixed-phase materials consisting of semiconductor
nanocrystallites&lt;br/&gt;embedded within a thin film semiconductor or
insulator. The approach is&lt;br/&gt;to use a new co-deposition system to create
nanoparticles in a plasma&lt;br/&gt;chamber that are rapidly injected into a
second plasma deposition system&lt;br/&gt;where they are incorporated into a
growing thin film material.&lt;br/&gt;Separating the particle growth from the
thin film deposition enables the&lt;br/&gt;particle beam density, particle size,
and the film deposition rate to be&lt;br/&gt;independently controlled. Cross-
sectional Transmission Electron&lt;br/&gt;Microscopy measurements will provide
important information on the size&lt;br/&gt;and density of the nanocrystalline
inclusions. The bulk properties of&lt;br/&gt;the resulting films will be
characterized through measurements of the&lt;br/&gt;conductance; optical
absorption spectrum and the infra-red absorption&lt;br/&gt;spectrum providing
important information concerning the defect density&lt;br/&gt;and hydrogen
microstructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This basic research into the fabrication of
novel materials has&lt;br/&gt;considerable potential for the development of a
wide variety of devices&lt;br/&gt;incorporating nanoscale inclusions and for the
modification of optical&lt;br/&gt;properties of dielectric or polymer films.
Possible practical&lt;br/&gt;applications include improved solar cells, non-
volatile memories and&lt;br/&gt;solid-state lighting. Successful completion of
this project may lead to&lt;br/&gt;rapid commercialization of new manufacturing
processes through&lt;br/&gt;collaboration with a private company vested in
solid-state lighting,&lt;br/&gt;that has the potential to replace less efficient
fluorescent and&lt;br/&gt;incandescent lamps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
