The area of direct-contact heat transfer is one of the frontiers of research in
the thermal sciences. The application of this approach is however, severely
handicapped because of an insufficiency of basic data. This effort, when carried
out, will lead to the erection of a unique direct-contact heat exchanger
facility whose existence will enable the execution of the required basic
experiments.
