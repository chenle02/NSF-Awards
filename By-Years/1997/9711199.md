This project has the goal of understanding computational aspects of the immune
system. The project extends earlier work by emphasizing the highly distributed
memory and control structures of the immune system and integrating several
earlier models. The following approach is taken: (1) identify an immune-system
mechanism that appears to be interesting computationally, (2) write a computer
program that implements or models the mechanism, (3) study its properties
through simulation and analysis, and (4) demonstrate its capabilities, either by
applying the model to a biological question of interest or by showing how it can
be used profitably in a computer science setting. Computer security in open
environments (e.g., the Internet) is used as a motivating application and as an
on-line environment in which to test the integrated adaptive computer immune
system. Other applications include: biological modeling, vaccine design for
mutating viruses, and anomaly detection in manufacturing. Distributed and secure
computing will play a central role in almost any future networked computer
system, and this project contributes a principled approach to this topic,
particularly the problem of how to deploy active truly autonomous agents across
large networks
