This NSF award will provide partial support for U.S.-based participants to
attend the 2023 installment of the Canadian Operator Symposium (COSy), to take
place May 15-19, 2023, on the campus of the University of Western Ontario in
London, Ontario, Canada. This international conference, which is regularly
attended by U.S.-based mathematicians, will bring together leading experts from
around the world to discuss important new developments in the field and provide
opportunities for mathematicians at all career stages to present their work and
propose directions for future research. The award will provide US-based early-
career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, and researchers not
otherwise funded by NSF the opportunity to participate in the conference.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COSy was established in 1972 as a conference focused on
operator theory, operator algebras, and applications and is now the premier
annual conference in Canada devoted to these themes. This yearâ€™s program is
anchored by a lecture series on quantum information theory, and will include
10-20 fifty-minute plenary lectures, as well as approximately 30 contributed
talks by researchers spanning a variety of mathematical areas. Topics will
include several areas of active current interest in operator algebras,
emphasizing recent developments and emerging directions in the structure theory
of von Neumann algebras; subfactors and fusion categories; the classification of
amenable C*-algebras; noncommutative geometry; and connections between operator
algebras and dynamics, logic, set theory, and quantum information theory.

and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
