This is an award to provide support for a project to study bioremediation as a
process for decontamination of groundwater. The study is expected to provide
guidance for determining the effectiveness of bioremediation procedures and to
identify any further research needed to evaluate bioremediation procedures for
decontamination of soil and associated groundwater resources. This project will
be conducted by a panel of experts appointed by the Water Science Technology
Board. The panel members will be selected for their expertise relevant to
bioremediation.
