Research on the factors controlling the formation and abundance of sulfide
minerals, and associated trace metal behavior, in a variety of modern and
ancient environments has established that many trace metals are extensively
pyritized during early diagenesis. Additionally, studies have defined the
interaction of metals with the surface of pyrite and the coprecipitation of
metals with mackinawite. The primary objectives of this research are 1) to
experimentally resolve the perplexing problem of how framboidal pyrite forms and
2) to study the coprecipitation of trace metals with this phase. A variety of
techniques will be used to attack this problem that include long-term gel growth
methods, and use of both "synthetic" and natural sediments.
