9411732 Webster The award is for the purchase of a high frequency data
acquisition system to investigate in-process grinding damage assessment
techniques using acoustic emission. Preliminary results have indicated that use
of filtered signals is not adequate and that the full range of data generated by
the acoustic emission signal must be used for effective assessment. The research
enabled by the acquisition of the equipment requested will investigate
innovative methodologies to identify signatures associated with workpiece burn
and subsurface damage in conventional and creep-feed grinding of ceramics and
steels. Detection of damage due to grinding is important since it is usually the
final process to be carried out on a precision component. Greater control of
grinding damage, by improved diagnostic procedures such as those sought here, is
therefore of direct interest to all grinding-dependent industries as it would
lead to lower scrap rates and cost savings.
