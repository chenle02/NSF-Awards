*** This award, in the Small Grants for Exploratory Research mode, supports a
preliminary investigation of the question of how to dynamically allocate task
control responsibilities between a human and robot in a teleoperation setting.
The approach will involve the development of a new control scheme in which the
inputs from computer and human can be smoothly integrated, and responsibilities
for processing of sensed information and actual control of the cooperative task
can be dynamically allocated. In addition, systematic categorization of expected
subtasks along with the associated assistance strategies will allow the computer
to select system parameters under this unified architecture to suit a variety of
situations. With this concept, an attempt will be made to bridge the gap between
traditionally practiced teleoperation and desirable but impractical autonomous
robotics in an unstructured environment. If successful, this approach should
lead to a general strategy that could enable robots to relieve some of the
tiring demands on human performance in teleoperation.***
