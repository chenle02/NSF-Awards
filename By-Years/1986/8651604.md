"Fast Plant" kits will be developed around the rapid-flowering Brassica
campestris, a "new plant technology", for use in K-12 science and biology
classes. Approximately 20 hands-on exercises illustrating the basic concepts and
principles of biology and genetics will be developed through the cooperation of
teachers, scientists and curriculum experts. Inquiry and problem solving through
hypothesis testing will be an important focus of each exercise. Carefully
designed to supplement the existing curriculum, the final product will be
packaged into easy-to-use kits including seeds, watering system, teacher manuals
and student workbooks. The rapid-cycling brassicas, members of the cabbage
family, have unique properties which make them ideal classroom subject:
hardiness, petite size (eight fit into a coffee mug), rapid growth (complete
seed-to-seed cycle in 35 days) and a wide variety of genes expressed as
identifiable phenotypic characteristics. Objectives of the Instructional
Materials Development Program include the introduction of new materials and
methods into the precollege classroom. This project aptly meets Program
objectives in that it is providing an exciting opportunity for more indepth
studies in areas such as reproductive biology, genetics, physiology and ecology.
The project director, both by training and experience, is highly qualified to
conduct activities.
