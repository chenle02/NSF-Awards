9450476 The proposed research involves several projects with a common theme
focusing on cellular and molecular mechanisms of signal transduction using a
variety of cell types as experimental model systems. The first project will test
the hypothesis that physiologically relevant alterations occur in the cellular
levels of G-proteins or their subunits. The second project will investigate the
physiological functions of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors in alveolar type
two neumocytes. The third project will study the regulation and secretion of
secretion and cell surface expression of galactoside binding proteins by
cytosolic calcium fluxes.
