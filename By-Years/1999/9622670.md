CMS-9622670 The deformation of soils in the field and laboratory are commonly
observed to concentrate in shear bands formed during failure by strain
localization. While this mechanism is widely appreciated by geotechnical
engineers, it remains difficult to account for this in the numerical solutions.
This research is the analytical/computational component of a collaborative
research project which includes the University of Southern California (USC),
Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), and two French engineering institutions
- the Institute Mecanique de Grenoble (IMG) and the Ecole Centrale de Paris
(ECP). The research will build on the experimental investigations at CWRU, IMG,
and ECP to develop the analytical/computational framework for strain
localization based on finite element implementation of gradient-dependent
plasticity, and including account of the diffusion of pore water during
undrained tests. The experimental and analytical program will lead to a better
understanding of the phenomenon of bifurcation and localization, and to
analytical methods for analyzing strain localization not only in laboratory
specimens, but also in practical boundary value problems in geotechnical
engineering. ***
