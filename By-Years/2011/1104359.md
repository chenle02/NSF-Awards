In attempts to communicate to the general public, short videos are an
outstanding tool that can be used in direct presentations and also on-line on
web pages, blogs, You tube and other social networking formats. This workshop
award provides funding for the University of Delaware to organize a ?Film
Festival? workshop to be held at the American Society for Limnology and
Oceanography (ASLO) conference in February, 2011. The proposed workshop will
support the efforts of scientists who are willing to present their research in
the short video format. The workshop builds upon two separate workshops that
were held in prior years at ASLO conferences.
