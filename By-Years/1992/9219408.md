The introns of eukaryotic precursor messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs) are removed by
splicing. The long-term goal of this proposal is to understand how one factor,
the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), functions in splicing in the
yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The U1 snRNP has a critical, hierarchic role in
intron recognition. It is the first snRNP to bind to the pre-mRNA. This binding
depends not only on the 5' splice site, but also on the branchpoint region of
the intron. This suggests that these two regions of the intron are juxtaposed at
this step. This hypothesis will be tested by in vitro RNAse protection assays.
Two components of the U1 snRNP, its small nuclear RNA (snRNA) and proteins will
be studied. The function of the SNP1 protein will be investigated; its gene will
be mutated in vitro and the effects of these mutations will be assayed in vivo
and in vitro. The results of the in vitro assays will determine if, when and how
the SNP| protein functions in splicing. The U1 snRNA will be investigated with
an in vitro reconstitution assay that will be developed. Additional factors for
U1 snRNP function will be identified genetically and analyzed. These studies aim
to understand fundamental mechanisms in splice site recognition. These
mechanisms are important, for example, for the replication of several viruses,
including the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
