This proposal is designed to pursue opportunities to advance our knowledge of
the morphology, functional anatomy, and phylogeny of early mammals. These
opportunities developed as the result of the recent discovery of associated
remains of a haramiyid mammal in the upper Fleming Fjord Formation of East
Greenland. The discovery not only reveals greater diversity among early mammals
than previously known, but also demonstrates how readily the current conceptual
framework of early mammalian evolution may be reordered by new evidence. The
proposed investigation will exploit this discovery by recovering associated
skeletal remains from the deposits. The realistic prospect of recovering
additional associated mammalian skeletal material from the Fleming Fjord
Formation offers excellent potential to increase significantly our knowledge of
the early evolution of Mammalia.
