9729713 Stott This ESH award will support the collection and initial analysis of
long piston cores from the Indonesian region. Sites of very high accumulation
rates will be cored, in order to provide sample intervals at decaded to century
scale through the last 60,000 years. The stable isotopic composition of planktic
and benthic foraminifera will be measured in conjunction with alkenone chemistry
of marine organic matter to reconstruct sea surface temperatures. These data
will be used to assess the stability of tropical sea surface temperatures under
varying global climates. Research will be conducted as part of the IGPB-PAGES
IMAGES program.
