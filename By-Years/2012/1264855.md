The role of surface heterogeneity can play a major role in particle adhesion to
surfaces, even when both particle and surface are uniformly charged with the
same sign of charge--which should make both surfaces strongly repulsive. The PI
has previously demonstrated the magnitude of heterogeneity effect by using
heterogeneous collecting surfaces to capture ?homogenous? particles with great
specificity and efficiency. This proposal turns its focus on the dynamic
consequences of heterogeneity (heterogeneity-driven fluctuations of flowing
particles), when heterogeneity resides on the flowing particle rather than the
collector. The proposed work will contribute to a broadening of sensing and
separations technologies beyond reliance on the bio-molecular recognition
paradigm to enable creation of separations and sensing systems that can
withstand a broad range of operating conditions. The PI will demonstrate how the
fundamental understanding derived from their studies can be translated to 3
specific applications: heterogeneous drug carriers in blood, on-line bacterial
sensing, and a non-immuno-based whole-cell cancer diagnostic.
