9604264 Buchanan The overall goal of this project is to enhance our
understanding of seed germination with particular reference to cereals. In both
wheat and barley, a ubiquitous regulatory protein, thioredoxin, appears to play
an important role in triggering mobilization of carbon and nitrogen during early
stages of germination. Current evidence indicates that thioredoxin exerts its
effect in three ways: (1) by reducing major storage proteins thereby increasing
their susceptibility to proteases; (2) by activating a protease, thiocalsin,
that is specific for the storage proteins themselves reduced by thioredoxin; and
(3) by reducing and thereby inactivating disulfide proteins that inhibit
individual enzymes which affect carbohydrate breakdown. The goals of the present
study are to complete our projects on (1) the protein found in our earlier NSF-
supported research to inhibit pullulanase, an enzyme responsible for breaking
down starch during germination, and (2) protein redox changes occurring during
development of wheat.
