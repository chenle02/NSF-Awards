9761265 Beetz This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to
develop a pixel-size PhotoMultiplier Tube (PMT) on Silicon, based on a novel
process technique relying upon photoassisted electrochemical anodisation and
chemical etching. Commercial applications include: (1) High grain fiber-optic
receivers; (2) Planar arrays of very high speed pixel detectors for machine
vision, line scanners, streak cameras and robotic vision systems; and (3)
Medical, process control and diagnostic instruments. The quantum-efficiency-gain
bandwidth product will exceed any known pixel detector capable of ship-scale
electro-optic integration, and the system cost in the applications arenas will
decrease substantially.
