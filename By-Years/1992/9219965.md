The proposed project concerns the collection, description and study of
microscopic plant remains and acritarchs from Silurian age rocks in northeastern
North America. The principal section to be sampled will be the Arisaig Group in
Nova Scotia, an extremely well-studied shallow marine deposit which spans the
entire Silurian Period. Spores and other plant fragments occur as organic
components of these near-shore marine deposits, and, because organic-walled
phytoplankton (acritarchs) are mixed in with land plant remains, it will be
possible to compare the North American assemblages directly with their
counterparts from the type sections in the Welsh Borderlands and the Prague
Basin. Since palynomorphs represent the remains of primary producers in both the
terrestrial and marine realm, the reconstruction of palynomorph assemblages
should serve as an index of the basal trophic resource for benthic marine
communities. PI will compare palynomorph diversity and assemblage dynamics at
both micro-and macro-scales with previously documented paleoecological and
benthic community reconstructions for the Arisaig section. PI will also test for
correlations between benthic invertebrate community assemblages and
syndepositional phytoplankton assemblages. The documentation of the non-marine
component of the Arisaig Group will represent the first attempt to study the
primordial adaptive radiation of the land plants from a single continuous
Silurian section. By establishing a stratigraphic record of fossil plant
remains, the information generated from this project will be critical to the
serious study of the origin and early evolution of the terrestrial plant
kingdom.
