Thornton&lt;br/&gt;0136882&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data from the RIPEX program will
be extensively analyzed and archived. Various hypotheses concerning rip current
strength and unsteadiness, as well as the instability of the nearshore shear
current, will be tested using these data and a calibrated version of the Delft3D
model. ARGUS systems will be used to monitor two sites within Monterey Bay while
offshore waves are monitored with wave rider buoys. Knowing the changes in
morphology and incoming wave spectra over a two year period, the PIs will test
the hypothesis that rip spacing is dependent upon the bandwidth of the forcing
spectrum. Delft3D will also be used to model the beach evolution. &lt;br/&gt;
