The American steel industry is going through a critical period in which
production and profitability have greatly declined. For the U.S. to be
internationally competitive, it must develop new technologies which are less
capital and labor intensive and more effective in the use of available
resources. The National Science Foundation as a supporter of basic research can
provide the incentive to investigate the fundamental principles of high risk,
high pay-off concepts. In addition, the Foundation is a viable source for
training of highly skilled personnel - a prerequisite for technological
innovations. The purpose of this one day workshop is to bring together the
research leaders of the steel industry and selected faculty members for a
thorough evaluation of current state of research and limitations of present
technology. The workshop will define the long term research and educational
needs of the industry. A report will be produced describing the research
opportunities and a list of recommendations. The principal investigator has 36
years of research experience in the iron and steel industry. The guarantee
organization is a small business.
