This award will support a special year in commutative algebra, representation
theory, and combinatorics. The special year will be held at Brandeis University,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Northeastern University during the
1990-91 academic year. Significant research has been done on the problem of
determinantal ideals by mathematicians in the three areas of the special year.
The purpose of this special year is to bring together researchers in the three
areas who are interested in the problem so that they can clarify the current
state of affairs and help define a number of promising avenues of research that
result form it.
