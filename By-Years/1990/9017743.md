The leukocyte adhesion molecule LFA-1 plays a crucial role in all forms and
levels of immunity. Leukocytes are able to turn LFA-1 function on or off on a
minute-by-minute basis, giving them precise control over their adhesions with
each other and other cells. The rapid regulation of LFA-1 function is mediated
by protein kinase C, and does not require changes in cell surface density of
LFA-1 or its ligand, ICAM-1. Rather, the regulation of the avidity of LFA-1 for
ICAM-1 involves poorly defined configurational changes. Elucidation of these
configurational changes is the goal of this research. Highly plausible changes
would be homotypic clustering of LFA-1 to increase avidity for ICAM-1 and
anchoring to the cytoskeleton. The approach proposed is to quantitate clustering
by flow cytometric analysis of fluorescence resonance energy transfer, a method
proven capable of estimating mean intermolecular distances on cell surfaces. The
ability to quantitate clustering will make it possible to explore its
mechanisms, including the roles of divalent cations and cytoskeleton. Anchoring
to the cytoskeleton will be evaluated by solubility in Triton X-100. Cellular
adhesion plays a critical role in many developmental and physiological
processes, including immune function. The molecular mechanisms by which cells
recognize and adhere to appropriate partners is a subject of great current
interest. The proposed research will explore an innovative approach to the study
of mechanisms by which the strength of adhesion between cells is regulated.
