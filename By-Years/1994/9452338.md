9452338 Pifer Until recently our physics major program was narrowly directed at
preparing a small number of elite students for graduate studies. The current
employment situation has made it clear to us that we can no longer take the
narrow view that graduate school is the only reasonable career goal for a
scientifically able student, and in fact, there are many technically able
students who would like to major in physics yet are not interested in graduate
school. Many of these students are minorities or women. In response to these
students' career interests, we have recently introduced an Applied Physics
Major. The Applied option emphasizes a breadth of technical experience with an
emphasis on experimental skills, and is intended for students who plan to seek
industrial jobs immediately after graduation. The centerpiece of the option is a
3-credit, junior- level applied physics lab course. This lab currently uses
experiments from our modern physics lab that are designed for students headed
toward graduate school. We are requesting funds to introduce five applied-type
experiments that are built around the needs of these students and involve modern
instrumentation and experimental techniques of the type that students will
encounter in industry. We are initially concentrating on two areas -- the
scanning tunneling microscope and modern optics. The experiments to be
introduced are the scanning tunneling microscope, the He-Ne laser, saturated
absorption spectroscopy, holography, and the dye laser.
