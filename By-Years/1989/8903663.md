The principal investigator will study an area of geometry which relates both to
entire space-like, constant mean curvature, hypersurfaces in the Minkowski
space, and to harmonic analysis on minimal surfaces. This work will naturally
extend his earlier work. Specific attention will be paid to the interplay
between harmonic maps (nonlinear theory) and harmonic function theory (linear
theory). Certain aspects of the deformation and rigidity of minimal surfaces
will also be investigated. Mathematicians and physicists have studied the
structure of invariant space-like minimal surfaces in four-dimensional space-
time for several decades. Such surfaces minimize an energy function and are the
Minkowski hyper-space analogues of the soap films encountered in everyday life.
