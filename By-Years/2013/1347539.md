Over the past three years, the quantity and quality of synchrophasor
measurements made on the U.S. electric grid have dramatically increased. In
addition, the performance and robustness of the systems used to collect and
manage this high-sample rate, GPS time-stamped data have greatly improved. The
number of real-time phasor measurements in some Reliability Coordinator control
rooms is now approaching the level needed for full analysis of the electric grid
through synchrophasor measurements alone. This full analysis requires a Real-
Time Phasor State Estimator (RT-PSE). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of
this project is to develop, test, demonstrate, and commercialize the RT-PSE. The
project team believes that the RT-PSE is necessary, if not critical, to realize
the full value from synchrophasor measurements. Through the capabilities
enumerated above, the RT-PSE will provide more complete, higher quality, and
more reliable synchrophasor data streams for use by control conter applications
and operators.
