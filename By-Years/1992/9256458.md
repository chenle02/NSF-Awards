9256458 Silbey The MIT Chemistry Department has been awarded a three year
Graduate Research Traineeship Grant by the Chemistry Education Program to
develop a traineeship program in Chemistry of the Environment. A group of 9
faculty in physical, inorganic, and chemical toxicology, will join in a
coordinated study of the production, dispersion, and removal of chemical species
in the natural environment, and their interactions with biological systems.
Among the topics to be addressed are chemical processes in the stratosphere;
detection of trace atomospheric pollutants; spectroscopy of hydrocarbon free
radicals found in combustion; synthesis of improved materials for fuel cells and
catalytic converters; biochemical studies of methanotrophic bacteria; molecular
biology of environmental carcinogens; and theoretical analyses of pollutant
diffusion in the atmosphere. New classroom subjects and seminars on the
relations between chemistry, technology, and environmental policy will be
offered as part of the program. %%% Chemical processes involving trace gases in
the atmosphere, such as catalytic ozone destruction, gobal warming due to
methane and carbon dioxide, and tropospheric pollution by nitrogen and sulfur
oxides are now widely recognized as critical environmental threats. A principal
focus of the MIT graduate traineeship program will be on the kinetics and
spectroscopy of atmospheric molecules and radicals. The goal of this effort is
to train a new generation of chemists better equipped to understand and deal
with these important environmental issues. ***
