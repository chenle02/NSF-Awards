Professor Cushing, with support from the National Science Foundation, has been
working over the past several years on extensive, philosophically oriented case
studies of episodes in contemporary physics. With this grant, he will use these
case studies as part of his investigation of the construction, selection and
content of scientific theories. The theory which he is developing will occupy a
kind of middle ground between the overly rational reconstructions of "logicists"
and the overly anti-rational reconstructions of some sociologists of knowledge.
His model will be "naturalized" in that it is based upon a detailed examination
of the actual historical record of current, real scientific practice which will
provide the 'data' to which the methods of science are applied in studying the
scientific enterprise itself; "socialized" in that it takes cognizance of
'external' social and individual factors in the construction and justification
of scientific theories; "highly constrained" in that it recognizes and examines
in detail the not uniquely determining 'internal' and often strongly compelling
logic of a theoretical framework once that framework has been even tentatively
accepted for development and testing. This work will be an important and highly
useful contribution to the ongoing discussion of the philosophical problem of
epistemic support for human knowledge claims, most especially for such claims
about science.
