The unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii differentiates into 4
distinct cell types during the course of its life cycle. Most if not all of
these differentiation programs are governed by its mating-type (mt) locus which
exists as a pair of apparent alleles (mt+ and mt-). A chromosome walk has
documented that the mt loci include highly rearranged sectors which render mt+
and mt- very dissimilar to one another. By analogy with fungal mating-type loci
this rearranged domain may include genes that govern life-cycle transitions. One
such gene has already been identified in the region: the imp-1 gene, which
confers upon mt+ gametes the ability to fuse with mt- gametes, has been
localized to a segment of the rearranged domain by virtue of its disruption in
imp-1 mutants. Additional sequences from the rearranged domains will be used to
identify additional mt-linked genes, to identify cDNA clones derived from cell-
type-specific, mt-linked genes, and to identify genes whose products regulate
the mating phenotype of gametic cells. %%% This analysis should enhance our
understanding of the evolution of eukaryotic gene regulation and cell
differentiation.
