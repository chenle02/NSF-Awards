During the first year of this research project the primary objective was to
develop a simulation environment modelling and design that would facilitate
construction of variant families of models and variable structure models.
Although a number of application areas for such an environment were considered,
the research team focussed on computer network and computer architecture design
and simulation. This year, work will continue by further specializing the
simulation environment to support design, modelling, and simulation of advanced
computer architectures.
