An increasing number of scientific laboratories rely on microcomputers for data
acquisition and manipulation, and as terminals to interact with other computers.
Properly trained students should be familiar with the use of these computers,
the means by which they are interfaced with laboratory instruments, and their
advantages and limitations as compared to more traditional means of data
acquisition. They also should be familiar with the techniques by which, for
relatively simple phenomena, microcomputers may be used to construct simulations
and models. Through the purchase of microcomputers and the appropriate
accessories, physiology students at the College of the Holy Cross will become
thoroughly familiar with the techniques required to use a microcomputer to
collect and analyze data directly from common laboratory instruments and also to
use the computers as digital oscilloscopes. In addition, simulations and models
will be included as adjuncts to most labs. Besides improving the students'
abilities to visualize biological processes, these models will be used to
develop testable predictions as to how biological processes should occur if they
are largely the result of underlying mathematical, physical and chemical laws.
Through this project students will have opportunity to develop a thorough
appreciation for the power of the computer in modern laboratories. In addition
to their major application in the Physiology labs, the computers will be used
for modeling in General Ecology and Genetics laboratories.
