This project is for Collaborative Research at Undergraduate Institutions,
involving molecular biology, physiology and ecology to understand how
reproduction is affected by environmental stresses. It is well known from
ecological and evolutionary research that organisms have considerable
flexibility in how they respond to variable and unpredictable environments, and
physiological and cellular mechanisms such as endocrine function have been well
studied. However, the means by which the environmental stimuli mediate their
effects through physiological and molecular mechanisms are not well understood.
This project uses laboratory and field experiments on a large insect as a model
system to determine how variations in temperature and food availability affect
the cellular, molecular and physiological events that accompany egg production,
egg laying, and the development and survival of offspring. Manipulations of
these variables will indicate whether this reproductive plasticity represents an
adaptive response or an environmental constraint. Results will have an impact on
developmental biology, ecology, evolutionary biology, insect biology and pest
control, and promises a novel integrative experience involving undergraduates in
exciting research over an unusual range of levels of biological organization.
