The inventory project by David Middleton and Stuart Davies of Harvard
University and their colleagues will document the plant diversity of Peninsular
Thailand which is botanically and geographically the most diverse part of the
country and is the only continuous stretch of land in the Asian tropics that
includes the geographic transition from aseasonal forests to strongly seasonal
forests. It is estimated to encompass 7,500 species of plants and includes parts
of two of the world's 25 biodiversity "hot spots," which are recognized for high
species diversity with many species of very local distribution (endemic) and
likely endangered by habitat loss. Field collecting will occur over three years
in selected sites in collaboration with staff of the Thai Forest Herbarium and
National Park Department. Sites have been selected to span the full range of
geographical, climatic, soil type, and elevational gradients within the
Peninsula, and collections will be made at different times of year to allow for
seasonal flowering and fruiting. The collections will be databased, and
interactive identification keys will be constructed for web-accessible use.
&lt;br/&gt; The project aims to increase botanical collections available to
specialists worldwide for taxonomic revisions of targeted groups and for large-
scale efforts to complete the Flora of Thailand, and to contribute to the
ongoing Flora Malesiana program. The project will also facilitate student
training both in Thailand and at Harvard University in the U.S. Baseline data
for exploring hypotheses about the biogeographical history of plant divergence
and migration in southeast Asia will also be acquired. &lt;br/&gt;
