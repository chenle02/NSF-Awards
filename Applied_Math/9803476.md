This work will be focused on the concept of material mixing in dynamics.This
concept introduces spatio-temporal composites, i.e. material microstructures
assembled and maintained in space-time. Such composites will be investigated in
the framework of a Maxwell system for moving dielectrics as well as for the
relativistic equations of elastodynamics and acoustics. The relevant set of
effective parameters (G-closures) will be explicitly specified for a number of
practical examples.

The knowledge of G-closures is crucial for the analysis of material optimization
problems that arise in dynamics of moving media, particularly in acoustics and
hydroacoustics, as well as in high frequency electronic engineering. Such a
knowledge makes many of these problems well-posed when the material coefficients
act as the control factors. Physically, this is because the optimal material
layouts in space-time generally shape themselves as microstructures. This work
is aimed to prepare a conceptual basis for a subsequent investigation of
material optimization in dynamics.
