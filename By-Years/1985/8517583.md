Multiple Sensing is the ability to sense the environment with the concurrent use
of several different sensors. This research is concerned with the perception of
structure and motion of 3-D objects from multiple sensing. This project is aimed
at examining the main issues and questions raised by the problem of perception
of structure and motion through the analysis of images from several different
sensors. Three related tasks are being undertaken: (1) Determining the motion of
3-D objects from multi-sensor data; (2) Scene interpretation from thermal and
visual information; and (3) investigating the problem of image registration in a
multi-sensor environment.
