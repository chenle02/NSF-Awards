This study will examine the processes leading to the passage of legislation to
bail out the savings and loan industry. The study will focus on three questions:
What forces caused bank deregulation and its unintended consequences of the
savings and loan crisis? What forces caused Congress and the executive federal
government to contradict prevailing laissez-faire philosophy and agree to the
most expensive bailout in United States history? What actors were most critical
in shaping the deregulation and bailout legislation? The study will primarily be
based on data extracted from the 34 volumes of testimony transcripts and
supporting documents from the Congressional investigations into the crisis. The
significance of the study is twofold. It will offer important insights into the
events leading up to the savings and loan crisis and to the social problems it
in turn created. This may be useful for policy makers and it may influence the
debate on the future of the banking industry and in particular the savings and
loan industry. The study will also contribute to our understanding of the role
of the state in the shaping of corporate welfare, and thus possibly to an
expansion of the concept of the welfare state to include not only social welfare
but also the welfare of corporations and businesses.
