The National Academies are conducting a conference to address, examine and
explore broad issues related to the accessibility and inclusivity of STEM
workplaces for persons with disabilities, and highlighting their success in the
STEM workforce. The National Academiesâ€™ Board on Higher Education and Workforce,
in collaboration with the Board on Science Education, are convening an ad hoc
committee to direct a set of commissioned papers and a virtual conference with
presentations, panels, discussion breakouts, interactive sessions, reflections,
or other modes of engagement, as determined to convey the information best and
be as accessible as possible. Topics include, but are not limited to, using an
asset approach to define the disabilities of persons in STEM; examining
institutional barriers in work environments, policies and practices; and better
understanding the experiences of persons with disabilities across STEM
workplaces, including all types of STEM research settings. By using an
intersectional lens to examine the challenges and opportunities experienced by
STEM workforce employers, and by persons with disabilities, the products
generated are contributing to advancing knowledge about systemic institutional
barriers that limit the career advancement of persons with disabilities in STEM,
as well as the access and inclusion practices and policies that contribute to
advancing persons with disabilities working in STEM research settings.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The virtual conference workshop is designed to engage with
stakeholders who are persons with disabilities, and those who are not. All
planned activities are accessible to any committee member or stakeholder with a
disability to ensure that the lived experiences of persons with disabilities are
included. Accessible conference proceedings and commissioned papers, and other
products, will be made available to the public. Results from the workshop are
expected to inform a national agenda for research about the accessibility and
inclusivity of STEM workplaces, and to inform NSF about initiatives to advance
persons with disabilities in the STEM workforce. An external evaluator will join
the project team to employ metrics for assessment of the work activities, the
conference and the dissemination materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
