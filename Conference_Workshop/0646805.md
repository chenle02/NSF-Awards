This project will support U.S. graduate students and speakers to attend a summer
school in modern number theory being held at McMaster University from August
9-13, 2007. The goal of the conference is to introduce interested graduate
students to major lines of current research in the field. Four speakers will
deliver lecture series of four hour-long talks each to the students. Select
students will work on projects designed by the speakers in groups during nightly
working sessions and give presentations of their work on the final evening.

The specific focus of the summer school is Iwasawa theory, an area in which many
exciting advances have been made very recently. The lecture series will be
delivered by four of the foremost researchers in Iwasawa theory and will give
graduate students to a strong and carefully designed introduction to both
fundamental aspects of the subject and recent advances in the area. The summer
school will train a significant number of U.S. graduate students, providing an
important step in their development as research mathematicians.
