The interactions between the solar wind and the Earth's magnetosphere are
responsible for the complex dissipative processes which control the dynamics of
the near earth environment. The study of these processes is the basic theme of
solar-terrestrial research. The plasma sheet, its boundary layer, and the high
latitude auroral region are of central importance in the understanding of these
processes. The existence of the plasma sheet in the geomagnetic tail and the
dawn-to-dusk electric field across the tail implies there is a significant
energization of the particles carrying the crosstail current. This energization
of particles in the tail represents ~2% of the total energy carried by the solar
wind over an area equal to the cross section of the dayside magnetosphere, and
thus this energization is an important, and perhaps the dominant means by which
solar wind energy is transferred to magnetospheric particles. Current sheet
acceleration of ions is responsible for the unstable ion beams found in the
plasma sheet boundary layer (PSBL). The resulting motion of both ion and
electron particle populations are the likely cause not only of the formation of
the isotropic plasma sheet, but of the high latitude potential structure
responsible for discrete arcs in the auroral region. Discrete auroral arcs are
associated with regions of upward current carried by downward precipitating
electrons which have been accelerated through a field-aligned potential
difference of 10,000votts. Cold ionospheric ions are accelerated upward by the
same potential drop. This grant is composed of three projects: A) magnetotail
particle dynamics, B) broadband turbulence and particle diffusion in the plasma
sheet, and C) instabilities in the auroral acceleration region. Both the
magnetotail and the auroral region are dynamically active and of central
importance in the mechanics of the magnetosphere. They are also intimately
coupled to each other. Better understanding of the current and particle self-
consistencies, acceleration mechanisms, and particle diffusion in the
magnetotail and interactions of beams in the auroral zone will lead to an
improved global picture of the dynamics of the magnetosphere.
