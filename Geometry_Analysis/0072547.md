Quantum cohomology is a deformation of usual cup product of ordinary cohomology
ring of a smooth projective variety X. Similarly quantum K-theory is a
deformation of ordinary K-ring of X. In their study of Gromov--Witten K-theory,
Professor Lee and his collaborators have found some interesting relations to
other fields in mathematics and physics including algebraic geometry, integrable
systems, representation theory and quantum geometry. These investigations also
naturally lead to further investigations of Gromov--Witten theory itself. The
main focus of this project will be on quantum cohomology, quantum K-theory and
their relations to discrete KdV hierarchies, Toda lattices, and enumerative
geometry.

Gromov-Witten theory is a new subject that lies within the intersection of many
traditional branches of mathematics and theoretical physics. This theory was
originally discovered within string theory. Shortly thereafter people found many
new applications to mathematics. Some of these applications solved problems
that, based on traditional methods, were considered to be very difficult. The
tools used to study Gromov--Witten theory also involves many fields, including
algebraic geometry, topology and analysis. Thus, this is a growing new field
which exhibits many rich structures and deserves further investigation
