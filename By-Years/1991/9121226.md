This project will investigate the role of active oxygen in restricting
pathogenesis by the plant pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae. The
hypothesis that the pathogenic Pseudomonads are able to reduce plant-imposed
oxidative stress during pathogenesis though an arsenal of catalase isozymes will
be tested. There are two portions to the project: 1) cloning of the genes for
the catalase isozymes and construction of mutants for virulence studies; and 2)
determination of the interactions of the various catalase genes with the hrp
genes that appear to control the pathogenicity of the bacterium. The genetic
part will be carried out by Dr. Hutcheson at the University of Maryland, while
biochemical and physiological studies will be carried out by Dr. Klotz at Utah
State University under another award. %%% This research will contribute to the
understanding of the initial events that occur during plant-microbe
interactions, and should provide new information on the fundamental differences
between microbes that causes plant disease and those which cannot.
