9617206 Koenker Quantile regression is gradually evolving into a comprehensive
approach to the statistical analysis of linear and nonlinear response models.
Although the application of quantile regression in empirical economics has grown
rapidly in recent years in part because of the many past contributions by this
project's investigator, applications of quantile methods to large problems have
been limited because the computational burden increases rapidly as the problem
size grows. This project pursues two lines of research which preliminary work by
the investigator suggests should yield dramatic improvements in this direction.
One is the use of recently developed interior point methods for linear
programming; the other is a form of preprocessing which can drastically reduce
the effective dimension of most quantile regression problems. Together, these
ideas, based on preliminary testing, appear capable of bringing the
computational effort of quantile regression down to the level of the standard
least squares approach for problems with sample sizes up to several million
observations, and perhaps larger. This project will refine these new methods and
extend them to nonparametric and nonlinear response models. The project also
addresses the problem of the bewildering array of methods of inference based on
discrete quantiles by developing a method that appears especially attractive for
a wide variety of quantile regression inference problems including the
construction of confidence intervals for individual quantile regression
parameter estimates. Finally the project uses quantile methods for economic
applications in time-series, duration, and multivariate analysis.
