Our society is increasingly dependent on the Internet for instant access to
information. Broadband access can have a very strong positive impact on society.
The US is lagging behind in providing inexpensive broadband access to its
citizens. Research is needed to develop next-generation broadband access
technologies which will lead to new competitive services and applications.
Novelty: This project is creating new knowledge on the design, deployment, and
operation of the novel Long-Reach Broadband Access Network (LR-BAN)
architecture, resource-allocation algorithms, and network evolution to
accommodate traffic growth. Broader Impact: This project is enabling US
researchers to lead the development of next-generation Broadband Access
Networks. This comprehensive and integrated research and education project
should enhance our nation's educational infrastructure through student training
and influence the US telecom industry with its findings.

Specifically, this project is investigating novel network architectures,
protocols, and algorithms to design and efficiently operate next-generation
broadband access networks that can provide extended coverage across local and
metropolitan regions in telecom networks. The project is developing efficient
methods for extending the coverage of today?s Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) networks
from their 20-km limit to 100 km and beyond by exploiting wavelength-division
multiplexing passive optical networks (WDM-PONs) to serve a large user base,
leading to the Long-Reach Broadband Access Network (LR-BAN). The LR-BAN
architecture can effectively decrease the number of Central Offices in a telecom
operator's network and reduce its Operational Expenditure. This project is
investigating various LR-BAN architectural options (such as ?ring-and-spur?
architecture); methods to flexibly allocate bandwidth on demand to users with a
diverse set of requirements (such as ?multi-thread polling?); and methods to
evolve the network toward future reliable broadband applications and
technologies.
