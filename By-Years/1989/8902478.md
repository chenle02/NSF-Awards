Oceanic barium distributions will be defined by mapping the 3- dimensional
distributions of Ba in the South Atlantic. Processes at the boundaries and in
the interior of the south Atlantic gyre will be studied in the context of the
unique uptake and release pathway involving biologically produced particles. The
scientific hypothesis under investigation is that barium is inorganically
precipitated in microenvironments during the decay of organic matter. %%%
Approximately 1300 samples have been collected during SAVE legs 1-5, and another
400 samples will be obtained during Meteor cruise 11 in early 1990. A rapid and
precise method for determination of Ba in seawater has been developed and will
be used for the analysis of these samples.
