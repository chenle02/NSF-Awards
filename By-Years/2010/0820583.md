ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;0820583 - Planning Visit for U.S. - China Collaborative
Research on Multifunctional Materials - Jiangyu Li, University of
Washington&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award supports the PI, 1 graduate and 1
undergraduate student to visit the State Key Laboratory of New Ceramics and Fine
Processing at Tsinghua University in Beijing, and the National Laboratory of
Solid State Microstructures at Nanjing University in Nanjing for 14 days. The
U.S. PI holds the Bryan T. McMinn Endowed Research Professorship in Mechanical
Engineering at the University of Washington and his counterparts in China are
Professor LI, Jing-Feng, Materials Science and Engineering Department at
Tsinghua and Professor LIU, Jun-Ming, Physics Department, Nanjing
University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ferroelectric, thermoelectric and multiferroic
materials research is a strength of the Chinese institutions involved and should
provide excellent access to facilities related to student research experiences.
The current visit will train two students to work with their Chinese
counterparts to assist in developing a feasibility case for the proposed
cooperative activities.
