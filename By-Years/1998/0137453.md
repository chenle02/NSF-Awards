Summary: This proposal request support for a comprehensive chemical and isotopic
survey (major, trace, and rare earth elements along with Sr, Nd and Pb isotopes)
to test the hypothesis that the source of particulate Fe to central equatorial
Pacific surface waters is the Papua New Guinea region via the eastward flowing
Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC). In addition the study will assess whether wind
blown material is more important as a source of particulate Fe at 4oN and 5-2oS
than is PNG-derived Fe. The study will examine downcore variations in the EUC-
sourced Fe through glacial-interglacial cycles, and examine whether changes can
be correlated with changes of export production recorded in the sediments.
