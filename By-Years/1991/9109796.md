Admissible heuristics are an important class of heuristics worth discovering:
They guarantee shortest path solutions in search algorithms such as A* and they
guarantee less expensively produced solutions with a bounded increase in
solution path length in search algorithms such as dynamic weighing. Several
researchers have described how admissible heuristics can be generated from
abstracted versions of a given problem, ones from which certain details have
been removed. This work aims to develop a quantitative theory that relates
abstractness to the effectiveness of the resulting heuristics and them
empirically validate that theory. Such a theory will enable us to predict how
much complexity reduction can be expected from using abstraction-derived
heuristics. Ultimately, this theory will result in a better understanding of how
effective admissible heuristics can be automatically discovered.//
