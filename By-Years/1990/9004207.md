This research is to fund the U.S. portion of a joint U.S.- Icelandic wide-angle
reflection/refraction experiment in the area of the South Iceland overlapping
spreading centers. Field expenses will come from the Icelandic NSF. The
experiment is designed to answer three questions: 1) Is the Eastern Volcanic
Zone a propagating spreading center and what is its propagation speed? 2) Is
there any subsurface evidence that the South Iceland Seismic Zone is a developed
transform fracture zone at depth, 3) Does the Icelandic rift zone have crustal
magma chambers or is it like the rest of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, without any
significant crustal low velocity zones? This research is a component of the
National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
