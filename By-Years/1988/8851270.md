The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry of the University of Arkansas is
the process of initiating an undergraduate degree program in biochemistry. A
major component of this new degree program is the creation of a new biochemistry
laboratory course which will emphasize training in state-of-the-art
instrumentation and techniques involved in biochemistry and molecular biology.
This award will provide instrumentation necessary for the implementation of this
course. Among the instruments to be purchased are a refrigerated centrifuge with
rotors, computer controlled diode array spectrophotometer, a high performance
liquid chromatography system with columns, and a variety of electrophoresis
equipment for characterization of proteins and nucleic acids. Several smaller
items needed to initiate the laboratory course are also requested. The intention
of this course is to train students in the theoretical and practical use of
biochemical techniques which they might be expected to encounter in future
professional training and/or employment. In addition to those majoring in
biochemistry, the course will also provide training to students from various
areas of biology and agriculture. The grantee institution is matching this NSF
award with funds from non-Federal sources.
