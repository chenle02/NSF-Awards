This doctoral dissertation award will support research in industrial geography
on the producer service sector and on the relationship between this sector and
the growth of regional and national economies. The project examines the
relationship between the behavior and business performance of U.S. affiliates
operating in the producer service industry of Singapore and the growth and
development of the Singapore economy. It will also examine the intraregional
division of labor in the producer service industry among the countries of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the relationship of this division to
the produce goods sector in Singapore. A small but increasing body of literature
has examined the role of producer services in urban and regional settings. This
research will determine whether producer services in well developed market
economies function with a signficant basic component, how linkage patterns
differ between indigenous and nonindigenous (externally controlled) offices, and
what proportion of the services sector output fill intraservice demand. It is a
field which requires elaboration through detailed case studies of individual
economies. This project provides such a case study, examining whether these
kinds of relationships hold true in the context of the powerful and rapidly-
growing city state of Singapore, which promises to have a future role as the
economic, communications and innovation center of the South East Asian region.
