ABSTRACT NARRATIVE Description: This project supports the scientific cooperation
of Dr. Maurice Shamma of the Department of Chemistry of Pennsylvania State
University and Dr. Tekant Gozler and Dr. (Mrs) Belkis Gozler of the Faculty of
Pharmacy, Ege University, (University of the Aegean), Izmir, Turkey. The
research is to be a continuation of on going research entitled "Alkaloids for
Turkish Plants". The research objectives are to isolate and characterize new and
unusual natural products, particularly alkaloids, from plant sources. New
compounds obtained will be screened for pharmacological activity, if obtained in
sufficiently large quantities. Additionally, the novel natural products isolated
may furnish new insights into the biogenetic processes occurring in plants.
Turkish plants to be investigated are Colchicum szovitskii and several members
of the _________ __________ Asclepiadaceae family. The impetus for this research
is the recent report (N.Y. Times, Nov. 1, 1987, p. 33) that colchicine itself
has significantly extended the lives of cirrhosis victims and has even reversed
the damage that cirrhosis does to the liver, and secondly, there is little
current research on new Colchicum alkaloids in the U.S. _________ Scope: This
project is designed to have the Turkish _____ collaborators identify and gather
the natural plants in Turkey. They then extract, purify, identify and test the
chemical compounds obtained. The research data and samples are sent to the U.S.
principal investigator for further analysis. The Turkish scientists participate
with their U.S. counterpart at Penn State University in this advanced testing
and data compilation. The advancement of the international exchange of
scientific knowledge and the training and use of developing countries scientists
fulfills a major objective of the Science in Developing Countries Program.
