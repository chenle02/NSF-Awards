9409157 Jenkins This Research Initiation Award is to study the wrinkling of
membranes. The research seeks to study the control of wrinkling that exists in
many areas such as aerospace vehicles and biological organisms. Attempts will be
made to numerically predict and experimentally verify wrinkling conditions for
the same problem. Once this is completed an attempt will then be made to develop
an algorithm to demonstrate active control of the deformations. ***
