The intent of this passive noise control project is to develop a method for
predicting sound absorption characteristics of heterogeneous fibrous materials
such as needle punched nonwoven substrates. The research will be useful in
producing more efficient sound absorbent materials and in designing materials
for low frequency sound absorption. This is a three phase project comprising
three objectives: 1) the development of an empirical model for predicting the
effects of needle punched nonwoven substrate characteristics on sound
absorption; 2) the theoretical determination of the mechanisms involved in the
absorption of sound by heterogeneous substrates such as needle punched nonwoven
fabrics; 3) the determination of the substrate design criteria necessary for low
frequency absorption. The model development task is accomplished by systematic
measurements of the sound absorption coefficients for a large number of needle
punched fabrics. The model is an empirical relationship obtained by fitting a
parametric expression to the measured sound absorption coefficient data using
stepwise multiple regression analysis. The second objective is achieved through
a three stage process comprising development of structural model of the needle
punched nonwoven fabric, development of a dissipation model including a pore
size distribution function, viscosity correction factor and flow resistance
function for needle punched fabrics, and development of an acoustical model for
needle punched fabrics. The third project objective is met by varying the model
parameters to predict the maximum sound absorption at low frequencies.
