The Mathematical Association of America is organizing a meeting for current
principal and co-principal investigators of current Computer Science,
Engineering and Mathematics Scholarships (CSEMS). The meeting brings together
experienced and novice principal investigators, providing the opportunity to
share successful, creative, and innovative strategies for managing projects and
supporting scholarship recipients. The meeting creates formal networks of
principal investigators and co-principal investigators within a selected
geographical area and within similar institutional structures to provide support
and improve articulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectually, the project
promotes the development of innovative plans for the development of scholarship
programs that include CSEMS discipline workshops and mentoring programs that
enhance the experiences of the scholarship recipients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader impacts are addressed by the development of strategies for institutions
that are represent the broad spectrum of educational levels: two year
institutions, tribal colleges, minority serving institutions, four year
comprehensive institutions, and doctoral institutions.&lt;br/&gt;
