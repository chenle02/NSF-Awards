The search for a quantum theory of gravity has seen progress with the advent of
string theory and loop quantum gravity, but both lack direct contact with
experiment. The PI proposes a five-year plan that can potentially resolve
fundamental problems in cosmology and particle physics by developing new models
that arise from theories beyond the standard model and quantum gravity.
Additionally, he proposes new observational schemes to test these models. The
PI's long-term research plans over the next five years focus on two themes. One
is at the Interface of Particle Physics and Cosmology where he hopes to look at
the consequences for LHC physics of his new model that unifies gravity with the
electroweak force. He will also investigate the phenomenological consequences of
a Supersymmetric extension of this model. The second area concerns the nature of
the cosmological singularity. The PI has proposed several novel theories based
on modifying gravity and will also consider the experimental consequences of
these models. The outreach part of this Career program will consist of
&lt;br/&gt;the PI giving a two-week course on Music and the Cosmos, which will
be hands on presentation on the physics of sound and musical instruments. These
lectures will be presented to urban high school students through the Upward
Bound Summer Science program at Penn State. The PI will also serve as both a
research and long-term career mentor for two minority undergraduate students
each year, by creating two summer research positions in his group through this
award.&lt;br/&gt;
