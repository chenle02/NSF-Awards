This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project is aimed
at providing integrated software solutions that will help academic institutions
address critical issues of cost reduction, operating efficiency, program
management, student retention and revenue generation. Every academic institution
has to regularly develop and update course schedules that are intended to
satisfy program requirements, student needs, teacher preferences and space
constraints. Additional pressures arise as institutions try to keep costs low
and/or increase revenues. This challenging optimization problem, called
"timetabling" in the literature, has never had a near-optimal theoretical or
practical solution for any but the smallest institutions, or limited versions of
the problem. Moreover, there is no existing integrated, near-optimal software
solution that can support studies of strategic issues such as new buildings, new
programs, parking, environmental impacts, security, etc. This research will
focus on extending methodologies, successfully developed for complex
manufacturing applications, to enterprise timetabling in academic institutions

A significant dichotomy exists between the societal need to make higher
education accessible, and data showing college costs rising much faster than
inflation. Today, most institutions control costs crudely with across-the-board
budget cuts, layoffs, larger classes and tapping into endowments. A
commercialized product based on the proposed research would provide institutions
with vastly improved planning and administrative capabilities, enabling them to
better control costs, develop new strategies for critical issues, improve
student experiences, increase revenues and more rapidly update programs.
