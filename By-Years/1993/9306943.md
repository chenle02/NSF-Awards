9306943 Givinish This research involves a molecular systematic study of the
monocot plant family Rapateaceae. Chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) variation will be
examined using both restriction site maps and nucleotide sequences of the ndh F
gene and rbc L atp B spacer. These data will be used to derive a molecular
phylogeny, and this phylogeny will be sued to interpret morphological changes
and the distribution and ecology of the family in both Africa and South America.
%%% The family Rapateaceae presents several opportunities for research on
various questions involving adaptation. In this family there are several
pollination systems involving bees, hummingbirds, flies, and weevils, and it is
unknown whether species that share similar pollinators and flowers are closely
related. Broader relationships of the Rapateaceae and Bromeliaceae are of
interest to plant biologists, and different morphological features support
alternative hypotheses. A molecular phylogeny will provide a test of these
hypotheses. Finally, this research will contribute to one of the world's largest
live plant and frozen plant tissue collections. This collection will be a major
contribution to the plant biology community.
