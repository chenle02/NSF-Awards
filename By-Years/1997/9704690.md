A computational strategy will be used to carry out the first completely
quantized first-principles quantum dynamical simulations of condensed matter
systems, in which both the electronic and nuclear quantization are effectively
included. The computational strategy combines the Centroid Molecular Dynamics
(CMD) approach and the Car-Parrinello (CP) method within a scalable algorithm.
The quantum dynamical information will be obtained by running classical-style
CMD trajectories for the quantum particles on an effective, temperature-
dependent ab initio potential. The ab initio effective potential will be
calculated by performing equilibrium Car-Parrinello quantum path-integral
averaging simultaneously with the time-integration of the MD equations. This
methodology will be implemented in a parallel CMD algorithm, which should be
capable of near linear performance scaling. A key element in the simulation
methodology will be the implementation of a cumulant averaging strategy to
significantly reduce the computational workload. The success of the project will
rely on the development of intrisically scalable computational methods
implemented on highly parallel computing platforms.
