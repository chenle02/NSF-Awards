The 49th John H. Barrett Memorial Lectures will be held on May 28-30, 2019 at
the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. The year's Lectures are entitled "Recent
Advancements in Number Theory" and will feature a number of hour long plenary
talks by high profile mathematicians, as well as shorter talks given by mostly
early career researchers. These talks will cover a range of topics in number
theory and arithmetic geometry. For more information, please visit the
conference website at: http://www.math.utk.edu/barrett/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
Barrett Lectures began in 1970 as a tribute to Dr. John H. Barrett, a
distinguished mathematician and influential Mathematics Department Head at the
University of Tennessee. Over the years, the Lectures have covered a large
number of mathematical topics (which this year topics coming from number theory
and arithmetic geometry), and have developed a rich history of excellence. The
Lectures are aimed to bring together researchers from various career stages in
order to stimulate academic discussions and collaborations as well as to
disseminate new topics and ideas among the community. Attendees, especially
graduate students and other early career researchers, will be exposed to the
research of high profile mathematicians, that can inspire, motivate, and give
new directions to their own research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
