In this proposal funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Arthur Suits of the State University of New York at Stony
Brook will pursue a program of research on ion pair imaging spectroscopy. Vacuum
ultraviolet radiation will be used to drive dissociation of various molecules to
produce ion pairs. The kinetic energy released, when one of the ions in the pair
is structureless (e.g., chloride ion) maps the energy levels of the co-fragment
in a manner analogous to photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). This approach permits
study of species for which no stable precursors re available, and will readily
allow for probing levels that are optically inaccessible. The overarching goal
of this project is to obtain vibrational frequencies and thermochemical data for
elusive ionic species not accessible to conventional techniques. Preliminary
studies of the methyl cation will be extended to include related C2 and C3
species, as well as the methylene cation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of
these studies will be used as benchmarks for comparison to theoretical
calculations, for their intrinsic value in determining the thermochemical scales
on which all of chemistry relies, and for developing the fundamental
understanding of transient species of importance in combustion, atmospheric and
interstellar chemistry.
