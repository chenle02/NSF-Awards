Although herbs typically contribute only a minor fraction of the total biomass
or production of a forest, they may be critically important in regulating forest
composition and dynamics through competition with tree seedlings. However,
because forests are extremely variable in herb abundance, the impact of herbs on
tree establishment is not consistent. Resource competition theory leads to the
prediction that under conditions of abundant soil nutrients and moisture but low
light, herbaceous plants will win in competition with woody plants, while higher
light or lower soil resource levels should shift the competitive interaction to
favor woody plants. Experimental manipulations of light and soil resources will
be used the hypothesis that herbs on high-resource sites influence tree
composition by reducing growth rates, and increasing mortality rates of tree
seedlings. Observation made along herb-cover gradients will be used to test the
general hypothesis that the light:soil resource supply ratio determines the
outcome of competition between woody and herbaceous plants in understories. If
this hypothesis is true, then canopy gaps, herb removal areas, and other low
resource microsites could play a critical role by shifting the competitive
balance to be more favorable for tree seedlings.
