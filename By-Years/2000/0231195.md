Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a project to organize a
conference on "Colleges of Education and Engineering: Fostering Campus
Collaborations". This is a follow-up conference which builds upon the success of
the previous conference "Taking the Lead: A Deans Summit on Education for
Technological World". &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference comprises of
approximately 200-250 attendees, including faculty from both engineering and
education colleges as well as deans, provosts or presidents. The conference
features best practices in campus collaborations that result in enhanced teacher
preparation, improved curricula and teaching methodologies, expanded outreach
for both education and engineering programs, and educational standards
development. All sessions cover methodologies and strategies to overcome
constraints and to maximize impact. The conference focuses on teacher
preparation, community outreach to K-12, and pedagogical strategies for
engineering education. In addition, seven themes are emphasized throughout the
conference. These themes consist of "Community of Deans", "Collaborations",
"Diversity", "Successful practices Integrating/Infusing Standards", "Pipeline
for Teacher Education and Engineering", and "Funding Sources".&lt;br/&gt;
