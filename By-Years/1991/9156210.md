The overall goal of this project is a radical restructuring of undergraduate
computing education, beginning with a one-year introductory computing
curriculum. The aim of this pilot project is to construct a database of two
problem case studies to be used in three quarters, or two semesters, of courses
in the algorithms and programming area. The case studies integrate the teaching
of theory, abstraction, design, implementation, and experimentation into a new
core curriculum for undergraduates from a growing community of disciplines. Each
case study is complete in that it contains instruction in all topics relevant to
its problem, as well as exercises and laboratory manuals to support the
implementation and experimentation components. The database is integrated with
information processing tools appropriate for supporting ongoing competence
tracking, optimization targeting, and module refinement. Empirical evaluation
plays a key role in the project, and ongoing effectiveness evaluation is built
into the curriculum design.
