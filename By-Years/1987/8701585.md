The flow of an incompressible fluid can be approximated by the vortex method if
effects of viscosity are negligible. It can be approximated by the random vortex
method if the fluid is viscous. This research program investigates the
convergence of the approximate solutions by these methods. Knowing that they
converge will make these methods reliable and therefore useful. Knowledge on the
rate of convergence will allow comparisons with other methods in efficieny and
cost.
