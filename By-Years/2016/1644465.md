This I-Corps L project will examine the potential of environmental monitoring
modules informed by high frequency water and weather data from a small urban
watershed for 9-12th-grade students. The Learning Enhanced Watershed Assessment
System (LEWAS) is a real-time, high frequency (1-3 min.) water and weather
monitoring system and its cyberlearning system is called the Online Watershed
Learning System (OWLS). Through early 2016, the LEWAS/OWLS-based learning
modules have been used in at least 17 different undergraduate university courses
in engineering, sciences and industrial design, one graduate hydrology course
across four universities in three countries and four first-year engineering
courses across two community colleges (Virginia Western and John Tyler) in
Virginia. The LEWAS/OWLS has also been used in: one high school course, an NSF-
supported Chautauqua Professional Development Short Course Series and
interactive touchscreen displays available to the public on the Virginia Tech
campus. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps L project builds upon the outcomes of
prior successful NSF grants in which the investigators have demonstrated
successful implementation of the LEWAS/OWLS-based learning modules into various
courses. This research, using the theoretical framework of situated learning,
has shown that use of the OWLS as a remote lab within hybrid instruction
increases students' learning of environmental monitoring concepts and
motivation. The team proposes to investigate potential customer interest in
incorporating the LEWAS/OWLS-based modules into 9-12 grade instruction. The
expectation is that incorporation of these modules that combine the idea of
understanding, evaluating, creating, and managing environmental (water quality
and quantity and weather) data through computation will lead to wide-scale
adoption of a cyberlearning approach for developing skills among 9-12th-grade
students in environmental monitoring and computational thinking.
