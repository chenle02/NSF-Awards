9310603 Saville Under the aegis of this equipment grant proposal, funds are
sought to purchase a set of devices (a high frequency impedance analyzer,
computer, and auxiliary equipment - hereafter to be called the High Frequency
Dielectric Spectrometer) to characterize colloidal dispersions, emulsions and
thin films via measurements of the (complex) impedance of dielectric constant.
The instrument will be used in several research projects including: (i)
Dielectric Spectroscopy of Colloidal Dispersions - Research on the electrical
nature of the particle-fluid interface and the properties of adsorbed polymer
layers using electrokinetic measurements, (ii) Microemulsions - Research on the
relationships between structures and bulk properties. (iii) Dielectric
Properties of Thin Film and Emulsions - Characterization of thinning processes
in single films and emulsions. ***
