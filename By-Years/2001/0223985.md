0223985 Graedel This MUSES incubation project will convene an expert workshop to
explore data needs and model formulation approaches for the steel-related
elements. Materials budgeting is a technique that, in principal, can provide
information useful for studies of resource availability, potential environmental
impacts, and policy options. Though data for steel are relatively accessible,
this is not necessarily the case for its common alloying metals, a group that
includes silicon, vanadium, chromium, manganese, cobalt, nickel, molybdenum, and
tungsten. The amounts of steel used are so large that, for these alloying
elements, their cycles are dominated by their use a small-percentage alloying
elements. To understand the interrelationships, and to predict the usage and
availability of these elements in the future, detailed dynamic models that
couple resource economics, potential technological evolution, and use and
recycling strategies will be necessary.&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will draw
participants from a broad geographic spectrum, and will explore available data
archives, information networks, and partnerships among academia and between
academia and industry. Graduate students will be used a focus group reporters,
both to ensure a detailed record of the workshop and to expose them to a group
of participants of international stature.&lt;br/&gt;Following the workshop, a
scientific programmer, under the guidance of the principal investigators, will
begin the implementation of the concepts developed at the workshop. The workshop
report and the preliminary model construction are expected to be the basis for
more comprehensive research on iron alloying element cycles in the
future.&lt;br/&gt;
