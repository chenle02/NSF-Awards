Project Summary Greenwald/ATM-9320146 This project will evaluate the range of
physical processes leading to the transfer of energy, momentum and mass from the
solar wind to the earth's upper atmosphere. Specifically, the investigators will
identify the conditions in the solar wind and earth's magnetosphere that lead to
the onset of current surges and then to track the resulting gravity waves in the
upper atmosphere as they propagate equatorwards, dissipating their energy. The
proposal will constitute a continuation of a previous three-year study using
high-latitude ground-based and satellite instrumentation for studies of gravity
waves launched by electrojet current surges.
