The proposed research covers several problems in microlocal analysis. In
particular the analysis of elliptic operators on singular or non-compact spaces.
Certain approaches to conical and wedge-like singularities are proposed and
applications to Hodge theory, the Yamabe problem and area minimizing
submanifolds, are intended.
