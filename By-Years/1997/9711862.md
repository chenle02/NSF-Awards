9711862 Skyllingstad This project is for a modeling study of turbulence
generation by storm-driven inertial currents. A series of experiments using LES
model will be carried out with the objectives to: 1) develop a physical
description of turbulent processes that are forced by inertial currents; 2)
quantify the energy budgets during wind events and how they relate to changes in
density structure; 3) determine the importance of mean flow properties in
controlling instability processes at the base of the mixed layer.
