The peccaries (Artiodactyla: Tayassuidae) are a family of ungulates with
extreme specializations of the nasal passages. In particular, their noses
contain a complex of inflated bony structures found nowhere else among the
mammals. The functions of these structures are completely unknown. One
difficulty in arriving at a functional interpretation is that little is known
about the functional morphology of the vertebrate respiratory system. The
proposed research is both a systematic investigation of possible functions of
the peccary nasal apparatus and general analysis of mammalian respiratory
mechanics. The principal investigators will test the hypothesis that the peccary
structures are involved in olfaction by histological and ultrastructural study
of the nasal epithelia. They will assess whether the structures function as part
of a brain-cooling mechanism by elucidating the anatomy of the nasal
vasculature. They will use mathematical modeling and an experimental flow
apparatus to test whether the structures are associated with a mechanism for
exchanging heat or water with the environment, and also to investigate if they
could be used to remove particles from a dust-laden atmosphere.
