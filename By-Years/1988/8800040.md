This award will enable collaborative research between Drs. Jer-Ming Chiu and
Steven Wesnousky of the Center for Earthquake Research at Memphis State
University, Dr. Bryan Isacks of Cornell University, and Dr. Terry Webb of the
Geophysics Division of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, New
Zealand. Drs. Chiu, Wesnousky and Isacks will meet with scientists in New
Zealand to coordinate preparations for the deployment of a portable seismic
array designed for numerical data aquisition (PANDA). Plans will be made to
deploy the seismic array on the North Island of New Zealand in order to
determine the structure of crust and mantle material within an active island-arc
subduction zone. The north Island of New Zealand presents unique geographic
characteristics. Deployment of the PANDA array in this region would yield
abundant seismic data which bear directly upon questions related to mechanical
behavior of earthquake faults, seismic hazard, imaging of magma bodies in the
shallow crust, and the effect of site response on the amplitude and frequency
content of short-period seismograms.
