0436435&lt;br/&gt;Arguello&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This U.S.-Argentina award will
provide support for collaborative research between Dr. Jose M. Arguello,
Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and Dr. Francisco L. Gonzalez-Flecha at the
University of Buenos Aires in Argentina. They will study P-type ATPases, an
important class of membrane proteins, from theromophilic organisms.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this work will increase our understanding
of this type of protein, which is one of the most important membrane proteins,
but experimentally difficult. Each side of this international collaboration
brings unique expertise to the project. The U.S. lab will provide strains and
the experimental approach to express heterologous Cop A, an experimental system
that is not yet broadly developed in Argentina. Dr. Gonzalez-Flecha will bring
his expertise on physical-chemistry for the study/analysis of membrane proteins.
