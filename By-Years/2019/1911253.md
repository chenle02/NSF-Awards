This project describes a methodology to design and manufacture ultra-bright
fluorescent nanoparticles using cellulose acetate, an FDA-approved material for
human use. The proposed work will fill the knowledge gaps in the stability,
functionality, and efficacy of the novel nanoparticles for cancer detection
using zebrafish xenograft models. This has a broad societal impact with a high
translational potential to clinics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will
develop a new family of cellulose acetate (CA) fluorescent nanomaterials that
will be biocompatible, less expensive, and brighter than quantum dots for in
vivo testing such as early cancer detection. Although CA is widely used in the
food and medical industry, only large nanomaterials have been developed which
are not good for in vivo applications as they are cleared rapidly from the body.
The investigator will develop CA nanoparticles with diameters less than 100 nm.
The particles will encapsulate multiple classes of dyes that will be
ultrabright, photostable, and chemically stable at different chemical
environment treatments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
