Sogge DMS-9424418 Sogge will continue his work on problems in classical analysis
and pde's that relate to the wave equation. He will attempt to prove sharp
results concerning Fourier analysis in domains which will have applications to
questions about nonlinear wave equations in bounded domains. He will also
investigate small-data existence theorems for semilinear wave equations in
Euclidean space. This will require new types of mixed-norm estimates for
solutions of the wave equation involving non-trivial angular norms. Partial
differential equations form a basis for mathematical modeling of the physical
world. The role of mathematical analysis is not so much to create the equations
as it is to provide qualitative and quantitative information about the
solutions. This may include answers to questions about uniqueness, smoothness
and growth. In addition, analysis often develops methods for approximation of
solutions and estimates on the accuracy of these approximations.
