9725675 Bloxham The P.I. proposes to continue investigations of the geodynamo,
building on his 3-dimensional, dynamically self-consistent dynamo code and
furthering use of observations to place constraints on the dynamo process. The
current geodynamo model operates in the same dynamical regime as the Earth at
leading order, but at higher order the scaling of the model to the Earth is
imperfect because of unavoidable computational constraints. In addition to
tackling this problem, the P.I. also plans a number of developments of the model
aimed both at further improvements to the computational aspects of the model and
at including additional geophysical effects, especially the effects of lateral
heterogeneity at the core-mantle boundary. A parameterized version of the model
for studying long-term field evolution will also be developed. Using
observations, a number of studies centered on the exchange of angular momentum
between the core and the rest of the Earth will be undertaken. This is an area
where observations have a particularly important role to play in constraining
the geodynamo. Finally, the dynamo model will be used to examine the underlying
assumptions that are adopted in analyzing the geomagnetic secular variation. ***
