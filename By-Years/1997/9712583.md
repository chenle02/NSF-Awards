The objective of the workshop is to focus on the manufacturing innovations
needed for reducing costs of composite components and systems. Relevant topics
such as newly evolving manufacturing technologies, cost reduction strategies,
manufacturing process automation, computer simulation of manufacturing processes
and virtual manufacturing will be covered in the presentations. The list of
invited speakers for the workshop includes well known composites manufacturing
experts from both the automotive and aerospace industries, as well as
universities and government agencies. The Proceedings of the conference will be
put together by the workshop as a special publication/report.
