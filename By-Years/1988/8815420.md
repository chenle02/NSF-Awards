This is a project to develop a new method of experimental stress analysis. The
proposed technique is a high sensitivity shearographic method which allows full
field and noncontact measurement of the surface deformation. The major thrust of
the proposed work is to increase the sensitivity of shearography and to automate
the data acquisition procedure.
