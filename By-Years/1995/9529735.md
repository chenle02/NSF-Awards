Sanford OCE-952735 An experimental study on the generation of the baroclinic
tide over roguh botom topography will be conducted at the Mendicino Escarpment,
off the Oregon coast. Its subsequent propagation and evolution along tidal beams
will be followed over a fortnight, and the fine-scale internal wave field in
abyssal waters over rough topography will be characterized. These objectives
will be met observationally by collecting velocity and density profiles over the
full water column. This research will also test models of internal tide
generation and alternate proposed sinks for internal wave energy and will
compare vertical wavenumber spectra for abyssal shear and strain to the standard
Garrett-Munk internal wave model.
