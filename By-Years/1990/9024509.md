In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, the
spectroscopy, photochemistry, and dynamics of coordinatively unsaturated
transition metal carbonyls will be studied. Such studies are important for both
the fundamental information they provide about the synthesis of new inorganic
compounds as well as the practical information about catalysis processes. %%%
Transient infrared spectroscopy will be the principal experimental method used
to obtain information about the reaction kinetics and mechanisms, bond energies,
photochemistry, and photophysics of the unsaturated metal carbonyls. Real time
information about a number of catalytic processes will be obtained and the
important kinetic steps in their mechanisms will be elucidated. Experiments will
explore the role of "ligand slippage" in substitution reactions of saturated
species, and a newly implemented kinetic technique will be used to measure bond
dissociation energies in order to understand trends.
