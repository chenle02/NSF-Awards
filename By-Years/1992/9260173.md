Sodium-beta (Na-beta)-alumina is the solid electrolyte membrane used in sodium-
sulfur batteries with applications in load leveling, electric automobiles, and
satellite communications. A novel method for the fabrication of thin (20 to 50
micrometers) Na-beta-alumina solid electrolytes will be undertaken. This method,
known as electrochemical vapor deposition (EVD), has been used successfully to
deposit zirconia, perovskites, and ceria for applications in solid oxide fuel
cells. The method consists of reacting gaseous species to form a thin membrane
of Na-beta-alumina over a porous support, further growth of which occurs by EVD.
An EVD reactor will be built. Na-beta-alumina membranes will be deposited using
two processes; a one step and a two step process. The membranes will be
characterized with regards to microstructure, crystal structure and
conductivity.
