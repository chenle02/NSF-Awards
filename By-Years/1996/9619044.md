mooring instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research. The shipboard
instrumentation will be used aboard the R/V Moana Wave, a 213 foot vessel, which
is owned by the Navy and operated by the University in support of oceanographic
research. Instrumentation requested includes a spectrometer, CCD camera, an
acoustic command encoder and transducer, a display monitor, slip ring assemblies
and a cable hotsplicer. The instrumentation is requested for support of NSF-
funded cruises aboard the Moana Wave during 1997.
