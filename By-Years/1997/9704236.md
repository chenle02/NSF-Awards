9704236 Dickinson The PI proposes to develop an integrated research and
educational plan in bioengineering. The research component involves a study of
the mechanism of bacterial adhesion to surfaces, a key early step in the
development of infections on implant devices. Non-specific (colloidal-type) and
receptor-mediated interactions of Staphylococcus aureus to surfaces will be
measured using total internal reflection microscopy and three dimensional laser
optical trapping. The forces and attachment kinetics will be used to develop a
mechanistic mathematical model for bacterial attachment. The ambitimus
educational plan involves participation in the development of a graduate, multi-
disciplinary degree program in biomedical engineering and an undergraduate
degree program in biochemical engineering. The PI will participate by developing
new class and laboratory courses in both areas. ***
