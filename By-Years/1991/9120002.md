This Center, in association with the University of Illinois, Purdue University,
the University of Michigan, and the National Institute of Standards and
Technology, undertakes multidisciplinary interactive research, as well as
broadly based education, outreach, and knowledge transfer activities. The
research focuses on developing a fundamental understanding of cement-based
materials and the complex relationships among cement chemistry, microstructure,
processing, micromechanics and engineering properties, and exploiting knowledge
gained to design high performance cement-based materials with superior
properties for use in advanced materials structures and systems. These goals
require an interdisciplinary, multi-institutional and well coordinated research
team, with expertise in cement chemistry, fracture mechanics, surface science,
electrical engineering, computer simulation and modeling, and materials science
and engineering. The educational and outreach activities include a pre-college
enrichment program for high school science and math teachers, a five week summer
program for high school students, and summer research experience for
undergraduates. Knowledge transfer is effected through research symposia,
international research personnel exchange and research collaboration, the
Industrial Affiliates Program, active participation in the Illinois Technology
Challenge Program, and publications in appropriate technical journals. This
Center is directed by Professor Surendra P. Shah.
