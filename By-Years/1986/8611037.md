The main objective of this study is to evaluate the performace of low- to
medium-rise flat-slab buildings damaged during the Mexican earthquake of
September 19, 1985, and to check the adequacy of U.S. procedures for the seismic
design of similar buildings. Information on Mexican design and construction
practive for slab-column connections is collected incooperation with the Mexican
co-investigator. The strengths, stiffnesses, and design features of these
connections are compared to those specified by U.S. building codes. Twelve
large-scale multiple-connection and single-connection slab-column assemblies are
designed according to the U.S. practice and tested in the laboratory to evaluate
their performance into the nonlinear range of response under earthquake-type
loading. The test assemblies include slabs with and without edge beams.
