Catalyst Projects provide support for Historically Black Colleges and
Universities to work towards establishing the research capacity of faculty to
strengthen science, technology, engineering, and mathematics undergraduate
education and research. It is expected that the award will further the faculty
member's research capability, improve research and teaching at the institution,
and involve undergraduate students in research experiences. This project at
Alabama State University intends to investigate the role of microbial (bacteria,
protists, algae) diversity and nutrient enrichment in the formation of Harmful
Algal Blooms (HAB) in collaboration with researchers at Auburn University. The
project will contribute to efforts aimed at establishing an active research and
training program in microbial ecology for educating and mentoring minority
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aquatic microbial biodiversity and trophic
complexity represent a diverse set of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes. The
role of aquatic microbes in reducing nutrient loads (via nutrient assimilation
or cycling) and controlling other invasive or harmful microbial species such as
Microcystis spp., is acknowledged, though less explored. This project will
mechanistically test the role of nutrient inputs and microbial biodiversity in
the survival of Microcystis spp., and HAB formation in lab and field experiments
using multi-omics approaches. The results from this project may contribute to a
broader understanding of microbial factors underlying HAB formation and control
in waterbodies. Overall, the proposed research may help us develop strategies
aimed at predicting and controlling HABs in the context of microbiome
biodiversity and ecosystem functioning research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
