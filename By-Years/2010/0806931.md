This project is awarding scholarships to academically talented and financially
needy students and is supporting the scholars through a variety of structures
and programs. Students from underrepresented groups are being especially
targeted for support. Student scholars are enrolled as engineering or computer
science majors and have been identified as those who are interested in either
pursuing an entrepreneurial career path or who are interested in pursuing
graduate research studies. The scholarship program is integrated with a
successful STEP program on campus, extending support and mentoring activities
into the junior and senior years for targeted students. The objective of the
program is the creation of enhanced educational opportunities to enable success
of the scholars. The methods being employed in the project include a strong
academic support structure, a mentorship program that involves research faculty
and industry partners, a Distinguished Speaker seminar series aimed at the
scholars, and a learning community infrastructure.
