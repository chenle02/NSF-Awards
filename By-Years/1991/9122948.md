This project is a study of the composition and properties, as well as the
associated synthetic aperture radar (SAR) signatures of warm arctic sea ice.
Direct measurements will be made from US Coast Guard icebreakers in the late
summers of 1992 and 1993 in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. Sea ice
characteristics to be investigated will include thickness, salinity and
temperature profiles, dielectric properties, crystal structure, and surface
conditions. These characteristics will be used to model the expected microwave
backscatter intensities, which will be compared to observed backscatter
intensities obtained by the SAR instruments on board the ERS-1 and JERS-1
satellites. The project will contribute to an improved understanding of the
internal structure of arctic pack ice, of the specific summer properties of warm
sea ice, and SAR signature variations produced by differing ice characteristics.
The information produced by this study is expected to be particularly valuable
in other fields of polar oceanographic research, such as sea ice dynamics and
thermodynamics, ice mechanics and rheology, oceanic heat and salt fluxes, and
sea ice biological processes.
