The Department of Chemistry is acquiring a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer
system for use across the curriculum from general introductory courses for non-
science majors to chemistry majors' senior research projects. In addition, to
using the instrument for reaction product characterization, students in organic
chemistry are studying rearrangement reactions occuring in the mass
spectrometer. Analytical chemistry students are investigating the presence and
identity of volatile organics in rain. The instrument is having a significant
impact on the undergraduate research program.
