This action funds a Minority Graduate Student Travel Award. These awards permit
minority graduate students who plan to apply for an NSF Minority Postdoctoral
Research Fellowship to make visits to prospective sponsoring scientists prior to
submitting a fellowship application. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ms. Uriarte will
visit laboratories and field stations at the University of Washington early in
calendar year 2001. Her research interests are in environmental biology and the
physiology of invasive plant species.
