This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will extend the
work begun in Phase I to apply advances in knowledge discovery to bridge the gap
between what is known about an Internet viewer and what is done with this
knowledge to improve user experience and business outcomes. The effort will
develop new algorithms to combine implicit and explicit taxonomies to build
content networks. A live feedback loop that uses multivariate test results will
be used to adjust and refine clusters of users in order to establish specific
parameters which can subsequently be acted on.

Online content publishers aggregate enormous volumes of data about their viewers
from web logs, registration systems, third-party web analytics providers and ad-
serving systems. Mostly these systems operate independently with a primary focus
on describing what has happened. Through a deeper analysis, which will be
enabled by the current effort, content providers will be able to use this data
in more predictive ways. This in turn will allow content providers a more
intelligent tool for serving higher-value content throughout the online
experience. If successful, this will have implication for new rich media
services and e-commerce.
