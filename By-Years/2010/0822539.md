Professors Shaorang Liu, Henryk Temkin and Jordan M. Berg of Texas Tech
University are supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the
Division of Chemistry to conduct research that employs theoretical,
computational and experimental nanofluidics methodologies to explore the unique
properties of liquids in nanochannels. The research effort will be focused on
three new phenomena: 1) ion enrichment and depletion, 2) electrolyte
conductivity enhancement, and 3) nano-induced apparent hydrophobicity. The
nanochannels under study will have a depth in the range of ten to one hundred
nanometers , where continuum behavior is dominant. Models will be developed to
interpret these phenomena and reveal the underlying principles.
&lt;br/&gt;Improved fundamental understanding of nanochannels will lead to new
devices with substantial societal benefits. The proposed research involves
chemists, mechanical and electrical engineers, and students from these three
disciplines. This project integrates cutting-edge research with training in
teamwork, communication, mentoring and leadership. The inherently
interdisciplinary nature of this research will produce students with exceptional
training. &lt;br/&gt;
