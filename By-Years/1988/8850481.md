The Curriculum Research &amp; Development Group (CRDG) of the College of
Education of the University of Hawaii is taking the lead in a national
consortium of 2 school districts, 13 universities, 29 elementary schools, and
its publisher, the University of Hawaii, to develop and disseminate a sequential
and integrated curriculum in science, health, and technology for elementary
schools, kindergarten through grade 6. The Developmental Approaches in Science
and Health (DASH) curriculum focuses on: o teaching the basic concepts of
science, health, and technology; o fostering understanding of the relationships
among science, health, and technology; o developing the strategies and cognitive
skills needed for using scientific, technological, and health-related knowledge;
and o fostering awareness of the responsibility of citizens for insuring the
appropriate uses of the knowledge and products derived from science, health, and
technology. DASH offers an integrated, holistic approach to elementary science
education for students. Its content is drawn from the foundational concepts of
the biological, physical, and earth sciences, and it incorporates applications
of these concepts in health and technology. In accord with the emerging
knowledge of cognitive development, DASH content is weighted toward the applied
and practical rather than the abstract and theoretical. Learning activities are
carefully sequenced to anticipate the cognitive and physical development of
children. For Teachers DASH will provide instructional materials that integrate
science, health, and technology, alternative instructional strategies for
teaching a heterogeneous populations of students, and instructional materials
that require minimal preparation time and are easy to organize and manage.
Twenty years of experience in developing science curricula at CRDG have provided
the grounding in theory and practice on which the instructional design of DASH
is based.
