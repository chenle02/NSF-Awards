This project lies at the interface of algebraic combinatorics and particle
physics. Combinatorics is the study of discrete structures (such as
permutations) and their classification and enumeration. Algebra is the study of
equations and their solutions. Algebraic combinatorics seeks to combine the two
subjects, solving algebraic problems using combinatorics, and vice versa. In
particle physics, one tries to model and predict outcomes of experiments
involving collisions of elementary particles. In recent years, such
calculations, called "scattering amplitudes", have been related to combinatorial
structures, called "positive geometries", appearing in algebraic combinatorics.
Roughly speaking, the combinatorics of positive geometries controls special
positions for elementary particles. This project aims to advance the field by
further improving our combinatorial understanding of positive geometries, and
establishing more robust relations with physics. The project provides research
training opportunities for graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
is in algebraic combinatorics. The PI aims to further study the recently defined
positive geometries and integral functions on these spaces. These functions have
applications to scattering amplitudes and to mirror symmetry, and include
special functions such as Beta functions and Bessel functions. One of the main
examples of positive geometries are totally positive spaces and the PI will
study the combinatorics and topology of these spaces. The PI will further
develop a program relating Langlands reciprocity to mirror symmetry for Fano
varieties. Finally, the PI will study the cohomology of cluster varieties, which
has applications to combinatorics (rational Catalan numbers) and representation
theory (higher extensions of Verma modules).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
