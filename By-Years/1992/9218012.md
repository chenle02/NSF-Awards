The Allegheny Observatory Trigonometric Parallax Program. The hallmark of the
astrometric program at the Allegheny Observatory is high precision,
approximately 0.001 arcsecond per parallax. Combining the Multichannel
Astrometric Photometer and the new optical system of the Thaw refractor, the
program has sufficient precision to obtain reliable trigonometric distances of
several open star clusters as well as other luminosity standards in most parts
of the Hertsprung-Russell diagram. Combined with data from a 70 year baseline
photographic plate collection, the MAP/Thaw system has sufficient precision to
define portions of the mass luminosity relationship previously outside of the
domain of trigonometric techniques, and to make significant improvements in our
understanding of the effects of age and chemical composition on the energy
output of stars.
