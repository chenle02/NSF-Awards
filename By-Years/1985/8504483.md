Long pulse relativistic electron beams (LPREB) have been studied for use in free
electron lasers, accelerator technology, and high power microwave systems.
Little work has been done, however, in examining LPREB for applications to
visible and ultraviolet (uv) gas laser systems. The purpose of the research is
to study the visible and near uv emission of LPREB produced plasmas using two
electron beam accelerators and to interpret these results using a rate equation
based computer model of the chemical kinetics. Time resolved visible and uv
emission spectroscopy of inert gas plasmas (He, Ar and Ne) will be performed on
two accelerators. One accelerator is the Febetron with voltage equalling 500 kV,
current equalling 1.4 kA, and pulse length 250 ns. The second accelerator is the
Michigan Electron Long Beam Accelerator (MELBA) with voltage of 1 MV, current of
10 kA, and pulse length of 1 us. The experiments vary pressure, current, and
voltage values, pulse length, and gas composition. Theoretical studies of
promising parametric regimes are planned with the computer model to optimize
particular results and to indicate the potential of LPREB for gas laser systems.
