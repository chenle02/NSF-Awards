The Department of Statistics at Colorado State University will purchase a
central server and two workstations dedicated to support research in time series
analysis, statistical inference, and statistical computing. The equipment will
be used for several research projects including those described below. 1.
Multivariate times series modelling using state-space techniques. 2. Automatic
data-driven bandwidth selection criteria will be evaluated in the multivariate
setting. 3. Confidence interval procedures for various functions of variances in
unbalanced variance components models will be studied. 4. Distribution-free
inference procedures in the linear model framework using permutation methods
will be investigated. A key component of this investigation will be the
development of a permutation package containing numerical and graphical
descriptive tools for implementing permutation methods for a broad class of
problems.
