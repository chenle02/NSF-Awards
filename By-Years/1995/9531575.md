9531575 Chakravarty This grant is a renewal of an ongoing program led by a mid-
career condensed matter theorist. The topics of interest in this grant are
Quantum Magnetism and non-Fermi liquid ground sates. In quantum magnetism, the
PI proposes to calculate the dynamic structure factor of a 2-dimensional quantum
antiferromagnet. The calculation will help understand the neutron scattering
measurements and provide insight into a special class of fermionic excitations
(spinons) at short wavelengths and high energies. Also planned is a study of the
materials which exhibit "colossal" magnetoresistance. The research on non-Fermi
liquids, using concept of scaling and effective fields, will involve
phenomenology and possible classification. %%% In a world where materials are
either metallic or nonmetallic, current research is converging on a class of
materials that show metallic character in resistivity but all of their other
properties (specific heat, magnetic susceptibility) are quite anomalous. This
grant will develop a phenomenological theory of such non-Fermi liquids. The
grant also includes work on quantum antiferromagnets in 2-dimension. As a
theoretical problem this addresses some outstanding questions since the PI's
earlier seminal contributions. ***
