The Courts of Appeals remain among the least comprehended of major federal
institutions. Despite the importance of these courts in setting national policy
and attention to their role in a number of particularistic studies, the absence
of analytic data across federal jurisdictions and over large spans of time has
limited our understanding of judicial decisionmaking and of the cases,
controversies, and outcomes of issues heard by these courts. Dr. Songer seeks to
advance scientific work on the Courts of Appeals through the development of a
multi-user data base. The resource will focus on the years 1925 through 1989 and
include both unpublished as well as published decisions. The sampling design
calls for approximately 40,000 cases across all twelve jurisdictions. In order
to insure the scientific utility of these data for many potential users, data on
a broad range of variables of theoretical significance (e.g., relating to votes,
decisions, issues, parties, and substance of the dispute) will be coded.
Substantial attention will be paid to coding reliability. Also, variables and
coding conventions will be compatible with existing large-scale data sets on the
Supreme Court and the federal district courts. A Board of Overseers comprised of
active researchers will provide guidance to Dr. Songer in the conduct of this
work. The data set will be archived and made available through the Inter-
university Consortium for Political and Social Research at the University of
Michigan. The creation of this data set is a major contribution to the field.
With the availability of this data set, new studies will be possible that might
otherwise be too expensive to undertake on an individual basis, and they can be
done with greater rigor and attention to rival hypotheses. Also, in conjunction
with extant data on other tiers of courts, this resource will comprise the most
comprehensive data base ever assembled and permit direct comparisons of judicial
decisionmaking and behavior across all three levels of the federal judicial
system.
