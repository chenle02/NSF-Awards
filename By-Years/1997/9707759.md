9707759 Henter The proposed research will examine the degree of local
adaptation in resource use within and between natural populations of a parasitic
insect over two different ecological scales. The investigator will determine
whether parasitoid populations are equally well adapted to 1) different beetle
host species on the same plant species, and 2) the same beetle host species on
different plant species. Quantitative genetic techniques will be used to test
the null hypothesis that the parasitoid Uscana semifumipennis is a generalist
across these environments. Reciprocal transplant experiments will allow
examination of the whole suite of characters involved in the parasitization
process. This information will be placed in an ecological context through
examination of the temporal distribution of the different hosts in their natural
environment. To understand the factors affecting parasitization, selection on
parasitoids by their hosts will be measured. This information will improve our
understanding of the evolutionary dynamics between host and parasitoid
populations, and will assist biological control workers and conservationists in
their assessment of the lability of host associations in entomophagous species.
