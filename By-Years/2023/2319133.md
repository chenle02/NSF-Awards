What can you see out of “the corner of your eye”? It is common for people to
think that peripheral vision is “bad” while central vision is “good”. After all,
we are almost constantly moving our eyes to bring different parts of the world
into our more-focused central field of view. But it may not be as simple as
that. Walking around with paper towel tubes limiting your view to only the
“good” central part, for example, would be challenging and frustrating. Instead,
this project considers the possibility that central and peripheral vision serve
different functional roles in visual perception more generally.

This work uses displays that change depending on where a person is looking to
isolate what part of the visual field people can see, and then to measure a wide
range of basic visual processes across the visual field. It is testing the
general hypothesis that central vision is perceptually organized, resulting in
representations of the world in terms of 3D objects and surfaces, whereas
peripheral vision is perceptually unorganized, resulting in 2D representations
that are more like textures than objects. This work can provide explanations for
different specific functional deficits that are experienced by individuals with
specific visual field loss, such as central loss from macular degeneration or
peripheral loss from glaucoma. This project is jointly funded by Perception,
Action and Cognition (PAC), the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive
Research (EPSCoR), and Smart and Connected Health (SCH).
