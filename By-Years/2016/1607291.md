A new window on the universe opened recently with the detection of gravitational
waves by the LIGO gravitational wave observatory. Other telescopes observe
electromagnetic waves (that includes visible light), and this new window will
give us quite different and complementary information. The work described here
seeks to understand better how to get the most information from these
gravitational wave observations. In particular, we study the very violent merger
of neutron stars and black holes to determine how the properties of these
systems are encoded in both gravitational and electromagnetic
waves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals supported by this award are to study the
dynamics of compact objects and the radiation they emit to capture the most
science possible from aLIGO and similar detectors. We will do so through
computational studies of binary systems incorporating magnetized matter with
resistive effects, realistic equations of state, electromagnetic and neutrino
emission, and r-process nucleosynthesis. Our efforts will include the following:
(i) We will determine gravitational waveforms from these binaries, with a focus
on observable imprints from the neutron star equation of state, mass, and
radius. (ii) We will investigate the construction of analytic and
phenomenological gravitational wave templates. (iii) We will study outflows from
merging binaries as an indicator of events with characteristic electromagnetic
and neutrino signals. (iv) We will study the global behavior of magnetic fields
and the electromagnetic emissions, such as jets, that originate in the
magnetosphere of coalescing binaries.
