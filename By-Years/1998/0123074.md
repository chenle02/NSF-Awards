The Emerging Mathematics, Engineering and Technology Scholars program supports
students who major in computer science, mathematics, engineering, or technology.
Students are chosen based on merit and need. The program provides enhanced
advising and financial support to assist in recruitment and retention. The
scholars join the NSF HBCU-UP, MARC (Minority Access to Research Careers) and
NASA scholars in the Emerging Caribbean Scientists (ECS) program for monthly
meetings which provide a support group for the
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
