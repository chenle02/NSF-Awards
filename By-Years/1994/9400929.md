ABSTRACT OPP-9400929 KINGSTON The overall goal of this anthropological research
is to understand the resilience of the King Island Inupiat as a distinct
indigenous community in Alaska. Although different acculturative processes have
led the King Islanders to move from their Bering Strait Island, a strong sense
of community and identity still exists and is particularly expressed by music
and dance traditions. These traditions are a repository of King Island history
and life. Archival film footage and oral history accounts will be used in
structured meetings with Native Elders in order to record and reclaim this
Alaska Native heritage. This study contributes to the development of
anthropological theory with reference to both the scientific use of film
archives, and understanding mediums of cultural continuity and change. ??
