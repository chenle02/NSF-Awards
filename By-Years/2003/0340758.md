Abstract: This award provides funding for research to develop the capability to
predict the occurrence, morphology and migration of natural megaripples in the
nearshore (water depth &lt; 8 m). In this region, complex combined flows and
turbulence dominate the transport of sediment. Megaripples (with heights of up
to 50 cm and lengths of 1-10 m) are ubiquitous, but they are poorly understood
and are not accounted for in models of sediment transport, wave transformation,
and nearshore circulation. The results of this study will help improve the
prediction of beach changes and beach erosion. This ADVANCE award is intended to
promote the career of a scientist who resigned from a previous job and moved due
to family responsibilities. In addition, the PI will involve undergraduates in
her research program and will provide an excellent role model for women in
science.
