9520635 Chung Development of crystalline carbon nitride coatings will be
attempted by seeding and epitaxial growth of alternating nano-scale layers of
nitride-based seeding materials and carbon nitride. The processing conditions
will be optimized and the coatings will be characterized in terms of
composition,structure, surface morphology, chemical bonding, and nano-
indentation hardness. Finally, the tribological properties of the coatings will
be determined. ***
