With this award, the Chemistry Division will support work in the curriculum
development area to be carried out by Dr. Seyhan N. Ege and Dr. Brian P. Coppola
of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Michigan. The award will be
used to help purchase instrumentation that will enhance the Department's
systematic change of its undergraduate chemistry curriculum. This change, which
began in 1989, offers new courses which emphasize process and method in addition
to content. The laboratory courses, in particular, from the very first term, are
structured with open-ended exercises and individualized problems to be solved.
The successful completion of these exercises requires that students have access
to modern instrumentation. It is believed that the project can be used as a
prototype for revitalization of chemical curriculum in the setting of a large
university.
