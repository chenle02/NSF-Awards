Antennas operating near or inside the human body are important for a number of
applications, including healthcare. Implantable medical devices such as cardiac
pacemakers and retinal implants are a growing feature of modern healthcare, and
implantable antennas for these devices are necessary to monitor battery level
and device health, to upload and download data used in patient monitoring, and
more. This project will create a UHF RFID tag antenna that can be inserted under
the skin for a permanent application. Ultra High Frequency (UHF) RFID tag
antennas are printed using conductive ink and have found increased applications
due to advantages such as minimal cost, low maintenance, good tag read range,
and ability to operate without an integrated battery. Despite their potential
use in long-term patient monitoring and wireless biometric tracking there is
limited research on UHF RFID for insertion in high-loss human body environments.
This research will greatly benefit from procedures already in place at Dr. You
Chung Chung's antenna lab at Daegu University in Daegu, Korea.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will use HFSS electromagnetic simulation
software to adapt existing slotline antennas from the High Frequency (HF) range
to the UHF range. Slotline antennas are easy to parameterize and fabricate for
RFID use. Promising simulation designs will be fabricated using conductive inks
such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Fabricated antenna designs will be
tested using available Network Analyzer equipment and liquids that simulate the
electromagnetic environment of the human body. Overall, this research will
contribute to implantable antenna research. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in
collaboration with National Research Foundation of Korea.
