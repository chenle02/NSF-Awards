0853467 &lt;br/&gt;Marshall&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research seeks to validate
the use of high resolution satellite sensing and a chemical transport model to
quantify ground-level NO2 concentrations in urban areas by completing a closure
analysis between the NO2 concentrations obtained by remote sensing and those
obtained by ground-level measurements. The variability in spatial and temporal
scales of the NO2 measurements and the parameters used to characterize urban
form/structure/transportation network will be included in the closure analysis.
The focus largely will be on the South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB) in Southern
California, owing to its large number of monitors and generally sunny climate
(low cloud-cover is important for satellite measurements) and to the extensive
body of work on air pollution in the SoCAB by project PI Marshall and many other
researchers.
