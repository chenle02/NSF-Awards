The Fellow will model geodetic data and crustal deformation associated with
active magmatic systems. Kilauea Volcano flows and deforms in response to many
complex magmatic and structural processes. Data collected since 1965 at the
Hawaii Volcano Observatory (HVO) includes inflation and deflation information of
summit magma-reservoir, dike injections along rift zones, and earthquakes
originating within the volcanic opening. The study expects to use the many
repeated measurements of distance, height, and tilt to establish average rates
of deformation, and then to solve for the generating structures and processes.
The Fellow plans to spend her fellowship tenure at the United States Geological
Survey at Flagstaff.
