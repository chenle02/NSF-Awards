9521359 Smyth Direct numerical simulations of turbulent patches representative
of those observed in the main thermocline will be conducted on massively
parallel machine. The goal of this study is to improve the interpretation of
exisitng one-dimensional microstructure observations and to plan future
experiments. In particular the sampling statistics of turbulent kinetic energy
and temperature variance dissipation rates, the degree of anisotropy of
turbulence and the variability of the mixing efficiency under various flow
conditions will be determined.
