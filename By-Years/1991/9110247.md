This is a proposal to lay the technological foundation for the development of a
state-of-the-art digital hearing aid for individuals with sensorineural hearing
impairments, especially those accompanied by "recruitment of loudness". The
research is to develop a digital signal processing system to compress speech in
order to compensate for the problem. The scheme, based on a model that breaks
speech into sinusoidal components, uses an adaptive algorithm with frequency
dependent gains and thresholds for the compensation. If successful, the research
will have a significant impact on the design of hearing aids.
