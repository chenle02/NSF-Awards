Fuzzing is an automatic software-testing technique that repeatedly injects a
randomly mutated input to a target program. Proven to be effective in finding
bugs in complex, real-world programs, fuzzing has become a core technique for
finding security vulnerabilities. There are now examples of major companies
building large-scale, distributed fuzzing infrastructure, which runs on hundreds
of virtual machines that relentlessly process over millions of test cases per
day. The performance of fuzzers is critical, as a faster, smarter fuzzer will
find more security bugs in the target program more
quickly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project takes a novel approach to fuzzing
performance by shortening the execution time of each fuzzing iteration by trying
to achieve more test coverage in a fixed time interval, whereas other approaches
focus on convergence to input sets that are more likely to trigger a
vulnerability. In the process, the project will overcome hidden scalability and
performance bottlenecks caused at the system software layers, such as operating
system and hypervisor. Such technical advances can bring significant saving of
the operation cost of fuzzing infrastructure and help developers to identify
more security bugs in open source and commercial software in a cost-effective
manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
