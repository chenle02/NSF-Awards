This project is intended to promote a new style of differential equations
instruction, one that emphasizes concepts and applications and one that involves
faculty members from both the mathematics and engineering communities. We will
share the results of the Boston University Differential Equations Project in
developing and implementing a radical revision of the traditional sophomore-
level differential equations course designed to achieve these goals. The project
will also feature presentations from an engineer who teaches courses that depend
heavily on the differential equations course. To emphasize the way in which
differential equations are used throughout a student's education, participants
will take part in collaborative activities in small groups that include both
engineering and mathematics faculty members. The goal is to promote a style of
differential equations instruction that better engages and serves students
throughout their college and professional careers.
