This dissertation research seeks to explain why the incidence of wildcat strikes
in the automobile industry declined from 1946 to 1974. The objectives are (1) to
describe local strikes occurring within the auto industry over this historical
period, (2) to look at changes in the industry itself as it is related to the
incidence of wildcat strikes, and (3) to see how changes in the way work was
organized might have affected the likelihood of strikes. The project will
contribute to an understanding of why and when strikes occur. It will also
result in an excellent data base on post World War II strikes in the U.S.
automobile industry.
