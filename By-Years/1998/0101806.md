The applied research project builds on the IMD funded "Where are We?" and poses
the following research questions:

Do students perform significantly better on real-world map tasks after using
WAW? What specific misconceptions and weaknesses remain widespread among
students after using the materials? How much improvement in student performance
on map skills tasks would be expected after using the curriculum? How can
teachers tell whether student learning has occurred? What is the relationship
between teachers' spatial abilities and the likelihood they would use the
materials?

The project will develop quantitative, reliable field-based assessments of map
skills and use them, along with other instruments, with three populations:
elementary students using the materials; children over the 7-15 age range who do
not uses the materials; and preservice elementary teachers. Results from these
assessments will be used in a redesign of the materials.
