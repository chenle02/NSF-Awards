This project is designed to complement and extend the thirteen year-old
academic year accelerated mathematics program already offered by the University
of Minnesota Talented Youth Mathematics program (UMTYMP) for both junior high
and senior high students. The project adds organized career exploration and
counseling, group and one-to one interaction with pure and applied
mathematicians, opportunities for intellectual exploration in an enriched
environment, and other supporting activities. The summer session, followed by
several academic year one day sessions, will emphasize individualized activities
related to mathematical problem solving, the use of computer support, and the
milieu of mathematics. Students will work on individualized problem solving
under the supervision of university professors, assisted by superior high school
teachers, will interact with each other on a mentor basis, and will meet with
working professionals. The design includes customized sessions for and on issues
facing professional women.
