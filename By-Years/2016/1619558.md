Truly ubiquitous computing with very small, self-powered and wirelessly
networked integrated circuits will become possible within a decade. Applications
of these devices include biosensors, environmental monitors, and defense, all of
which bring a need for security and privacy. Enabling the use of strong
cryptographic algorithms on extremely constrained devices requires rethinking,
from an energy-first perspective, the design and implementation of basic
cryptographic building blocks. The Secure Dust project seeks to reduce the
energy of cryptographic functions in advanced technologies by an order of
magnitude, and to validate the designs using test chips. The findings of this
project will help to secure future ubiquitous devices and the Internet of
Things.

The specific research objective of this project is to explore the scaling down
of security functions into advanced CMOS technologies and in particular the
important role of manufacturing variations and noise that can be both
advantageous (Physical Unclonable Functions and Random Number Generation) and
detrimental (side-channel resistant ciphers and hash functions) depending on the
cryptography block. We target an energy budget of picojoules per secure
transaction, built upon basic cryptography functions. The project combines
design expertise in lightweight cryptography using block ciphers, hash
functions, PUFs and RNGs, along with low-energy techniques and realistic
semiconductor design flows and economic realities. FPGA-prototyping and CMOS
FinFET test chips will be used to demonstrate complete cryptosystem
functionality, including side-channel susceptibility.
