The Center for Limnology's Trout Lake Station provides access to a region with
one of the densest concentrations of lakes in the world. Aquatic systems in this
region range from temporary ponds to large lakes and represent a broad diversity
of hydrologic, edaphic, and trophic conditions. Most of these systems lie within
protected watersheds with low population densities. The diversity of these
resources has led to an extensive history of aquatic research at the station.
Early work began with the pioneering comparative investigations of Birge and
Juday and was expanded upon by the whole-system experiments conducted by Hasler.
Current programs at Trout Lake include several multi investigator, ecosystem-
level investigations well as numerous smaller-scale projects involving
population and community ecology, hydrology, fisheries biology, and basic
limnology. Research activities at the station have undergone a major
improvements in both the physical plant and the research capabilities of the
station. This support will continue improvements in basic research capabilities.
Specifically, support will be provided for instrument systems (a dissolved
inorganic carbon, dissolved organic carbon analysis system; a dissolved oxygen,
multi-parameter water monitor; and a hydroacoustic, fish sensing system) which
will contribute substantially to the basic research capacity of the station.
These improvements will help meet the primary goal of maintaining the Trout Lake
Station as a national and inter- national center for aquatic research.
