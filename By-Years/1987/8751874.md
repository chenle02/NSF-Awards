This two-year project is targeted at teachers of biology in American Indian
junior and senior high schools. A total of twenty teachers will participate in a
6-week summer session that will include exposure to a molecular biology research
laboratory, lectures on current topics in biology, instruction in modern
laboratory methods, and discussion of effective teaching strategies. The
participants' interaction with American Indians who are successful in science,
including Poodry, will demonstrate by example that American Indian students can
succeed in science at the college level and beyond. Follow-up will consist of a
visit to each participant's school and a group meeting of all participants. The
University of California at Santa Cruz is contributing an amount in cost-sharing
that is equal to 12% of the NSF award.
