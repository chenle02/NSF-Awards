This project in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program addresses a number
of important issues in surface chemistry. During the tenure of this three-year
continuing grant, Professor Weinberg and his students will utilize molecular
beam scattering methods to examine the process of direct dissociative
chemisorption. Radical beam sources will be used to simulate high pressure
reaction conditions and the effects of electropositive promoters and
electronegative poisons on the course of reactions on transition metal surfaces
will be investigated. Monte Carlo methods will be used to study kinetic phase
transitions in reacting systems and oscillating surface reactions.
