The State of Louisiana proposes a Statewide Systemic Initiative to improve
mathematics, science and engineering education. This project, the Louisiana
Systemic Initiative Program (LaSIP), will be implemented through six
initiatives: (1) Pre-Service-- Curriculum for K-12 mathematics and science
teachers will be transformed in light of the new goals and standards; (2) In-
Service--Two NSF-funded projects for mathematics and science teachers will be
adopted statewide; (3) Teacher Certification-- Recommended modification of
certification for elementary and middle grades will be considered; (4)
Curriculum and Materials-- Mathematics and science curriculum guides and
materials will be updated and integrated; (5) Educational Technology--Current
uses will be expanded, and new uses will be evaluated and employed; and (6)
Professional Partners--Practitioners will make students aware of the role of
mathematics and science in careers. Cost sharing: 100%.
