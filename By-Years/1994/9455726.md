The Pacific Northwest Environmental Studies Program (PNESP) is an undergraduate
curricular collaboration among four Pacific Northwest higher education
institutions. The program addresses the need to prepare students to enter one of
the region's principal growth industries, environmental technology. This
academic partnership allows the participating schools to pool their resources,
field work opportunities and expertise to deliver a fully-transferable two-year
curriculum in more depth and with broader scope than is possible without the
collaboration. The curriculum development process includes both academic year
meetings and summer faculty development programs that engages faculty from all
participating campuses and involves professionals from the environmental
industry. Thus, the program fosters the concept of an environmental teaching,
learning, and service community among the faculty, students and industry
professionals. The PNESP opens an avenue of seamless transition for students
from precollege programs to upper division coursework. The PNESP core courses
also serve to prepare students to enter teacher education programs that are
aligned with Oregon's K-12 Natural Resource Systems Certificate of Advanced
Mastery. The PNESP curriculum of introductory courses and field experiences will
become the core element in environmental baccalaureate, associate and
certificate degree programs encompassing science, policy, technology, and
engineering on the participating campuses.
