9317874 Meikle In this study of wild house mice, the offspring of mothers that
always have food available will be compared to the offspring of mothers that are
fed on an intermittent basis. In addition to data on the rate of growth of
offspring, the project will yield information on offspring dominance ranks,
territorial behavior and choice of mates by daughters. Finally, the reproduction
of sons and daughters in small outdoor enclosures will be measured using a new
DNA fingerprinting technique. These results will provide the first detailed
information on how maternal nutritional state during pregnancy influences the
development, behavior and reproduction of offspring.%%% The study will help
resolve the controversy about whether maternal nutritional state has different
effects on the reproduction of sons and daughters in a mammalian species such as
house mice. The results also will yield information about the physiological
impact of maternal nutritional state that may be useful to animal breeders. In
addition, if these results are generalizable to other mammal species, they may
offer some insights into human development and behavior.***
