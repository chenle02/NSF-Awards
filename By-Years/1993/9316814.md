9316358 Ni This is a project to deploy a passive-source broadband seismic array
to complement the core reflection profiling experiment (INDEPTH II - a funded CD
project) across the Tsangpo Suture in Tibet. The array will be equipped with 12
broadband seismometers contributed by the P.I.'s German colleagues, and will
record for 8- 9 months beginning in May, 1994. Although the reflection profiling
experiment is expected to image the top of the underthrusting Indian Plate, the
behavior of the mantle part of the lithosphere is unknown. The anomalous
velocity structure of the upper mantle beneath southern Tibet can be imaged by a
passive-source PASSCAL-type experiment. The main objective of the proposed
broadband study is to search for the mantle downwelling beneath southern Tibet.
