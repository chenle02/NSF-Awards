ABSTRACT CTS-9714629 J. Schwank This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research
co-funded by the Kinetics and Catalysis and the Process and Reaction Engineering
programs. In this research, Professors Schwank and Kravaris will explore
scientific applications of micromachined hot-plate chemical reactors containing
catalytically active thin films. The ability to accurately control the film
temperature, independently from the gas phase temperature, will allow the
separate manipulation of heterogeneous and homogeneous reactions. The model
reaction to be studied is the selective oxidation of ethylene and propylene on
silver films. By maintaining a cold gas phase and a hot surface, the selectivity
towards partial oxidation products will be optimized. Arrays of microreactors
with independent surface composition and temperature control will be also
explored as a means to achieve spatially nonuniform but well controlled
temperature distributions. The control theory of nanoscale temperature-
controlled flow reactor will be explored, with the objective of maximizing
conversion and selectivity in a transient operating regime.
