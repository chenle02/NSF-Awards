The Scripps Oceanographic Data Facility (ODF) will continue a project to upgrade
shared-use equipment and increase the level of services that the Facility is
able to provide. Tasks include software development to automate sample data
logging, improve and further develop reliable and precision oxygen sensors on
CTD packages, improve CTD data processing capabilities, and upgrade the
calibration facility. Routine maintenance and upgrading of existing equipment
will also be accomplished to prepare for several funded and planned ocean
science field programs that will make use of ODF technicians and hardware.
