Martin J. Kelly IBN-9500239 Steroid hormones play central roles in many bodily
functions including neural development, reproduction, salt and water
homeostasis, response to environmental stressors, skeletal maintenance and
grmwth, and blood pressure to mention a few. It is generally agreed that the
actions of these powerful hormones are exerted by binding to intracellular
receptors which subsequently dimerize and bind to nuclear DNA where they act to
facilitate or inhibit gene transcription. These actions usually take hours to
days to be manifested. However, several electrophysiological and behavioral
studies have reported very rapid effects of these hormones, in the seconds to
minutes time frame. The rapid action of the hormones suggest that a nuclear site
of action is highly unlikely and is more consistent with the existence of
membrane bound G-protein-coupled receptors. Dr. Kelly has assembled a team of
skilled investigators, experienced in molecular biology, behavior and
electrophysiology to isolate and clone these novel steroid receptors for
estrogen and glucocorticoid hormones. Using the latest in expression cloning
strategies, this group proposes to isolate and characterize G-protein coupled
receptors for glucocorticoids and estrogen, to study the physiological role of
these novel receptors in cellular metabolism, to identify their natural ligands
and begin to design agonists and antagonists for future study. This proposal is
appropriate for a SGER award because these studies are novel and highly
exciting. Moreover, if successful, the outcome will revolutionize our
understanding of the mechanism of steroid hormones action and have major impacts
in the fields of neuroscience, endocrinology and behavior.
