This research will develop a new computer-based system for improving very
short-term prediction of aviation-sensitive weather parameters. The emphasis on
very short term predictions designed to meet the needs of aviation-oriented
weather prediction means that the "spin-up" period (often lasting 6-12 hours)
that is characteristic of previous operational numerical models must be
virtually eliminated. The development of an FDDA procedure will assimilate a
variety of conventional and remotely sensed observations into the governing
hydrodynamic system of equations of the high-resolution mesoscale numerical
model. This will include both short- and long-term strategies: 1) developing and
testing a suitable procedure for near-term operational implementation based
primarily on the widely tested Newtonian relaxation (nudging) technique, and 2)
perform basic and developmental research to explore the feasibility of the more
advance adjoint technique. The FDDA procedure, coupled with the mesoscale
numerical model and the statistical model, will be combined into a single
working system, which will then be tested on real data events and compared to
current operational aviation weather-sensitive products.
