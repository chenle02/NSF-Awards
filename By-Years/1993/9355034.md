9355034 Palmer Twenty members of Berkeley's Institute of Cognitive Studies
propose an integrated graduate research training program in the
interdisciplinary field of cognitive science with a focus on spatial cognition.
We request funds to support a five-year training program for five graduate
students to consist of both coursework and research on the theme of spatial
cognition, including spatial perception, language, and reasoning. Students will
we required to take a set of five basic lecture courses and a series of research
seminars to ensure adequate background knowledge in computer science,
linguistics, psychology, and biology on topics integral to research on spatial
cognition. Research training will occur as the trainees engage in research on
topics within a number of well-established projects at Berkeley on the theme of
spatial cognition, including: (l) cross-linguistic studies of lexical semantics,
(2) the nature of spatical and temporal metaphors, (3)the acquisition of spatial
language by children in different cultures, (4) the "psychophysics" of spatial
terms, (5) the biological basis of spatial cognition, (6) the representation of
spatial knowledge, (7) computational models for understanding, learning, and
producing spatial descriptions, and (8) biological aspects of spatial cognition
in animals and humans. Both faculty and trainees will take part in a series of
research seminars focusing on the results of these research projects. ***
