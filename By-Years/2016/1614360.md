Brain cancer is one of the most deadly forms of cancer due to the difficulties
involved in diagnosis and treatment. Treatments typically used against brain
cancer include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. More recently,
immunotherapy has been used in clinical trials against brain cancer cells where
the body?s own immune system can target cancer tumors. The brain, as part of the
central nervous system, has its own immune system with immune cells known as
microglia cells. Microglia cell activation has been seen to aid in regulating
brain activity and brain repair. This project will investigate the biology of
microglia cell activation on glioblastoma brain cancer tumors. The project will
be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Dong Woon Kim at Chungnam National
University in Daejeon, South Korea. This collaboration provides access to unique
data that will enable new insights into glioblastoma and immunology.

Microglia cell activation allows for immune response of the brain toward
diseased or infectious agents; however, limited research has been performed on
the biology of microglia activation on glioblastoma. This project will focus on
using microglial activation on glioblastoma as well as the more resistant
glioblastoma population known as glioblastoma stem cells. By the combined
culture of glioblastoma cells with microglia cells, microglia cell activation
will be observed through gene expression. Furthermore, glioblastoma stem cell
expression will be tested under microglia activation. This project will allow
for greater understanding of brain immunology in glioblastoma and as a potential
aid in better cancer therapies.

This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports
summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the
National Research Foundation of Korea.
