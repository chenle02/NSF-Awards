In this study, the investigators will address the problem of atmospheric
predictability and forecast skill from a phenomenological perspective.
Predictability will be analyzed and interpreted in terms of the ability of
operational global numerical weather prediction models to forecast the evolution
of high-impact weather systems, the large-scale flows in which these are
embedded, and the transitions between large-scale flow systems that occur in
conjunction with the evolution of selected weather systems. In samples taken
from high-resolution ensemble forecasts, case studies for two types of
interactions will be diagnosed: tropical-extratropical interactions and arctic-
extratropical interactions. In particular, this research will address the
physical aspects of the different evolution of ensemble members in the ensemble
forecast system. Two graduate students will be involved in this project. The
results of this research are expected to translate into improved long-term
outlooks and short-term forecasts of high-impact weather events, thereby
benefiting operational forecasting and societal activities.
