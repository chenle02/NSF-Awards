This award will support a two-year cooperative research project involving
Professor Raphael M. Ottenbrite, Department of Chemistry, Virginia Commonwealth
University; Professor Michael Sobel, Medical College of Virginia; and Professor
Junzo Sunamoto, Department of Polymer Chemistry, Kyoto University, Japan. Their
past efforts have produced a unique approach to delivering antitumor polyanionic
polymers by using polysaccharide-coated liposomes as masking agents. Their
research is a collaborative, interdisciplinary effort intended to continue to
develop new and better polymers which will provide less toxic and more active
agents, to develop new and better liposomes and carriers to improve the
biological success currently achieved, and finally to evaluate this combination
immunostimulator and delivery system with in- vitro and possibly in-vivo
experiments. Professor Ottenbrite is well known for his work in the area of
polymer synthesis. Professor Sobel is a biochemist with expertise in cell
membranes and their role in the assimilation of materials into the cell.
Professor Sunamoto is an expert in the area of liposomal encapsulation. Their
joint efforts should result in the development of new knowledge which could
ultimately lead to viable new methods of immunotherapy.
