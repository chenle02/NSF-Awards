The selective absorption in packed columns H;i2S and CO;i2 from natural,
synthesis, and refinery gas streams into tertiary alkanolamines is investigated.
The project objectives include: investigation of the use of cross-flow
hydrodynamic models to describe chemical absorption/stripping in packed columns;
a re-examination of existing hydrodynamic models for packed columns/beds through
salt tracer experiments and the understanding of their relationship to mass
transfer through C140;i2 tracer experiments; development of process models for
chemical absorption/stripping in packed columns that are sufficiently rigorous
to predict selectivity as well as being computationally efficient; and
experimental verification of process models with a laboratory packed column.
