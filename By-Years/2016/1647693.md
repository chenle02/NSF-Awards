The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves a disruptive change to the solar energy
industry by potentially doubling the efficiency of the best available solar
cells while, at the same time, significantly reducing their cost. Renewable
energy sources are critical to energy independence and, importantly, to the
long-term viability of human society which is faced with the inevitable
depletion of hydrocarbon based energy sources, such as oil, gas, and coal.

The proposed project leverages known technologies that are used in physics
research, specifically in high energy physics accelerators, such as those found
in Fermi National Accelerator Lab or at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The
approach is based on using thermo-ionic emission from metals as the source of
electric power, in contrast to existing technologies that only use photo-
generated currents from more expensive semiconductors. This shift can provide
not only higher efficiency, but also a shorter "return-on-energy" which is
defined as the time it takes for the device to produce as much energy as was
used in its production. The project goal is to demonstrate this new approach by
producing a cell that can produce electricity with high efficiency and be
measured and evaluated independently by a standards laboratory to validate its
result. From this starting point, device optimization and further development
will provide a new competing approach to energy independence.
