Walter Neumann will continue his study (previously supported by DMS-8805551) of
the topology of complex curves and surfaces and their singularities and of the
geometry and arithmetic of low-dimensional manifolds. Alan Reid will study
arithmetic and geometric aspects of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, with special
emphasis on questions of existence of incompressible surfaces, isospectrality,
special arithmetic and geometric properties of knot complements, and the Lehmer
conjecture. Low-dimensional manifolds are very natural geometric objects and
deserve to be thoroughly understood. The physical world is a 3-dimensional or
4-dimensional manifold, depending upon whether one includes the time dimension.
Hyperbolic metrics are in some ways more natural than Euclidean metrics, even
through locally our world appears to be Euclidean.
