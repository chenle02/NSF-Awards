Professor Carey will continue his work in operator theory concerning principal
currents, local index, and Fredholm reciprocity in multivariable spectral
theory. For operator rings of type II, this work involves relationships between
determinant theory in operator algebras and plurisubharmonic functions. This
project concerns Hilbert space operators which can be thought of as infinite
matrices of complex numbers. Professor Carey's project will focus on a more
geometric way of looking at these operators. The ultimate goal is to be able to
classify and obtain a deeper understanding of large families of these objects,
for they are important in almost all branches of pure and applied mathematics.
