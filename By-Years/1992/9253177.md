This project is a one year planning program that will lead to the submission of
a proposal from Old Dominion University for a Teacher Enhancement Institute to
serve middle-school biology teachers from the Hampton Roads Region of the state
of Virginia. The planning process will be facilitated by a Planning Committee
with representation from the university and regional medical institutions,
regional school districts, and regional biotechnology industries. The specific
content area to be addressed will be the integration of mathematics and biology
as applied via biotechnology. Cost sharing equals 45% of the NSF award.
