This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2). Humberto Gilmer is awarded an NSF Mathematical and
Physical Sciences Ascending Postdoctoral Research Fellowship to conduct a
program of research and activities related to broadening participation by groups
underrepresented in STEM. This fellowship to Dr. Gilmer supports his research
project entitled " MPS-Ascend: Superfluid Dark Matter: Unveiling the Dark Sector
of the Cosmos", under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The host
institution for the fellowship is Brown University and the sponsoring scientist
is Dr. Stephon Alexander.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Gilmer will explore a study a
model of self-interacting dark matter which will provide an understanding of how
dark matter mediates the gravitational interaction on galactic length scales,
resolving the discrepancies present in the Standard Model of cosmology. Gilmer
will also work to increase the participation of historically excluded minority
students in the Providence, RI area through the creation of an Arts in STEM
program at Brown University. This program will provide participants with
knowledge of opportunities in STEM and a sense of science
identity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
