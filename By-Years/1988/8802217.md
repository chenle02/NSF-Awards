This project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
is concerned with the chemistry of the so-called post transition elements, which
include selenium, tellurium, arsenic and tin. Anionic clusters of these
elements, i.e. clusters of atoms with negative charges, have been known for some
time, but little is known about the chemistry of these clusters. The focus of
the project is the reactions of these clusters with transition metals, such as
chromium and niobium, to form a variety of unusual new mixed-element clusters.
The new species are of interest because they are soluble precursors of new
materials, and because they pose interesting challenges to existing bonding
theories. The reactions of post transition element cluster anions, such as the
triselenide, the tetratelluride and the nonastannide ions, with transition metal
complexes will be investigated. The goal is to prepare new cluster anions
containing both transition and main group elements. Strategies will be developed
for stabilizing the cluster anions in solution, such as the introduction of
carbon as a heterovertex atom. For the preparation of the target clusters the
reactions of main group anionic clusters with transition metal halides and with
a variety of organometallic compounds will be investigated.
