9602542 McCoy Under this award, twelve American researchers will be brought
together in a workshop with Australian physicists and mathematicians to exchange
the most recent research developments and to establish the basis for future
joint research in statistical mechanics and integrable systems. The workshop
will be held near Brisbane immediately following the Congress of the
International Association of Mathematical Physicists. The principal organizers
of the workshop are Professor Barry McCoy of the State University of New York at
Stony Brook and Professor Rodney Baxter of the Research School of Physical
Sciences of the Australian National University.
