The State University of New York at Stony Brook is awarded a grant to improve
sequence assembly for high-throughput sequencing technologies. Significantly
cheaper de novo sequencing technologies must be developed to fully understand
the diversity of life. Although the technologies currently being developed focus
on the easier problem of resequencing to study genomic variation, the
investigators are convinced that coupling them with significant advances in
computational sequence assembly has the potential to dramatically reduce the
cost of de novo sequencing as well. They propose to build assembly programs for
sequencing technologies slated to become commercially available over the next
one to three years. Certain technologies achieve their cost efficiency by
producing massive numbers of very short reads cheaply, while others provide
extremely long reads (albeit with high error rates). The intellectual merit of
the proposed research lies in the application of mathematical analysis,
algorithm design, and software implementation to the assembly problem for these
new sequencing technologies. Broader impacts of the proposed research include
the significant biotechnical, economic, and scientific advances which result
from reducing the costs of de novo genome sequencing, and educational
opportunities for undergraduate, graduate, and interdisciplinary students.
