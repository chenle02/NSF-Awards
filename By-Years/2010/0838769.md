Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through modeling and data assimilation studies,
University of Washington researchers seek to reconcile information on Antarctic
sea ice and its interaction with the upper ocean and the atmosphere, throughout
the modern era of satellite observation (1979 to present). Links to changes and
variability in Antarctic climate postulated in terms of the patterns observed in
the Southern Annular Mode, mechanisms of likely positive trends in Antarctic sea
ice extent in an otherwise warming climate, and estimates of how the Antarctic
ice-ocean system may respond to changing atmospheric circulation will be
considered. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The model to be used in the study is the
Global Ice-Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (GIOMAS;
http://psc.apl.washington.edu/zhang/Global_seaice), a coupled global
ocean/ice/atmosphere model. Technical improvements to this model include an
update of the GIOMAS model physics appropriate to the Antarctic ice-ocean
system; use of NCEP/NCAR and ERA-40 reanalysis data to drive atmospheric
forcing, and, through numerical experiments, estimates of parameters such
Antarctic sea ice thickness, open water, snow depth, surface temperatures etc of
interest to the climate and ecosystem research communities will be
made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"This award is funded under the American Recovery and
