Research will be carried out in the area of nuclear reaction studies using a
radioactive beam of Li-8. Information which is important to understanding
nucleosynthesis will be provided. In addition, studies of heavy ion collisions
will be carried out towards the end of providing improved information on nuclear
deformation. Undergraduates will be involved in this research.
