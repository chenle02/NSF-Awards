The University of Southern California will hold an international workshop
focused on convergence education where representatives from multiple stakeholder
communities will share insights about the impact of the evolving nature of STEM
education and workforce development. The workshop will assess the status and
importance of convergence education on all levels globally, describe how
convergence and responsible science are being developed in other countries,
propose strategies to address emerging convergence education topics and changing
workforce needs, and discuss how convergence education can broaden participation
in the Stem workforce. The workshop will be used to produce a report with
actionable recommendations and prioritization for stakeholder responses that
respond to recent national policy and research reports. The workshop supports
the National Science Foundation Big Idea "Growing Convergent Research".
