Plant seeds are important, renewable sources of natural products such as oil,
protein, starch and fiber. Though the biosynthetic pathways for these storage
compounds are mostly known it is not clear how these pathways are regulated in
oilseeds which produce higher quantities of oil and protein. Quantitation and
identification of proteins expressed at multiple stages during embryo
development of four diverse oilseeds will systematically reveal the dynamics of
protein networks responsible for oil and protein accumulation in four diverse
oilseeds. Public dissemination of these data in multiple, user-intuitive formats
will provide new directions for the scientific community to engineer seed
metabolism for the benefit of health and environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
website will be open for viewing within the first year of the proposal and will
include both one- and two-dimensional gels of membrane and total proteins,
respectively, from various stages of oilseed development (within first two-three
years of the proposal). Identification of proteins will commence with the
purchase of a tandem mass spectrometer in the third year of funding. Identities
of the first 300 protein spots (project goal of 500-600) of Arabidopsis and
oilseed rape will be posted to the website by the end of the third year support
and prior to publication. Identification of 450-500 castor and soybean proteins
will also commence in the third year of funding with a projected release date to
begin in year four. Manual de novo sequencing of unidentified proteins and
potential post-translationally modified proteins will be the subject of research
for year five.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
