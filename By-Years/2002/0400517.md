This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial biology for
FY2004. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden their scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Analysis of how microorganisms
survive while starving." When starved, eukaryotic cells use multiple strategies
to survive. One of these is macroautophagy, a process by which the contents of
the cell are recycled. This process has been characterized in the microbe
Dictyostelium discoideum. The goal of this project is to identify factors
involved in microbial macroautophagy.
