he UCNA project has essentially completed construction of
their&lt;br/&gt;experiment to measure the beta-asymmetry in the decay of the
neutron&lt;br/&gt;using ultracold neutrons (UCN). The UCN source developed for
this&lt;br/&gt;measurement, a solid-deuterium superthermal source coupled to
a&lt;br/&gt;spallation target at the 800 MeV proton beam at LANSCE, is the
first&lt;br/&gt;such source to be constructed. When fully operational, this
source&lt;br/&gt;promises ample UCN for the first measurements of the beta-
asymmetry. &lt;br/&gt;The preliminary goal of the UCNA collaboration is a
measurement of the&lt;br/&gt;beta-asymmetry to a precision of 0.2 percent.
During the next funding&lt;br/&gt;period, we plan to refine this measurement,
increasing the precision of&lt;br/&gt;the beta-asymmetry (in part by
implementing several different beta&lt;br/&gt;detection systems) and initiating
a program to measure the other&lt;br/&gt;angular correlations involving
detection of the recoil proton following&lt;br/&gt;beta-decay. The existence of
this new source will also make possible&lt;br/&gt;the investigation of new uses
of UCN for both fundamental and applied&lt;br/&gt;physics
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
