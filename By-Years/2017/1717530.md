This work aims to develop mathematical laws and foundational principles for
belief sharing in systems with human and machine intelligence working together
to make robust decisions. Prior work in statistical signal processing and in
psychology has only considered technological limitations or human limitations
independently, but jointly considering informational limitations of both humans
and machines is critical in engineering future sociotechnical systems,
especially when people are overwhelmed by too much information. A theory for
fundamental limits and optimal designs for such systems is
lacking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rather than systems with agents sharing either raw
data or local decisions, we develop intermediate designs based on sharing
beliefs. Belief sharing increases modularity among networked units compared to
central analysis of raw data, yet also strengthens coordination compared to
decentralized local decisions. We build on our prior bounded rationality models
of people and stochastic models of artificial intelligence to determine optimal
mixed human-machine architectures. First, we find fundamental information-
theoretic limits of belief-sharing under Bayes risk and discrete choice models,
new kinds of CEO problems. As a key substep, this involves determining
fundamental Ziv-Zakai bounds on Bayesian estimation under non-quadratic
criteria. We then use quantization and decision theory to develop optimal
architectures that have cognitively- and algorithmically-limited agents,
including optimal categorization of beliefs and judgment pooling rules taking
human behavior into account. Finally, we consider the language needed to
communicate beliefs in complicated network structures to achieve collective
intelligence, studying Nash equilibria balancing focal and shared concerns.
