This project will investigate aspects of a class of reinforcement learning
algorithms based on dynamic programming (DP). Although these algorithms have
been widely studied and have been experimented with in many applications, their
theory is not developed enough to permit a clear understanding of the classes of
problems for which they may be the methods of choice, or to guide their
application. Research at the University of Massachusetts has made considerable
recent progress in relating these methods to the most closely related
conventional methods and in understanding the factors that influence their
performance, both successful and unsuccessful. These methods may provide the
only computationally feasible approaches to very large and analytically
intractable sequential decision problems. The objectives of this project are: 1)
to continue development of DP-based reinforcement learning methods an their
theory, 2) to investigate their computational complexity, and 3) to define the
characteristics of problems for which they are best suited.
