This project examines the development of the science of cosmology in order to
contribute to the growing understanding of the dynamics of science
popularization, and in the process further undermine the still-prevalent notion
of science as Kuhnian problem solving punctuated by periods of revolution. The
project looks at the development of the science of cosmology as the result of
the interaction of discourse between the big bang cosmologists and steady state
cosmologists in three forums or arenas of discussion -- a cosmologist's forum, a
physical science forum, and a public or popular science forum.
