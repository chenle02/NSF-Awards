This grant will provide student travel fellowships to the 2019 American
Ecological Engineering Society (AEES) annual meeting, as well as to provide
facilities for a student-oriented poster session and career networking event
there. This funding will supplement AEES' ongoing efforts to engage students in
the society and the discipline more broadly. The AEES annual meeting is the
premier venue for ecological engineers to present new work to their colleagues
and garner valuable feedback on their research. It allows researchers to hear
about the latest discoveries, trends, and challenges in the field and related
disciplines, and make connections that enhance their research programs through
interactions with colleagues from different institutions around the country and
world. Feedback collected from students supported by travel fellowships will be
used to better understand how the discipline is perceived by the next generation
of ecological engineers.

The AEES meeting will have approximately 170- 200 attendees; approximately half
are expected to be undergraduate or graduate students studying fields related to
ecological engineering. To increase the overall diversity at the meeting and
within the discipline, student travel fellowships will be awarded to prioritize
attendance by under-represented institutions and geographic regions. Through the
networking session to be supported through requested funds, students will have
the opportunity to interact with faculty and industry professionals working in
the field of ecological engineering. Anticipated outcomes of this session
include expanding student mentoring/professional networks and exposing them a
variety of career pathways.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
