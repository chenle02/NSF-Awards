9707802 McFadyen This activity focuses on providing opportunities for senior
engineering students in Biological Engineering to design and construct devices
and aids for students with disabilities at the university. These design projects
will be incorporated into the senior design course sequence, which all students
in Biological Engineering are required to take. The design projects will be
developed to meet explicit needs that will be identified each semester for
persons with disabilities. This activity would involve ten projects per year for
a period of five years. Examples of projects to be implemented during the first
year include: (1) a footmouse, a device to allow operation of a computer more
efficiently for individuals with some nerve related disabilities which have
difficulty operating a standard computer mouse, (2) a device to enable
wheelchair users with cognitive impairments to improve their ability to control
the movement of a power wheelchair, (3) an automated wheelchair guidance and
tracking system to control the movement of a power wheelchair within a confined
environment, (4) a wireless telephone handset to allow a wheelchair user to move
freely about a room while talking on a telephone, and (5) a low cost scientific
calculator with voice output to aid visually impaired individuals. ***
