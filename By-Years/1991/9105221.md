The principal investigator will study some problems in algebraic geometry
related to partial differential equations. Systems of partial differential
equations may be formulated as an integrable system. The solutions of the
partial differential equation are realized as integrable manifolds of the
system. It is this formulation of systems of partial differential equations
which makes the application of methods from algebraic geometry possible. Systems
of partial differential equations play an important role in models of physical
systems. An important example is in the area of control theory in which one
would like to guide an object along a desired trajectory. The system of partial
differential equations used to model this situation can be formulated as an
integrable system. The research supported by this award should be particularly
useful in studying this problem.
