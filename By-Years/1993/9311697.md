The propose work will address two interrelated issues: undesired plasma based
particle generation and plasma created damage to underlying devices. Both
proposed studies strongly impact the yield of working die in manufacturing and
share the common issues of a plasma environment. The initial focus will be in
plasma ashing of polymer photoresist which occurs 10 - 15 times in the
manufacturing cycle and is therefore leveraged to productivity. In-situ plasma
conditions as measured by optical methods will be correlated with post-process
particle distributions on wafers as well as plasma damage to device structures.
If successful to results will allow higher yields and greater productivity in
the production of semiconductor devices.
