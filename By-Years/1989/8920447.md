This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of Dr.
Christopher J. Abelt at the College of William and Mary, who is studying the
light-induced transfer of electrons between molecules that are held in
constrained orientations. This investigation will provide fundamental
information on the mechanism of electron transfer between reacting species. The
experiments to be conducted by Dr. Abelt will employ chemically modified
cyclodextrins having cyanoanthracene substituents that can initiate photoinduced
electron-transfer reactions. Treatment of these derivatives with aromatic amines
will result in binding of the latter within the molecular cavity of the
cyclodextrin, and irradiation of the resulting host-guest complexes will
initiate the electron transfer process. The studies will define the relationship
of charge-transfer interaction with binding of the aromatic amines and will
allow Dr. Abelt to determine the effectiveness of differently substituted
cyclodextrins in carrying out photoinduced electron-transfer reactions of bound
guests.
