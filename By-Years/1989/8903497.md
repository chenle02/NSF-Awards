Certain features in large layered intrusions suggest that infiltration-driven
metasomatic reactions or other post- solidification processes have played a
central role in influencing the final distribution of mineral and chemical
components. Features of this kind, recently recognized in the Skaergaard
Intrusion, include: a. concretion-like masses of mafic minerals in a felsic
matrix; b. irregularly shaped residual islands of earlier rock within a more
felsic recrystallized domain; and c. multiply-fingered dendrites of plagioclase-
rich rock within a more iron-rich matrix. Phenomena of this kind have also been
observed in recent simulations of the reaction/transport equations for water-
rock systems. We propose to use modeling to explain the origins of these
recrystallization phenomena and to predict other possible post- solidification
transformations. Processes to be accounted for in these simulations include
grain growth and dissolution, solute diffusion and infiltration transport, fluid
flow, and pressure solution. Because our models show that these phenomena occur
under well-defined conditions, we shall use the results of the models to
interpret commonly observed features in the Skaergaard and other large layered
intrusions.
