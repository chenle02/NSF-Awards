SMART Utah is bringing 22 professionals with strong mathematical backgrounds and
an interest in teaching into the profession in a manner that helps bridge the
obstacles in making the transition: bringing the Fellows under supervised
mentoring to the level of master teachers, while meeting the needs of districts
to increase the number of quality math teachers. The collaborating entities are:
the University of Utah Department of Mathematics and College of Education; the
Utah State University departments of Mathematics and Teacher Education and
Leadership; the Division of Teacher Quality and Licensure at the Utah State
Office of Education; Math for America (MfA); the Park City Mathematics Institute
(PCMI); and the Jordan, Granite, Salt Lake and San Juan school districts. The
bases of the program are: in-depth understanding of mathematical content,
connections between various mathematical areas, and connections between
mathematics and other disciplines; pedagogical training that is content-driven,
flexible and inclusive; permanent professional learning communities in the
schools where teachers can continually extend their learning. On these bases,
teachers can transmit important mathematical understandings to their students,
transforming their classes into learning communities as well. Through
participation in the Park City Mathematics Institute, the Fellows are exposed to
current mathematical research and to research in mathematics education as an
integral part of their professional development. Through lesson study they
undertake building of instruction informed by their teaching practices, and the
feedback they receive from both their peers and students. Through the
established distance-learning program at USU, with satellite sites throughout
the state, the project is impacting teachers and prospective teachers state-
wide. The project interacts with a mathematics education center in San Juan
county, serving the Navajo and Ute nations in Utah.
