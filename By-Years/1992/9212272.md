The PI proposes to purchase a ASAP 2000 MicroPore sorptometer (an adsorption
porosimeter) from Micromeritics. The instrument measures the surface area, pore
volume, and micropore (20 A) and mesopore (20-500 A) size distribution of a
porous solid sample based on the physical adsorption of N2. A volumetric method
is used to measure the adsorption and desorption isotherms over a large pressure
range, and from these the pore characteristics of the material can be
calculated. The PI will use this instrument in his research on the sol-gel
preparation of ceramic membranes. In particular this instrument will allow for
(1) the elucidation of the effects of sintering temperature and hostile
processing environment on the pore structure al alumina, zirconia and titantia
membranes, (2) examination of pore structures of hydrothermally stable
separation membranes made of silica- alumina or silica magnesia binary systems
and (3) establishing pore structures in alumina, zirconia and titania membranes
doped with materials to improve their thermal stability. The advanced ceramic
membranes that the PI is researching have many potential applications,
especially in the gas separations area, and the porosimeter is essential for
characterizing these membranes.
