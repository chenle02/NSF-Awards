Work will concentrate primarily on problems arising in real, complex and matrix
valued orthogonal polynomials. This includes an analysis of polynomials and
associated quantities such as higher order derivatives, Christoffel functions,
Cotes numbers and roots of orthogonal polynomials at singular points of the
support of the measure (which determines the orthogonality). Related work will
also look at points where the absolutely continuous component of the measure
vanishes and the nature of these quantities near the endpoints of support.
Applications of this work will be made to tail estimates of statistical
distributions. When orthogonal polynomials are given as eigenfunctions of Jacobi
matrices, the corresponding measure is the spectral measure of the matrix. The
logarithmic integrability of the absolutely continuous component of the measure
(Szego's condition) is not controllable. A major goal of this project is to find
necessary and sufficient conditions on the matrix so that the integrability
condition will be satisfied. Examples of compact perturbations of constant
Jacobi matrices having purely singular spectral measures have been discovered.
Work is progressing on the relevant inverse question: to find conditions on any
spectral measure to see if it arises from a compact perturbation of a constant
Jacobi matrix. Efforts will also be made in extending the classical Szego theory
to take in the case of measures supported on curves in the complex plane, to
study the behavior of orthogonal polynomials in classical Lebesgue spaces
(rather than pointwise) and to continue research on relating coefficients in
three-term recursive definitions of polynomials with the corresponding spectral
measures. Applications to least square prediction theory of discrete- time
theory stationary stochastic processes and signal processing are planned.
