Future Internet backbones will have a two-layered architecture: MPLS-capable IP
network on top of WDM-based optical network, where the optical layer offers
ultra-high bandwidth and the IP layer provides quality of service and traffic
engineering capabilities. As businesses and individuals increasingly rely on
computer networks to carry mission-critical traffic and real-time traffic,
survivability must be a key ingredient of the future Optical Internet. In this
project we will investigate various resilience schemes that enable IP over WDM
networks to recover from network component failures with minimum service
disruption and with efficient use of network resources. &lt;br/&gt;The research
work will focus on:&lt;br/&gt; Developing intelligent optical layer lightpath
protection/restoration methods for dealing with single/multiple network
failures; &lt;br/&gt; Developing a new scalable IP layer resilience framework
that enbles fast IP flow restoration with low packet loss; &lt;br/&gt;
Developing algorithms for dynamically enhancing capacity and connectivity of
logical topology to combat congestion and network partition caused by network
failures; &lt;br/&gt; Understanding various tradeoffs among restoration speed,
spare capacity requirement, and algorithm/protocol complexity;
&lt;br/&gt;Investigating whether handling multiple network failures requires
significant amount of extra control complexity and network resources compared
with handing single network failures. Performance of the developed algorithms
and protocols will be evaluated via simulations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
research efforts will have a significant impact on the evolution of the future
survivable optical Internet. The education part of the program is centered
around motivating both graduate and undergraduate students to participate in
networking research and training students to conduct quality research in the
networking area. The findings of this research will be included in class
materials and seminars. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
