This project provides equipment to support research projects related to problems
of noise and vibration control. The equipment comprises a GenRad 2515 Computer-
Aided Test System and related testing analysis software. Its capabilities
include modal analysis, signal analysis, acoustic intensity measurements, and
rotating machinery testing. Two current projects will utilize the equipment. The
first is entitled Measurement Based Models for Acoustic Response. The project is
directed towards the control of noise in machines, transportation vehicles, and
the workspace. It requires experimental multi channel signal processing and
analysis to facilitate the accurate analytical modeling of a sound field and its
sources. The procedure decomposes the sound field into its propagating energy
bearing portion and the standing wave reactive portion. The second project is
entitled Structural Acoustic Modal Analysis. Its focus will be the vibration of
structures and machines, and their acoustic radiation. An experimental modal
analysis is conducted to obtain a mechanical system's modal properties, natural
frequencies, mode shapes, and damping characteristics. Furthermore, the surface
acoustic intensity field is also measured with the equipment. These measurements
are used to define the dynamic response and the sound radiation resulting from
each mode of the structural response. Structural modifications using
optimization techniques are applied to the model to predict new structural and
acoustic responses and to assist in the structure/acoustics design process.
