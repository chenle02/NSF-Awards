This grant supports equipment needed for characterizing mechanical behavior of
advanced structural materials, specifically in the areas of dynamic, high-rate
fracture characterization and damage detection. The equipment consists of (1) a
Dynatup instrumented low/high-velocity impact test system with an integrated
environmental chamber and (2) a Panametrics ultrasonic scanning system. When
integrated with the existing facilities, these instruments provide a direct and
immediate benefit to faculty and graduate and undergraduate students in the
Mechanical Engineering and Civil Engineering Departments in their materials-
related research and education activities. The equipment will be integrated into
several courses at both the undergraduate and graduate levels providing hands-on
training and exposure to advanced materials characterization and evaluation
methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A significant area of concern when designing
advanced structural materials for critical components is their durability and
damage tolerance under a variety of loading and environmental conditions. The
survivability of advanced materials must be fully understood before they can be
utilized. Impact events, including high-velocity loading (ballistic projectiles)
and low-velocity events (e.g., tool drops, bird strikes, hail damage, etc.) are
of particular concern, as they can cause damage not visible on the surface, but
which can result in significant degradation of performance. Full
characterization of the response of materials to impact loading requires the
capacity to experimentally generate controlled impact conditions as well as the
ability to quantitatively measure the extent and growth of internal damage
resulting from this dynamic form of
loading.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
