Szymanski 9320264 The award will support interdisciplinary research on
simulating ecological systems on massively parallel computers. The
investigations include formalization of a probabilistic ecological model, design
of software tools for model implementation and prototyping the developed
software on sample applications. The software will model the impact of vector-
borne disease on a small community. The model involves interactions among four
species: two hosts, a parasite, and a pathogen. This award is being jointly
supported by the Ecology Program and the Computational Biology Activities
program. ***
