9313510 Hemberger Roanoke College has been recognized as one of the most rapidly
improving undergraduate programs in the South, as evidenced by recent increases
in the quality of its applicants and the research accomplishments of its
faculty, especially in the sciences. The number of declared science majors at
Roanoke College has increased by 27%, which stands in stark contrast to the
downward national trend. Student involvement with faculty research is
commonplace. The Science Center complex at Roanoke College is a five- story,
120,000 square foot structure that houses the College's scientific research and
research training activities. Since its construction in 1971, research labs in
the complex have suffered from ground water infiltration, and the building's
ventilation, plumbing, and electrical systems have aged to a point that they no
longer serve the rapidly growing science program. The proposed renovation will
address these problems, thereby enabling the College to 1) support the research
activities of its faculty, 2) provide suitable environments for research
equipment, 3) offer research training as a part of undergraduate coursework, 4)
create opportunities for joint student- faculty research, and 5) attract
students to careers in science. ***
