The logographic writing system of the Micmac Indians of the Atlantic coast of
Canada will be analyzed in its linguistic, historical, and functional contexts.
This research is significant for two important reasons: (1) it is the only
indigenous writing system in North America; and (2) it has never been completely
deciphered. Particular emphasis will be placed on secular uses of the script in
personal messages, legal documents, declarations of war, and dairies. The
system's evolution from a traditional symbology, and the possibility of a
precontact written language will be explored. Also to be investigated will be
the role hieroglyphic literacy played in the establishment, growth, and
maintenance of Catholicism among Micmacs.
