A Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer will be used in upper level
undergraduate laboratories in analytical and physical chemistry and in two new
courses, Physical Polymer Chemistry Laboratory and Advanced Synthesis
Laboratory. Students in these courses will learn the use of infrared
spectroscopy to characterize and quantitate inorganic, organic, and polymeric
materials. Many of the experiments will also utilize modern methods of sample-
handling, including diffuse reflectance and both horizontal and cylindrical
attenuated total reflectance. The new courses will instruct undergraduates in
two important areas of chemistry, and the additional experiments in existing
courses will guarantee that chemistry graduates have adequate exposure to the
theory and modern applications of FTIR.
