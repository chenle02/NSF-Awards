A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the
science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and
research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the
Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the research capacity at these
institutions expands the opportunities for students to pursue challenging,
rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that
may be locally relevant, and encourages a faculty community to look beyond the
traditional classroom for intellectual and professional growth. This project
aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will increase the body of knowledge
about the faculty-led research being conducted at TCUP
institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tribal Nations Research Group (TNRG) will
conduct a series of symposia over three years that will invite faculty and
students at TCUP institutions to present the results of their original research
or design projects. TNRG will also provide consultation to student researchers
on writing, presentation, and communication skills needed for scientific
careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
