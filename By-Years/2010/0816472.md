Dr. Matthew Covington is awarded an NSF Earth Science Postdoctoral Fellowship to
carry out a program of research and education at the University of Missouri -
Columbia. Dr. Covington will augment computer models for karstic aquifers that
relate the geometry of the conduit to recharge and discharge. These models will
be tested against natural systems, Devli's Icebox and Maramec Springs, in
Missouri. Monitoring stations for water level and temperature will be placed in
the main recharge and discharge areas of these two aquifers; these three
parameters will be entered into the computer models to draw conclusions about
the geometry of the conduit. The results from this investigation will provide
information on the geometry of the conduit network in karstic aquifer systems, a
factor of critical importance when managing water resources for significant
number of the population. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, Dr. Covington will
establish an outreach program to local high schools to share with students his
experiences and anecdotes while exploring caves for recreational and scientific
purposes. Dr. Covington will also teach an introductory level Geology class.
