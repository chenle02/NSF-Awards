This award will provide partial support for the Chemistry Career Planning
Workshop for Underrepresented Minority Students which will be held at Purdue
University, June 12-14, 1992. The objective of the workshop is to bring minority
students from throughout the U.S. together with about 25 very successful
minority mentors from industry, academia and government, in order to acquaint
the students with the opportunities created by obtaining a Ph.D degree in
Chemistry. The workshop will also afford the students to meet with graduate
students in the Chemistry Department at Purdue and to see state-of-the-art
research instrumentation in use.
