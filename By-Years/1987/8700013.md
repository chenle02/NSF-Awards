This study concerns the general question of how food material is transferred
from plants (which initially manufacture the food), to herbivores and carnivores
in the sea. Recently, the accepted view of this process has undergone a healthy
reexamination. The simple notion that the food material passes mainly to
relatively large grazers and then to harvestable organisms such as fish has been
supplanted by the recognition that much of the plant material produced is
consumed by a variety of microscopic organisms in what has been termed the
microbial loop. This study will employ several well conceived laboratory studies
to analyze the role of certain widespread marine micro- organisms known as
ciliates in the flow of food energy in this biological "loop". The results will
directly advance our understanding of marine food webs.
