The advantages of free-flow zone electrophoresis for processing labile
macromolecules are well-known. The technique is powerful, gentle, and
universally applicable to biomaterials ranging in size from low molecular weight
antibiotics to whole cells. To date, however, it has been impossible to achieve
high resolution and high throughput simultaneously. In an early study, also
supported by NSF, a prototype device was constructed to experimentally test a
design capable of both high throughput and excellent purifications; these
experiments indicated the mathematical model of the process is adequate for
scale-up of the design. The prototype model has a protein throughput equal to
that of the best currently available commercial devices. The present grant is
for testing of a device scaled-up to a throughput two orders of magnitude
greater, on the order of 100 g/hr, and the demonstration of its separating power
for realistic industrial protein mixtures.
