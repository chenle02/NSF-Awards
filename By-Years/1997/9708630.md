*** 9708630 ORWOLL This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and
Facilities Program (CRIF) Program will assist a junior faculty in the Department
of Chemistry at the College of William and Mary to acquire a electrochemical
analysis system. This equipment will enhance research in the area of metal-
containing oligomers and polymers. The electrochemical analysis system is
concerned with measuring the processes and factors affecting the transport of
charge across interfaces between chemical phases. This technique allows
researchers to study electrode reactions that might include an unstable
intermediate such as radical ion, and to conduct electrosynthesis. ***
