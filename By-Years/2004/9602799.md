The University of Minnesota at Duluth, the second largest of the four campuses
of the University of Minnesota system, will receive an award from the Academic
Research Infrastructure Program to renovate, reconfigure, and modernize research
and training space in the Chemistry Building. Constructed in 1948, the building
houses research programs that focus on analytical, inorganic, and organic
chemistry, and biochemistry and molecular biology. Current conditions, such as
inadequate utilities, substandard fume hoods, and the lack of environmental
controls adversely affect experiment work and in some instances prohibit the
pursuit of research problems. This project will modernize research space by
installing fume hoods and computer network lines, and reconfiguring bench space
to accommodate additional students and new research areas. Renovations will
improve the HVAC infrastructure to create an environment that supports research
programs, and renovate research support areas to comply with state and federal
regulations, thereby creating a safer and more efficient research environment. A
new synthetic chemistry laboratory will be created to enhance research training
by supporting the growth in student enrollments and provide efficient space for
state-of-the-art instrumentation. This project will sustain a growing program
benefiting 58 faculty members and their students.
