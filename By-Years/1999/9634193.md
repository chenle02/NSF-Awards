*** Michalowski 9634193 There has been an increase in interest in reinforced
soil structures following the major seismic events in the U.S. and in Japan in
the last few years. Reinforced soil structures appear to have performed very
well during earthquakes, and showed little structural distress. This project
addresses the stability analysis of such structures. Both soil nailing and
geosynthetic reinforcement are considered, and seismic loads, given as patterns
of base acceleration, are accounted for. Two major objectives are: (a) progress
in understanding of soil reinforcement mechanisms, including some "non-
traditional" synthetic reinforcement such as thin continuous filament, and (b)
development of techniques for analysis and synthesis of soil structures
reinforced with soil nails or geosynthetics, and presenting results in a manner
useful for design practice. The analysis is based on the theorems of plasticity
theory. The contribution of soil nails or geosynthetics are accounted for
through inclusion of additional work dissipation terms in the energy balance
equation. An effort is made to investigate the influence of non-associativity of
plastic flow of granular soils on the results of the stability analysis. The
structural loads considered include self-weight, forces applied as boundary
loads, and inertial forces due to seismic acceleration (base shaking). This
research will contribute to the state of knowledge in the area through
development of a new analysis for stability of soil-nailed or geosynthetic-
reinforced structures, and through development of a new approach to modeling of
soils reinforced with continuous thread (filament). It will also contribute to
engineering design practice. An effort will be made to create useful design
charts.
