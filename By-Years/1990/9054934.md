Collaboration between NSF and CCSO to develop indicators of science and
mathematics education began in 1986. The project was initiated with two goals:
1) to establish a system of education indicators that provides the capacity for
national analyses and state-by-state comparisons of the condition and trends in
science mathematics education, and 2) to improve the quality and usefulness of
data on science and mathematics education to assist the state policymakers and
program managers in making more informed decisions. The present proposal
outlines four objectives for the next phase of the state science/math indicators
project: 1. Collect and report biannual national and state-by-state data on
selected indicators of science and math education, based on data collected by
state departments of education; 2. Produce and report state-by-state analyses of
data on science and math indicators from the Schools and Staffing Survey of the
National Center for Education Statistics; 3. Provide assistance to 5-10 states
to develop capacity for collecting and reporting data on science/math
indicators; 4. Establish an "interstate consortium on alternative methods of
student assessment" to assist states in reforming their assessments of student
learning in science and mathematics.
