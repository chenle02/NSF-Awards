Phased-array radar is a mature technology that has recently been applied to
remote sensing of clouds and precipitation. These radar systems have several
advantages over current weather radars, however there are biases introduced when
dealing with polarimetric variables that help to discriminate between
precipitation types. This award will allow researchers to conduct experiments
with the goal of providing a clearer picture of the capabilities and limitations
of phased-array technology for weather polarimetry. The broader societal impacts
of the award are related to improving technology that could eventually be used
to study and forecast severe weather. Students would be directly involved in the
project, giving them valuable training experience. The radar testbed will be
made available to other researchers and it could potentially be used as a gap-
filling radar for the local region. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phased-array radar has
a long history of use for point measurements, but making polarimetric
measurements using phased-array is more complicated than for a traditional
antenna design. The PI will perform engineering and observational experiments
with the Raytheon Low Power Radar (LPR) to study the polarization performance,
biases, and other measurement uncertainties particular to phased-array weather
radar antennas, as well as to explore new capabilities including rapid scanning,
polarization correction, and alternate polarization bases. The LPR would be co-
located with a mechanically-scanned radar for comparison purposes.
