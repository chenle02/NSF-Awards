The University of Florida's Human-Centered Computing Scholars (HCCS) program
supports ten financially disadvantaged doctoral students in its College of
Engineering. The Scholars conduct research in Human-Centered Computing and work
on projects related to accessibility, biometrics, virtual humans, virtual
reality, educational technologies, information technology policy and social
computing. During the summer months, the project also supports two undergraduate
researchers who work in teams with and are mentored by the doctoral students.
Each doctoral Scholar is also given an opportunity to participate in a summer
internship with a government or industrial research lab.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Human-Centered Computing Scholars are recruited from
Historically Black Colleges and Universities and other universities in
cooperation with the Institute for African-American Mentoring in Computing
Sciences (iAAMCS). The project is intended to broaden the participation of
underrepresented groups, primarily African-Americans, through engagement in
research and mentoring activities.&lt;br/&gt;.
