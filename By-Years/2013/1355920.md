The proposed innovation uses microfluidic technology to rapidly generate fluid
mixtures of drugs with fine increments in their proportions to assist with
combination drug development. Although automated pipetting systems and well
plates have been the workhorse for primary drug screening where thousands of
individual compounds are tested, few, if any, are flexible for screening
combination drugs because of the complexity involved in scanning a large number
of drug-and-dose combinations. This technology involves injecting plugs of drug
solutions into a uniquely designed microfluidic device that allows autonomous
mixing and dilution. This approach allows mixing drugs in very fine increments
with significantly less consumption of drug samples and reagents.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Development of a microfluidic drop technology for
combination drug discovery may accelerate the process of drug screening and
discovery of new or combination drugs. It would help to reduce the drug
development time cycle and cost as it facilitates fluid mixtures of drugs in
very small increments. Outside of the pharmaceutical industry, this technology
could also play a role in combinational mixing of consumer products and
biomaterials.
