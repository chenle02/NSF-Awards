This project will investigate the genetic relationships between the North
American, European, and Asian trouts and salmon. This will be done by obtaining
data on the DNA sequence of the ribosomal RNA genes. Using these data, a tree
will be constructed showing the relationships between the various species. This
tree will be compared and combined with trees obtained from analysis of
morphological traits and chromosomal variation in these fishes.
