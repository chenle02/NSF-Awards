This award provides support to students and other young researchers for travel
and accomodation to the 2009 Chicago Learning School/Workshop on Theory and
Practice of Computational Machine Learning to be held in Chicago, June 1-11,
2009. Tutorial presentations of the Summer School are being recorded and are
being made available over the Web. The workshop and summer school provide a
forum on geometry and high-dimensional inference in computational learning, and
will be effective in bringing these subjects to the attention of a broad
scientific community interested in problems of machine learning and inference.
