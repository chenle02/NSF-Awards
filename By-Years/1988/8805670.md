This proposal is a request for partial support of the Satellite Symposium of
the 47th Annual Meeting of the Society for Developmental Biology to be held at
the University of Connecticut, Storrs, Conn., on June 11, 1988. The topic of the
Satellite Symposium is "Extracellular Matrix and Morphogenesis". The goal of
this symposium is to provide a forum to review and project experimental
endeavors in this important area of developmental biology research. Speakers
from diverse backgrounds, who have a common interest in morphogenesis and are
working on different levels of organization, will be brought together to discuss
and identify exciting directions and to encourage new insights and approaches.
