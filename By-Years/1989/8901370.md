The purpose of the research is to understand the relationships between
processing parameters and mechanisms of structural change in silicon-on-
insulator material synthesized by high-dose oxygen implantation into silicon.
The research uses transmission electron microscopy techniques to study the
development of structure in thin "superficial" silicon layers above the buried
oxide layer. Specimens are processed using a variety of implantation and thermal
treatments to allow following of the formation of the microstructural changes.
Modelling for thermally activated processes of precipitation and precipitate-
induced defect formation is based on bulk silicon models modified for effects of
damage from ion implantation, high oxygen concentration, and high defect
density. The research is relevant to understanding of the effects of oxygen,
radiation damage, and mechanisms of ion implantation in silicon.
