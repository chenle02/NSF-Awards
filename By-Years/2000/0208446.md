Measurements of the magnetic properties of rocks can provide information on
properties of magnetic minerals that reflect environmental changes and affect
the reliability of paleointensity methods. Recent technology allows us to
measure magnetic hysteresis rapidly and represent the full complexity of it
using phenomenological models such as Preisach or FORC diagrams. To interpret
these diagrams, we need a good physical model for the magnetic particles. The
goals in this proposal are to develop a quantitative model for hysteresis in
some well characterized synthetic magnetite samples, and to test it rigorously
using hysteresis measurements at several temperatures combined with detailed
particle size distributions. Recent micromagnetic models for the size dependence
of hysteresis are much closer than previous models, but their predictions are
still somewhat low. The investigator will test the hypothesis that stress
anisotropy has an important effect on hysteresis even in the smallest particles.
A numerical micromagnetic model will be used to calculate the magnetic
hysteresis. Because magnetic properties depend strongly on the method of
synthesis, the PI will concentrate on two sets of samples, aqueous precipitates
and glass ceramics, with sizes below 0.4 microns. These samples have been
intensively studied, are small enough for accurate micromagnetic modeling, and
are analogues of natural systems. This work should either produce a realistic
model for the magnetic properties or eliminate some models from consideration. A
successful model could be used to interpret Preisach and FORC diagrams. It would
also be the basis for future work on other magnetic phenomena such as
thermoremanent magnetization.
