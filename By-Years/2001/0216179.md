0216179&lt;br/&gt;Peck&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds from this Major Research
Instrumentation (MRI) grant will be used to acquire a dual-inlet stable isotope
ratio mass spectrometer for the Department of Geology at Colgate University. The
instrument will be used primarily in the analysis of oxygen isotope ratios in
silicates by on-line laser fluorination, in addition to analyses of gases
prepared by combustion or reaction with acid off-line. Laser fluorination is the
method of choice for analysis of refractory mineral separates for oxygen isotope
ratio, has short analysis times (15-20 minutes per sample), and yields routine
precisions of +/-0.1 per mil or better for samples as small as 1 mg. A mass
spectrometer at Colgate will allow new and continuing interdisciplinary research
projects in the Geology Department, including studies of granulite facies stable
isotope thermometry and hygrometry, tectonic, magmatic, and fluid studies of the
Grenville orogen, plume-ridge interaction in the Galapagos, and studies of
paleoclimate in Alaska, New York, and Antarctica. All of this research will
expose undergraduate students at Colgate to the use of stable isotopes in the
geosciences, allowing hands-on exposure to modern
instrumentation.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
