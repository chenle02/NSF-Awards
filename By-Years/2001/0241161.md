0241161&lt;br/&gt;Doyle&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the
participation of American scientists in a U.S.-Japan joint seminar on quantum
correlation and coherence to be held in Hokkaido, Japan from September 12-18,
2003. The co-organizers are Professor John Doyle at Harvard University in
Massachusetts and Professor Makoto Gonokami at Tokyo University in Japan. The
meeting will bring together research scientists from the U.S. and Japan, two
countries where important and exciting progress in the fields of quantum optics
and atomic physics continues to strengthen our ability to observe and manipulate
coherent quantum systems. Even though quantum mechanics is more than a century
old, scientists are only just beginning to explore the fundamentals of quantum
coherence. In addition to amplifying our understanding of fundamental issues of
quantum coherence, these advances are opening exciting applications in the areas
of atom optics and interferometry, precision measurements, non-linear optics,
quantum measurement and quantum computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The co-
organizers have complementary scientific expertise in the field. This enables
them to evaluate and attract the best physical scientists to participate. The
seminar organizers have made a special effort to involve postdocs and graduate
students as both participants and observers. The exchange of ideas and data with
Japanese experts in the field will enable U.S. participants to advance their own
work, and will set the stage for future collaborative projects. Following the
seminar the organizers plan to establish a workshop web page. Conference
proceedings will be published on this web site.
