Conventional fabrication methods for nanoporous polymeric filtration membranes
employ organic solvents resulting in membranes having a wide pore size
distribution and limited organic solvent resistance. Large volumes of solvent-
contaminated aqueous wastes are produced. Preliminary studies have described a
novel and generally applicable solventless technique for making nanoporous
membranes from a multicomponent polymer system containing a matrix phase and an
immiscible minor phase with/without a compatibilizing block copolymer. The
method involves melt extrusion of the multicomponent polymer system into a film
and subjecting it to post-extrusion treatments involving stretching steps
leading to continuous microcracks in the matrix and pores at the phase interface
via debonding. A general investigation of such a technique for making flat
nanoporous membranes is proposed. The specific research objectives and the
corresponding methods are as follows: (1) Broaden the range of immiscible
polymer blends to a variety of systems from two broad classes of polymer
combinations: semicrystalline/amorphous, and semicrystalline/semicrystalline
with different melting temperatures. System selection will consider their
polarity, hydrophilicity, degree of crystallinity, melting temperature, melt
viscosity and elasticity and molecular weight and distribution. (2) Established
the detailed processing/structure/property correlations between film extrusion
and post-treatment conditions, the precursor solid film morphology and the
nanoporous membrane structure developed. (3) Investigate the separation
characteristics of such membranes in ultrafiltration, nanofiltration,
microfiltration, supported liquid membrane permeation as a skin-barrier analog
and battery separator applications. (4) Analyze the drastically reduced overall
environmental impact of the proposed solventless membrane manufacturing method
vis-a-vis existing solvent-based membrane making process.

Successful achievement of these research objectives will establish an
environmentally friendly general solventless technique of making flat nanoporous
polymeric membranes having a variety of commercially-useful separation and
transport capabilities for mixtures of molecules/proteins/nanoparticles. The
manufacturing methodology will have immediate potential for extension to hollow
fiber membranes. Understanding the science of this membrane-making technology
and its potential will facilitate development of novel nanoporous membranes. A
graduate student and a post-doctoral fellow will be educated in membrane
fabrication, membrane characterization and membrane processes. Collaboration
between Polymer Processing Institute and the Center for Membrane Technologies at
NJIT will advance existing cooperation to a higher level.
