ABSTRACT

The project involves work on several distinct problems with the common themes of
controlling, estimating or reconstructing singularities that arise in
oscillatory integral operators, Fourier integral operators and inverse problems.
The first problem concerns establishing optimal decay rates for oscillatory
integral operators in three dimensions having generic homogeneous polynomial
phase functions. In the second, the Calderon problem for scalar conductivities
with jump discontinuities in two dimensions will be analyzed, with singularities
(suitably interpreted) of boundary data yielding information about the
locations, and possibly sizes, of the jumps of the conductivity in the interior.
A linearized version of the identification problem for the attenuated Radon
transform will be analyzed using techniques from micro-local and harmonic
analysis in the third problem. Finally, a linearized hyperbolic inverse problem
involves studying the composition of Fourier integral operators associated to
specific singular geometries arising from the presence of caustics occurring
generically in three dimensions.

Progress on these problems will add to the understanding of partial differential
equations, the operators, which are used to solve them, and the behavior of
their solutions. Many laws of nature are expressed as partial differential
equations, which govern physical quantities of interest, such as electromagnetic
field strength or pressure exerted by acoustic waves. The techniques to be
developed in this project are applicable to equations that govern various kinds
of wave propagation and are based on a geometric point of view in understanding
the singularities, which are present. The last three problems have the potential
to assist in the design or refinement of systems for nondestructive testing,
medical imaging, and seismic exploration.
