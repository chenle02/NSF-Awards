The project studies three important domains which highlight physical Human-Robot
Interaction involved in assisting humans in the home and workplace: (1) human
guidance through cluttered environments using physical contact, (2) cooperative
carrying of large objects through complex and dynamic environments, and (3)
robot assisted sitting and getting up. This is accomplished through the
evolution of an experimental single-wheel mobility platform into an autonomous
robot that is instructed and guided by people in a natural
way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Such systems are needed in many public health domains,
including care for the elderly, rehabilitation and assistive programs. Project
results are incorporated into coursework offered by two different departments at
CMU, and exposes students to unique robot planning, control and Human-Robot
Interaction issues. High school students are introduced to this area as part of
the Andrew Leap program. Students from underrepresented groups participate
through the ARTSI program. Results may be presented in cooperation with museums
or entertainment companies.
