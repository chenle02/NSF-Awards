Allegheny College will begin the creation of an exemplary Teacher Education
Program for the College that will be specifically for the education of teachers
of mathematics and science. Mathematics and Science are areas of strength for
Allegheny College. The teacher preparation program will be a part of the
responsibility of all departments, not just the College of Education. Science
and Mathematics Educators will hold appointments in the disciplinary departments
so that the pedagogical preparation can be integrated into the content education
of the preservice teachers. The project, also, will develop recruitment
strategies to attract excellent students into the program.
