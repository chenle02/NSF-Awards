The overall objective of this project is to characterize the biochemical
function of two enzymes, a lignin peroxidase (LiP) and a manganese peroxidase
(MnP), in the oxidative degradation of lignin by the white-rot fungus
Phanerochaete chrysosporium. Kinetic, spectroscopic and reactivity experiments
will be conducted to ascertain the role of veratryl alcohol in the mechanism and
regulation of LiP. Steady-state kinetic measurements, EPR, and resonance Raman
spectroscopy will be used to characterize the active center of MnP and the role
of Mn as redox couple in the enzyme. Lignin is the second most abundant
biopolymer and the most abundant natural aromatic material on earth. An
understanding of the role of these enzymes in the biodegradation of lignin may
lead to the development of many useful biotechnological applications such as
those in the pulp-paper and chemical industries. They would be less energy
demanindg and more environmentally benign than existing processes.
