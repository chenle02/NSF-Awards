Each year many students diagnosed with Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity
Disorders (ADHD) enroll in universities to pursue a degree; overall, it is
estimated that up to 8% of college students with known disabilities are
diagnosed with ADHD, while there are of course many more who are not formally
diagnosed and for whom ADHD is a hidden disability. As a concrete example, the
awardee institution currently has approximately 1,500 students with known
disabilities of whom 342 are ADHD. Typically, these students are expected to
perform at the same level as those with a high attention span; curricula and
lectures are not designed with ADHD students in mind. So, while ADHD students
may spend more time studying outside the classroom to compensate, they often
fail to notice their attention has drifted until precious time has been wasted.
Currently, there is no immersive neurophysiological tool to help improve
attention retention and reduce mind wandering. The objective of this research is
to explore to what extent ADHD students' attention retention can be improved
through creating paintings with a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). If successful,
project outcomes will have broad impact by paving the way to a better and more
successful life for students with poor attention spans, whether or not diagnosed
with ADHD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will establish a comprehensive and
empirical method of investigating the effects of painting with the brain using a
P300 stimulus to improve attention retention. Subjects will need to focus on a
stimulus on a computer screen to create their desired image, which will require
a lot of concentration to complete the task accurately and in a short amount of
time. This skill once acquired could transfer to other situations requiring
prolonged attention, thereby helping the students perform more successfully in
school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
