A single chip implementation of a maximum likelihood Viterbi decoder is being
studied for use with convolutional codes and trellis coded modulation. The
actual final design and fabrication will occur in Phase III. The decoder is
matched to all codes with up to 64 states with the property that branches
connect any state in the trellis to at most 4 new states. This decoder chip will
have extensive applications in digital communication systems and in digital
recording systems including magnetic, magneto-optic and optical systems. This
chip is expected to be of use in high-speed telephone-line modems, satellite
communication, and magnetic recording applications. The maximum-likelihood
decoder will significantly reduce the incidence of channel induced errors in the
information bit stream, which was previously convolutionally encoded. While the
convolutional encoder is easy to implement, the dynamic programming algorithm
which constitutes the Viterbi decoder is much more difficult and is thus a very
significant contribution.
