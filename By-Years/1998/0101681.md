California manufacturers cannot fill their demand for qualified, trained
technicians in electronics, welding, machining and other manufacturing related
fields. Allan Hancock and Cuesta Colleges along with select industrial partners
and faculty are joining California Polytechnic State University at San Luis
Obispo to address this shortage by developing a Regional Center for
Manufacturing Education. This project constitutes the planning phase for the
development of this center. The planning phase is helping the participating
members to create the strong linkages needed for the success of such a
comprehensive undertaking. Planning activities are focused on organizing
meetings with industrial partners to identify industry needs, offering a pilot
workshop to community college and high school faculty, and reviewing all
relevant data to meet industry needs for manufacturing while maintaining
educational integrity. Once developed, this center will provide industry driven
skill training for high tech jobs, will offer a series of activities to attract
students into manufacturing programs, and will give those who wish to pursue a
baccalaureate degree a seamless path to a four-year institution.
