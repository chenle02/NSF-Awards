The impact of Hurricane Iniki on native Hawaiian forest was highly variable.
Preliminary observations suggested that native trees were less damaged than
introduced species. The spatial pattern of damage seemed to be related to soil
wetness, a prime factor limiting tree root depth. The productivity of forests
should be affected by removal of leaves, death of fine roots, and nutrient
accumulation by fallen leaves and twings. In areas which were not severely
damaged by the hurricane, a new mechanism may be identified whereby sub-
catastrophic storms help maintain the unique even-aged population structure of
native Metrosideros forests. This research will test hypotheses on mechanisms
controlling these apparent patterns, and will measure (1) the spatial pattern of
damage, (2) damage by size class and species, (3) changes in leaf area and
growth rate, (4) changes in fine root biomass, (5) decomposition of leaves and
twigs, and (6) changes in soil nutrient availability.
