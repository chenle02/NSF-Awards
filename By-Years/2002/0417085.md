This project builds Stevens' capacity in information assurance and computer
security education by developing new interdisciplinary cybersecurity degree
programs on both the undergraduate and the graduate level. Although the computer
science department offers a graduate certificate in cybersecurity, none of the
available programs in science, technology management, engineering, or
mathematics at Stevens Institute of Technology allow the students to earn an
actual degree in cybersecurity. It is believed that having separate degree
programs will allow Stevens to attract more students to the program, as well as
providing these students with an education that prepares them more thoroughly
for careers as information assurance and computer security professionals. A
major step in achieving this goal is to offer an interdisciplinary education,
integrating core computer science with conventional sciences and cybersecurity,
as well as with engineering and technology management. The newly proposed
degrees are interdisciplinary in character and are intended to build on and
extend current efforts to better suit these needs. Nevertheless, the new degree
programs are primarily based in computer science, as professionals in computer
security and information assurance need to have both strong theoretical and
practical backgrounds in order to be well prepared for their careers.
