This project covers two themes in the field of atom interferometry. The first
involves the development of improved atom interferometric techniques with a view
toward applying them to the demonstration of a high precision Sagnac effect
gyroscope. In the second quantum optics interferometry techniques will be
extended to atomic sources. The goal is to develop new techniques in quantum
measurement, to use direct atom counting methods to study the quantum
statistical nature of degenerate and chaotic atomic sources, and to generate and
characterize degenerate Fermi sources.
