Full Center Proposal (Phase I) for an I/UCRC for Electromagnetic Compatibility

0934299 Clemson University; Todd Hubing

Clemson University (CU) seeks to join the existing I/UCRC "Electromagnetic
Compatibility" consisting of the Missouri University of Science and Technology
(MST) and the University of Houston (UH). MST is the lead institution of the
proposed Center. Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) is an essential feature of
virtually all high speed digital electronic assistants and home entertainment
centers to essential control and information processing systems. EMC is the
ability of these electronic systems to function reliably without causing
interference to other electronic systems, being overly sensitive to weak signals
generated by other electronic systems, and generating signals in one part of the
system interfering with the operation of another part of the same system. The
PI's move to CU and the Clemson University International Center for Automotive
Research (CU-ICAR) provides a unique opportunity to significantly expand the
automotive research being done. The CU-ICAR faculty and facilities will help
attract new center memberships representing the automotive, aerospace, and
industrial automation industries. The Clemson Vehicular Electronics Laboratory
has helped more than a dozen companies address EMC-related problems through
research projects, consulting and short courses.

The proposed Center will encourage collaboration amongst the institutions, and
is committed to providing a skilled and diverse workforce in the area of EMC as
required by industry. The research will expose students and faculty to state-of-
the-art research projects of value to the industry. Much of the material
developed as a result of the research performed by the university participants
has been incorporated into short courses, and CU intends to use some parts of
this short course to address diversity by improving its recruiting of
underrepresented groups among the graduate student population. CU also intends
to develop some demonstrations suitable for K-12 programs designed to interest
high school students in technical careers. In September 2008, CU was honored at
the National Role Models Conference in Arlington, VA for its success in several
high-profile diversity programs.
