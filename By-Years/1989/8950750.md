This project has expanded instruction involving X-Ray diffraction in the
Chemistry, Geology and Physics classes by introducing X- ray diffraction in new
places in some courses and provides opportunities for students to learn modern
X-ray diffraction techniques. This allows students taking these courses to be
better prepared for graduate study or for jobs in industry. The grantee provides
funds that are an equal match for the NSF award.
