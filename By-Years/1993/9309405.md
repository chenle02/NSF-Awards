9309405 Davis This research concerns the effectiveness of decision making by
small groups such as committees and panels. Enhancing the productivity of groups
often involves encouraging consensus, promoting discussion, publicizing member
views, etc. The validity and efficiency of such measures have rarely been
studied and unanticipated side-effects and not been considered. The empirical
research in this project involves an orderly assessment of the influence of
various procedural mechanisms and how they effect the final outcomes or
decisions of the group. The decisions at issue will be ordinary judgments
similar to those expected of citizens serving on a civil jury or schoolboard.
Although the experimental results should assist in achieving of long-term goal
of improving group efficiency and accuracy, a more basic research issue is how
and why the various procedural mechanisms work as they do. A formal model is
being developed to predict group consensus on quantitative judgments. The data
from the experiments will be used to test the model and guide its further
development. The model should provide additional insight into group decision
processes and its enhancement. ***
