9714966 Gibson This SGER project will explore a unique approach to forming
large ordered arrays of nanometer-scale metal particles separated by dielectric
barriers. The idea is to combine a gold-particle supermolecule with Langmuir-
Blodgett film deposition methods; the approach involves a variety of
experimentation in dealing with the ability of the hydrophobic tails to be able
to float large gold-containing head groups. The impact of the project could be
significant because the presence of a metal particle with an organic shell would
allow extension of research on colloidal dielectric sphere arrays to studies of
x-ray photonic bandgaps; analogous supermolecules could be made with a variety
of metal and semiconductor cores. If successful the technique would impact
research in several areas including x-ray optics, mesoscale physics, and
advanced electronic devices. The ordered arrays will be characterized by TEM,
x-ray reflectance, and transport measurements. %%% This project will explore a
new and innovative approach to the synthesis of photonic nanometer structures
from the broad perspectives of chemistry, physics, and materials science. The
idea being explored is the potential use of surface chemistry techniques for the
formation of ordered arrays of ultra-small scale metal particles which have
significant potential applications in several areas of science and technology.
This project sets specific goals and methods for an initial study to test these
ideas, and several key issues can be appropriately addressed and resolved by the
project. ***
