Lasers are versatile tools in the physical sciences that are able to accomplish
tasks that no other tool can achieve. The advent of inexpensive, easy-to-use and
reliable dye lasers makes it possible to introduce a variety of experiments into
physical science programs at the undergraduate level. Students in the
Departments of Physics and Chemistry will use the lasers and auxiliary detection
equipment to perform a variety of experiments including: the measurement of the
speed of light in air and liquids, studies of one and two photon fluorescence,
the use of Raman scattering to study the structure of molecules, and the
detection of subnanogram amounts of toxic aflatoxins from grain samples. The
experiments developed in this project will be made available to other schools to
extend the impact, and prepare more students for careers in the physical
sciences.
