Sea cucumbers and other echinoderms have evolved the unique capacity to modulate
on a physiological time scale the mechanical properties of their connective
tissues. This mechanical modulation is accomplished by neurally regulated
secretions of cells located within the tissues. The secreted molecules lead to
either an increase or a decrease in the mechanical interactions between collagen
fibrils. The PI has isolated and characterized native collagen fibrils from sea
cucumbers, and have identified two macromolecules from the same source that
cause the fibrils to aggregate ("stiparin") and that inhibit aggregation
("stiparin inhibitor"). In addition, the PI has isolated two additional
macromolecules that cause the tissue to become stiff ("stiffener") or plastic
("plasticizer"). The PI's hypotheses are that fibril-aggregation in vitro is the
test-tube equivalent of tissue stiffening in vivo; that stiffener and
plasticizer cause their effects through their interactions with stiparin and
stiparin inhibitor; and that plasticizer and stiffener are localized in
different secretory cells within the tissue. The experimental approach uses
biochemical, physiological and structural analyses. The ultimate goal is to
recreate in the test tube, using characterized macromolecules, the same
modulations of fibril interactions that occur in the tissues.
