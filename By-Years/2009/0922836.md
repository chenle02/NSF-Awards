The objective of this research is to provide enabling instrumentation for
controlled patterning of nanostructures at dimensions comparable to molecular
length scales. The approach is to acquire a next generation high voltage
electron beam lithography instrument that exceeds the current limits of
precision and accuracy. Electron beam lithography equipment employs a digitally
controlled beam of electrons to directly shape nanoscale patterns. The new level
of speed, placement accuracy, overlay, and stability will allow resolution and
control on the sub-10 nm length scale enabling scientific and technological
breakthroughs in sectors that include: communications, high density computer
storage, health care diagnostic, low cost electronics, and energy research and
products. This award will place advanced patterning equipment at the Cornell
NanoScale Science and Technology Facility where it will be openly accessed by
hundreds of researchers annually. Broader impacts of this award devolve from
CNF?s active and committed role in nanotechnology education, mentorship, human
resources and economic development. CNF staff conduct over a thousand group
training sessions on individual equipment for over 700 users annually. CNF staff
teach semi-annual nanotechnology laboratory courses, organize workshops
specifically for practitioners of e-beam lithography and will develop an
advanced e-beam training module. CNF sponsors and hosts over 20 undergraduate
researchers each summer focusing on nanotechnology research. The CNF REU program
particularly targets women, underrepresented minorities, and students with
little or no prior research experience. In addition, CNF provides significant
technology support to small innovative companies with limited laboratory
resources, resulting in significant economic development opportunities.
