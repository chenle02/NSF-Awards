This project will study how genes control the shapes of living things. It will
identify specific genes that affect the shapes of fly wings, and will assess
their relative effects and possible modes of action. Fly wings offer a fast,
cost-effective way to investigate the basic principles of genetic shape control,
because they can be easily projected and magnified, and their shapes can be
rapidly measured with a computer. This makes it possible to analyze thousands of
measurements of individual differences, which are required to study the small
effects of many genes. Previous work in mice and flies indicates that many minor
genes are involved in shape control. In this study the new technique of
microarray analysis will be combined with massively replicated measurements to
find and identify these genes. In many cases we know how genes guide cells to
differentiate into the separate parts of organisms, but not much is known about
how growth is subsequently regulated to determine the final shapes of parts.
Understanding differential growth regulation in normal cells should advance our
knowledge in areas of medical interest, with possible applications to abnormal
growth, birth defects, and the origins of cancer. Frequently, basic research in
fruit fly genetics has led to major advances in human genetics.
