9603119 Freeling Technical section A typical Mutator (Mu) line of maize carries
about 100 Mu transposons and about five autonomous Mu transposons called MuDR. A
minimal line that carries a single MuDR has been characterized. All phenotypes
induced by transposition, excision, demethylation, and suppression of Mu-induced
alleles, are specified by this element. Deletion analysis of MuDR-1 will be
continued in order to ascribe specific functions to regions of MuDR DNA
structure and domains of the encoded proteins A and B. Antibody to A will be
prepared and with the already available antibody to B, immunolocalization and
nuclear protein coprecipitation experiments will be done. The mechanism of Mu
suppression will be studied using a quantitative assay, and reverse genetics
will be used to target small deletions to particular regions of MuDR-1 (p1). The
observed phenomenon whereby Mu becomes less active during development and
following inbreeding even though intact MuDR elements exist in the genome called
"dominant negative regulation", will be investigated. Promoter diversity will be
studied using a Mu excision event which resulted in a series of mis-repair
events affecting a region of about 400 bp. A single MuDR element has been
introduced into oat via a sexual cross and its behavior in a non-native species
of grass will be analyzed. Non-technical abstract A transposable element native
to corn, Mu, will be studied. A strain which contains only one master element,
in contrast to the many usually present in the corn genome, will be used to
study the structure and the function of the element. A phenomenon, dominant
negative regulation, which results in a cession of activity by the Mu element
during development and following inbreeding even though many structurally intact
elements are present in the genome, will be investigated. The availability of
this strain and its progeny also makes it possible to study the effects of
variation in promoter sequence and the behavior of the transposon when it is
transferred to a foreign host.
