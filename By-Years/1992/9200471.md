The P.I. will conduct high pressure solidus-to-super solidus experiments on
mantle peridotites in a Patterson-type apparatus in order to quantify the roles
of deviatoric stress and finite strain in the formation of anisotropic melt
distributions. A second goal will be to determine the conditions at which a
transition from porous flow to localized flow occurs in response to melt
fracturing vs, fluid dynamic instabilities. His ultimate objective is to obtain
constraints on the mechanism of melt focussing at mid- oceanic ridges.
