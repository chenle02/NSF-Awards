Mathematical Sciences (21). This "proof-of-concept" project is developing
instructional materials that incorporate examples from Digital Image Processing
(DIP) to enhance the teaching and learning of linear algebra. The key idea is
that processing an image (or a sequence of images, i.e. a movie) is equivalent
to operating mathematically on matrices. Since the results of such operations
are inherently visual, students are guided by increasingly sophisticated
visualizations, thus providing an opportunity to motivate the understanding of
mathematical concepts and theory. Students first explore stretching, rotating,
or flipping images, then proceed naturally to the study of contrast enhancement,
detecting images in data corrupted by noise, feature extraction, edge detection,
and techniques of data compression - techniques that all rely on using concepts
from linear algebra.
