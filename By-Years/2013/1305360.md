For more than three decades, the slowest and most limiting component in computer
systems has been the disk-based file system. For that reason, file systems have
consistently been a critical area of computer systems research. One of the most
useful techniques for studying file systems is to collect, analyze, and replay
detailed activity traces. In the past, traces have been used for retrospective
analysis and as a source of workloads for both simulation and live experiments.
However, many file-system studies have been handicapped by a lack of publicly
available trace data, often causing experiments to be performed using inadequate
data sets. In many cases, those data sets are not published for use by other
researchers, making comparative studies difficult or
impossible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this work, the PIs are operating and
expanding IOTTA Trace Repository (after the Storage Networking Industry
Association's I/O Tools, Traces, and Analysis Working Group) that makes
standardized, high-quality data sets available to researchers worldwide. This
repository is widely known in the research community as the most reliable source
of file system and I/O trace data, and has proven its worth by providing data
sets to hundreds of research projects worldwide each year. The project involves
defining standard formats and then creating tools to make it easy to work with
traces, despite their immense size. Because the trace repository is inherently a
community effort, it is supervised by an advisory panel of experienced
researchers.
