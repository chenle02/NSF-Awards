The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project is to improve clinical outcomes for patients needing valves for vascular
(veins) or urinary systems. It is difficult to make artificial versions of the
fluid control elements, such as valves, that are biocompatible and withstand the
physical forces associated with their function, as well as the changing
environment associated with aging. The proposed project advances a system to
make artificial sutureless devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project
will optimize the materials and variables of manufacturing a polymer valve
integrated with durable polymer encapsulation of a structural Nitinol frame.
This Nitinol-polymer structure must withstand long-term challenging in vivo
conditions while maintaining a physical interface that does not experience
premature delamination and loss of device functionality. Polyurethane materials
have excellent mechanical properties for rigorous applications and history of
use in implants. This project explores the phase space of relevant parameters
for manufacturing and deployment of these valves at
scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
