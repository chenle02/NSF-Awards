We propose to test and extend existing sequence stratigraphic and
sedimentological interpretations of rocks of Neoproterozoic to earliest Cambrian
age in the Adelaide geosyncline, South Australia. Sequence stratigraphy provides
an independent method for significantly improving intro-basinal correlation in
sparsely fossiliferous rocks, and a physical context in which to analyze
biostratigraphic, chemostratigraphic, magnetostratigraphic and geochronological
data. To the extent that the waxing and waning of Neoproterozoic ice sheets must
have influenced sea level, we infer that at least some of the most persistent
sequence boundaries are of global extent. This possibility needs to tested
against the emerging stratigraphic record in key sections. The Adelaide
geosyncline was selected as a reference section for sequence stratigraphic
research on the basis of its great thickness (15 km), quality of outcrop,
limited deformation and metamorphism, availability of seismic and core data in
adjacent basins of the same age, varied biota (including acritarchs, trace
fossils, Ediacara assemblage metazoa, and stromatolites), and amenability to
stable isotope geochemistry. There is some potential also for U-Pb geochronology
of ash beds, and we propose to search systematically for such layers. The
proposed research will be co-ordinated with the work of others under the
umbrella of Project 320 of the International Geological Correlation Programme
(Neoproterozoic Events and Resources), with the long-term objective of
documenting and evaluating the connections between a variety of biological,
environmental and tectonic phenomena recorded in younger Neoproterozoic rocks.
