This project is developing twelve interactive applets that use 2-D and 3-D
animation to help students visualize concepts in linear algebra (e.g. vectors,
vector spaces, linear transformations, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, determinants,
and orthogonality). The project is using GeoGebra, a free, easy to access and
use software package that is compatible with multiple platforms including mobile
phones and computer tablets, and has wide use nationally. Accompanying each
applet are directions for use and an instructional module with examples and
learning exercises usable both in formal classes and independently by students
and teachers. Each module also includes an example STEM-application to provide
context for the use of the corresponding applet. The intellectual merit of this
project is grounded in research that indicates helping students visualize
mathematical processes promotes better understanding of the concepts involved.
Moreover, by focusing on linear algebra with its extensive applications in
chemistry, physics, engineering and similar fields, the project is filling a gap
within the larger collection of educational applets that promote learning of
mathematical concepts. The perspectives of a set of beta testers and reviewers
are informing the development work, and a well-considered experimental design is
being used to assess the applets' impact on student learning. With respect to
broader impacts, the project is using an aggressive dissemination plan featuring
conference workshops and mini-courses, a dedicated web server for exploring and
downloading the applets, plus the GeoGebraWiki to facilitate interactions among
developers and users. The flexibility of the GeoGebra software and its
adaptability for use on multiple platforms including mobile devices also
contribute to the project's potential for broad impact and support from a
growing community of GeoGebra developers.
