The Research Experiences for Undergraduates program at the University of Central
Florida will expose ten undergraduate students, chosen from institutions
throughout the Southeast to thirteen weeks of research experiences in the
development and applications of lasers. A primary emphasis of this program will
be to encourage talented undergraduate students, in particular women,
minorities, and persons with disabilities, to pursue graduate studies in the
field of electro-optics and lasers. Eight internationally recognized faculty in
the Center for Research in Electro-Optics and Lasers (CREOL), which is a
recognized center of excellence in optics and laser research, will be Research
Supervisors in this program. The program will include: 1) An introductory course
in the basic principals of optics and lasers; 2) A course on laser systems; 3)
Weekly Research Seminars by the CREOL faculty and other experts organized
specifically for the REU students; 4) Biweekly industrial visits to the numerous
optics and laser companies in the Orlando area; 5) Weekly classes and discussion
sessions on issues of ethics in science and engineering research; 6) Continuous
monitoring of the students' progress by the principal investigators. All of the
activities will take place in the summer term of 1993.
