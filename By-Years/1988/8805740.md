This grant supports a program of experimental research using proton-induced
charge exchange reactions to study nuclear structure and the isovector
components of the nuclear force. The measurements will be carried out at the
Indiana University Cyclotron Facility and the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility.
In addition to its consequences for the understanding of nuclear structure
physics, this research will provide information concerning the suitability of
boron-11, gallium-69, iodine-127, and thallium-205 as detectors for use in solar
neutrino measurements.
