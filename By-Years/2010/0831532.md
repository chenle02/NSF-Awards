The inability of programmers to write vulnerability free code is the most
pressing problem in practical computer systems security. The most serious class
of vulnerabilities is memory vulnerabilities, which generally allow an attacker
to subvert the program's control flow. In response to this problem, generic
mitigations have been widely deployed that, through changes to the operating
system and processor, seek to make it impossible for attackers to exploit errors
in programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Implementers considering deploying such
mitigations must know how much (if at all) a generic mitigation improves
security and what its costs are if they are to allocate R&amp;D resources
wisely.&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, until recently, the benefits of generic
mitigations were studied only superficially. Recent first steps have already
shed some light, showing, e.g., that the widely deployed
"W-xor-X"&lt;br/&gt;mitigation provides no security benefit
whatsoever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project puts imperfect, ad-hoc mitigation
on a scientific footing. It provides a formal, comprehensive analysis to
determine the cost-benefit equation is for generic
mitigations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project begins by producing quantitative
analyses of current mitigation techniques and of attacks; these analyses
facilitate the creation of new mitigations that resist attacks that foil current
mitigations; these new mitigations are implemented, evaluated, and disseminated.
In addition, the project develops a sandboxed environment for experimenting with
software vulnerabilities and malicious code, and a curriculum for teaching
systems security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results will be better use of
implementation resources for vendors; a more secure legacy software environment
for users; and better security education for the next generation of programmers,
so they will not make the mistakes earlier ones did.&lt;br/&gt;
