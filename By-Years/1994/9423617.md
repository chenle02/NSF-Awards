This proposal is for, "Electron Studies and QED". It involves isolating
electrons, storing them, and studying their behavior when their environment is
varied in a controlled manner. The development of the apparatus to control the
environment of the electron allows a new generation of measurements of the
magnetic moment of the electron and positron. Together with quantum
electrodynamics (QED) theory, this will provide the most accurate value for the
fine structure constant. When the fine structure constant is measured by an
independent method, then QED will be subjected to its most stringent test. A
helium spectroscopic measurement is proposed for this purpose. Further
measurements involve the study to nonlinearities due to special relativistic
effects in the cyclotron motion of a one electron oscillator.
