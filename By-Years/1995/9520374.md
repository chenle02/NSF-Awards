9520374 Shepson This project aims at improving our understanding of the impact
of organic nitrates on the production and distribution of tropospheric ozone.
Organic nitrates are produced in the reaction between organic peroxy radicals
with nitric oxide, usually as a minor product. The importance of this reaction
channel increases with the size of the organic precursor. Removal of nitric
oxide through this reaction could constitute an important NOx sink, thus
reducing the ozone formation rate. In order to accurately model the ozone
budget, the yields of organic nitrates in the oxidation pathways of natural
hydrocarbons are needed. In this project, the yield of nitrate formation from
isoprene, terpenes, and aromatic hydrocarbons will be measured using a large
photochemical reaction chamber equipped with sampling and detection devices
capable of distinguishing individual nitrate species. In addition, ambient
measurements of organic nitrates will be conducted at a forested site at the
northwestern tip of the Michigan southern Peninsula, using a unique combination
of adsorbent concentration and chemiluminescent detection that will enable the
investigators to measure the total concentration of both gas- and particulate-
phase organic nitrates with very low limits of detection. These data will be
useful for modeling studies of tropospheric ozone, and will provide new insights
into the problem of the speciation of atmospheric total reactive nitrogen (NOy),
and the importance of organic nitrates as a sink and/or vehicle for the
transport of atmospheric NOx.
