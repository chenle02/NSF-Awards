This award is made as the starter grant increment of Dr. Robert Kennedy's
Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chemistry Award in support of his research at The
University of Florida. The research will be an investigation of the
electrochemistry of alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone, a tetradecapeptide,
with the goal of developing a sensor which can be used to measure its release
from individual cells of the rat pituitary gland. Fast scan cyclic voltammetry
at carbon fiber microdisk electrodes will yield signals with suitable detection
limits and stability. The close spacing of the cell and the electrode will
prevent dilution of secreted hormone and allow for the observation of the
release profile with minimum diffusional distortion. Liquid chromatography will
be implemented to ensure the identity of the voltammetric signal. %%% The
successful development of this micro-electro-analytical technique will provide a
general method to study peptide secretion from individual cells with the best
time resolution yet available.
