QEIB: Novel Approaches to Plankton Seasonal Succession &lt;br/&gt;Christopher A.
Klausmeier&lt;br/&gt;Georgia Tech Research Corporation - GA Institute of
Technology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plankton are the microscopic plants and animals
that form the base of most aquatic food webs. Seasonal changes in weather have
major effects on plankton communities. In temperate lakes, organisms grow during
the warmer months, then die off or form resting stages in winter. This
&lt;br/&gt;environmental variation leads to a regular succession of species over
the growing season, called seasonal succession. Although seasonal succession has
long fascinated plankton ecologists, there have been few attempts to model this
process mathematically. This project will investigate seasonal succession with a
combination of mathematical modeling, laboratory experiments, and analysis of
long-term data from a range of Swiss lakes. Although the focus is on plankton
communities, this research will illuminate other ecological systems that are
influenced by a fluctuating environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twenty-first
century biology is becoming increasingly quantitative. This project will improve
the teaching of theoretical ecology and provide research opportunities in
quantitative ecology for graduate and undergraduate students. It will allow
collaboration between empirical and theoretical ecologists and mathematicians,
strengthening interdisciplinary links at Georgia Tech, and involve undergraduate
students with a special focus on recruiting from local historically black
institutions. Freshwater ecosystems are essential to human well-being and are
heavily impacted by human activities. This project will provide fundamental
insights into their dynamics, which will allow better management of lake
ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
