There is a growing need for effective formal methods of constructing correct
and reliable computer programs. This need becomes especially crucial in the case
of concurrent,distributed, real-time, or, more generally, reactive systems. Such
systems typically involve a number of delicate and subtle aspects such as
parallel operation of distinct, often geographically dispersed components, and
ongoing, ideally nonterminating computation where each component repeatedly
interacts with neighboring components in order to achieve a global goal or
maintain a global invariant. Many safety critical real-world applications
programs can be counted among the reactive systems. Examples include: computer
operating systems, computer network communication protocols, air traffic control
systems, on-board avionics control systems, as well as automated banking
networks. The approach taken in this research to reasoning about such reactive
systems centers around the use of Temporal Logic, a formalism that can be used
for specification, verification, design, and synthesis of reactive systems. This
research investigates to what extent efficient automation of temporal reasoning
about reactive systems is possible. Considerable attention is devoted to the
following particular aspects: attacking the state explosion problem, reasoning
about many homogenous processes, real-time reasoning, and synthesis of reactive
systems.
