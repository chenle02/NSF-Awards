The project involves purchase of a powder diffractometer, a camera station, and
the computer hardware and software necessary for their operation. The
instrumentation will be used to establish a modern x-ray diffraction facility
which will enhance students' practical experience, strengthen and expand
existing programs at the college, and improve the breadth of available
laboratory experience for student research. It will be used in both Chemistry
and Physics laboratory courses that range from introductory experimentation to
advanced student research projects, and will impact virtually every science
major at the College.
