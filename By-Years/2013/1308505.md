This award supports the travel of US doctoral students to, and their
participation in the Twelfth International Joint Conference on Autonomous Agents
and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 2013), and the doctoral consortium to be held in
conjunction with it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AAMAS is the premier international
conference devoted to all aspects of agent technology and its applications in
the World Wide Web, electronic commerce, digital libraries, search,
personalization, etc. The Doctoral Consortium offers the students an opportunity
to present their research and receive in-depth feedback from senior researchers.
Students will benefit from attending the conference, with its rich technical
program of contributed and invited research talks, complemented by focused
workshops, tutorials and other events. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The student travel
awards will help enrich the eduation and training of a diverse group of young
researchers, including women and members of underrepresented groups, working in
Artificial Intelligence in general, and Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent
Systems in particular.
