This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will assist the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania in the purchase of an
x-ray diffractometer and associated data collection and analysis system and an
upgrade of an older x-ray diffractometer. This new instrument will enhance
greatly research in a number of areas including the following: 1) Transition
metal complexes of organosilicon compounds: New structures and catalysts, 2)
Catalytic dehydrogenative coupling of alkylsilanes to carbosilanes, 3) Natural
product structure determination, synthesis and organic photochemistry:
Hitachimycin (a.k.a. Stubomycin), a novel antitumor agent, 4) Bioorganic
chemistry: Non-peptidal peptidomimetics, 5) Materials chemistry and inorganic
catalysis: New polymeric precursors to boron-based ceramics, 6) Ferroelectric
metal-oxo polymers and metal-insulator transitions in metal-oxo polymers, 7)
Organometallic reactivity of metallomacrocyclic complexes, 8) Strategies for
synthesis of anti-tumor compounds. %%% The x-ray diffractometer is used to make
accurate and precise measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a
molecule. The information obtained gives the precise values of all the bond
distances and bond angles of a given molecule and it gives accurate information
about the spatial arrangement of that molecule relative to the neighboring
molecules.
