This project will establish new connections between mathematics and physics. On
the mathematics side, it explores objects originating from number theory that
possess a sophisticated collection of symmetries. On the physics side, it
involves lattice models from statistical mechanics. These lattice models are
attempts to study the behavior of matter (e.g., its phase transitions from solid
to liquid to gas) by determining the energy in each individual atomic
interaction. While such a reductionist physical approach may seem daunting, it
works surprisingly often and, roughly speaking, the models which succeed in this
approach are termed "solvable." In this project solvable lattice models are used
to represent special functions from number theory and to demonstrate previously
unknown properties of them and the connections between mathematics and physics
serve to inform both subjects. The project will provide training opportunities
for undergraduate and graduate students that are broadly applicable to a wide
range of STEM careers.

More precisely, the goal of the project is to provide algebraic structure to the
study of matrix coefficients on groups over local fields and their covers. The
PI and his collaborators have demonstrated a fundamental connection between
metaplectic Whittaker functions on p-adic groups and quantum groups, using the
solvable lattice models described above as a bridge between the two theories.
The research will demonstrate that this connection extends and generalizes in
multiple directions, and a solvable lattice model for Iwahori fixed vectors in a
metaplectic Whittaker model is now within reach. Once completed, the project
will provide a powerful connection between metaplectic representations and
quantum affine superalgebras via the R-matrices used to demonstrate Yang-Baxter
equations. Additional topics to be investigated include finding direct links
between p-adic representation theory and quantum groups; using Hecke algebra
characters to categorize matrix coefficients to better understand unramified
calculations in the local theory, which are essential in integral
representations of L-functions; and describing enhancements to the theory of
Kashiwara crystals for superalgebras and to archimedean matrix coefficients on
geometric crystals.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
