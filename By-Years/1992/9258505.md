Disaccharidase activities vary among bird species, determine bird sugar
preferences, and have probably influenced the evolution of nectar and fruit-pulp
composition. Dr. Martinez del Rio will investigate the molecular basis of
variation in the intestinal disaccharidases of birds. He will also study the
integration of disaccharidase activity with intestinal sugar uptake and digesta
retention time to effect digestive performance and feeding. This is an N.S.F.
Young Investigator Award.
