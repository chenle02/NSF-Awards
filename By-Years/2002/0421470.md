With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at El Paso County Community College will purchase an
inductively coupled optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES). This equipment will
enhance research in a number of areas including a) phytoremediation of soil and
water; b) microbial contamination and chemical toxicity of the Rio Grande basin;
c) development of metal ion sensors using biological materials; and d) soil
pollution.

Electrically generated plasmas produce energetic sources for the optical
emission spectrometer. An inductively coupled plasma is a high-temperature
source in which energy to form the plasma is generated by a high-frequency
magnetic field. The optical emission spectrometer is an extremely useful
analytical tool that allows the identification of molecular species and an
understanding of the energy levels in the molecule. These studies will have a
significant impact in furthering our understanding of environmental chemistry
and remediation of polluted sites.
