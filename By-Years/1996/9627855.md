9627855 Barazangi This research is a collaboration between Cornell University
and Moroccan and Spanish research institutions to map crustal and upper mantle
seismic structure in the convergent continental plate boundary between Africa
and Iberia. This complex deformation boundary is active today, as evidenced by
both shallow and intermediate depth seismicity, and includes the Moroccan Rif
and Spanish Betic interplate mountain belts, which constitute the Gibraltar Arc,
and the Alboran Sea. A number of competing models have been suggested to explain
the apparent coeval development of these striking arcuate fold and thrust
mountain belts and the neighboring Alboran basin since the early Miocene.
Possible models range from trapped microplates to subduction or delamination.
Combined digital seismic networks in Spain and Morocco (installation of the
latter was in part supported by NSF funding) provide 49 stations for data
analysis. Precise earthquake location and focal mechanism determination along
with 3-D seismic velocity and attenuation mapping will be used to discriminate
among the competing models of deformation. ***
