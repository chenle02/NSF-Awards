The project will maintain distributed snow sensor arrays in the Boulder Creek
(BC) and&lt;br/&gt;Jemez River (JRB) Basin Critical Zone Observatories (CZO?s).
These snow sensor arrays&lt;br/&gt;complement existing CZO infrastructure. These
snow sensor arrays, combined with existing instrumentation at the CZO?s, create
hydrologic instrument clusters to explore feedbacks between hydrological and
ecological processes, constrain models of water and carbon fluxes, and improve
predictions of ecosystem impacts associated with climate change. These snow
sensor arrays are compatible with those operating at KREW (Sierra CZO) and
represent a comprehensive network of co-located snow, soil, and vegetation water
use measurements. The continued maintenance of the snow measurements will enable
data acquisition to continue in winter 2010-11 without data
gaps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, in cooperation with the Sierra CZO,
lays the foundation for a distributed snow hydrology measurement network design
across these three Critical Zone Observatories. While the emphasis of the
proposed research is on continuing and maintaining snow-measurement programs
already initiated, the data sets collected and collaboration across CZOs will
lay the foundation for a more-uniform and broader cross-CZO snow-measurement
network. These data are important in establishing general relationships between
physiographic variability and patterns of snow distribution and melt. The CZO
program allows for the first time a sustained effort over various temporal
climatic variations in three different mountain regimes that are representative
of the Western U.S.&lt;br/&gt;
