This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to
determine whether thin film materials, specifically CIGS, can accept the angle
of diffracted light from holographic film, and assess the commercial viability
of HPC on thin film PV modules. The project will characterize the electrical and
optical properties of thin film cells, design holographic elements to work with
the cells, design and produce a sample low cost module, and evaluate performance
and manufacturability. Results from this project will be higher efficiencies,
low-cost manufacturing and many new applications for thin film.

The broader impacts/commercial potential of this project will be the merging of
thin film technology with existing technology to create a groundbreaking new
product. The thin film market has been growing dramatically, resulting from its
low cost, low weight, and the ability to manufacture on flexible substrates and
embed solar into walls, roofs and windows. When thin film is combined with
inexpensive holographic film, the results should lead to even more dramatic
performance efficiencies and lower costs. It has been forecasted that the thin
film market will represent 20% of the PV industry by 2010, and reach $7.2
billion worldwide by 2015 (from just over $1.0 billion today).
