9413168 Kosro In this project, the PI will use a shipboard Acoustic Doppler
Current Profiler (ADCP) to measure vertical profiles of currents beneath the
ship as it collects hydrographic and tracer data along a zonal section at
latitude 20 degrees South. This work is a component of the U.S. contribution to
the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) Indian Ocean Expedition (IOE). The
focus of these observations will be, on ageostrophic surface Ekman transport in
the open ocean, and on the spatially-confined boundary currents near the coasts
- the Leeuwin Current off western Australia, and the East Madagascar Current to
the east of Madagascar. In addition, near the boundaries, a lowered ADCP will be
used to full ocean depth to resolve deep boundary currents. ***
