Michael Tremmel is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral
Fellowship to conduct a program of research and education at Yale University. He
will perform large-scale cosmological simulations to study how pairs of
supermassive black holes (SMBH) are formed during the merger of two galaxies.
The simulations will predict observational electromagnetic signatures of galaxy
mergers and identify how galaxy formation and mergers are related to the growth
of SMBHs. Along with this research, Tremmel will provide an interactive research
experience in computational astrophysics to local high school students who are
traditionally underrepresented in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High-resolution
simulations performed in this project will include a new physical model and a
powerful new algorithm to identify the connections between the assembly history
of galaxies and their coevolution with SMBHs. Using two complementary simulation
suites, the project will investigate how the masses and mass ratios of galaxy
mergers are related to the evolution of SMBHs, as well as the early accretion
and merger histories of massive halos and the long term coevolution of their
central galaxies and SMBHs. Results from this project will allow astronomers to
understand how galaxy assembly influences SMBH
formation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
