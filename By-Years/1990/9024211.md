This research is to develop a new class of spatial light modulators, which are
comprised of ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) modulators and silicon VLSI
substrates to provide optoelectronic interconnects between processors and
memory. By coating a silicon substrate with FLC material, those neural
optoelectronic devices will have the advantages of both technologies: optics
provides parallel inputs and outputs (avoiding the VLSI pin-out limitations);
and, electronics provides the flexibility of the processing function. These
devices are ideally suited for optoelectronic computing applications such as
optical pattern recognition and correlation, analog memory for vector
quantizers, optical neural networks and early sensory perception chips.
