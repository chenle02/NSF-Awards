Lewis and Clark Community College (L&amp;C) is conducting a number of activities
which focus on hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) technology. The project develops
HEV-infused professional development programs in all eight major areas of
automotive technology for community college and high school instructors of
automotive technology and to emergency responders. The project also expands its
outreach to high schools in the region of southwestern Illinois with the
broadened implementation of its Automotive Academy and continues a focused
recruitment of underrepresented groups in the region through expansion of its
program called Females under the Hood. Updating the HEV-infused curriculum to
include a variety of HEV car models and to transition to plug-in hybrid models
is also part of the project. The project is revising and updating its
articulation program with Southern Illinois University-Carbondale (SIUC).
Existing partnerships with local automotive repair businesses which deal with
HEVs are sustained and strengthened. The project increases understanding about
instruction in HEV technology with dissemination of the results of the
curriculum development activities and targets underrepresented groups and
females.
