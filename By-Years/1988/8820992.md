This project is for the theoretical and simulation research in magnetospheric
physics. The proposed research covers several topics including 3-D simulation of
the reconnection process, plasmoids and kinks in the magnetospheric tail and
pulsating aurora. In particular, 3-D simulation of reconnection is innovative
and it is expected to yield new and significant results in this field. Previous
research considered only two- dimensional MHD models of reconnection for the FTE
(flux transfer events). The 3-D simulation is capable of showing longitudinal
effects, thus enabling global studies of the reconnection process. Other aspects
of FTE studies will include electron heat flux, evolution of helical flux tubes
and ground signature. In the magnetotail region, development of saugage and
tearing modes will be studied. A simulation code based on the electromagnetic
particle code will be used for the study of the pulsating aurora. The results
will explain several observed features of the pulsating auroras.
