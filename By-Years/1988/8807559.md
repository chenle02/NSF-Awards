Sea Education Association will underake a Research in Undergraduate Institutions
(RUI) instrumentation acquisition project. Modern oceanographic instrumentation
will acquired and placed in a pool of shared use equipment and made available to
students and visiting users of the Association's Sailing School Vessel,
WESTWARD. After an extensive refurbishment, the vessel will resume undergraduate
education and research projects through SEA's ongoing programs. The new
instrumentation will upgrade educational capabilities by enabling students to
have practical, hands-on experience with modern oceanographic instrumentation,
and will provide visiting scientists with a well equipped facility for
conducting research. Provided instrumentation are basic to physical, biological,
chemical, and geological oceanographic investigations and commonly found on many
research vessels.
