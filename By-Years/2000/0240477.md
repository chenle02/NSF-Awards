This research is developing simulation models that are used to simulate and
analyze the affect of large-scale network attacks and assist in the development
and understanding of potential defensive mechanisms. The work includes the
creation of computer models for a number of network behaviors that are commonly
exploited to maliciously degrade or inhibit access to computer networks and
systems. These models are used to analyze "what happened", "what might have
happened", and "what will happen next time" for common network attacks and
failures. By analyzing past behavior, network researchers and network operators
are able to better design and implement defenses that mitigate the affect of
malicious activities. Recreating the original attach scenario in a simulation
environment allows operators to demonstrate what will happen in the future under
a similar attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The methodology used to accomplish these
goals is to extend the functionality of the existing ns2 and GTNetS simulation
environments to allow for simulation analysis of DDOS attacks. These additions
allow researchers to include end--system resource limitations for memory, CPU,
and kernel resources into the simulation scenarios, and give a realistic picture
of the affect of various attack scenarios on more than just network traffic
load.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, using these models, interfaces to existing
security analysis tools, such as tcpreplay, allow for detailed study of actual
systems behavior while under attack scenarios defined and modeled by the
simulators. Thus, any live system can be subjected to a variety of attacks in a
controlled, but highly realistic environment.
