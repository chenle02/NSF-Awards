&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this research involves four goals: First, to develop
catalytic processes that involve the alkylation of nickel enolates within a
metallacycle framework. Second, to develop total synthesis applications of [3+2]
alkylative cycloaddition of enals and alkynes. Third, to develop conjugate
addition procedures that do not require preformed organometallic nucleophiles.
Fourth, to study the role of organozincs and related species in accelerating the
rate of nickel-catalyzed processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the
Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr.
John Montgomery in the Department of Chemistry at Wayne State University.
Professor Montgomery will focus his work on development of new processes that
involve the generation and functionalization of nickel enolates. The research
will advance the fields of nickel catalysis, conjugate addition chemistry and
transition metal enolate chemistry in general. The project has potential for
broader impact in the pharmaceutical industry and the project serves as an
excellent training ground for undergraduates, graduate students and
postdoctorals. The inclusion of underrepresented minorities to the project will
be stressed.&lt;br/&gt;
