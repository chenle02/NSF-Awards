Professor Greenberg will continue his investigations of the properties of
Selmer groups and their connections with values of certain L-functions that
occur naturally in number theory and algebraic geometry. Three seemingly
separate fields of modern mathematics meet in this project: Number Theory,
Algebraic Geometry, and Analysis. Number Theory means the study of the whole
numbers, static and discrete; Algebraic Geometry began with the study of the
relations and motions of constructs like lines and planes, but has taken on an
ever more abstract and algebraic tone in recent years; Analysis refers to that
broad region of mathematics that is related to Calculus. That modern
arithmetical algebraic geometry is drawing from these three fields and
simultaneously making contributions to them is one of the most exciting
developments in mathematics today.
