In this award, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the
Division of Chemistry, Professor Thomas Wenzel of Bates College and his
undergraduate student researchers will be supported to synthesize and
characterize new kinds of chiral NMR shift reagents. The kinds of reagents that
Prof. Wenzel and his students create will enable chemists to rapidly determine
the enantiomeric purity of newly synthesized
compounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chiral molecules are molecules that have
"handed" symmetry. They differ in structure from each other only in the sense
that they are mirror images of each other. Since they have identical chemical
structures, except for their handedness, it is difficult or impossible to use
analytical techniques like NMR to assess the enantiomeric purity of mixtures of
these compounds. Professor Wenzel and his students are interested in designing
reagents that will interact with different optical isomers to different extent,
which will cause differences in the NMR spectra for the different isomers. This
work has important applications in the analysis of pharmaceuticals. The
undergraduate students working on this project will gain useful experience in
carrying out the physico-chemical characterization of these interesting
molecules, and they will be prepared for further study in the chemical sciences.
