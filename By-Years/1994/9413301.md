ABSTRACT CTS-9413301 X. C. Zeng, U. of Nebraska, Lincoln The objective is to
develop a nucleation theory based on statistical mechanics (density-functional
approach and the Monte Carlo simulation) which would agree with the experimental
facts previously unexplained by other nucleation theories. The rate of
nucleation in both gases (droplet formation) and liquids (cavitation, boiling),
as well as related characteristics such as critical supersaturation and the
tensile strength, will be determined . Five types of fluids systems will be
investigated to test the theory. Together with Dr. D. V. Oxtoby (University of
Chicago), the P. I. has proposed an original approach, which may lead to
fundamental advances in the field of nucleation. The nucleation theory to be
developed in this project has relevance on the formation of hazardous aerosols,
photochemical smog, acid rain, green house effect in the troposphere, cloud
formation and in other areas of environmental science. A second area of
relevance is in materials synthesis form aerosol precursors. ***
