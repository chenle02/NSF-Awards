The Principal Investigator will spend the 1992-93 academic year in the
Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Arizona conducting
field work on the ecology and evolution of nectarivorous bat-cactus interactions
in the Sonoran desert. Two hypotheses will be examined in this research: (1) the
phylogeography of the migratory nectar-feeding bat Leptonycterid curasoae
conforms to the type I pattern of Avise et al. (1987): there should be strong
phylogenetic continuity within subspecies and a strong genetic separation
between subspecies; northern migrants of the Mexican species represent a random
draw from southern populations and (2) sex ratios in the trioecious, bat-
pollinated cactus Pachycereus pringlei vary geographically with the proportion
of females in populations being positively correlated with the availability of
nectarivorous bats. The P.I. will use mtDNA techniques to test the first
hypothesis and observational techniques to test the second hypothesis. When not
in the field he P.I. will work in the Laboratory of Molecular Evolution and
Molecular Systematics to learn molecular techniques (e.g. mtDNA and cpDNA
restriction site analysis) and methods of phylogenetic analysis. These
techniques are essential for future studies of the historical ecology of bat-
plant interactions in New World desert ecosystems.
