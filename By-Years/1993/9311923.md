9311923 Kaufman The goal of the proposed internship is to develop a systematic
approach to identifying models of gas turbines from operating data records.
There are data records. There are two primary reasons for carrying out system
identification: 1. Developing better controllers 2. Refining the physical models
To achieve the first objective, we will try to obtain simplified models that
will capture enough details of the system dynamics to enable us to design robust
controllers. The second objective feeds into a larger development project at GE
which involves building better models for the gas turbine system . The results
of the system identification task will help in refining the dynamic and steady
state characteristics of the models, thereby improving our understanding of the
physical process. ***
