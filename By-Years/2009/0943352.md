The rice receptor-like kinase, XA21, is a key recognition determinant in the
innate immune response, a pathogen defense pathway widely conserved between
plants and animals. Few proteins that transduce the rice innate immune response
have been characterized. For this reason the isolation of a protein from an in
vivo XA21 complex, called BiP (luminal binding protein, also called glucose
regulated protein 78 (GRP78)), is particularly important. BiP is an endoplasmic
reticulum (ER)-located member of the family of heat shock protein (HSP) 70
chaperones. In BiP3-overexpressing rice plants, XA21-mediated resistance is
compromised and XA21 stability is significantly decreased. These results
indicate that BiP3 regulates XA21 protein stability and processing and that this
regulation is critical for resistance.

The long-term goal of this project is to elucidate the mechanisms of innate
immunity, determine the role of BiP in these signaling pathways, and use this
information to develop new strategies for disease control in plants and animals.
The project will use biochemical, cell biological and genetic approaches to
determine how the ER chaperone BiP affects XA21-mediated signaling. Results from
these studies will lead to major advances in understanding biogenesis and
processing of plant and animal sensors of pathogen-derived molecules. Because
XA21 is closely related to sensors controlling innate immunity in other plants
and animals, the expected results will have a broad impact on understanding and
controlling diseases of cereals and humans. The results will have relevance to
other plant-microbe interactions and will be disseminated broadly to enhance
scientific and technological understanding of the mechanisms of innate immunity.

Postdoctoral and graduate students will receive training in bacterial genetics,
biochemistry, and plant pathology. Educational outreach includes a month-long
science and art program to be presented in a local elementary school.
