HICLAS is biological classification data management system designed to store
and retrieve taxonomic data about the relationships between species and other
taxonomic levels. Classifications provide the bases for recording and tracking
information of the tree of life; they are modified, tuned, improved and replaced
as new information about the identity of species on the planet becomes
available. A prototype WWW interface and home page for the database is available
at: http:/aims.cps.msu.edu/hiclas. The focus of this project is to develop a
software interface between the HICLAS system and other existing taxonomic
databases. A set of interactive database interface tools will be built for data
transfer, search and display. In order to establish interoperablity among
various taxonomic database systems the databases that are currently available
are classified into two categories. The first category of databases manages
nomenclatural data with taxonomic hierarchy and associated taxon data including
taxonomic history. The second category of databases manages dendrograms,
especially phylogenetic trees, and related character-taxon data sets for
cladistic and phenetic analyses. A generalized tree-comparison method and a user
query system will be applied to compare classification trees with dendrograms
gathered from different existing systems such as UC Berkeley's SMASCH
(http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/smasch)and Harvard University's TreeBASE
(http://www.herbaria.harvard.edu/treebase).
