The international Union for Pure and Applied Biophysics will hold its 11th
International Biophysics Congress and General Assembly in Budapest, Hungary, in
July, 1993. Biophysics is the application of the laws of physics and chemistry
to the understanding of the fundamental mechanism of life. It concentrates on
subcellular and highly quantitative general questions. Many disciplines,
including medicine, chemistry, neurology, cell physiology, physics and
microscopy overlap to form the biophysical science community. %%% The
International Biophysics Congress is the largest and most comprehensive
international meeting in the field of biophysics research. The Congresses are
highly regarded for the quality and scope of their programs. The scientific
program offers symposia on topics of current interest and scientists of
international reputation have been selected to serve as invited participants.
The standing of U.S. scientists in this field is well known and respected and it
is important that they attend to learn from and discuss their research
experiences with experts from all over the world.
