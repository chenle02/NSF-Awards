The principal investigator will do research on non-linear problems in
Kirchhoff's theory of elastic rods with the goals of (i) finding, for knotted
and unknotted closed rods and open rods subject to terminal forces and torques,
precise analytic representations of equilibrium configurations that show both
isolated points and intervals of self-contact; (ii) deriving practical necessary
and sufficient conditions for an equilibrium configuration to be stable in the
sense that it gives a strict local minimum to elastic energy; (iii) obtaining
insight into the dependence of bifurcation diagrams on knot type and the
presence of intrinsic curvature; (iv) understanding the way in which the
occurrence of plectonemic loops leads to hysteresis in torsion-stretching
experiments for elastic rods and in single molecule manipulation experiments on
DNA. The analytical representations of equilibrium configurations will be
employed to develop a new Metropolis Monte Carlo procedure for evaluating
partition functions for thermally fluctuating DNA molecules subject to specified
constraints and end conditions. Graduate students will participate in this
research which lies, as described below, at the interface between modern
continuum mechanics and molecular biology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each human cell
has a meter of DNA in a nucleus that is less than 1 micron in diameter.
Throughout the life of the cell, its compacted DNA is in a state of rapid, yet
controlled, activity, because the regulation of life functions requires repeated
transcription of appropriate portions of the genetic code into strands of RNA.
The present research project addresses issues in theoretical mechanics that must
be resolved before one can attain full understanding of the way in which highly
compacted DNA is made available for the processes of transcription, replication,
and recombination.
