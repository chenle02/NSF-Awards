This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a
fluidic wave guide biosensor that employs unique physical and structural
features to measure biological pathogens. Preliminary research indicates that
this diagnostic technology promises to achieve a combination of speed,
simplicity, sensitivity and selectivity significantly superior to that attained
by current pathogen detection technologies. The versatility of fluidic
waveguides makes it possible for these systems to employ a wide range of
detection strategies, including probes based on DNA/RNA, antibodies, aptamers,
and immobilized enzymes.

The initial commercial applications of this project will be in research and
development laboratories, and in the food and agricultural industries.
Additional applications are expected in the markets for medical diagnostics and
for homeland defense.
