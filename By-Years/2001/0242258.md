The project will develop a model for secure survivable transaction processing
system. Special emphasis will be on integrity and availability issues for
transactions. The outcome of the research will be a flexible framework for
transaction processing. Specifically the following activities will be carried
out: (i) Investigate how the different types of data and control flow
dependencies impact secure transaction processing (ii) Formalize the notion of
well behaved transaction (iii) Develop the secure multiform transaction model as
a tool-kit approach (iv) Explore recovery issues for secure transactions
