A conference on Numerical Analysis and Domain Decomposition will be held on
January 23-24, 1998, at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. This
conference will focus on current advances in numerical analysis and scientific
computing with particular emphasis on domain decomposition, and important
applications of these techniques to areas such as computational solid mechanics
and fluid dynamics. The conference promises to bring together a very strong
international field of senior scientists with a large number of promising young
investigators from the U.S. The conference provides a great opportunity to
promote areas of critical interest, primarily scientific computing, scalable
parallel algorithm development (including domain decomposition) and fundamental
research in numerical analysis. The continued national investment currently
being made in high performance computer hardware requires a similar investment
in and dissemination of the underlying mathematical tools required to utilize
this equipment. Consequently, the conference will yield strong practical
benefits as wells as theoretical ones.
