9510235 Raufaste This award provides continuing support for the U.S.\Japan Panel
on Wind and Seismic Effects which was established in 1968 to further
collaborative efforts between the two countries. The panel develops knowledge
and technologies that advance engineering design and construction practices. The
panel is comprised of 18 Federal agencies who participate in ten task
committees. The task committees focus on specific national issues, e.g., passive
and active control systems; repair and retrofit of structures; and wind and
earthquake engineering for offshore structures. Annual meetings alternate
between Japan and the U.S. ***
