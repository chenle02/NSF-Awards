Central Michigan University's (CMU) ADVANCE Adaptation project aims to improve
the workplace culture and climate for STEM faculty at CMU. This project is
informed by an institutional self-assessment that identified opportunities to
enhance the institution’s ability to recruit highly qualified STEM faculty to
CMU and to ensure that they are retained and thrive at CMU. The project includes
three initiatives: 1) creating an “advocates and allies” program, 2) ensuring
transparent and fair policies and procedures, and 3) developing more welcoming
faculty recruitment practices and mentoring opportunities. These initiatives are
evidence-based informed by the relevant research literature and/or adapted from
other ADVANCE institutions.

The CMU ADVANCE project will result in several tools that may be beneficial to
other institutions such as a self-assessment checklist, based on the literature,
for departmental by-law reviews and a faculty recruitment and hiring toolkit.
The project has support from institutional leadership and is designed to be
sustainable. This work is expected to build an institutional culture of equity,
transparent policies, and improved recruitment and mentoring practices that will
benefit all faculty and students at CMU.

The NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on
the identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the
full participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions.
Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in policies, processes,
practices, and the organizational culture and climate. ADVANCE "Adaptation"
awards provide support for the adaptation and adoption of evidence-based
strategies to academic, non-profit institutions of higher education as well as
non-academic, non-profit organizations.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
