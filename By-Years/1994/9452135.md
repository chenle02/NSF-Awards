9452135 Craig Hobart and William Smith Colleges will establish a computer
laboratory for high performance molecular modeling. A network information
retrieval system has been designed by the project director that gives convenient
campus-wide interactive graphic access to data in the Brookhaven National
Laboratory Protein Data Bank. This laboratory will facilitate the integration of
molecular modeling of complex bimolecular into course work and research in
undergraduate chemistry, interdisciplinary studies, and biology. The impetus for
this project comes from a desire to make the learning of bimolecular structure a
more active discovery-oriented process for students as well as to expand the
modes through which our students and faculty access the chemical literature. In
course work, students can now be asked to find structural evidence that supports
their claims about biological function, underlying chemical principles that
determine structure, mechanisms for enzyme catalysis, and much more.
