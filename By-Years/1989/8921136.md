This doctoral dissertation research will be done by Nathaniel Wilcox under the
supervision of Professor Telser. It will look at an important anomaly found by
economists and psychologists known as preference reversal. There have been many
alternative (although generally unsatisfactory) explanations for preference
reversal findings in the experimental economics literature. The investigator
will study whether decision cost analysis is a viable explanation, since it
considers computational and constraints faced by agents in utilizing their
preferences for certain kinds of decisions. The analysis will be tested in an
experimental context with 200 subjects using a personal computer.
