9413157 Warner In this project, the PI will collect and analyze samples for
Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) on WOCE Hydrographic Program (WHP) sections, I-5W/I-4
(25degS and 30degS), and I-1 (Zonal section along 8degS), as part of the WOCE
Indian Ocean Expedition (IOE). Specific objectives include a study of
ventilation of Intermediate Waters formed in the Red Sea (I-1), and a study of
mixing rates in Western Boundary Currents (I-5W/I-4), using the CFC's along with
velocity measurements from geostrophic calculations and Acoustic Doppler Current
Profilers. ***
