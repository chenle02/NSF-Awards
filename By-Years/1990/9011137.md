This is a post-event investigation project to learn engineering lessons from
the Loma Prieta earthquake (October 1989). The objective of this project,
conducted in companion between the University of Texas (UT) and the H. J.
Degenkolb Associates (HJD) is to study the performance of industrial buildings
and their contents during the Loma Prieta earthquake. The primary focus will be
on facilities in high- tech industries. The data gathered will be used to
examine structural design criterial associated with providing safety and life.
The requirements that should be given to maintenance of operations when
designing or retrofitting a structure will be defined quantitavely. The
investigation will involve three major tasks: (1) A field study of damaged
buildings/contents and the work done to restore operations, including cost data
by (HJD and UT), (2) Gather details of selected existing structures to determine
problem areas and to evaluate the redesigns actually used those proposed for the
structure (HJD and UT) and (3) for selected structures, conduct detailed
analyses of the existing and redesigned structures using models based on
available test data for strengthened or repaired structural elements (by UT). It
is anticipated that the project will make access to data, determine feasibility
of retrofitting to standards, result in improved understanding of vulnerability
of critical industries, and identify long-term experimental and analytical
research needs for operation maintaining and rapid post-event recovery.
