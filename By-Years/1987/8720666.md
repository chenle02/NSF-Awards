This project represents a continuation of research previously supported by NSF
grant EAR7920095, involving fundamental studies of the structures and crystal
chemistry of rock-forming minerals. The experimental aspects of this program
employ single-crystal diffraction methods, transmission electron microscopy, and
spectroscopic methods to characterize the structures of geologically important
low-symmetry complex structures. The major thrust of the current research will
be to employ an essentially ionic model to simulate complex structures and
calculate their energies. These procedures permit the evaluation of the
stabilities of particular structural configuations relative toalternatives, the
examination of the response of a particular structure to changes of temperature,
pressure, or composition, and the examination of the mechanisms of phase
transformations. The success of any particular modeling strategy depends on the
veracity of the interionic pair potentials. Depending on specific objectives,
these may be derived empirically by appropriate fitting to known structure data,
or may be calculated ab initio from fundamental electron density-energy
functionals through the modified-electron-gas formalism. Particular mineral
systems of interest include pyroxenes, for which present MEG-derived potentials
are inadequate; feldspars, particularly the P1 to I1 anorthite transformation;
and cordierite.//
