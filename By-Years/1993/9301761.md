9301761 Ritter The role of moisture in enhancing delamination of model polymer-
bonded systems is studied experimentally and analytically. Model systems in
which the crack driving force and the loading are variable are tested in
differing moisture environments. A range of important adhesives and techniques
for modifying the adhesive bonding on interfaces are examined. A subclass of
adhesives that delaminate by finger-like growth on the interface are included in
the studies. Adhesive properties, treatment of the interface, thickness of the
adhesive layer, and moisture environment are variables under study. Finite
element techniques are employed to model the systems, which can have multiple
cracks and different crack growth rates. Crack shielding in multiple crack
systems and the role of focussed crack process zones in thin layers of adhesives
are considered. %%% Understanding and minimizing the effect of moisture on the
bonding characteristics of these systems is of obvious importance to the
application of polymer adhesives. ***
