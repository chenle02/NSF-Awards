This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institutes (PASI) award, jointly supported by
the NSF and the Department of Energy (DOE), will take place September, 2010, at
the Centro Austral de Investigaciones Cientificas and the Complejo Astronomico
El Leoncito in Ushuaia, Argentina. Organized by Dr. Rolando Garcia from the
National Center for Atmospheric Research, the PASI will address the dynamics and
chemistry of the mesosphere and thermosphere. The proposed institute will
advance knowledge and train particpants in the fundamental problems of
atmospheric and space sciences. The PASI will consist of training/workshop
sessions where current research results will be presented while introducing
state-of-the-art observational and theoretical methods in upper atmosphere
research. Expected outcomes from this PASI include: (a) training participants
from the Americas with the theoretical and practical background to pursue or
continue research careers in atmospheric and space science; (b) identifying
needed instruments for deployment in South America; and (c) promoting
collaborations between researchers to address global challenges. The PASI
sessions will be recorded using audio/video and the results will be disseminated
both through the web and in printed form.
