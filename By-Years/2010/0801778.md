Objective:&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to develop a microfabricated biosensing
platform based on Glucose Binding Protein (GBP) that continuously and reliably
measures glucose levels in the hypoglycemic, normal, and hyperglycemic range.
The platform will consist of three components: a glucose-sensing array based on
the electrochemical detection of glucose using the model enzyme glucose oxidase
(GOx), an independent power supply, and a telemetry system. The performance of
this biosensing array will be compared with that of the well-established GOx
glucose biosensor.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The
project has significance beyond blood glucose monitoring, since identical
miniaturized biosensing platforms can be utilized for other applications with a
wide range of other biosensors. In addition, multiple sensors selective to a
series of analytes can be incorporated in different reservoirs within a single
device, allowing the measurement of multiple analytes. Moreover, this platform
can be utilized as a responsive drug delivery system. Such a system integrates
reservoirs loaded with miniature sensors with drug-containing reservoirs.
Finally, the proposed platforms should result in enabling technologies that will
find applications in individualized medicine.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impact:&lt;br/&gt;The work will involve students at both, the graduate and
undergraduate levels. Such work will foster interdisciplinary interactions and
will provide the students with the necessary skills and knowledge for the design
and development of novel biotechnologies. The investigators plan to broadly
disseminate the results of this work and raise the awareness of the general
public in diabetes research, biosensing, hybrid systems, and device
miniaturization. This will be accomplished through participation in workshops
and outreach programs. The newly developed technologies will be highlighted in
bioengineering courses.&lt;br/&gt;
