A major obstacle to delivering the increasingly complex software systems that
society demands is the resource drain from maintaining existing systems. The
high expense of maintenance is related to the tendency of software quality to
decline over time. Maintenance is often performed under tight resource
constraints, with the minimal amount of effort required. Typically, there is a
gap between this minimal amount of work and the amount required to maintain the
software's quality. This gap can be viewed as a type of debt, which brings a
short-term benefit (usually shorter release time) but which might have to be
paid back, with ?interest? (decreased productivity), later. Many practitioners
find this metaphor intuitively appealing and it is already transforming the way
that long-term software maintenance is viewed. But its lack of a sound
theoretical basis, empirically-based models, and practical implementation hinder
its ability to transform how maintenance is done. Thus the contribution of this
work is to provide empirically based models describing, and validated mechanisms
for managing, technical debt. This project also supports the PI's activities in
mentoring a diverse population of students, as well as UMBC's nation-wide
prominence in the advancement of women and minorities in science and technology.
