The research supported under this award is aimed at fundamentally advancing our
understanding of the Langlands functoriality conjecture. The Langlands
functoriality conjecture is a profound unifying force in modern mathematics.
Though largely open, even what is currently known has consequences that ripple
throughout number theory, representation theory, algebraic geometry, and even
mathematical physics. The basic objects of study are automorphic
representations. Automorphic representations are defined using locally symmetric
spaces, which are highly symmetric spaces that can be thought of as arbitrary
dimensional drums. Every sound on a drum is a superposition of pure tones and
automorphic representations are analogous to these pure tones. These are very
complicated objects. Every locally symmetric space has a comparatively simple
invariant called an L-group, and the functoriality conjecture predicts that when
one can relate L-groups one can relate (the far more complicated) automorphic
representations. The PI will also train graduate students in this area of
research and is involved in mentoring activities at all levels from high school
through to post-doctoral.

Using relations between L-groups one defines functions called L-functions, and
proving L-functions are "nice" is enough to prove Langlands functoriality. This
proejct will develop new techniques to prove that L-functions are nice. The
oldest tool available for proving L-functions are nice is the Poisson summation
formula familiar from Fourier analysis, signal processing, etc. The PI and B.
Liu have recently discovered generalizations of the Poisson summation formula
that are the first of their kind. The more particular goal of the research is to
extend and exploit these generalizations with the aim of studying triple product
L-functions in higher rank. Using converse theory as developed by Cogdell and
Piatetski-Shapiro many cases of Langlands functoriality can be reduced to the
study of triple product L-functions so this is of fundamental importance.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
