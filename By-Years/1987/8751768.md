The Lawrence Hall of Science will be launching with this grant a three year
dissemination effort designed to bring Great Explorations in Math and Science
(GEMS), an activity-based science curriculum, into elementary and middle school
classrooms nationwide, and to help determine the effectiveness of such a
dissemination model. GEMS is a series of thirty teacher's guides to activities
that are exciting and fun yet meet the content and process objectives of school-
based science. GEMS activities have been extensively tested and improved by
classroom teachers. They can be used to supplement or replace existing
curricula, and require only easily accessible materials. Dissemination will be
through orientation workshops to 2000 individual teachers and teacher educators
across the nation who already implement activity-based materials in the
classrooms or who are interested in improving the teaching of elementary school
science.
