Professor Xia proposes to continue his investigation of dynamics of Hamiltonian
systems. One of the most important problems in Hamiltonian dynamical systems is
whether orbits in typical systems are stable. The proposed research will address
these problems, with research topics such as Aubry-Mather theory, Arnold
diffusions, chaotic behaviors and Newtonian $n$-body problem. The ultimate goal
is to show that typical near integrable Hamiltonians in higher dimensions are
topologically unstable.

The proposed research concerns the stability problems in Hamiltonian dyanmics.
Hamiltonian dynamical systems model many systems arising from classical
mechanics, celestial mechanics and physics. These problems has a long history,
going back to Poincare and Birkhoff. A typical question one often asks is the
following: Is our solar system stable? One of our goals is to find an answer to
this and a large class of related questions. With recent progresses in the
theory of modern dynamical systems, we understand much better the chaotic nature
of typical systems. However, the stability problem remains open except in some
special cases and it is one of the most important areas of study, from both
theoretical point of view and wide applications it finds in various physical
systems.
