The Quality Education for Minority Network (QEM) will hold a workshop for
Minority Serving Institutions that may submit a proposal to the Math and Science
Partnership (MSP) program. Minority Serving Institutions play an important role
in teacher preparation and development. Partnerships between these Institutions
and school districts through the MSP program could substantially enhance the
quality of education in the schools which serve proportionally high percentages
of minority students. These workshops will help the MSP program at NSF achieve
its goal of diversifying its awardees and the children served by them.
