9408295 Pascal Three projects will be studied: (1) the use of nonplanar aromatic
compounds as conformational switches, (2) the use of nitrogen-halogen donor-
acceptor interactions in aromatic compounds, sometimes in combination with
hydrogen bonds, for the control of molecular conformation and molecular
association in the solid state and in solution, and (3) the synthesis of
conformationally rigid, chiral molecular cavities. This grant from the Organic
Dynamics Program supports the continuing research of Professor Robert A. Pascal,
Jr. at Princeton University. Molecules will be prepared that will change their
three-dimensional array in a controlled manner upon oxidation or reduction (the
gain or loss of an electron) and by changing acidity. These molecules will form
the basis of molecular switches, which may have practical importance. Another
aspect of the work will directed to a study of attractive interactions between
nitrogen and chlorine atoms in molecules. These interactions will have
importance in the controlled assembly of molecules in solution and the solid-
phase. In the final project, chiral molecular cavities will be prepared which
can act as hosts to other chiral guest molecules. Chiral molecules are related
as one's right and left hand.
