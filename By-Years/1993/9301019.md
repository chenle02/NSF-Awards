9301019 Gould Curriculum materials and software will be developed to make it
easier and more meaningful for faculty to incorporate computer applications into
the upper level undergraduate physics curriculum. These materials would give
students more opportunities to develop their conceptual understanding of the
principles of physics, learn about new developments in research, study areas of
physics not usually taught at the undergraduate level, and apply the principles
of physics to the other sciences and engineering. The proposed materials would
emphasize the unity of physics, its intellectual excitement, and its wide
applicability. The principal investigators have extensive experience in
incorporating computers into the physics curriculum, and the proposed work will
have national and international impact. *** v s t E t- - u D Qaob- 3tiuqib G edd
