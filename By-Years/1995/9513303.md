9513303 Grodzicker This proposal is for partial support of a conference devoted
to progress in the use of the zebrafish as a subject for studies in the
development of the nervous system. The zebrafish has emerged in recent years as
a model system with which to analyse the developement of the central nervous
system at structural, biochemical, and genetic levels. The forum will bring
together leading established scientists and young scientists to evaluate the
current state of knowledge and explore future prospects.
