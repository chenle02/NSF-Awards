The long range goal of this project is to develop an understanding of the
connections between the structure of complex enzyme-promoted metabolic networks
and their structural capacity to admit more than one steady state. More
generally, the Principal Investigator (PI) is interested in connecting his long
experience with intricate reaction networks to important problems in both cell
biology and biotechnology.
