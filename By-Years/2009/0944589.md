Abstract

High nutrient low chlorophyll regions of the Southern Ocean are conventionally
explained by lack of bioavailable iron (Fe). Various localized sources of Fe in
the Southern Ocean/Antarctic continental margins have been proposed and studied.
In areas removed from obviously localized terrestrial dust sources, air-sea
deposition of aerosol Fe, the particle size distribution of atmospheric Fe and
the variability of aerosol composition, including other atmospheric constituents
that may affect the bioavailability of Fe and micronutrients, is not well
observed. This project seeks to conduct shipboard atmospheric sampling and
analysis from a Chinese ice breaker (R/V Xue Long) passing through the Southern
Ocean on route from Shanghai to Zhongshan Station, Antarctica

Bulk aerosol and size segregated aerosol samples will be measured for their
chemical, physical and morphological properties, Fe content by capillary
waveguide spectrophotometry, elemental composition by mass spectrometry (ICPMS),
along with corresponding water soluble fractions. Precipitation samples, when
encountered, will also be analyzed to derive wet deposition fluxes. Satellite
remote sensing of aerosol dust products and chemical transport modeling
approaches will also be used in data interpretation.
