This two-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research on the
preparation of monolithic, inorganic-organic mesophase materials. The
collaboration involves research groups led by Bradley F. Chmelka at the
University of California, Santa Barbara and Florence Babonneau at the CNRS
(French National Center for Scientific Research) Laboratory for Chemistry and
Condensed Matter at the Pierre and Marie Curie University. The objectives of the
project are to: (1) create macroscopically oriented, mesostructured materials
with compositionally diverse transition metal oxide networks; and (2) create new
bulk mesoscopically ordered inorganic-organic composite materials using block
copolymers. They will employ NMR spectroscopy and sol-gel processing techniques.
The US investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in preparation and
molecular characterization of composites using NMR spectroscopy techniques. This
is complemented by French experience in sol-gel chemistry and processing. The
collaboration takes advantage of synchrotron facilities in Paris. It will
advance understanding of the development of new materials used in separation
processes, catalysis, and opto-electronic devices or processes.
