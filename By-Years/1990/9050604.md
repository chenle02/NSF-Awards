To meet the increasing demand for trained scientists in the field of
biotechnology, this institution has developed a program in biotechnology, in
order to give students both the technical skills and a clear understanding of
the principles of the field. Through two laboratory courses, the students
utilize advanced DNA cloning and protein isolation and purification techniques
to follow a gene from its DNA sequence to its gene product and function. The
purchase of culture growth shakers and equipment for electrophoresis of nucleic
acids and proteins provides the necessary equipment for these lab courses, which
will make the students more competitive for jobs in all facets of biotechnology.
The university will contribute an amount equal to the award.
