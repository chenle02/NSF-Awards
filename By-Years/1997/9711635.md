This project investigates the interaction between text compression and text
retrieval, and aims to build a parallel text retrieval system called Codir that
allows compression-domain text indexing and retrieval. Ultimately, Codir is
expected to be able to efficiently respond to queries consisting of one or
multiple "keywords" connected via Boolean operators, with documents in the text
database that either contain those keywords, or whose "theme" matches the
keywords. The most important feature of Codir is the flexibility it provides to
allow space/time tradeoff and the use of this flexibility in the Dynamic Index
Cache. The two target applications areas to which the technologies developed in
Codir are to be applied to are Web Page Searching and Video Access using
Captioning. The expected contributions of this project to the text retrieval
field are: (1) the performance tradeoffs of integrating text compression and
text retrieval in a unified framework; (2) the detailed characterization of the
access patterns and query statistics of a production-mode use of Codir; (3) the
development of new techniques to support approximate keyword search and frequent
in-place updates to the text database; (4) the incorporation of advanced text
classification techniques such as term weighting and theme indexing into the
implementation framework of Codir. The technologies developed from this project
are expected to be useful to designers of corporate information repository,
internet search engines, and large-scale text-based Web servers.
