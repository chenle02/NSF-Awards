This twelve-month award will support a US-Portuguese workshop on regional
economic indicators models chaired on the US side by Douglas Woodward of the
University of South Carolina and on the Portuguese side by Paulo Guimaraes of
the University of Minho in Portugal. On the European side, the workshop will be
attended by European scholars and practitioners outside of Portugal as well as
those from Portugal. The goal of the workshop is to develop a common methodology
and approach to regional economic indicator modeling, based on work that has
been done at the national level. The US brings to the workshop significant
methodological advances in the development of national economic indicators, as
well as a strong effort to develop regional indicators at the University of
South Carolina. This expertise is matched by similar research efforts at the
University of Minho, as well as the Europeans' broader experience in developing
indicators to track regional differences in Europe. The different research
backgrounds of the participants will enable the design of an integrated approach
to regional economic indicator modeling
