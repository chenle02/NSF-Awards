ABSTRACT

The principal investigator will use valuations, a tool from algebra, to study
local problems in dynamics and analysis in two complex dimensions. Valuations
can be visualized concretely as the different ways that a sequence of points can
converge to the origin. In fact, they parameterize all the local data at a
point. Local phenomena in complex variables, such as the singularity of a
plurisubharmonic functions or the rate of convergence of an orbit to a fixed
point, can be effectively studied by observing the behavior along different
approaches to the point. Valuations constitute a very powerful tool for this
study. The success of the approach depends on the fact that the set of all
valuations at a point in two dimensions is a set that can be understood: it is a
tree in the sense of an infinite collection of real intervals welded together at
branch points so that no cycles appear. This tree is a complicated but
manageable object and its one-dimensionality has striking applications.

Dynamical systems are mathematical models that are widely used in virtually
every science for any situation that undergoes a time-evolution. Sir Isaac
Newton invented calculus, or mathematical analysis, for the study of the
planetary system, a prime example of a dynamical system. Much of mathematics has
developed as a respond to the need to model and understand the world around us.
In this proposal the principal investigator will use a tool from a different
field of mathematics in order to understand certain dynamical systems. One
example of a system that can be studied arises from numerical (iterative)
algorithms, and the study of the dynamical systems in this proposal will give
information on the performance of the algorithms.
