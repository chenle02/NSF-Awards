This award provides continued NSF support the successful Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) program in Evolutionary Biology at the American Museum
of Natural History (AMNH). Drawing on the research and teaching expertise of the
Museum's scientific staff, the program revolves around projects carefully
designed to introduce undergraduates to the excitement, challenge and relevance
of research careers in Evolutionary Biology. The program is a comprehensive,
interactive learning experience that has already proven highly successful in
directing students into science career tracks. In addition to hands-on
experience of research and publication the program includes a series of
roundtable discussions where students discuss their research, "show and tell"
their latest findings, and thrash-out ideas in an informal, friendly setting. A
Special Lecture Series introduces the students to eminent scientists whose
lectures address current debates in evolutionary biology, systematics, the
biodiversity crisis and the role of museum research in these areas. Students
will visit the Peabody Museum at Yale University, and gain insight into the role
of collections in teaching programs. At the end of the program students
participate in a Student Seminar where they give formal slide illustrated
presentations and answer questions from the floor. The AMNH has established a
comprehensive follow-up program which enables them to maintain contact with REU
alumni, provide support and track their careers.
