This award provides renewed funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates
(REU) program at Georgia Institute of Technology. The program will support nine
students per year during a ten week summer research program. Students will
conduct independent research projects on aquatic chemical ecology. Chemical cues
mediate a variety of critical ecological processes, including inter- and
intraspecific competition, predator-prey, host-parasite, and mutualistic
interactions. These cues are used by organisms to locate food, evade predators,
select mates, form aggregations, launch cooperative behaviors, construct social
hierarchies, and choose suitable environments. Chemical signaling appears to be
especially important in aquatic environments, where visual and auditory
transmission of signals is often impeded. Chemically-mediated interactions have
ecological and evolutionary consequences at the individual, population,
community, and ecosystem levels. The program will stress interdisciplinary
research as a tool to solve complex problems and promote an appreciation for the
importance of chemically-mediated processes in basic and applied research.
Recruiting will focus on students from non-PhD granting institutions and
minority students.
