While the concept of conditioning is well understood in numerical linear
algebra, still little is known in that direction for problems beyond equations,
and in particular for variational problems, finite- and infinite-dimensional,
where the presence of constraints complicates the analysis considerably. In
recent years it has become clear that the basic paradigm behind conditioning,
the "distance to good behavior," can be extended to a vast variety of problems,
linking it in one general picture with the development of error bounds measuring
the effect of perturbations and approximations of a problem on its solutions as
well as with the convergence rate of algorithms. The "good behavior" of a
problem is usually understood as a regularity property of a mapping related to
the problem at hand which describes desirable features of its solutions. In this
project we will extend the conditioning paradigm to broad classes of variational
problems, including problems in nonlinear programming, calculus of variations,
and optimal control. This task requires background work in the general area of
variational analysis as well as the development of highly technical tools for
tackling specific problems.

This project aims to establish theoretical foundations for conditioning of
variational problems through rigorous analysis of regularity properties of
mappings associated with such problems. The project will lead to a better
understanding of the interplay between the theoretical features of a problem and
the actual computation of solutions. Furthermore, it has the potential to have a
direct impact on the scientific computing of variational problems, by providing
tools for the development of preconditioning techniques and, consequently, new
fast and efficient algorithms for solving large-scale problems that appear in
science and technology.
