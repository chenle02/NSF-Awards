This grant supports a symposium on martensitic phase transformations, ICOMAT-92,
to be held in Monterey, California, July 20-24, 1992. Several topics are to be
covered in the conference, including the physics of the martensite phase
transformation, mathematical modeling, bainitic transformations, the shape
memory effect, crystallography, microstructure, and the properties of
martensites. Applications of materials with martensitic transformations are also
considered. The proceedings are to be published in a volume that consists of the
technical papers accepted for the conference. %%% Martensites are used in a
number of materials systems, including shape memory alloys, steels,
ferroelectrics, and tough ceramics and cermets. The conference highlights these
applications and looks at other possible areas for use.
