This project will analyze hydrothermal samples previously collected from 9
degrees north on the East Pacific Rise, and from the North Cleft segment and
Axial seamount on the Juan de Fuca Ridge. The common theme among these
hydrothermal vent sistes is that all three are associated with active manga
chambers. Gas chromatographic methods will be used to analyze the samples for
carbon dioxide, methane, hydrogen, nitrogen, and argon.
