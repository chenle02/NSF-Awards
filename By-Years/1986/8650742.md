The objective of this project is to provide undergraduate students at the
University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point with modern instrumental capabilities
necessary to support both laboratory coursework and student research projects. A
Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer will be used by
undergraduates for laboratory coursework in advanced organic, advanced
inorganic, analytical, physical, and polymer chemistry. In addition, a number of
students will use Fourier transform NMR techniques in their research projects.
