The objective of this project is to study and control bone cell-biomaterial
interactions. The specific objectives of this project are to: (1) optimize and
characterize methods to chemically modify biomaterial surfaces with bioactive
ligands, (2) investigate protein interactions with chemically modified
biomaterials, (3) examine focal adhesion formation and subsequent functions of
osteoblasts and osteoclasts cultured on chemically-modified biomaterials, and
(4) incorporate mentored student-teaching and active learning opportunities into
biomedical engineering courses on cell-biomaterial interactions. &lt;br/&gt;
