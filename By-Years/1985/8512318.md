A radial flow hollow fiber mammalian cell culture system is to be used for
continuous culture of non-anchorage dependent murine hybridoma. Continuous
production of monoclonal antibodies is being investigated. Hybridoma cell lines
PM-81 and AML-2-23 are used for mass culture and monoclonal antibodies
production studies. The project also evaluates the feasibility of ;itin situ;ro
membrane separation of antibodies, and investigates the long-term stability of
the culture and antibodies production. Analysis is complemented by mathematical
models which incorporate hydrodynamics, membrane transport, and transient
behavior of culture systems.
