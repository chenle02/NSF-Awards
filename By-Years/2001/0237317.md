Sensory inputs to the brain are modulated by excitatory and inhibitory activity
even at the first central synapses where peripheral inputs contact central nerve
cells. In the somatosensory system of vertebrates, for touch, heat and pain
detection, spinal afferent nerves carrying incoming sensory information
terminate in the spinal cord structure called the dorsal horn, where they
synapse on central spinal neurons. One of the neurotransmitter compounds, a
peptide called Substance P ('SP'), has traditionally been considered to have
only excitatory effects in the dorsal horn, though there have been some
inferential suggestions of inhibitory effects. This project presents a novel
challenge to the traditional view, with direct tests based on recent evidence
that SP may increase inhibitory synaptic activity in the dorsal horn.
Electrophysiological recordings using the powerful technique of patch-clamping,
coupled with new cellular labeling techniques, allow studying cellular and
synaptic mechanisms by which SP produces inhibitory activity in the dorsal horn.
Results will have a substantial impact in challenging a traditional dogma; the
importance extends beyond somatosensory neuroscience to modulation in other
senses, and to modeling neuronal circuits. This project also has teaching and
interdisciplinary training components for graduate students, including
international collaborations with Japan.
