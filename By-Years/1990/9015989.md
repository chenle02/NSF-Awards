The in situ generation of lubricating carbonaceous films on rubbing surfaces at
elevated temperatures will be evaluated. In the first part of the study it was
proven feasible to catalyze formation of such films from combustion gases and
other carbonaceous gases on surfaces containing nickel and on the surfaces of
certain common ceramics when they are subjected to tribological interactions.
This part of the study aims at determining the nature of the carbonaceous films,
their formation parameters and their tribological properties.
