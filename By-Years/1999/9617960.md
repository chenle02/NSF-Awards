ABSTRACT OCE-9617960 Denitrification rates in continental shelf sediments are
globally significant in that they affect nutrient availability in surface waters
of the ocean, modulate oceanic productivity and influence atmospheric carbon
dioxide concentrations. Classical approaches to determine these rates are
limited, since nitrogen fluxes cannot be accurately estimated from wide areas of
the coastal ocean where rates are moderate or low, and these regions may be more
important globally than those areas already identified with high rates. The
objective of this proposal is to expand our ability to measure denitrification
rates in areas of low or moderate nitrogen fluxes. The approach to be employed
by the principal investigator is to use a more precise mass spectrometric
technique, where not only nitrogen, but nitrogen/argon ratios are measured in
order to determine more accurately nitrogen fluxes in sediment cores collected
from test sites in the Gulf of Maine region. The principal investigator is a
leading pioneer in studies of the global nitrogen cycle, and advances based upon
this new method should expand significantly our ability to identify and quantify
global sources and sinks of nitrogen in marine systems. Christensen
