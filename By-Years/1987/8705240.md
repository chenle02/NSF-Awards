Researchers at the University of Illinois-Urbana will purchase a hypercube
multiprocessor. The equipment will be used for research in computer science,
including the following three research projects: (1) Design and implementation
of sophisticated computer-aided design tools for VLSI that can run efficiently
on the Hypercube multiprocessor. Specifically, tools will be developed for cell
placement, wire routing, timing, logic and fault simulation, circuit extraction
from mask layouts, and automatic test generation. (2) Intelligent heuristic
searches for artificial intelligence applications. Strategies for parallel
processing of heuristic searches on the Hypercube will be developed. Also to be
considered will be program restructuring for parallel evaluation of logic
programs. (3) Performance evaluation of the Hypercube system.
