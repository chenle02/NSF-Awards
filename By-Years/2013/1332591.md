Jackson State University will investigate the effects of the proper levels of
scaffolding for cyber-enabled collaborative learning on academic performance and
skill development of African American STEM students and identify social and
cognitive factors that can contribute to their achievement gains through cyber-
enabled collaborative learning. The PIs will test the hypothesis that
scaffolding cyber-enabled collaborative learning can promote shared construction
of knowledge and regulation of learning processes for African American students
and, thus, lead to improvement of their deeper understanding of important
concepts and higher-order skill development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
will expand the current knowledge about cyber-enabled collaborative learning by
conducting the research in a STEM context, particularly examining the effects of
instructional guides in an authentic STEM education setting for African American
students. Prior research on collaborative learning was conducted mainly on K-12
students or liberal arts college students. The study could add new perspectives
in instructional strategies for STEM faculty to increase student engagement and
persistence and improve academic performance in STEM and non-STEM disciplines.
