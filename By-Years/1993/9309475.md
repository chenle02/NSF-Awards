9309475 Lam This research will carry out queuing and delay analysis when a
number of traffic streams are multiplexed in several stages. The first step will
be to model the output process from a single first stage asynchronous transfer
mode (ATM) multiplexer. Various models will be considered. Based on these
models, performance measures will be investigated including cell loss
probability, delay and delay jitter experienced in multistage multiplexing. The
aim is to derive algorithms and deterministic or stochastic bounds for these
performance measures. Both exact and asymptotic methods will be used. The
performance of multiplexing traffic streams in several stages will be compared
to the results obtained using a single giant (one stage) multiplexer. This
research is of considerable importance in the formulation of requirements for
Broadband Integrated Digital Networks (BISDN) equipment since cell loss or cell
delay must be at a level acceptable from network performance and service
perspectives.
