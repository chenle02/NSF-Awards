Since the introduction of computer science and engineering courses in electrical
engineering curriculum in the 60's, the RF and microwave engineering courses
have gradually been omitted from most of the EE programs. Recently with the
development of cellular telephone, cable TV, satellite communication, mobile
radio and TV, personal communication systems, interactive video, distant
learning, and other wireless communication systems, several universities have
reintroduced new RF and microwave engineering courses in their electrical
engineering programs. It requires a special effort and some innovation to offer
RF and microwave engineering courses at the undergraduate level with extensive
hands-on laboratory experiments. Through this project, a modern laboratory for
the computer-aided design, fabrication, and testing of RF and microwave circuits
is being established.
