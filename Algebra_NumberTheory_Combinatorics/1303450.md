The goal of the proposed project is to investigate the p-adic aspects of the
Langlands program. At the heart of the Langlands program is a conjectured
reciprocity law relating automorphic representations of a certain type (namely
those whose Langlands parameter at the archimedean place is ``integral'', or
``algebraic'') to Galois representations arising from the etale cohomology of
algebraic varieties over number fields (i.e. Galois representations that are
``motivic''). A basic fact in the theory of Galois representations is that such
representations are naturally parametrized by certain p-adic analytic spaces
(Galois deformation spaces), in which the motivic Galois representations float
in a much larger sea of non-motivic representations. Studying this entire sea of
Galois representations is an interesting and important problem, which turns out
to be of fundamental importance even if one is ultimately interested only in the
motivic points of this space, since most successful approaches to establishing
reciprocity have involved p-adically interpolating information across the sea of
all Galois representations. In the case of two-dimensional representations of
the absolute Galois group of Q, the proposer has proved the desired reciprocity
in most cases, by establishing a local-global compatibility result relating the
p-adically completed cohomology of modular curves to the p-adic local Langlands
correspondence of Breuil, Colmez, and Paskunas. The proposed project involves
generalizing these results to other contexts, such as to representations of
the/absolute Galois group of a totally real field. Since there isno construction
of a p-adic local Langlands correspondence in this case, a major part of the
project will involve constructing such a correspondence.

Number theory is the branch of mathematics that studies phenomena related to
properties of whole numbers. A typical number theoretic question is to determine
the number of whole number solutions of some equation of interest. The answers
to such questions can often be encoded in certain mathematical functions known
as L-functions. The mathematician Robert Langlands has developed a series of
conjectures (or mathematical predictions) regarding L-functions, which predict
that any L-function should arise from another kind of mathematical function
called an automorphic form. (Number theorists refer to Langlands conjectured
relationship between L-functions and automorphic forms as a ``reciprocity
law''.) Langlands developed an array of powerful representation theoretic
methods to study his conjectures. These are methods that exploit the many
symmetries of automorphic forms and L-functions to analyze their mathematical
properties; these methods have been incorporated into a body of mathematics
known as ``the Langlands program''. A more recent approach to the study of
automorphic forms and L-functions is the use of p-adic methods. These are
methods that involve using divisibility properties with respect to some fixed
prime number p to study the Taylor series coefficients of the automorphic forms
and L-functions. Recently, the representation theoretic methods and p-adic
methods have begun to be unified into a so-called ``p-adic Langlands program''.
The proposer aims to develop new results and methods in the p-adic Langlands
program, and to use them to establish new results about L-functions, and, in
particular, to establish new reciprocity laws.
