The cytochrome c peroxidase:cytochrome c complex is physiologically important
and functions in long distance electron transfer reactions. Important progress
in elucidating the details of the functioning of this complex have been made.
The projected work will: 1) elucidate the rate of electron transfer between the
peroxidase oxidized intermediates and ferrocytochrome c and 2) study the rate of
electron transfer in cytochrome c peroxidase:cross linked with yeast cytochrome
c isozymes and/or tuna cytochrome c. Various physical techniques will be used,
as well as molecular graphics modelling, designed to compare the possible
complex geometries and their dependence on sequence variations in the
cytochromes c.
