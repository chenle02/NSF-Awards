9412991 Bradley The principal objective of this project is to interact with
industrial personnel during the development of a model-based knowledge system
for casting design and manufacturability assessment. The work will extend and
integrate ongoing applied and fundamental research within a framework for the
intelligent design and production of castings. Key elements of the project
include object-orientation to model the casting process; feature-based design;
integration of process control and casting design; and industry-university
interaction within the foundry environment. By integrating design and
manufacturing, the model-based knowledge system will facilitate concurrent
engineering and lead to more productive interaction among foundry personnel and
between the foundry and its customers. This will help ensure the
manufacturability of customer designs prior to costly production trials, improve
productivity and product quality.
