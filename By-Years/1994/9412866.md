A concurrent computational and experimental study will be conducted which
focuses on explaining the physics of vortex breakdown through observing the
kinematics of vortex lines of the flow, as well as their topology in bundles
which constitute the vortex core. To establish the importance of vortex tilting
and stretching in vortex breakdown, axisymmetric swirling flows as well as those
with elliptic cross sections will be studied. To support the theory a novel
experimental device is proposed which consists of a large Plexiglass sphere
containing a smaller sphere and oil filling the large gap. The inner sphere is
suspended and spun magnetically. The device allows for nonaxisymmetric spinning
of the inner sphere and is fully nonintrusive: neither the hardware nor the
visualization method (based on laser velocimetry) intrude into the flow. Vortex
breakdown has proven to be a problem of fundamental interest with applications
to areas as diverse as air-traffic safety, flame holding in swirl combustors as
well as supersonic combustors, and laminar-flo w control. A vast body of
literature has been devoted to the study of this phenomenon; however there is
still no consensus as to its underlying physics.
