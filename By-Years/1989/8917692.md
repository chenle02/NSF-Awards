Time dependent mixing and stratification will be studied in a partially mixed
estuary using a mixed-layer model with second moment turbulent closure. A one-
dimensional version will first be examined for the response of the water column
to wind and tidal forcing. Then a two-dimensional extension will include spatial
variability of the forcing additionally including fresh water.
