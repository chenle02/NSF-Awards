This research is in the broad area of complex algebraic geometry and involves
three investigators. The unifying theme of the research is the geometry of
subvarieties of moduli spaces. Carlson will study subvarieties of the Griffiths
period domains i.e. variations of Hodge structures. Clemens will consider
subvarieties of a fixed variety and their Abel-Jacobi theory. Toledo will
examine the metric and function-theoretic properties of subvarieties of
symmetric spaces as well as of more general domains. These subjects are closely
related and much work of a joint nature will result. The subject of this
proposal is algebraic geometry, the study of the geometric objects obtained as
the set of solutions of systems of polynomial equations. The emphasis here is
the study of their geometric (as opposed to their algebraic) properties. It
still represents a nice blend of algebraic, analytic and, of course, geometric
ideas. The three individuals work together as a powerful team to produce much of
great interest.
