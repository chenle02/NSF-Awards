9503505 Taylor Understanding the processes that lead to continental extension
and crustal failure, and subsequent sea-floor spreading are primary questions
being addressed by the marine geological community. The present project is
examining these processes in the Woodlark Basin in the western Pacific. Primary
data for this study was collected on a field program under previous support and
includes side-scan data, detailed bathymetry, seismic reflection, gravity and
magnetic measurements. Initial analyses of these data are highly promising. The
present award will support completion of analyses, publication, and student
theses. These additional analyses will also provide fundamental data for
planning drilling in the region by the Ocean Drilling Program.
