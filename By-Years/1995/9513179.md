9513179, PI-Johnson: The main thrust of the research is in the accurate
calculation of the energies and transition matrix elements of many-electron
atoms and atomic ions. This includes parity non conserving transitions in Cs,
Th, Pb and Bi, which are of interest in quantum chromodynamics, and the study of
quantum electrodynamic effects in highly charged ions and atoms.
