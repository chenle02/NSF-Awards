9627890 Arritt The goal of this project is to understand and estimate
quantitatively the linkage between large-scale atmospheric circulation anomalies
and the atmospheric component of the regional hydrological cycle associated with
Midwestern summertime floods and droughts. Between 1979 and the present, there
were four major flood and three major drought years. For those year, the
principal investigators will carry out (1) diagnostic analyses of global
circulation patterns in National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)
global reanalyses, supplemented by rain-gauge precipitation data for the
midwestern region and (2) simulations with NCAR's MM5 regional model, run in
climate mode and driven by large-scale forcing from the NCEP analyses, focused
on exploring regional water vapor fluxes and the mechanisms relating them to the
large-scale forcing. Special attention will be given to the role of the
southerly low-level jet in defining the water vapor transport and flux
divergence. For one of the years of interest, an important additional source of
high resolution data will come from specially processed wind profiler data.
These studies are critical to understanding the hydrological cycle and will
contribute to the goals of the Global Energy and Water Experiment (GEWEX) of the
World Climate Research Program. This project is supported under NSF's Water and
Energy: Atmospheric, Vegetative, and Earth Interactions (WEAVE) Initiative of
the Global Change Research Program. ***
