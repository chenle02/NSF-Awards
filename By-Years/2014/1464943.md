With this award, the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Division of Chemistry is
funding Professor Thomas R. Cundari of the University of North Texas to use
advanced scientific computing to understand the chemistry of "green" metal
catalysts. "Green" replacements for precious metals catalysts are increasingly
sought by the scientific and industrial communities as concerns grow for the
geopolitical realities, high costs and ecological issues associated with these
metals. In considering catalytic chemistry alternatives, advanced scientific
computing permits the comparative study of economical, earth-abundant metals
with oft-employed expensive, rare transition metals. The goal is to establish
the proper computational tools, such that these metals might be compared as
catalyst candidates with some level of predictability. Particular emphasis is
being given to catalysts for formation of bonds between the elements of carbon
and nitrogen as well as carbon and oxygen, which are important reactions for
transforming hydrocarbon resources from petroleum and natural gas into more
valuable chemical compounds. Students participating in this project are
receiving cutting edge training for future careers in the STEM
workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Cundari is performing computational
chemistry studies on potential earth-abundant catalysts based upon metals from
the middle transition series. The research project is focusing on catalysts for
the activation and functionalization of hydrocarbons, especially those found in
natural gas. The essential chemical characteristics that determine the preferred
pathway carbon-hydrogen bond activation and subsequent carbon-X (X = nitrogen or
oxygen) bond formation (functionalization) are being investigated. Of particular
interest are the studies of several promising new classes of transition metal
complexes, including those for which carbon-hydrogen bond activation can be
triggered by coordination of a Lewis base.
