MacCready 0136760&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds are provided for the development of
two simplified models to be used in an investigation of the adjustment of an
estuary to changes in river flow, wind forcing, and tidal forcing. The simplest
model depends on two bulk parameters representing vertical and longitudinal
stratification while the other is laterally and layer averaged. Further three-
dimensional modeling will be performed with ECOM-si, a modified version of the
Princeton Ocean Model, in simple topographic scenarios. The three-dimensional
model will be verified using data from Willipa Bay and Budd Inlet. The output
from the three-dimensional model will be compared to solutions from the more
simplified models and used to verify the latter. Laboratory modeling will also
be undertaken. The results of this research will be quickly transferred to
students in the PI's courses. The PI has close collaborations with state
environmental managers intends rapid technology transfer to practical
applications, as well.&lt;br/&gt;
