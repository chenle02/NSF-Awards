This research aims to establish the physical and chemical principles which
underlie in the kinetics of the phase transition of polymer gels; phase
transitions are a phenomenon universally found in gels where they reversibly
swell or shrink in volume by as large as 1000 times in response to changes in
temperature, solvent compositions, pH, ionic strength, electric field, or light.
The research will examine the time course of the shape, local network density
and local strain of gels of various sizes and chemical composition in regards to
the kinetic processes of a phase transition. Kinetics of a swelling or shrinking
process of a gel with respect to a small change in volume have already been
established; it was uniquely characterized by the collective diffusion
coefficient of polymer network. Whether or not a similar theory applies to the
kinetics of phase transition where the gel volume changes by 3 orders of
magnitude is unknown. To examine such a hypothesis and establish the principles
of kinetics of phase transition, these viscoelastic quantities will be
independently determined within the entire phase diagram of gels. Friction
coefficient and shear modulus will be determined by microscopic methods. Dynamic
light scattering and fluorescence photobleaching recovery spectroscopy will be
used. The mechanism of formation and evolution of patterns that appear in gels
undergoing a phase transition will be elucidated so as to formulate the equation
of motion that govern the kinetic processes of gels. Finally, it is hoped to
clarify the origin of structural inhomogeneities within gels which influence
substantially their mechanical, optical, and viscoelastic properties.
