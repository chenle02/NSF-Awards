Seismic data recorded by the Cascadia Initiative array will be analyzed to look
at evolution of the ocean lithosphere from ridge to trench on the Juan de Fuca
plate. The determined structure will be related to along-strike variation in
down-going plate properties (apparent hydration and whether it occurs in the
young and/or older plate, thermal structure, segmentation) and seismic behavior
along Cascadia subduction zone. Shear wave structure will be determined from
surface waves and ambient noise analysis; receiver functions will indicate the
depth distribution of interfaces between contrasting properties. Surface wave
results will provide the starting model for the receiver function analysis,
which will also use results from the COAST study that documented crustal
velocity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A graduate student will receive training in
seismic analysis and Cascadia processes. A portion of the results will provide
context for hazard assessment of the margin, in particular along-strike
variability. In-depth use of the CI community experiment data will take place
and the results of this study is expected underpin a variety of subsequent
geoscience investigations.
