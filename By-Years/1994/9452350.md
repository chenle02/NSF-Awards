9452350 Fried Research-based discovery science generates enormous enthusiasm
among undergraduates. The organic chemistry laboratory sequence is being
remodeled to take this fact into account. This course is populated primarily by
biology majors and chemistry majors. Students are working individually, but
sharing their results within a group of eight students. The research projects
for this lab sequence include the isolation and identification of secondary
plant metabolites, a study of the Claisen-Schmitt formation of chalcones, and an
investigation of substitution reactions. These experiments were chosen in
consultation with the biology department in order to emphasize the important of
chemistry to the study of biology. The students working on these projects are
using instrumentation presently available in the department as well as a GC-MS
and an HPLC. Both of these instruments are greatly enhancing the students'
laboratory experience. In order to provide further connections between biology
and chemistry, both instruments are also being used in the plant biology
courses.
