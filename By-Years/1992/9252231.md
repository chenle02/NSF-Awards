A three dimensional computer-graphics based projector and host- computer are
being installed in the campus planetarium. The Digistar System utilizes
computer-generated graphics to allow students a three dimensional view of the
universe from any vantage point. In addition to enhancements in astronomy
classes, other applications are being developed which include three dimensional
simulation of static and dynamic features such as molecular structure, planetary
tectonics, storm formations and ocean currents for use in chemistry, geology,
meteorology, oceanography and physics. Drafting students using AutoCAD software
on desktop computers are involved in the development of these extended
applications.
