The Principal Investigator will be studying, along with a postdoc, Herbig-Haro
objects and their jets. Herbig-Haro objects are regions excited by shocks from
highly collimated jets that emanate from young stars or star-forming
condensations. Most of these objects emit radiation by the recombination of
matter that has become ionized by the shocks. The goal of the proposed research
is to understand the physics of Herbig-Haro objects by comparing observations in
the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet wavelength ranges with hydrodynamic
radiation models.
