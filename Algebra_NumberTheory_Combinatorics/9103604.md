This award supports the research of Professor J. Wahl to work in algebraic
geometry. He will study the Gaussian map in different situations. Along with his
graduate students, he intends to study the stratification of the moduli space of
curves of genus g by the corank of the Gaussian map of the canonical bundle. The
research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of the oldest parts of
modern mathematics, but one which blossomed to the point where it has, in the
past 10 years, solved problems that have stood for centuries. Originally, it
treated figures defined in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely
polynomials. Today, the field uses methods not only from algebra, but also from
analysis and topology, and conversely it is extensively used in those fields.
Moreover, it has proved itself useful in fields as diverse as physics,
theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics.
