TECHNICAL SUMMARY: Grain growth is one of the most important unsolved riddles in
metals science. It is understood in broad terms how and why it occurs, but the
details necessary to quantitatively predict it remain elusive. This project
takes a unique direction of attacking this unresolved, fundamental question by
investigating the topological mechanisms of grain growth in metals to determine
the influence of grain-size distribution on them. Investigations will use three-
dimensional Monte Carlo computer simulations to explore varied virtual grain
size distributions and interesting grain topologies. Simulations will provide
information where experiments cannot. Experiments will be conducted to examine
grain topologies and size distributions following growth. Serial sectioning will
be used to accumulate three-dimensional data sets. This study will provide
first-time results of the topological and distributional nature of grain growth.
Education and training will be enabled for graduate and undergraduate students,
who will engage in outreach activities at local schools.

NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: Grain growth strongly affects the mechanical properties
of materials and is prevalent in industrial processing, yet many details of its
occurrence are not understood. This project addresses the need to better
understand these aspects. The fundamental mechanisms that produce grain growth
will be explored through a combination and computational simulations and
laboratory experiments. Both approaches will produce three-dimensional sets of
information that will be compared and used for scientific inquiry. An improved
scientific understanding for the mechanisms that govern grain growth in metals
is expected from these studies. Improved scientific understanding will impact
future capabilities to predict and control grain growth in metals and alloys
important to a wide range of technological applications, from bridges to
automobiles to electronics. Education and training will be enabled for graduate
and undergraduate students, who will engage in outreach activities at local
schools.
