Professor Greenberg will continue his work on several problems connected with a
generalized Iwasawa theory. He will study Selmer groups associated to abelian
varieties and to certain families of p-adic representations. Greenberg will also
investigate the phenomenon of trivial zeros of p-adic L-functions in an attempt
to understand more fully the corresponding derivatives of these functions. This
project falls into the general area of arithmetic geometry - a subject that
blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: number theory and geometry. This
combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful, having recently solved problems
that have withstood generations. Among its many consequences are new error-
correcting codes. Such codes are essential for both modern computers (hard
disks) and compact disks.
