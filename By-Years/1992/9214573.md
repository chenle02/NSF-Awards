This award is to acquire a networked infrastructure of imaging equipment. The
equipment will be used in interdisciplinary projects involving the Department of
Engineering at the Colorado School of Mines. The primary use of the equipment is
for visualization of 2 and 3 dimensional fields related to materials,
structures, and flow phenomena. Civil, Mechanical, and Electrical Engineering
will all benefit from this award. The proposed equipment will consist of high
speed graphic processors with associated image capturing and processing
equipment all networked together with high speed links.
