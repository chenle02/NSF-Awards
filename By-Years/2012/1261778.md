The complexity of modern high-end computers has made it exceedingly
&lt;br/&gt;difficult for scientific applications to effectively manage resources
&lt;br/&gt;such as extreme-scale parallelism, single-chip multi-processors,
&lt;br/&gt;and deep hierarchy of shared/distributed caches and memories. In
&lt;br/&gt;particular, as machines and applications have both evolved to become
&lt;br/&gt;complex and massively parallel, compilers have failed to
automatically &lt;br/&gt;bridge the gap between complex software and diverse
hardware platforms.&lt;br/&gt;Optimization models for parallel computing have
lagged far behind &lt;br/&gt;those for serial applications, and conventional
compilers are &lt;br/&gt;increasingly unable to accommodate emerging high-end
architectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research develops a new optimization
model that allows&lt;br/&gt;1) developers to effectively interact with advanced
optimizing &lt;br/&gt;compilers to provide both domain-specific knowledge and
high-level &lt;br/&gt;optimization strategies (e.g., directions to enable new or
choose &lt;br/&gt;amongst differing parallelization strategies); 2)
computational &lt;br/&gt;specialists to easily define arbitrary domain-specific
transformations &lt;br/&gt;to directly control performance optimizations to
their code; &lt;br/&gt;3) architecture-sensitive optimizations to be easily
parameterized &lt;br/&gt;and empirically tuned to achieve portable high
performance.&lt;br/&gt;The optimization model is supported with an integrated
environment &lt;br/&gt;that contains two main components: ROSE, a
C/C++/Fortran2003 &lt;br/&gt;source-to-source optimizing compiler developed at
DOE/LLNL; and POET, &lt;br/&gt;a transformation language together with an
empirical optimization &lt;br/&gt;engine developed at UTSA. This framework
permits different levels &lt;br/&gt;of automation and programmer intervention,
from fully-automated tuning &lt;br/&gt;to semi-automated development to fully
programmable control. The research &lt;br/&gt;targets both the optimization
needs of computational kernels and the more &lt;br/&gt;general requirements of
whole program optimizations. The framework is &lt;br/&gt;integrated as an
external development mechanism for the widely-adopted &lt;br/&gt;ATLAS library
and is connected with empirical tuning research under &lt;br/&gt;DOE SciDAC
program to improve the efficiency of large-scale scientific
&lt;br/&gt;applications.&lt;br/&gt;
