This new proposal requests funds to support the coordination of the NSF Geospace
Environment Modeling (GEM) workshops. The GEM workshops are comprised annually
of a week-long workshop during the summer and a half-day mini-workshop in
conjunction with each Fall American Geophysical Union (AGU) meeting. The next
summer workshop will be held in Snowmass, Colorado in late June 1995. Funds will
support all facets of workshop coordination, including: facility planning,
meeting logistics organization, room and audio-visual rental, student and
scientist travel support, and associated administrative support. The goals of
the workshops are to identify and work toward solutions of outstanding problems
in several focused research areas that will contribute to the ultimate
development of a magnetospheric global circulation model. The goal of the
workshop coordination is to provide organized forums in order to foster the
community-wide discussions and research needed to achieve the GEM initiative
goals.
