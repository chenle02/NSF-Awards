Professor Sunhee Choi of the Chemistry Department at Middlebury College is
supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
for her bioinorganic chemistry studies on the mechanism and kinetics of the
oxidation of guanosine derivatives by Pt(IV) complexes, complexes related to
biologically important anticancer agents. Various Pt(IV) complexes will be
synthesized and characterized. UV-visible spectroscopy, 1H and 31P NMR, HPLC and
mass spectroscopy will be used to determine how the reduction potentials of
Pt(IV) complexes affect the redox kinetics. Results of these studies will
enhance the basic understanding of transition metal/DNA chemistry.

This research will focus on the bioinorganic chemistry studies on the mechanism
and kinetics of the oxidation of guanosine derivatives by Pt(IV) complexes.
Platinum coordination complexes are biologically important anticancer agents.
These bioinorganic chemistry studies will provide molecular level understanding
of the oxidation of DNA by Pt(IV) species and enhance the basic understanding of
transition metal/DNA chemistry. Undergraduate students will receive multifaceted
training in inorganic synthesis and characterization and the use of transition
metal complexes in probing nucleic acid toxicology, and pharmacology.
