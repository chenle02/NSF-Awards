The Seminar on Stochastic Processes 2016 will be held at University of Maryland
College Park from March 16th to March 19th, 2016. This conference is part of a
long-standing series of conferences devoted to probability an stochastic
processes. Past conferences have had major impact on the field, and broad
participation of graduate students and early-career researchers, including
future fields medalists and many world-leading experts in early stages of their
research careers. The conference will be advertised through the Bulletin of the
Institute of Mathematical Statistics and the Notices of the American
Mathematical Society, and the conference website is presented at
http://depts.washington.edu/ssproc/.

The conference will feature current research in the area of probability and
stochastic processes. Researchers will present their new results and there will
be time for open discussions to explore unsolved problem in the field, as well
as a poster session. The format of lectures at the conference is strongly based
on the success of the format of recent Seminars on Stochastic Processes. Five
one-hour lectures and two 90 minute lectures will be delivered by distinguished
speakers.
