Four aspects of the biology of Recent stalked crinoids in the Straits of
Florida are examined as they contribute to understanding paleoecological
processes: 1) niche partitioning of habitat and food among four species
distributed as three sympatric pairs--does it support or refute tiering,
hydrodynamic and food partitioning hypotheses proposed for fossil taxa. Measured
variables include current velocity, stalk height, crown diameter, filter
density, gut contents and available food; 2) larval recruitment contributions to
aggregated versus scattered populations; contributions of recruitment and
relocation of vagile adults in re-establishing aggregations following physical
disturbance; 3) relationship between possible behavioral patterns (feeding,
activity or locomotory patterns or cycles) and variations in current regime and
4) skeletal contributions of Recent crinoids to sediment as an analogue for
depositional processes in ancient crinoidal sediments--analyses of post-mortem
processes and potential preservational biases. Work will be conducted via
submersible, time-lapse cinematography, morphological, photographic and
sedimentological analyses of collected material. Isocrininds represent major
components of macroepibenthic assemblages in the study area and have a fossil
record dating to the Triassic. As such, they represent an excellent analogue for
paleoecological processes.
