This proposal is for an accomplishment based renewal (ABR) that continues the
development and application of algorithms for analysis of seismic wavefields
that was begun with support from two previous NSF grants. The four specific sub-
projects to be included are: 1) the use of tomographic estimation of near-
surface velocity anomalies for statics corrections of crustal/lithospheric
refraction data. 2) simultaneous inversion for 2-D P and S-wave impedance
distributions. 3) simultaneous inversion for P and S-wave velocities, density
and Q.
