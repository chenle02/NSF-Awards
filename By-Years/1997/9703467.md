Proposal Number: ECS-9703467 Principal Investigator: Melinda Piket-May Title:
CAREER: Electromagnetic Modeling and Simulation Electromagnetic theory and
analysis for high frequency design problems such as high speed analog and
digital design, interconnect technology, cellular communications, multipath
propagation and quasioptical systems will be investigated. The research will
focus on embedding the circuit physics of nonlinear circuit devices in the full
electromagnetic field physics of Maxwell's equations as solved by the Finite
Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method. A significant problem with the traditional
FDTD technique is numerical dispersion. In this research the conventional 2-2
FDTD modeling will be interfaced to a modified 2-4 algorithm which mitigates
numerical dispersion in the grid. Problems that are currently computationally
inaccessible because of numerical dispersion will be significantly impacted by
this research. This includes many circuit problems in wireless and optical
applications. A significant part of the educational plan involves a design
oriented freshmen projects course focused on the area of assistive technology.
The students will design and fabricate devices for use as aids to handicapped
individuals within the local community/specialty educational system. In addition
to the design of novel and successful devices, the students also learn problem
formulation and team participation skills. Additionally, emphasis is placed on
careful analysis and re-working of designs which failed to meet criteria for
successful use, as defined by the handicapped client. This work is a significant
contribution to the building of a strong interface between the University of
Colorado Integrative Teaching Laboratory and the local community.
