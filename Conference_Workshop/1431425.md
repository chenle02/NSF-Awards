This award will support participation of speakers and junior researchers in the
2014 Midwest Representation Theory Conference, to be held September 5-7, 2014 at
the University of Chicago. Representation theory developed as a generalization
of classical harmonic analysis, through which functions can be decomposed into
their elementary components, much as a prism breaks light into its spectrum. The
theory found wide applications in physical sciences (such as quantum mechanics)
and in other areas of mathematics (notably number theory and geometry). The
power of the theory comes, in part, from its utilization of algebra and topology
in concert with analysis. This (almost) annual conference has been a source of
important information for experts in the field, and many collaborative efforts
have originated from discussions at these meetings.

This, the 40th anniversary of the original Midwest Conference, will honor the
contributions of Rebecca A. Herb, and it will also be in memory of the Midwest
Representation Theory Conference founder, Paul J. Sally, Jr. (1933-2013). The
invited speakers will all be leaders in the field and will reflect recent
developments in representation theory. We expect speakers will report on recent
progress, including applications to number theory and geometry, and the state of
the Langlands Program. Topics covered may include unitary representations of
reductive Lie groups, Plancherel formula, admissible representations of p-adic
groups, Galois representations, functorial transfer to general linear groups,
Theta-correspondences, orbital integrals, and Fourier transforms. The conference
