Collaborative Research on Learning Technologies Program: Planning Grant for
Center for Collaborative Research in Learning Technologies based at Arizona
State University Arizona State University has been awarded funding in the amount
of $50,000 for a 12 month planning grant for a Center to address the rapid
development of two types of delivery systems - integrated software for science,
engineering, and mathematics education use, and technology improvements for
distributed/distance education. The desired outcomes are to enhance the quality
and accessibility of education at all academic levels, K-16, graduate, and

functioning as team and facilitation of team processing. Partners in this
planning project include Motorola, Intel, Cox Communications, Peoples Choice,
