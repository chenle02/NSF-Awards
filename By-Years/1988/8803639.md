The principal investigator will continue his study of the probabilistic
properties of the resampled sample in the bootstrap methods. The investigation
will extend to bootstraping stochastic processes such as Brownian motion. The
effects of changing the resampling size will be explored. Resampling from a
trimmed empirical rather than the original empirical distribution will be shown
to be better. Limit theorems for bootstraping of the U statistics will be found.
The probabilistic study of the bootstraping phenomena leads to not only
interesting theorems in probability but better bootstraping methods and the
validity for the existing methods.
