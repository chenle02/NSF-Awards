This project follows 300 urban women workers in Bangladesh from 2003-2005 in
order to assess the impact of global and national economic changes on their
types of employment, income-earning strategies, and empowerment. This research
uses quantitative and qualitative methods to generate individual level data
during a period of rapid change in global trade to answer two general questions:
First, what are the macro and individual level determinants of Bangladeshi
women's work histories and their shifts to another sector, staying in the same
sector, or migrating abroad? Second, what are the effects of women's work within
a particular sector, sector shifts, and work history on their empowerment
(resources, agency, and outcomes)? Data are drawn from annual surveys and
quarterly follow-up interviews that explore women's background characteristics,
work, family, migration and life activities. These methods generate work
interval and duration data used in life table and hazard models to estimate
dynamic models that reflect international, national, and individual determinants
of women's work and moves among different types of formal, informal, and
household work over two years. The analyses estimate probabilities of women
staying in one work area and/or their moves to other work that occurred during
changes in trade rules, an important issue for policy makers who seek solutions
to unemployment. This research evaluates the competing claims of World Bank and
other researchers such as Ward, Pyle, Carr, Chen, Pearson, and Kabeer on the
effects of economic restructuring and economic development on women workers.
This project's broader impacts lie in its potential contribution to economic
policy makers, women's rights groups, and scholars interested in understanding
the consequences of global restructuring for women, families, and countries that
depend on garment work; the project also will provide opportunities for
international faculty collaboration and student training in the U.S. and
Bangladesh.
