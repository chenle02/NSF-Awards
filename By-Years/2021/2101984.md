Representation theory studies the realization of groups as linear symmetries.
There are two typical stages: 1) finding the general structure of
representations of a given group (e.g., classifying irreducible
representations), and 2) applying this to representations of particular interest
(e.g., functions on a homogeneous space). This project aims to study higher
representation theory, which studies the realization of groups as categorical
symmetries. The emphasis of the proposal focuses on loop groups, where the
theory remarkably mirrors classical harmonic analysis for p-adic groups. In
particular, one finds Langlands-style decompositions here. This project focuses
on understanding some key categories of interest in this framework. The
investigator will study 3d mirror symmetry conjectures, representations of
affine Lie algebras, and moduli spaces of bundles arising in the global
geometric Langlands program. This project provides training opportunities for
graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, 3d mirror symmetry,
representations of (reductive) affine Lie algebras, and the geometric Langlands
program are the three primary ways actions of loop groups of reductive groups on
categories arise. A large class of 3d mirror symmetry conjectures concerns the
categorical Plancherel formula for loop group actions on categories of sheaves
on loop spaces of particular varieties with group actions. The PI will establish
first cases of 3d mirror symmetry and apply the results to give coherent
descriptions of some categories of primary interest in geometric representation
theory. Representations of Lie algebras concern the action of a group on its
category of Lie algebra representations. The PI will extend previous work on
critical level localization theory and develop a substitute for Soergel modules
that will apply to poorly understood categories in the local geometric Langlands
program. The applications to global geometric Langlands concern actions of loop
groups of reductive groups on moduli spaces of a global nature, namely bundles
with a level structure. The PI will extend the Satake theorem and apply the
result to study Eisenstein series in the global geometric Langlands
program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and

intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
