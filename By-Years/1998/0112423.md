This research program will continue and complete an experimental investigation
of the radiative properties of high temperature combustion gases, particularly
CO2 and H2O. Existing property data for these gases have an average uncertainty
of plus/minus 30% and may be in error in some cases by as much as 70%. The PI
will use a unique isothermal high-temperature gas column and an FTIR
spectrometer to ensure better spectral resolution than previous high temperature
measurements. The potential impact is a significantly improved capability to
make radiative heat transfer calculations in arbitrary combustion
gas/particulate environments, including combustion chambers and furnaces, fires,
and propulsion systems, and therefore improve the performance and design of
these systems.
