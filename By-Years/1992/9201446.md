The objective of this proposal is to develop a tractable approach for the
analysis of two- dimensional quantum which feature sizes &lt; 1000 A. We will
base our analysis on the non-equilibrium Green function formalism which can take
into account quantum interference, dissipation and electron-electron
interactions. We have made significant progress in applying this formalism to
realistic device structures. Numerical simulation programs have been developed
for one- and two-dimensional quantum devices using a simple model for the
electron-phonon interaction. The purpose of the proposed research is to extend
this work to include realistic models for the electron-phono and electron-
electron interactions. Such interactions are expected to play a significant role
in determining the transport properties of devices with dimensions in the sub-
1000 A range.
