The 2015 WiFiUS workshop and principal investigator meeting is held on December
10, 2015, in San Diego, California, USA. This meeting convenes all the principal
investigators who have been jointly funded through the WiFiUS program by the
National Science Foundation of US and either Tekes or The Academy of Finland of
Finland. This is the first of two annual meetings specified in the WiFiUS NSF
program solicitation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting offers an opportunity for
the principal investigators, industry representatives, and funding agencies
representatives, to review the research progress of the funded projects,
identify new research directions, discuss the spectrum of the research projects
allowing for identification of gaps and/or overlaps, and enabling cross-
fertilization of the projects. The meeting is also open for the general research
community members, who are not funded by the program, to attend and participate
in the discussions and group break-out sessions, thus helping build a community
of diverse international research collaborators. This workshop helps create and
foster a vibrant international research and education community in the key area
of wireless networking. Given how the world is increasingly connected, and the
convergence towards a single set of global wireless standards, this workshop
enhances and accelerates the innovation and collaboration between the teams of
researchers, and helps to identify future directions for international research
efforts.
