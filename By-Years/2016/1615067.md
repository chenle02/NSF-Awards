It is well known that protons and neutrons are made from constituents, called
quarks and gluons, which give substructure to these particles. The goal of this
project is to make measurements of the spatial distributions and the momenta of
the quarks that provide a three-dimensional map of quarks in the nuclear medium.
This knowledge provides the basis of our understanding of nuclear matter in
terms of the dynamics of their internal constituents. Using this information,
theoretical models show how the constituent parts of the proton and neutron can
be used to build up its fundamental intrinsic properties, i.e. its overall size,
or radius, and quantum mechanical spin. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
engages the PI and Duquesne University's undergraduate students in research
aiming to study the strange sea using semi-inclusive production of Kaons with
CLAS12 at Jefferson Lab. Physics analysis of 6 GeV Kaon data from eg2 experiment
and software development projects for 12 GeV experiments will be performed at
Duquesne University, while hardware and detector tests will be carried out at
Jefferson Lab. The PI is leading the calibrations of a hybrid Ring Imaging
CHerenkov (RICH) detector which is currently under construction. This detector
will be used for hadron identification in the momentum range of 3 to 8 GeV/c.
Undergraduates play an integral part in this project, which provides them with
opportunities to further their training and education outside of the classroom.
This will include: gaining experience in the design, assembly, and testing of
modern particle Physics detectors, high tech fast electronics, and scientific
data analysis.
