9401852 Lyons This project supports continued work on the revision of the proof
of the classification of finite simple groups. The principal investigators
propose (1) to begin its publication, starting with the introductory sections
giving an outline of the series and laying the general group-theoretic and
K-group-theoretic foundations for the later parts; and at the same time (2) to
continue the writing of the later parts, for which drafts of most chapters
already exist. A group is an algebraic structure with a single operation. It
appears in many areas of mathematics, as well as physics and chemistry. The
fundamental building blocks of finite groups are finite simple groups. One of
the major results in mathematics of the past decade is the classification of the
finite simple groups, the proof of which would require 10,000 to 15,000 journal
pages. The research supported is a joint effort to produce a self-contained,
simplified and coherent treatment of this proof.
