"Philosophy of Biology Graduate Training ISHPSSB Off-Year Workshop"

This proposal will support graduate training in the philosophy of biology. It
will emphasize emerging and underdeveloped fields of research that pose
interesting and important conceptual issues for philosophers of biology.
Finally, the workshop will emphasize the importance of collaborative efforts
with biologists and other scholars as a fruitful methodology for philosophers of
biology. The intellectual merit of this proposal relates to the training of
graduate students in philosophy of biology. Meeting together will enable them to
establish or strengthen professional relationships in the field. This will be
especially beneficial to younger scholars, who may not have had opportunity to
forge the kinds of relationships that foster feedback and collaboration on
research efforts. The broader impacts will include better preparation for
independent research expected of professional scholars; a proceedings that will
be submitted for publication to Biology &Philosophy; and identification of
emerging and underdeveloped fields of research in philosophy of biology will
spur research in these fields.
