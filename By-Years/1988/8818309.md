Calcium plays an integral role in the metabolism, growth and development of
plants and plant cells; however, our understanding of this important regulator
has lagged behind similar insights in animal systems. A workshop will be
organized to evaluate the methodologies commonly used to investigate calcium-
mediated systems, responses and processes. This workshop will focus on the
various approaches as they may be applied to plant tissues or cells and will
consider the special problems which attend the study of calcium in plant cells.
Thus, the principle objectives of the workshop are to expand the base of
knowledge fundamental to the study of calcium in plants; to critically evaluate
the currently available methods,; and to focus on the developing new
technologies which may provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of calcium
action in plants. This workshop will provide an opportunity for interaction
between beginning and experienced investigators and will provide a forum for the
critical evaluation of the methods available to investigate the role of calcium
in plant cells. The exchange of information provided by this workshop should
substantially enhance the knowledge base for future research directed toward
understanding the role of calcium in plant metabolism, growth, and development.
