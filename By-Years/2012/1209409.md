The project investigates the role of turbulence in cloud development and
evolution, from an applied and computational mathematics perspective. There is a
fundamental challenge to understand multiscale interactions between fine scales
and coarse scales in clouds, from cloud droplets and turbulence (micrometers to
meters) to turbulent updrafts (meters to kilometers). Both scales are of key
importance in determining, for instance, how much solar radiation is reflected
by clouds and how much (if any) precipitation is formed. To study these complex
interactions, the principal investigator will employ multiscale asymptotic
models and stochastic models, building on his previous work with these
methodologies. Using multiscale asymptotic models, one of the questions of the
project is the effect of the coarse-scale updrafts versus the intermediate-scale
fluctuations from cloud pulses and thermals on water transport from low
altitudes to higher altitudes. Secondly, using stochastic modeling techniques in
addition, the goal is to investigate relationships between aerosol and droplet-
size distributions (fine scales) and cloud amount and lifetime (coarse scales).
To model these processes across scales from micrometers to kilometers, the
principal investigator will use stochastic models to represent the fine-scale
interactions between turbulence and droplet evolution, and these fine-scale
processes will then be coupled with the coarse-scale deterministic evolution of
turbulent cloud updrafts.

This project will develop mathematical methods for the modeling of water and
energy transport in clouds, which is of fundamental importance in weather
prediction, climate science, and air pollution. At present, clouds are a primary
source of uncertainty in projections of climate change, since it is still
unclear whether increased cloud cover will cool the planet (due to increased
reflection of incoming sunlight) or heat it (due to the capacity of clouds to
store and redistribute thermal energy). In addition, clouds interact with
aerosols and air pollution in various ways, influencing day to day local
atmospheric phenomena. For both of these issues, the uncertain role of clouds is
determined by the complex interplay of both cloud-scale properties (such as
cloud amount and lifetime of a cloud) and smaller-scale properties (such as
droplet size distribution and aerosol particles). The project will use modern
mathematical techniques to shed light on these questions. Educational activities
supported by this project will connect mathematics, cloud physics, and climate
science, and they are aimed at high schools with a large percentage of students
from underrepresented groups.
