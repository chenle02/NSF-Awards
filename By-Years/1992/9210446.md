Adaptive and sensory materials are a class of material systems which contain
their own sensors, actuators, and microprocessor capabilities and can be used in
many applications requiring a high degree of adaptability to changing external
and internal conditions. The basic aim of current research activities is to
develop and synthesize materials systems which mimic biological organisms, i.e.,
the human arm, which can perform sophisticated slewing and robotic tasks, change
the stiffness, sense numerous environmental conditions and adapt to them, all
with the aid of highly integrated sensor (nervous system), actuator (muscular
system) and control (brain system). A three day conference will be held to
provide an international forum highlighting innovations and new research
developments related to all aspects of actuator and sensor development and their
control.
