This project gives undergraduate Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering
students with access to modern, state-of-the-art Human Factors/Ergonomics
laboratory grade equipment for physiological, psychological and cognitive
measures of human performance. The integration of the microcomputer in real time
data acquisition and processing, coupled with graphical displays enhances the
student's interpretation of the experimental phenomena. This award is being
matched by an equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
