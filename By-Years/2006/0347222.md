The overall objective of this CAREER award is the development of an Internet-
scale, on-line predicate-evaluation. The first specific objective of the project
is the validation of a partial synchrony model for the Internet. The second
specific objective is the development of scalable monitoring and predicate-
evaluation algorithms which exploit hierarchy by aggregating information,
approximating to control of the tradeoff between fidelity and performance,
distributing the evaluation of sub-predicates to local domains, within which
partial synchrony assumptions will be exploited within. Symbolic model-checking
and partial order methods enhance the performance of intra-domain monitoring.
Finally, compositional reasoning techniques and data aggregation will be used to
perform inter-domain monitoring. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expected result of
the proposed research is a set of robust and scalable algorithms to evaluate
system state with correctness guarantees established with respect to validated
synchrony assumptions. This research is expected to provide a fundamental
ability to understand the behavior of a distributed system using techniques that
are formally correct and practical, suitable for Grid computing, large-scale
collaboration systems, and replicated servers. The educational objective is to
increase in the retention and success of underrepresented students in computer
science by explicitly teaching educational success skills through participation
in research, through a broad-spectrum introduction to computer science, and
through development of academic preparedness specifically relevant to computer
science. These activities will take place within the context of the affinity
group model. It is expected that such participation will lead to greater
retention and success through the development of affinity and
persistence.&lt;br/&gt;
