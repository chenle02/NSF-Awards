This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project concerns the
development of a multi-channel fluorescence lifetime measuring instrument using
a novel low-cost digitizer. The key to bringing the well-known utility of
fluorescence lifetime measurements "to the masses" is to have a low-cost
instrument with excellent speed and accuracy. This work will pioneer a measuring
technique that, by taking advantage of recent developments in lasers, goes a
long way toward meeting the needs of such an instrument. However, there is one
vital component, the digitizer that presently accounts for more than half of the
cost.&lt;br/&gt;Commercially available digitizers do not match the needs of the
application and are therefore too expensive or lack essential capabilities.
However, This work has found a unique custom ASIC that appears to be a good
match. This ASIC is a waveform digitizer developed at Berkeley National
Laboratory for the AMANDA neutrino telescope.&lt;br/&gt; This work will
prototype and characterizes a multi-channel fluorescence lifetime measuring
instrument that uses this ASIC as the digitizer. If the phase I objectives are
achieved, this work will be able to build exceptionally affordable instruments
that can enable and greatly expand the use of fluorescence lifetime measurements
in a vast range of applications.&lt;br/&gt;
