People are different and those differences can and should have an impact on
economic policy. For example, raising taxes on gasoline would affect the
economic welfare of different individuals differently. This proposed research is
about allowing for individual differences in estimating economic effects.
Previous research has allowed for such differences in quite limited ways. The
research outlined here will allow for very general differences across
individuals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three topics will be considered in the
proposed research. The first topic is how to allow for people to be different
when estimating the average welfare effect of price increases. This research
will be applied to gasoline demand in the US. There the average effect of
various price increases will be estimated from recent data. The results will be
useful for evaluating the welfare effects of potential increases in gasoline
taxes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second topic is allowing for individual
differences in estimating the effect of taxes on taxable income. The
investigators will develop methods for estimating the effect of the tax
structure on the average of labor income. This research is applied to US and
Swedish data. The effect of changing the taxes on labor income in the US and
Sweden will be estimated. Others have tried to estimate these effects but have
only allowed for individual differences in restrictive ways. This research will
be the first to allow for general differences in people. This work is useful for
predicting how changes in the tax structure would affect average taxable income.
These results could help understand how changing taxes to reduce the deficit
could affect the income level in the economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third
topic is about how to use repeated data on individuals to estimate economic
policy effects, while allowing people to be different in a general way. The
approach and methods developed in this research should a broad impact on panel
data methods in statistics and economics. These methods are used to estimate
important economic effects in many settings. In previous research they have been
used to estimate the effect of unions on the distribution of wages and the
effect of children on labor participation of women. There are also many other
important applications of economics where these methods and models can be used.
