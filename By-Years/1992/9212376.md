The Coordinated Science Laboratory at the University of Illinois- Champaign will
purchase equipment to support research in real- time vision based adaptive
control of robotic manipulators. The equipment, consisting of a camera, vision
system, and computer workstation, will be interfaced to a direct-drive
manipulator for use in research projects aimed at improving the robustness of
adaptive robot control. The project will seek to quantify, through theoretical
and experimental investigation of adaptive robot control, various instability
phenomena that may arise in real-time adaptive vision feedback as a result of
external disturbances and unmodeled dynamics. Among the phenomena to be studied
are slow parameter drift instabilities, fast adaptation instabilities, bursting,
and more. The ultimate goal is to make adaptive control of robots highly robust
and therefore practical from an engineering standpoint.*** //
