The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a genetic medicine platform to regulate human genes for treating
specific diseases. Many diseases are caused by abnormal levels of a specific
gene, which can have harmful effects. Current technologies can overcompensate by
delivering genes at extremely high levels, causing unwanted effects. This
proposed technology aims to activate specific genes in the human genome in a
controlled and reversible manner. By using the cell's own machinery, the
proposed technology may precisely control gene expression to treat diseases
where the molecule is delivered. If successful, the proposed technology may
provide a new therapeutic approach for a variety of diseases, leading to better
health outcomes for patients. In addition, the proposed technology may provide a
new platform for drug development. This could lead to the development of new
drugs for a wide range of diseases, improving quality of life for patients, and
reducing healthcare costs.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of a new genetic medicine
platform that uses CRISPR/Cas-based epigenome editing to treat diseases by
upregulating therapeutic genes. Current existing methods are not efficient at
targeting specific non-coding regions of the genome. In contrast, the proposed
technology is designed to target regions of the non-coding genome in human cells
that are implicated in certain disease states and restore their function. In
addition, the proposed technology enables the delivery of these molecules
efficiently with reduced cytotoxicity and off-target effects while retaining
function. This may overcome existing hurdles in delivering these therapies in
vivo to reach higher levels of therapeutic targeting efficacy. The proposed
technology has the potential to treat a variety of monogenic and complex
diseases that previously were not accessible to current therapeutic approaches.
