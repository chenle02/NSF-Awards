8822287 Roberts The principal investigator will study nonlinear convection
arising in a horizontal layer of electrically conducting fluid. The layer is
heated from below, cooled from above, is rotating about the vertical, and is
permeated by an applied horizontal magnetic field. This represents an
idealization of conditions that arise in nature, e.g. in the solar convection
zone. The unusual feature of such a system, the feature that motivates this
project, consists of theoretical and observational hints that the pattern of
convection will in general vary with height. This possibility will be studied in
detail in this project.
