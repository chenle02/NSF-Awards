9530116 Soos This is a renewal grant co-funded by the Division of Materials
Research and the Chemistry Division. Theoretical research will be conducted on
the electronic properties of conjugated molecules and polymers including
nonlinear optical response, efficient electroluminescence and high conduction on
doping. The long-range goal of this research program is a unified,
semiquantitative description of polymer excitations that parallels conjugated
molecules, incorporates modern vibrational spectroscopy, combines nonlinear
optical and linear spectra, and applies to both pi- and sigma-conjugated
systems. Projects to be studied include: a joint approach to conjugated
molecules and polymers; vibronic analysis of nonlinear optical and
electroabsorption spectra; electron-phonon coupling and force-fields; and,
charge transport in molecularly doped polymers. %%% Theoretical analysis will be
done on the electronic and optical properties of polymers. These materials have
unique properties and are amenable to processing such that materials can be
designed to have specific properties. The research is supported by both the
Divisions of Materials Research and Chemistry. ***
