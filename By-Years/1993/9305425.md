9305425 Marzke This award provides partial funding (57% of total cost) for the
acquisition of components of a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer (NMR)
system to be installed and operated in the Department of Physics at Arizona
State University . The NMR unit will consist of a 300 MHz spectrometer equipped
with a wide-bore superconducting magnet configured for nuclear magnetic
relaxation and NMR spectroscopic studies in solids and liquids under extreme
conditions of pressure and temperature. ***
