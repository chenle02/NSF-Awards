Computerized equipment will permit students to observe and record electrical
activities of animal cells and tissues as well as aspects of muscle contraction.
The equipment includes three work stations consisting of a Macintosh SE
computer, MACLAB software, transbridge amplifier transducers, preamplifier,
stimulator, and one laser printer. This equipment will make it possible to: 1.
offer modern laboratory courses in Comparative Vertebrate Physiology, Cell
Physiology, and General Biology; 2. develop a laboratory for the Neurobiology
course; 3. encourage student research projects relating to electrophysiology and
muscle activity, and 4. enhance the computer literacy of the biology students at
this women's college. The college will provide 50% matching funds.
