Non-Technical Abstract Advances in synthetic, experimental and
modeling/simulation methodologies have considerably enhanced our understanding
of materials. Yet, despite this remarkable progress, many outstanding challenges
remain in our quest to understand how the properties of the basic material units
or particles determine the properties at the macroscale. This work uses small
soft particles to address this question. In particular, the project aims at
understanding how single-particle deformability and compressibility affect
formation of ordered and disordered solids. The research involves graduate and
undergraduate students, and provides materials for enhancing existent soft
matter physics courses, both at the theoretical and laboratory-work levels. We
also exploit the natural connection between the science we address and food and
cooking, to bring the research to the general public; this is achieved by
bringing chefs and scientists together and organizing outreach events that
include talks and demos by the speakers.

Technical Abstract This project uses colloidal hydrogels as model soft particles
to address (i) the formation of disordered solids and how it depends on the
single-particle softness, and (ii) elucidate how size mismatch and
polydispersity affect crystallization in soft-particle suspensions. One focus is
the relation between glass formation and jamming, and whether these are distinct
mechanisms, and if so, in which way and in what parametric range are they at
play, for formation of disorder solids made of colloidal hydrogels. Another
focus is to unravel the relation between fragility, which quantifies the way the
liquid approaches the glass, and single-particle elasticity. The third focus is
to elucidate the mechanism enabling crystallization of polydisperse colloidal-
hydrogel suspensions. Ultimately, the overarching goal of this research is to
understand and eventually exploit how single-particle softness affects
macroscopic behaviour. The techniques employed include 3D-static light
scattering, as well as small angle neutron and X-ray scattering, to quantify the
structure of the suspension, 3D-dynamic light scattering and rheology, to
quantify the dynamics at different time and length scales, and osmosis, to
determine the suspension osmotic pressure, an important state function for
colloidal systems. The experimental work is complemented with computer
simulations and numerical calculations.
