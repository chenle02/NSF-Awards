This grant provides support for travel and participation costs of approximately
ten invited speakers from the former Soviet countries to attend the First
International Meeting for Wave Propagation in Random Media (Scintillation), at
the University of Washington, Seattle, WA, August 3-7, 1992. The Scintillation
meeting will bring together the optical, radio, and acoustical communities to
exchange ideas and foster communication. Only problems of wave propagation in
continuum random media involving scintillation will be addressed. Some of the
relevant topics, of importance to engineering, atmospheric sciences and
observational astronomy, include: statistical description of scintillation;
measurements of turbulence spectra; remote sensing; image and focal plane
statistics; pulse propagation in random media; adaptive optics; and speckle
interferometry. This meeting is the first to bring together the diverse
international groups working in the area. Many prominent scientists from the
former Soviet countries have contributed to founding the field, and, in fact,
over one-third of the meeting abstracts are from these countries.
