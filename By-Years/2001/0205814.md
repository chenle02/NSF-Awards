AST-0205814&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Woodward&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
interstellar medium is enriched with chemical elements synthesized in the
interiors of stars and dust grains formed in their atmospheres. Stars accomplish
this enrichment through mass outflows ranging in character from slow winds in
post-main sequence, luminous evolved stars that operate over long time scales,
to explosive events such as novae. By observing these outflows the process of
chemical enrichment can be investigated. In particular IR observations will be
carried out to provide abundance estimates for elements in the ejecta, such as
C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Al, and Si, that can be used to assess the contributions of
stellar winds to the interstellar medium. For a nova event prompt observations
of sudden, transient activity at many wavelengths are required. This study will
provide information about the stages of stellar evolution that are associated
with mass loss, characterize the physical properties of astrophysical dust
grains in circumstellar outflows, and assess the contributions that novae and
luminous IR variable stars make to the grains and gas that constitute the
interstellar medium. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
