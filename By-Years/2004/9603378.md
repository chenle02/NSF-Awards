This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in astrophysics
between the NSF Science and Technology (STC) for Particle Astrophysics at the
University of California, Berkeley, and the Laboratoire de Physique
Corpusculaire at the College de France. The U.S. and French research teams are
led by Bernard Sadoulet, Director of the STC at Berkeley, and Yannick Giraud-
Heraud, leader of the French group. Specifically, support will be provided to
advanced U.S. graduate students and postdoctoral researchers affiliated with the
Berkeley STC for their travel to France. The U.S. and French teams will focus on
the fundamental problem of dark matter, a topic identified as the highest
priority in astrophysics research. Evidence indicates that 90% or more of the
Universe is made of dark matter, and that this matter may be in the form of
particles dating back to the beginning of the Universe. The study of the dark
matter problem has important implications for understanding the origin of the
Universe and the fundamental nature of matter. In this project, the U.S. and
French teams will perform experimental searches for dark matter either in the
form of weakly interactive particles or in the form of massive astrophysical
compact halo objects.
