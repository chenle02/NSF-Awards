This award provides funding for the National Academy of Sciences? Government
University Industry Research Roundtable to support activities of the Federal
Demonstration Partnership (FDP), an ongoing cooperative initiative among
university research administrators, faculty and federal agency representatives.
FDP, which currently consists of representatives from 119 academic institutions,
10 federal agencies and seven professional societies, offers a forum for members
to improve the national research enterprise by its efforts to streamline and
standardize research administration policies and procedures. During the current
phase, FDP will develop and expand upon targeted demonstrations that address and
provide guidance for several activities such as: modifying regulations involving
effort reporting that correspond with the Office of Management and Budget
circulars, developing a government-wide professional profile, identifying
opportunities to share administrative infrastructure among categories of
research institutions, and continuing efforts to reduce faculty time utilized on
research-related administration. The organization continues to improve the
relationship between federal agencies and the research community, ensuring the
efficiency and integrity of STEM administration.
