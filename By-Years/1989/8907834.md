This award is for the use of the Hardware Ranch Observatory (HRO). The facility
will be used to test optical and radio instruments and to conduct observing
campaigns. This facility will provide a unique opportunity for the NSF community
at minimal cost. This award will almost exclusively be committed to operating
the Observatory: installing instruments, coordination and making observations,
reducing data, making data available to the CEDAR community, and conducting an
active research program.
