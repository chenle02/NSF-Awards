This is a program of aggressive study of optical pumping mechanisms and
development of optical pumping techniques with particular attention toward
coupling the results of this work to noble-gas-enhanced MRI. It will be carried
out in close collaboration with MRI team from the university. The initial focus
will be on enhancing the MRI signal through increasing the number of polarized
rare gas atoms. The ultimate goal will be to explore time-dependent functional
imaging as well as the possibility of imaging in tissues through absorption of
the rare gases in the blood stream, which will then deposit them in the areas of
interest.
