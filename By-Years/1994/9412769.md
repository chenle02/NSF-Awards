9412769 Technical Abstract: The research on this renewal grant will focus on
transverse dynamics and relxation of Fermi systems. The main theoretical
objectives are to obtain macroscopic equation for spin dynamics at finite
temperatures, study zero-temperature attenuation in longitudinal dynamics, apply
the theory to itinerant magnetic systems and study the zero-temperature
attenuation in Heisenberg models. In addition, the boundary effects will be
studied by reducing the problem to an equivalent problem of random
imperfections. Non-Technical Abstract: This is a continuation of the work on
transverse spin dynamics in spin-polarized Fermi liquids at zero and finite
temperature. The previous work of quantum liquids will be extended to metallic
and itinerant magnets.
