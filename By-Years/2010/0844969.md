Current medical robotics systems use non-intelligent surgical manipulators that
place the entire burden on surgeons for safeguarding against damage to the
anatomy. The emergence of new surgical paradigms, such as Natural Orifice
Endoscopic Trans-luminal Surgery (NOTES), requires surgical robots that are
capable of supporting safe interaction with the anatomy while accessing deep
surgical sites through often long natural access pathways. This requires new
types of robots capable of safeguarding against damage to the anatomy by acting
as intelligent intervention and information gathering tools for assisting
surgeons during increasingly complex procedures.

The objective of this research is to provide the theoretical foundation for
modeling and control of flexible robots for intelligent and safe interaction
with the anatomy. Intelligence refers to the ability of these robots to gauge
their force interaction with the anatomy, gather information about the anatomy,
and act based on this information. Screw theory and stochastic estimation
methods are used for modeling the ability of these robots to estimate their
wrench interaction with the anatomy by using intrinsic and extrinsic sources of
information. These performance measures are used in hybrid force control
algorithms that allow characterizing shape, stiffness, and anatomical
constraints governing safe maneuvering of suspended organs.

The outcomes of this research will allow the development of radically new
technologies for newly emerging surgical paradigms (e.g. NOTES). This research
will also advance the field robotics by addressing control and resolution of
multi-point contact problems along flexible robots for compliant insertion
control and bracing against soft environments.
