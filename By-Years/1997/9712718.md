Educational Innovation:Undergraduate Modeling, Simulation and Analysis This CISE
Educational Innovation award supports the development of a new course sequence
in computational science for undergraduates. The program, entitled Undergraduate
Modeling, Simulation and Analysis (USMA), enables qualified undergraduates to
broaden their educational experience via small group interaction with faculty
who are active researchers in modeling, simulation and analysis. The USMA
program provides formal courses in these areas as preparatory work for research
in computational science, encourages small-group interaction with research-
active faculty via a mentored research seminar, offers an integrative
interdisciplinary project based on an application from engineering or the
sciences, creates a mechanism for students from Hampton University to
participate in the USMA program and begins to incorporate courses in
computational science at that institution, as well.
