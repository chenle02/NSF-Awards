The Center for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science (DIMACS)
will host a conference on the Challenges of Identifying Integer Sequences,
October 9-10, 2014 at Rutgers University in Piscataway, NJ.

The conference will honor the contributions to the mathematical sciences of the
Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) featuring renowned researchers
reporting on the latest developments and open conjectures attributed to the
OEIS. Conference discussions will highlight the role the database has served in
assisting with developing conjectures in number theory, algorithmic and
enumerative combinatorics, combinatorial number theory, bifurcative and other
nonlinear sequences, sphere packing, and many other mathematical fields as well
as the tools necessary for identifying those conjectures. The conference will
bring these topics to a large audience, with the express goal of making the
ideas accessible to a diverse audience of researchers and students. For more
