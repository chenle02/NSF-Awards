This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). The investigator addresses fundamental problems arising from
the mathematical analysis of multiscale geometries of sets, and multiscale
decompositions of function spaces on such sets. The complexity of the geometry
of these sets, which are embedded in high-dimensional spaces, are noisy, and
often have different dimensions at different locations, is analyzed at multiple
resolutions. He develops robust mathematical and statistical quantitative
multiscale methods of analysis, yielding estimators of intrinsic dimensionality
that are extremely robust to noise and succeed with high probability even for
small sample size. He develops algorithms for multiscale processing of high-
dimensional point clouds much as is done for low-dimensional functions, by means
of a geometric multiscale transform. He studies and approximates functions on
data by constructing data-driven multiscale dictionaries, generalizing
approaches familiar in low-dimensional Euclidean spaces. He develops efficient
algorithms for computing these multiscale decompositions and dictionary
expansions.

Many important application problems directly require the analysis of high-
dimensional data sets, dynamical systems, or large graphs, or they are posed on
a framework of high-dimensional data sets, dynamical systems, or large graphs.
Such problems arise for instance in different disciplines and real-world
situations where instruments or simulations produce large amounts of data. The
investigator develops novel methods for the analysis of high-dimensional data
sets and of statistical models with a large number of variables, under the
assumption that the number of free parameters (which in some sense represents
the intrinsic dimensionality or complexity) of the data is small compared to
that of the ambient space. He further applies these methods to algorithms that
are able to learn functions on such data from examples, or learn models of
complex dynamical systems (e.g. molecular dynamics, protein folding, neuronal
activity, etc.), or learn behavior patterns in social networks. This Career
award is funded by the Applied Mathematics program in the Division of
Mathematical Sciences/Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences and by
the Office of Cyberinfrastructure.
