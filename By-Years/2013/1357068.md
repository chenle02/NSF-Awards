The proposed research project develops an understanding of collective
mobilization and civic policy by examining community responses to extreme
weather events. This project assesses how these extreme weather events may
impact public awareness, community action, and civic response to issues of
climate change. By undertaking a systematic comparative case analysis of
communities in the United States which recently experienced extreme weather
events, we will seek to understand under what conditions and via what mechanisms
communities undertake significant climate-related actions following an extreme
weather event. Through this study, we mean to bring the insights of two distinct
literatures to bear on the question of variable community response: the general
literature on social movements and the more specialized scholarship on climate
change awareness and action from the fields of environmental sociology and
psychology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will employ fuzzy set Qualitative
Comparative Analysis and a variety of data collection techniques, including data
from newspapers, site visits and interviews, and community to surveys. The PIs
will employ both graduate and undergraduate students in its implementation. Its
interdisciplinary nature, which combines both sociological and technical
expertise, will provide a unique opportunity for teaching, training and learning
for these students. The research also has important implications beyond the
academy. Scholars, civic leaders, and the public are paying increasing attention
to the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. A host of real world
actors are eager to understand the dynamic processes that mediate between
awareness and action. By learning more about the factors and processes that
convert awareness into action, stakeholders would be in a much better position
to serve as agents helping to address critical challenges. Progress on this
front can turn the teachable moments that arise with extreme weather events into
lessons that can be applied in practical contexts.
