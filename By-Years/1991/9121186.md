is award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organo- metallic Program to
Professor Jerry Atwood of the University of Alabama will fund continued studies
of guest-host chemistry involving calixarenes. Calixarenes are flexible,
macrocycles (hosts) that can incorporate smaller molecules (guests) with
multiple non-covalent interactions. Emphasis will be on: 1) interactions with
metal complexes as primary and second sphere ligands, 2) inclusion of water in
the hydrophobic cavity of water soluble calixı4!arenes, 3) conformation and
complexation of higher (n=5-8) calixın!arenes, and 4) further characterization
of bilayer solid state structures found for calizı4!arene sulfonates and related
compounds. Information obtained from these studies on the nature of guest-host
interactions will impact on separation science and biological chemistry. %%%
This study is expected to provide important fundamental information about
multiple, but highly specific, non-covalent interactions of molecules. Such
interactions are responsible for recognition of substrates by enzymes in
biological systems and allow for the separation of mixtures of very similar
molecules when appropriate hosts can be designed and synthesized.
