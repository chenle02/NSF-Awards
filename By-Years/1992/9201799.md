Long & Medium-Term Research: Elementary Photoproduction of Eta Mesons This
award is under the Long and Medium-Term Research at Foreign Centers of
Excellence Program, which enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three
to twelve months of research abroad at research centers of proven excellence.
The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of
unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions
abroad. This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit by
Dr. Michael M. Rigney of the University of South Carolina to work with Professor
G. Noldeke at the University of Bonn. They plan to explore the elementary
photoproduction of the neutral ETA(n) meson at the existing electron accelerator
and stretcher ring ELSA in Bonn. This accelerator in conjunction with the
PHOENICS Photon Tagging System will be used to measure differential and total
cross sections for n photoproduction a 1H,2D, and 12C. These measurements will
enable them to explore the role played by the P11(1440) Roper resonance in these
processes. The award recommendation provides funds to cover international
travel, a stipend for twelve months and a dependents' allowance.
