9420817 James This award provides one-half the funds needed to acquire computer
equipment consisting of 4 workstations, a CD-ROM mass storage device, and a
color printer all to be installed in the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism of
the Carnegie Institution of Washington (DTM-CIW). DTM-CIW is committed to
providing the remaining funds necessary for the acquisition. The equipment will
be used primarily by the geophysics group at DTM-CIW who are actively involved
in computationally data intensive research. The group currently operate 20
digital broadband portable seismograph units and 50 digital borehole
strainmeters in a number of seismic experiments worldwide. ***
