This three-year project is to enable the participation of distinguished U.S.
scientists at the VarSITI (Variability of the Sun and Its Terrestrial Impact)
Meetings during 2016-2018. The VarSITI program is sponsored by the SCOSTEP
(Scientific Committee on Solar-Terrestrial Physics) and it promotes
international collaboration of solar-terrestrial researchers in data analysis,
modeling, and theory to improve our understanding of how the solar variability
affects the Earth. The related Meetings during 2016-2018 will serve as venues to
discuss recent results on VarSITI-related projects, exchange ideas, and educate
the next generation of solar-terrestrial researchers on integrated system's
science. This three-year project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS
Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.
