The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP)
through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and
study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the
preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue
STEM graduate programs and/or careers. Harris Stowe State College will boost
retention of students entering the Biology program by adopting the innovative
learning experience idea of using authentic research questions to teach
foundational biology laboratory concepts. This project will infuse the Biology
program with Biotechnology courses that will help prepare students for
continuing education and to become part of the Biotechnology workforce hub in
the St. Louis region. The BIO-BOOST project will focus on engagement and
retention of early-stage (first and second-year) Biology students by creating
interactions among students and faculty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the
BIO-BOOST targeted infusion project is to increase the retention of students
entering the Biology program at Harris Stowe State College through engagement in
biotechnology focused student-centered curriculum and projects based on
authentic research experiences. The objectives of the BIO-BOOST project include:
1) implementation of a research-based Biotechnology curriculum; 2) creation of
on-campus Biotechnology research experiences for freshmen; and 3) increased
retention and networking of undergraduate students entering the Biology program.
The project plans also include updating the Harris-Stowe Biology program with
modern Biotechnology lab equipment.
