Adaptive IIR filters can be useful in many signal processing and communication
applications. However, a number of important issues concerning their robust
design needs to be resolved before they can be widely used. This research
addresses some of those issues. In particular, it deals with: 1) Exhaustive
study of the properties of signed adaptive IIR filters, with special emphasis on
the development of design tools and guidelines to ensure their robust
performance. 2) Design of adaptive IIR filters which are time varying. Both slow
and fast time variations will be considered. 3) Development of formal
methodologies for designing error filters for a range of adaptive algorithms.
The resolution of the above issues will contribute to the basic understanding of
issues linked to good adaptive filter performance and lead to the development of
design tools for a spectrum of applications.
