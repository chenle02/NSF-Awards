Systematic study of structural, optical and vibrational properties of solid
hydrogen and other simple molecular solids at ultrahigh pressures (greater than
100 GPa, or 1 Mbar), in order to investigate their transitions to the metallic
state. Diamond- anvil cell techniques, in conjunction with synchrotron x-ray
diffraction and optical spectroscopic methods, will be employed. Emphasis will
be placed on measurements on solid hydrogen above 200 GPa. In the 50-100 GPa
range, single crystal x-ray diffraction experiments on hydrogen isotopes will be
carried out to determine the P-V equation of state, and to characterize
structural transitions which have been observed optically. Experiments on rare
gas solids and other simple molecular solids will be performed in the 100 GPa
range, in order to compare their behavior with solid hydrogen and with
theoretical predictions. New high resolution x-ray diffraction methods will be
used to extend pressure calibration above 200 GPa, and to study the maximum
pressure possible with the diamond anvil cell.
