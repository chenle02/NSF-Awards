9560480 Downing This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
will investigate several potential system architectures that could be employed
in a solid-state, three-dimensional volumetric display based on two-photon
upconversion (more specifically, two-step, two-frequency upconversion).
Alternative system designs will be examined in terms of cost, complexity, and
system performance. Applications that are well suited to particular designs will
be identified, and a preferred design showing strong market potential will be
selected for later Phase II development. Commercial uses of a solid-state 3D
display include medical imaging, computer aided design (CAD) and manufacturing
CAM), engineering work stations, scientific visualization, air traffic control,
geological and oceanic exploration, molecular modeling, environmental hazards
evaluation, architectural design, education, entertainment, and defense.
