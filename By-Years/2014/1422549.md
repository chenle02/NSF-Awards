Nonnegativity and sparsity are highly desirable properties in data and signal
decomposition algorithms. Nonnegativity is particularly relevant when the
involved variables have a physical interpretation and ensures a separation of
properties that interact in an additive manner. Nonnegativity and sparsity have
been used in principal component analysis for numerous applications including
bioinformatics, hyperspectral imaging and computer
vision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research involves the study of sparsity and
nonnegativity in quadratic optimization problems. This project develops novel
algorithms for solving such problems under sparsity and nonnegativity
constraints using a low-rank projection framework. This framework allows the
development of novel algorithms for nonnegative sparse principal component
analysis and matrix factorization. The research program relies on a fruitful
synthesis of tools from information theory, combinatorics and linear algebra.
The developed algorithms are both empirically outperforming the previous state
of the art and have provable approximation guarantees.
