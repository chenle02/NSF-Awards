We are requesting funds for support for the 25th Annual Meeting of the
Northwest Regional Development Biology Conference to be held April 29- May 2,
1992 in the conference facilities at the Friday Harbor Laboratories of the
University of Washington (San Juan Island, Washington). The funds requested here
will be used exclusively (a) to pay for travel expenses, room and board for the
five invited speakers, and (b) to lower the cost of room and board for the
estimated 55-75 graduate students expected to attend the conference.
