This is a project in theoretical high energy physics that deals with quantum
chromodynamics, the theory of interactions of quarks and gluons, topological
aspects of field theory, and superunification theory. The project is divided
into three parts according to the research interests of the three principal
investigators: (1) a study of a variety of applications of topology in field
theory, a study of fundamental problems in superstring field theory, and a study
of some phenomenological consequences of superunification; (2) a study of the
long range structure of the QCD plasma and its phenomenological consequences;
(3) a study of the phenomenology of confined QCD. All of these studies deepen
and broaden our understanding of the fundamental interactions and components of
matter. The work on these studies will be carried out by very highly-regarded
theoretical physicists whose special interests are in the area of elementary
particle physics and in adjacent areas.
