This research seeks to break new ground in accounting measurement of managerial
decisions by developing a triple entry accounting frame of reference for
bookkeeping, which links changes in the balance sheet and in the income
statement to management decisions so that a more long term view of decision
making will become prevalent. This work could have a major impact on the
dominant accounting paradigm. The research will result in a system for
measuring; recording and reporting income momenta and impulses of an enterprise;
apply its prototype in actual companies and analyze its impact on managerial
goals, risk taking and decisions.
