The studies described in this proposal integrate genetics and ecology to
investigate natural gene exchange between the Louisiana Iris species, Iris fulva
and I. brevicaulis. We will test for: i) the number and genomic location of
genetic elements that affect growth, survivorship and reproduction in different
microhabitats; ii) the relative contribution of floral and microhabitat
characters on the fertility and fecundity of different genotypes in different
environments; and iii) the effect of genetic elements for floral traits, male
fertility and microhabitat associations on the natural transfer of genes between
I. fulva and I. brevicaulis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our proposed research also has
implications for both agriculture and conservation biology. Crop improvement has
historically been accomplished using the process we are studying - introgressive
hybridization (i.e., the exchange of genes between hybridizing forms). This work
will thus discern some of the genetic and ecological traits that affect crop
improvement. Further, our studies will answer questions concerning the
likelihood that genetically modified (GM) crops will accidentally exchange genes
with their wild relatives. These studies also have at least two applications for
determining how to manage rare species. First, environmental changes are
resulting in the loss of rare species through natural hybridization with more
common and prolific forms (e.g., wild canids by domestic dogs). Second, there is
concern that GM species will hybridize with wild relatives, producing hybrid
types capable of competitively replacing the wild species. Our studies will
provide data to determine how best to prevent both of these
occurrences.&lt;br/&gt;
