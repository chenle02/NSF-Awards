In this project, researchers will elucidate the kinetic aspects of micellar
solutions and microemulsions using stopped-flow, temperature-jump and ultrasonic
absorption techniques, and will correlate the results with equilibrium
properties of these systems. Specifically, it is planned: to investigate the
effect of solubilized oils on the kinetics and equilibrium properties of
micellar solutions; to elucidate the influence of solubilization kinetics on the
micellization process in micellar solutions; to measure kinetic properties of
high concentration surfactant solutions to elucidate the effect of micelle-
micelle interactions and the formation of anisotropic (birefringent) structures
on relaxation processes in these systems; and to measure kinetic properties of
microemulsions to delineate the mechanism of spontaneous uptake of water or oil
by microemulsions. The rate of molecular exchange between bulk and the interface
in microemulsions are determined using the ultrasonic technique. These
measurements are used to identify various microstructures in single phase
microemulsions.
