A study of software code has revealed a surprising result: that software code
may be just as (if not more) "natural" as natural language itself (e.g.,
English) in that code is highly predictable and repetitive; statistical natural
language techniques may be applied quite competently for some software
engineering tasks. For example, N-grams may be quite effective at suggestion and
completion tasks in code. The evidence supports further exploration of the
applicability of statistical NLP techniques and tools to software development
activities and processes. The project explores the feasibility of establishing a
scientific basis and tools for a variety of code-level software engineering
functions -- including natural language summarization, code retrieval, software
question answering, automated code completion, and assistive tools for disabled
developers to support software engineering, forming not only a new and important
domain for further research in NLP, but also a totally new approach to software
development.
