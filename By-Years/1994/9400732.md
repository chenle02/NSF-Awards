This research is directed towards the development, implementation, and
demonstration of advanced model-based signal processing algorithms for real-time
measurement of wafer temperature profile in Rapid Thermal Processing (RTP), RTP
cluster tools are strategically important for submicron semiconductor
manufacturing because of trends towards reduced thermal budget and tightened
process control requirements on large diameter silicon wafers. Despite its
significant advantages, commercial versions of RTP modules for various chemical
vapor deposition applications are not available. In this project, the
investigators are developing advanced model- based signal processing algorithms,
which when coupled with the acoustic thermometry and acoustic/pyrometer
approaches, accurately measure the wafer temperature profile at fast acquisition
rates and with a minimum number of sensors. This entails algorithm development,
implementation, and validation using real data from commercial RTP tools at UT-
Austin and SEMATECH.
