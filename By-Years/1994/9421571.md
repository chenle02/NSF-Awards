9421571 Murphy Mount Aloysius College requests support from NSF for connection
of its campus network to PREPnet. PREPnet is the midlevel network located in the
state of Pennsylvania. PREPnet will provide operations management and
information services and it will give Mt. Aloysius College connection to the
NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone
network. The College needs greater functionality and network speed to be able to
access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with being able
to implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty research will
benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity for the school to
explore innovative educational resources.
