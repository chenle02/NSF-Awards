9528276 Cogger Cornell University requests funding for research and development
in the area of ATM over low-cost media. In particular, they will explore "Cells
in Frames," the transport of ATM over ethernet media. Initial investigations
made them confident that the concept is workable and would be highly beneficial.
With industry partners, Cornell will develop a prototype network, large enough
for a significant demonstration, which will include low cost CIF access devices
and diverse end system environments. They will test its effectiveness and
develop prototype applications.
