Theoretical research in elementary particle physics will concern various
aspects of supersymmetric quantum field theory. This theory relates "fermions"
such as quarks to "bosons" such as the particles whose exchange produces the
basic forces of nature. Major thrusts will include the interplay between
supersymmetry and topological charges, which are reflections of the broad shapes
of physical systems, and ways in which results for supersymmetric theories yield
results for non-supersymmetric theories. Supersymmetry is an attractive approach
to the solution of long-standing riddles in elementary particle physics, and the
thrusts of this research are regarded as promising avenues of work within
supersymmetry.
