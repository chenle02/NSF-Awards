Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Loss of
vision in glaucoma is caused by the death of retinal neurons that convey visual
information from the retina to the brain. Currently, there is no cure for
glaucoma. In recent years it has become apparent that most forms of glaucoma are
inherited and the genetic factors play a key role in its onset and development.
Glaucoma-causative genes appear to be very promising therapeutic targets for
glaucoma treatment. Recently, it has also been discovered that the loss of the
retinal neuron function could not only be slowed down but could also be
reversed. Thus, it seems hopeful that not only could the glaucomaâ€™s progress be
slowed down using genetic and epigenetic approaches, but it may also be possible
to reverse its progression with retinal neuron and optic nerve axon
regeneration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators propose to develop a novel
visible light activated CRISPR-dCas9 based epigenetic method for glaucoma
treatment and the potential for vision restoration. CRISPR is a revolutionary
new technology for versatile genome alterations but the high frequency of off-
target activity induced by CRISPR at sites other than the intended on-target one
is a major concern, especially for therapeutic and clinical applications. This
problem could be solved with a light activatable version of CRISPR, which
enables localized genetic alterations, limiting off-target activity only to the
illuminated cells. They will develop and construct a new instrument for
localized CRISPR activation with visible light. The proposed novel light
activated CRISPR-dCas9 based epigenetic method for glaucoma treatment and vision
restoration is transformative since the platform could have a profound impact on
developing highly effective ophthalmic therapies for a wide range of retinal
disorders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
