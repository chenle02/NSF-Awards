Economical methods of removing and/or recovering dissolved organics or metals
from water are necessary for US industrial competitiveness. Also, firms
specializing in hazardous waste disposal and pollution control will be a major
area of industrial growth in the US. Micellar-enhanced ultrafiltration (MEUF) is
a new process which can remove dissolved organics and multivalent metal ions
from waters. In MEUF, an ionic surfactant, which forms aggregates called
micelles, is added to water. Organic and metallic species associate or bind with
the micelles. The solution is then treated in an ultrafiltration device with
membrane pore sizes small enough to block the passage of micelles and the
associated target solutes. The result is an extremely pure permeate, and a very
concentrated, low-volume retentate for disposal or much more economical ultimate
recovery of the solutes. Unlike most alternative methods, MEUF can
simultaneously remove both organics and metals. Reductions in concentration of
two orders of magnitude in one pass have been demonstrated in preliminary work.
The percentage reduction does not decrease as the feed solute concentration
decreases, making this technique particularly effective in the reduction of very
toxic chemicals from low concentrations to ultralow concentrations.//
