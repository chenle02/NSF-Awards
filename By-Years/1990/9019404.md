Several types of gelatinous zooplankton, including medusae, sometimes occur in
extremely high numbers (blooms). The reasons for dramatic population
fluctuations are not understood. The scyphomedusa Chrysaora quinquecirrha is
unusual in thriving in estuarine waters of as little as 7% salinity. However,
its annual population fluctuations may be related to differences in springtime
conditions during asexual production of medusae in the spring. This research is
designed to test the combined effects of temperature, salinity, and food levels
on the production and survival of young medusae. Drs. Purcell and Wright will
examine ionic and osmotic regulation in the polyps and medusae in order to
determine if they are physiologically limited in low salinities. This project is
an effort to understand population fluctuations of a major predator in
Chesapeake Bay. The results are important in understanding the formation of
blooms in pelagic ecosystems. Responses of bloom organisms to changing
environmental conditions are of particular importance now, given the predicted
temperature and salinity changes associated with global warming.
