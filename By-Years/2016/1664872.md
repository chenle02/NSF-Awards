The project will support graduate and undergraduate participation in the 25th
meeting of the North American Catalysis Society (NACS) to be held in Denver,
Colorado June 4-9, 2017. Specifically, the funds will provide assistance to 30
students from U.S. universities for registration fees and travel related
expenses as administered through the Kokes Travel Award program sponsored by the
NACS. The students will present their research at the conference, attend
lectures by leaders in the field of catalysis, and provide assistance to the
organizers in running the meeting.

The biennial NACS meetings are the largest North American meetings dedicated to
catalysis. Student participation helps train young researchers in this vital
aspect of science and engineering that supports advances in environmental
pollution control, energy utilization, sustainability, and greenhouse gas
reduction, thereby building the next generation of catalytic scientists and
engineers working to ensure competitiveness of our Nation's chemical and
petroleum industries.
