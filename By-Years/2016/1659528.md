This award supports the renewal of the Research Experience for Undergraduates
(REU) site in experimental high energy physics and astrophysics at Nevis Labs,
Columbia University. The site will support undergraduate student participation
in original, cutting-edge physics research, working with a faculty mentor. Two
students per year will spend the summer conducting research at the European
Organization for Nuclear Research in Switzerland at the Large Hadron Collider.
Key goals of the REU are increasing the knowledge and interest of students in
physics research, increasing participation of traditionally under-represented
populations, and motivating students to pursue graduate studies in science and
engineering. Achieving these goals is critical for providing the Nation's future
well-trained workforce required to continue to lead an increasingly
technological world.

The students spend 10 weeks during the summer participating in the broad Nevis
high energy physics and particle astrophysics research program, which seeks to
address the most pressing issues of these fields, including the origin of mass,
the question of neutrino oscillations, and the search for Dark Matter. Answers
to these questions will have profound implications for our understanding of the
fundamental structure and evolution of the universe. The strength of the Nevis
research program, coupled with the Nevis infrastructure of world class
electronics design and mechanical construction, forms a unique environment with
opportunities for training of students. As the variety of experiments are at
different stages in their development, Nevis provides the opportunity for
students to gain experience in all aspects of the experiments, from initial
detector design, hardware development and construction, to software development
and data analysis.
