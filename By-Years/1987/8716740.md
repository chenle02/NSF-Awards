A redox system is present in the membranes of glyoxsomes from the endosperm of
germinating castor bean (Ricinus communis L.). This electron transport system is
thought to consist of a transmembrane flavoprotein (NADH:ferrichyanide
reductase) and cytochrome b5 in the cytoplasmic face of the membrane. It is
hypothesized that the flavoprotein accepts electrons from NADH at the matrix
face and transfers those electrons to cytochrome b5 or a cytosolic acceptor at
the cytoplasmic face. The protein responsible for the NADH:ferricyanide
reductase activity will be isolated from glyoxysomal membranes and
characterized. Another redox protein, cytochrome b5, will also be isolated. The
kinetic characteristics of the isolated proteins will be compared to the redox
activities in the intact glyoxysomal membranes. Possible endogenus electron
acceptors will be identified. Antibodies to the redox proteins will be generated
and used together with inhibitors and non-penetrating probes to determine the
orientations of the proteins in the membrane. The proposed work is important to
understand the mechanism by which plants generate the energy and metabolites
necessary to begin the germination process. Past work discovered a new energy
shuttling mechanism within glyoxysomes. The proposal work will determine its
stucture and specific operation within the cell compartment.//
