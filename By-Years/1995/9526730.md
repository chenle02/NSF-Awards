9526730 Ni This grant provides $35,000 as partial support of the costs of
acquiring hardware, software and peripherals to upgrade a computer laboratory
used for research in computational and observational seismology. Specific
research includes studies of active tectonics in southern Tibet and, eventually,
the monitoring of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), which prohibits all
nuclear weapons testing. The bulk of this equipment request includes a new Sun
SPARCstation 20 server, 2 Sun SPARCstation 5's, increased storage capacity and
programming and data analysis software. The upgrade will benefit a small but
growing number of faculty and students in the Geophysics department at New
Mexico State University. ***
