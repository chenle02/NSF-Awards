0132759&lt;br/&gt;Holmen&lt;br/&gt;Very little is known about the organic
chemical composition of the ultrafine particles emitted by vehicles and about
the atmospheric processing of these particles as they age during transport in
the atmosphere. This is especially true for the more polar organic compounds
that have been linked to stronger mutagenic effects. The composition of these
ultrafine particles, and the organic species adsorbed to the particles, has very
important implications for particle reactivity and the resulting endpoint
effects on environmental and human health. The Research Component focus is the
processes that control the physical and chemical attributes of vehicle-derived
ultrafine particles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Research Component will: (1)
design and build a new sampler for size- and time-resolved collection of
ultrafine particles from vehicles; (2) conduct "aging" experiments on vehicle-
derived ultrafine particles to determine reaction products during exposure to UV
light, ozone, and NOx under controlled laboratory conditions; and (3) develop
new analytical techniques to analyze the composition of both fresh and aged
ultrafine particles. This research will help close the gap in understanding the
mechanism of diesel soot toxicity and identify the conditions under which aging
mechanisms produce significant polar organic species. The results of this
research will allow the most complete model yet of the processes governing the
formation of vehicle-derived PM polar organic species in the atmosphere.
