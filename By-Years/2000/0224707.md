The main goal of this research project is to develop a comprehensive framework
for dynamical state estimation, fault detection and fault accommodation in
energy processing systems. Such systems include terrestrial and autonomous power
systems, electric drives and power electronic systems, and can be found in both
civilian and military sectors.

The PI's approach is based on a family of experimentally verifiable and mutually
consistent dynamic models, with various family members being suitable for
different tasks in analysis, fault management and control. In addition to
exploring hierarchical and distributed architectures for monitoring and
accommodating for faults in energy processing systems, he will also study
simulation environments in which multiple models with embedded redundant
dynamics are used to detect inconsistencies, and to initiate more detailed
simulations to resolve them. He will also study economic and environmental
aspects of fault tolerance in energy processing systems.
