This grant supports upgrade of the computer facilities used by the Geodesy and
Geodynamics group in the School of Earth Sciences (SES) at Ohio State
University. Modern computational platforms will immediately serve NSF funded
crustal motion geodetic research in South America, Greenland and Antarctica, PI
analysis of the global vertical velocity field in support of studies of sea
level change, and work in GPS meteorology and kinematic positioning. Specific
equipment to be acquired includes five dual Intel-based quadcore Macintosh
compute systems each with 16 Gb RAM and a 640 Gb hard drive. The compute
facility will serve four graduate students and two professional staff scientists
in PI Mike Bevis?s research group as well as students in Professor Terry
Wilson's research group at OSU. The PIs have ported the geodetic processing
package GAMIT/GLOBK to enable it to run on a Macintosh Xgrid system. This
modified version of GAMIT/GLOBK would be available to any MIT licensed user.
