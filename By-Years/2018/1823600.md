Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) proposes to support technical services
on three research vessels, all operated as part of the U.S. Academic Fleet which
is scheduled by the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS).
Ships to be supported include R/V Revelle, R/V Sproul and R/V Sally Ride, a new
Navy-owned vessel which came into service in 2016. As part of their basic
operations they will provide one (Sproul) or two (Revelle and Sally Ride)
technicians on each seagoing research project to support basic services and they
will maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified users items from their pool
of shared-use research instrumentation. They also propose to provide several
elements of specialized support for investigators, with separate charges.
Specialized support proposed for 2018 includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;? Reference
Quality CTD (ODF)&lt;br/&gt;? Additional Technical Support&lt;br/&gt;? HiSeasNet
Management&lt;br/&gt;? HiSeasNet Expansion&lt;br/&gt;? HiSeasNet
Hardware&lt;br/&gt;? Hydrographic Doppler Sonar (HDSS)&lt;br/&gt;? MOCNESS
Interface&lt;br/&gt;? Multichannel Seismic&lt;br/&gt;? Marine Mammal
Mitigation&lt;br/&gt;? Cyberinfrastructure for Vessel Operations&lt;br/&gt;?
SatNAG &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of
the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal
Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to
use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded
oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by
the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and
operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any
US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their
research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of
potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
