The main objectiveof the workshop is to address technical problems that are to
be solved to allow users and organizations to build applications around
interoperating data and knowledge bases. This workshop, while dealing with the
technology of information access and sharing will also forge a collaboration
between industry and science. The proposed workshop will advance futher
understanding of the issues faced by industry in utilizing the results of
distributed access to databases. For some industrial problems conceptual
solutions may be available. For other types of problems the interaction will
provide guidance for researchers in identifying and abstracting research issues
that must be addressed. Interaction among researchers will help in identifying
promising approaches as well as likely deadends. The collaboration and
cooperation between basic and application researchers in solving applications
problem can then be based on a solid basic research foundation. The workshop's
effort in resolving technical problems facing researchers in developing
multidatabases is closely related to technical problems described in the recent
NSF report (Toward National Collaboratory, NSF 1989). Clearly that problems of
Intelligent Agents, Interoperable Data Description, Information Fusion, and
Smart Data Gathering listed in that report are very same problems that a
designer of multidatabase application should solve to make an application
operate with information geographically distributed among various data sources.
