In this project the essential components of versatile laser spectrometer is
assembled that enables our chemistry major to carry out experiments in Raman
spectroscopy, time-resolved absorption spectroscopy, and time-resolved
fluorescence spectroscopy. The total system includes both a pulsed nitrogen
laser and a dye laser, as well as a monochromator, a signal processor, and a
laboratory computer to store and analyze the data. The spectrometer is used to
introduce students to several phenomena and techniques which are important to
current research in chemistry. These include (a) principles and applications of
lasers, (b) techniques for measuring very fast processes, and (c) computer
interfacing and control of experiments. This also provides an opportunity for
our chemistry majors to use state-of-the-art laser equipment for independent
research projects. The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal
amount of funds.
