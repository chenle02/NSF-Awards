This award will support Professor Thomas Gaisser and Todor Stanev of the Bartol
Research Institute at the University of Delaware in a research collaboration
with Professor Giulio Auriemma of the Universita "La Sapienza" in Rome, Italy.
The researchers propose to investigate the interpretation and theoretical
implications of novel experiments being performed in several deep underground
laboratories around the world that detect remnants of ultra-high energy natural
radiation from outer space. They will carry out computer simulations and other
calculations necessary to interpret measurements of coincident multiple muons,
of neutrino-induced upward muons, and of correlations between surface and
underground observations. They will also study the implications of the
measurements for cosmic ray physics, for neutrino astronomy and for properties
of elementary particles. The work proposed here will be coordinated with the new
experiments that are coming into operation now in association with the Gran
Sasso Laboratory at L'Acquila in Italy. This support will serve to increase
significantly ongoing cooperative research in particle-astrophysics. The
researchers will take advantage of the operation of major new underground
detectors at the Gran Sasso Laboratory such as MACRO (Monopole, Astrophysics and
Cosmic Ray Observatory) as well as other underground experiments in the planning
stage in Italy.
