Linguists conduct formal studies of the structure of the world’s over 6,000
languages, investigate the acquisition and use of language in typical and
atypical populations, seek to understand the neural structures that enable
humans to learn and use language, and create the language models used in
computational contexts, such as artificial intelligence and machine translation.
The breadth of the field’s applications makes it vital to technological and
medical advancements, economic competitiveness in a global economy, humanitarian
aid, and U.S. national security. This award will encourage high-school students’
engagement with linguistics and language science, and will help recruit them to
pursue careers in this field of study. Since 2007, about twenty-five percent of
US team members who attend the International Linguistics Olympiad (IOL) have
continuing involvement with the fields of linguistics and language technologies
after graduation: nearly all team members take linguistics courses in college,
bringing a broadened view of language to their studies and future
careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will enable two teams of
undergraduates to participate in the 2022 International Linguistics Olympiad
(IOL). The project will introduce high school students to the field of
linguistics and provide training to interested students and support to their
teachers. In selecting and coaching the team of U.S. students that represent the
country at the IOL, it will support the current work of the Linguistic Society
of America in its focus on creating and promoting the teaching of an Advanced
Placement course in linguistics for high school students. Specifically, the
grant supports the costs associated with training a team of eight high school
linguists from across the United States and escorting them to the 2022
IOL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
