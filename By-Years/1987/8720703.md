Mylonite zones exposed within the granulite facies terrains of the Ivrea-
Verbano zone, northern Italy, and the Bergen Arc, western Norway, provide
examples of fault zones in the lower continental crust of extensional and
compressional regimes, respectively. Within the Ivrea zone, the shear zones
occur as mylonites of the Pogallo fault zone and as high temperature shear zones
in the granulite domain of Valle d'Ossola. Deformed ultramafic rocks are also
important constituents of deep structural levels of the Ivrea zone. Mylonites in
the Bergen Arc are superimposed on an anorthositic complex and are characterized
by an eclogite facies mineralogy. The research investigated the seismic
properties of rocks from the these zones in order to evaluate the hypothesis
that mylonite zones cause deep crustal reflections. The main phases of the work
are 1) a sampling program in both regions; 2) investigation of preferred mineral
orientations in the mylonitic rocks; 3) thin section and geochemical study of
the composition of samples; 4) determination of the elastic constant tensor by
measurement of P- and S-wave velocities at confining pressures up to 600 MPa; 4)
construction of hypothetical velocity profiles through deformed and undeformed
sequences.
