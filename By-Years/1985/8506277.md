This project will provide the Department of Electrical Engineering at the
University of Colorado at Colorado Springs with computer-aided-engineering (CAE)
workstations for use in designing a novel nonvolatile, solid-state, random
access memory. These workstations will enable the project team to conduct all
design steps on a single integrated system, from schematic capture to layout of
the fabrication photomasks, including essential simulation and verification
steps.
