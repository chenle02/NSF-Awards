The investigator will attack the problem of the isometric classification of
hyperbolic metrics on a given 3-dimensional manifold, as well as study the
topology of limit sets of such metrics. These two problems involve understanding
the geometry of geometrically infinite ends of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. The
approach which he plans to use is based on the technique of pleated surfaces in
hyperbolic manifolds. He intends to develop a calculus for pleated surfaces
which will enable him to obtain estimates on their geometry and the speed at
which they converge to infinity in the 3-manifold. It is a surprising fact that
although we live in a three dimensional space, a so-called 3-manifold, and so
are blessed with a natural intuition about such geometric objects, in the end
this does not carry us as far as we might have expected,for questions which have
been settled by algebraic calculations for higher dimensional manifolds still
remain baffling in the 3-dimensional case. The most famous of these is the
celebrated conjecture of Poincare from around the turn of the century concerning
3- dimensional spheres, where precisely the original 3-dimensional case is the
only one still open. The investigator is pursuing a variety of questions about
3-dimensional manifolds with slightly strange notions of distance on them, so-
called hyperbolic metrics, but time and time again these questions have been
shown to have clear relevance to the case of manifolds with a more familiar
notion of distance.
