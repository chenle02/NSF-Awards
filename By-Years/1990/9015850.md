The work is designed to provide a method by which differential soil movement
can be predicted in expansive soils beneath slab-on- grade foundation influenced
by climate. Its ultimate objective is to mitigate structural damage resulting
from expansive soil movement. The work plan consist of theoretical, laboratory
and field studies, and will continue the field measurements obtained during a
recently completed research project. Monthly measurements will be made of soil
moisture content, soil suction, surface elevation and depth of shrink/heave, and
the long-term development of the distorted shape of swelling soil beneath slabs
will be measured and compared with that predicted by a model developed from the
field data acquired from the previous study. These results of the work will
elucidate and relate soil differential movement as a function of climate, soil
suction and clay mineralogy with actual measured field values.
