This project refines previously developed materials for introductory physics
including research-based worksheets that show large conceptual learning gains in
students. The project has a publisher willing to distribute these materials in
an open-source format making them widely adaptable in a variety of educational
settings. Further, the project is linking annotated video clips from their video
library to assist TA development in effectively applying these materials.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three aspects of the development of these materials
contribute to their success: (1) systematic attention to students' views of
knowledge and learning; (2) last-minute adjustments to materials based on
students' progress and needs; and (3) attention to helping teaching assistants
(TAs) become better at attending and responding to student thinking, often by
using videotaped TA-student interactions from recitation sections. With the
application of the worksheets embodying these aspects, students are less likely
to revert to passive learning (e.g., memorizing information from authority) in
later classes. The worksheets show conceptual gains and also significantly
improved student views about knowledge and learning.&lt;br/&gt;
