The principal goal of this project is to introduce and use modern, computer-
based design tools and methodologies in a broad range of undergraduate digital
systems design activities. The intent is to introduce such tools and methods
early in the program so that students can become well-versed in their use before
applying them at the advanced level. This approach will greatly enhance
instruction in digital systems design and will also introduce students to
current industry practice. Funds are requested for the development of a
computer-aided engineering laboratory to support five courses dealing with the
design and implementation of digital systems. The laboratory will consist of a
network of six lab stations, each consisting of a logic analysis system coupled
to an engineering workstation and supported by computer-aided engineering
software. A network server will accommodate file and program sharing among the
lab stations. The idea is to integrate the capabilities of the logic analysis
system with those of the engineering workstation to form a single support
environment. A student will first develop and verify, via simulation, a circuit
design on the workstation. A prototype will then be constructed. The logic
analysis system, driven by workstation software and using the simulation
results, will be used to test the prototype by comparing the observed prototype
behavior to the expected behavior indicated by the circuit simulation.
Modification of the original design and/or prototype can occur as desired.
