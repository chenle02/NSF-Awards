Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alice 3 is is a new version of the
Alice programming environment that blends the highly successful Alice 3D
animation environment with the capability of going "under the hood" of Alice by
allowing students to program directly in Java using a text-based integrated
development environment. Alice 3 will take advantage of the interest and
motivation students find in video games and animated films while allowing
teachers to cover all the skills and concepts mandated by computing curriculum
standards. This project is delivering a workshop for college teachers in
computer science who teach the first rigorous course in computing (CS1).
Workshop participants are being introduced to Alice 3 and are being given the
opportunity to test the software, to report bugs, and ultimately to contribute
to the production of a stable version of Alice 3.&lt;br/&gt;
