This research is in the area of musical instrument analysis and synthesis. It is
anticipated that linear predictive modeling techniques, including autoregressive
moving-average (ARMA) models, will play a central role in the research.
Techniques such as principal (eigen) component analysis will be applicable.
Future research areas based on AR and ARMA modeling will also be pursued. The
computer software that will be developed will be useful in all aspects of the
research.
