The International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) is developing a framework to
automatically detect privacy violations in mobile applications. The project
leverages prototype work in augmenting the Android operating system with
instrumentation to detect when applications access sensitive user data, what
they do with it, and with whom they share it. The project modifies this system
to support the analysis of thousands of applications in parallel, through
virtualization. This infrastructure enables better understanding of the mobile
privacy landscape, as well as making available new techniques for auditing
programs at scale. The project offers end-users an online resource
(https://www.appcensus.mobi/) to research the privacy behaviors of their
applications; regulators can use these tools for enforcement, and developers can
use them to detect and fix privacy violations in their mobil applications prior
to releasing them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current program analysis approaches
either do not actually observe program execution, and instead only examine
program code, or do not scale well. This approach instruments the operating
system and then uses simulated user behavior via computer-generated user
interface events to passively observe what personal information applications
access and exfiltrate. A prototype of the framework was used to detect thousands
of potential violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).
This project expands that initial infrastructure to enable evaluation of
thousands of applications simultaneously with real user input from crowdworkers,
as well as to offer a programming interface for both developers and regulators
to be able to evaluate new mobile applications on
demand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
