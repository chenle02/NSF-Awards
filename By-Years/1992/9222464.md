This Phase II SBIR grant will allow BIOTEK to do research on low molecular
weight metal polymer salts that can be used as biodegradable implants or
injections. Many medical therapies can benefit from drug delivery using
biodegradable implants or injections. The FDA-approved polymers used for this
purpose are polyesters of lactic and glycolic acids (PLGs) which are limited to
rather slow degradation in the body. PLGs with a molecular weight low enough to
degrade quickly are syrups or sticky solids. BIOTEK is seeking to improve PLGs
by using low molecular weight metal polymers salts that have both good physical
properties and shortened degradation times. Phase I confirmed that such salts
can be strong and non-tacky. These new materials open the door to many new
medical products; the company's commercial interest lie chiefly in producing PLG
salts for the drug delivery field. In Phase II BIOTEK will investigate
alternative methods of production; verify reproducibility and purity; prepare
injectable and implantable drug delivery systems; and assess delivery,
irritation, and resorption characteristics.
