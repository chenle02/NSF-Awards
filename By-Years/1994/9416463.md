9416463 Cheng This project investigates damage and collapse behavior of
MissionGothic Undercrossing and Bull-Creek Canyon Channel bridges. Damaged
structures on site were studied and field observations extensively with eminent
engineers in California were exchanged. The tasks include: (1) failure criteria
and nonlinear finite element analysis, (2) structural modeling and response
analysis, (3) effect of interacting ground motions, (4) results synthesis, and
(4) recommendations on bridge code improvements. Analysis includes formulation
of nonlinear finite elements and the effect of interacting ground motion on
structural response. Analytical results will verify field observations and
enhance current practice in design and retrofit of bridges in the US. This is a
Northridge Earthquake project. ***
