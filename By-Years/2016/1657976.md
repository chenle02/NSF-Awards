High-valued domain applications in areas such as medicine,&lt;br/&gt;biology,
physics, engineering, and social phenomena demand&lt;br/&gt;both fast innovation
and high execution speed and require&lt;br/&gt;productive development
environments for domain experts who&lt;br/&gt;may not be computer science
experts. This workshop brings together leading researchers in
architecture,&lt;br/&gt;compilers and programming languages, and domain experts
to discuss&lt;br/&gt;and debate potential approaches to accelerating progress in
such&lt;br/&gt;high-valued domains with an emphasis on developing strategies
for&lt;br/&gt;exploiting machine learning, including strategies for
accelerating&lt;br/&gt;learning algorithms through parallelism. The goal is to
stimulate&lt;br/&gt;an in-depth discussion of the potential benefits of joint
architecture&lt;br/&gt;and compiler approaches. The workshop will promote
broadening&lt;br/&gt;participation by including speakers from groups
underrepresented&lt;br/&gt;in computing and early career
researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will produce a report providing
recommendations on:&lt;br/&gt;joint compiler/language and architecture
approaches, compiler/language&lt;br/&gt;support enabling more aggressive
hardware capabilities, architecture&lt;br/&gt;support enabling more effective
compilers, and applications whose&lt;br/&gt;development process could benefit by
these advances, The report&lt;br/&gt;will identify research opportunities in the
interaction between&lt;br/&gt;developers, and architecture and language/compiler
researchers to&lt;br/&gt;enable productive domain application development and
highly efficient&lt;br/&gt;and scalable implementation on heterogeneous
computing systems. The&lt;br/&gt;report will outline promising approaches and
the research required for&lt;br/&gt;these approaches to become usable by the
domain application developers.
