This project provides funds to equip a computer laboratory with 22 networked
personal computers, 4 laser printers (2 color and 2 black/white), and an
overhead screen projector. This new computer classroom enhances the learning for
the 1,200 students taking Introductory Astronomy per semester in two ways.
First, it allows manipulation of images obtained with the Observatory's charge-
coupled-device camera to address specific scientific questions and provides a
hard-copy print for students to keep. Second, it provides access to computer-
based exercises that allow interactive exploration of topics in astronomy and
physics.
