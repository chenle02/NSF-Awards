0116129&lt;br/&gt;Lathrop&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to better
understand the generation mechanism for the Earth's magnetic field. This Major
Research Instrumentation grant will fund development of a new device designed to
self-generate magnetic fields at parameters close to the Earth. This new device
will drive liquid sodium to flow in a three-meter spherical tank. The tank and
the enclosed propellors rotate independently to drive a sodium flow to stretch
and amplify magnetic fields. The goal is to better understand the saturation
mechanism which determines the strength of the Earth's field, as well as
characterize the dynamics of a saturated self-generating dynamo state (such as
reversals). New diagnostics are planned to better characterize the fluctuations
in the magnetic field and the fluid velocity, including ultrasound velocimetry,
spherical magnetic field sensors, and a magnetic field imaging array. The
effects of rotation and Lorentz forces on the velocity and magnetic fields are
specific issues these diagnostics will probe. This scientific exploration seeks
to shed light on the dynamics of field self-generation on a wide variety of
objects showing active fields (the Earth, the Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Io) as well
as those lacking self-generation such as Venus.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
