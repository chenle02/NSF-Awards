This proposal offers a possible solution to the problem electrical power at
remote locations in polar environments. A Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell
operating on stored hydrogen and ambient air can operate unattended for six
months or more. The PI will design, fabricate and test sub stack assemblies to
provide information for a more definitive program later. Issues related to the
use of air as the oxidant will be explored including drying of the ion exchange
membrane, freezing of internal components and product waster storage.
