In geometric group theory and geometric topology, one usually studies groups and
spaces through their coarse geometry, focusing only on properties that are
preserved by QIs (quasi-isometries, or maps with bounded additive and
multiplicative distortion of distances). This viewpoint is forced on us if we
want to study infinite finitely-generated groups without specifying a generating
set, since the graphs that record each group's geometry are only mutually
related by QIs. In this project, the PI proposes to study group statistics that
are large-scale but not invariant under quasi-isometry, and so may depend
nontrivially on a choice of generating set. This point of view facilitates the
study of randomness and asymptotic density in groups. The PI has studied free
abelian groups and the discrete Heisenberg group in this way, opening up several
avenues for current and future research. Another object of particular interest
is Teichmueller space, the parameter space for many kinds of geometric
structures on surfaces. The proposal contains descriptions of ongoing and
planned work developing ideas for measuring "typical'' geometric properties in
Teichmueller space, the mapping class group, and the complex of curves using
data that is destroyed by quasi-isometry. For instance, one can show in this way
that even though Teichmueller space is not a hyperbolic space, certain
characteristics of hyperbolicity hold on average, or up to measure. The
techniques developed to study this space, which has many features of negative
curvature but does not satisfy any of the usual curvature conditions, are
promising for applicability in other settings, such as relatively hyperbolic
groups. A third main component of the proposal returns to the world of quasi-
isometry invariants, developing new families of filling functions that appear to
make finer geometric distinctions than some of their predecessors in the
literature.

This project belongs to a world of ideas that has a growing number of practical
applications. For instance, it is useful in a wide range of applications (like
communications networks) to have sparse but well-connected graphs. In
mathematics these are called expanders; the first families of examples came from
Cayley graphs of groups, and later it was realized that randomization over
regular graphs also produces good expanders with high probability. Expansion
constants, like a host of other geometric statistics, are "fine" and not QI
invariant. Generally, the question of understanding the nature of an object by
randomly sampling its points appears across many areas of applied mathematics,
and the topics in this proposal are clustered around this theme.
