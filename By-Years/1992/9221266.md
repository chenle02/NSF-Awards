The use of plant medicines by contemporary people of Hawaii is commonplace,
even among urban populations and in a state which offers one of the most liberal
access to biomedical health care in the US. Especially for Native Hawaiians,
health care professionals express concern that access to these alternative
medicines delays seeking attention from practitioners of biomedicines, which
compromises the efficacy of such therapy, and that plant medicines are used in
conjunction with or to the exclusion of pharmaceuticals, thereby setting into
motion physiochemical actions that might be contrary to the outcome of
pharmaceutical therapy alone. The primary objective of this research is to
investigate the use of plant medicines from a biobehavioral perspective that
explores the cultural constructions of "folk" preventive and therapeutic
strategies and links that to pharmacologic assessments of medicinal plants. The
principal concern is how preventive and therapeutic strategies affect the
physiological health of Native Hawaiians. The plants isolated for attention will
meet two criteria that increase the likelihood that they have a significant
impact on health: 1) plants that enjoy wide currency - used most commonly by
people and/or for more conditions; 2) plants most likely to compete directly
with pharmaceuticals and other forms of biomedical care or to delay biomedical
treatment.
