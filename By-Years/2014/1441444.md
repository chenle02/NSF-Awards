The project performs empirical studies of code bases to characterize
vulnerabilities that occur in practice on software projects. The studies will
identify the vulnerability-causing commits to understand when security
vulnerabilities are introduced and how long they are exposed. The empirical
methodology for studying security vulnerabilities sets the stage for more
rigorous and efficient empirical studies important for evaluating the efficacy
of new software development methods aimed at design more security systems. The
initial studies will look at Apache HTTPD service data. An additional objective
of the research is to gather more information about how industrial projects
collect and analyze the data needed for learning about security vulnerabilities
in practice.
