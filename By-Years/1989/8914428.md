The PI plans to work on provably effective techniques for machine learning in
the area of theoretical aspects of artificial intelligence. Some topics to be
studied are: techniques for learning an unknown system or environment by
exploration, techniques for representing and utilizing prior knowledge,
techniques for trading hypothesis complexity for fit to the data, learning
deterministic systems with an infinite number of states and learning finite-
state probabilistic systems with probabilistic transitions or output functions.
