Dr. Catherine Murphy has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Murphy's doctoral degree was from the University of Wisconsin
under the supervision of Professor Arthur Ellis. Dr. Murphy intends to continue
research at the California Institute of Technology under the sponsorship of
Professor Jacqueline Barton. Dr. Murphy's area of postdoctoral training and
research will be the application of solid state inorganic chemistry to problems
of biological interest. As a specific example, she will investigate
photoluminesence of adsorbed semiconductor colloids onto biological surfaces as
a probe of molecular conformation. The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry
Program is viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to broaden
the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D's and attract them into meaningful
careers in contemporary chemical research and teaching.
