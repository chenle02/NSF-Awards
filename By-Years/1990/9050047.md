The overall goal of this project is to link educators, professional science and
mathematics association leaders, curriculum developers, and professional
scientists and mathematicians to explore ways to improve the teaching of science
and mathematics through the integration of the two disciplines. To initiate the
network, a conference is to be conducted by the School Science and Mathematics
Association which will bring together the key players to establish
communications links, promote multidisciplinary dialogue, encourage and
facilitate ongoing research and development, stimulate new activities, and
disseminate information and materials. Post conference networking activities
will include the establishment of an electronic network using existing
facilities such as Bitnet and Compuserve, a newsletter, and several workshops to
provide additional face-to-face networking opportunities. Cost sharing in the
amount of $14,472 is 14% of the amount requested from NSF.
