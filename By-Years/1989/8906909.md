Data dependence is the theoretical cornerstone on which all automatic
parallelism detection methods are built. Automatic vectorization, which has been
critical in the use of vector computers, and other advanced optimizations for
new parallel computers and languages all require data dependence information.
Our project will measure both the effectiveness and the efficiency of data
dependence decision algorithms. Effectiveness will be measured by counting the
number of loops that can be vectorized and concurrently executed. Efficiency
will be measured by computing the time taken to build the data dependence graph.
Efficiency must be carefully defined, since a quick data dependence decision
algorithm may add more arcs to the dependence graph, thus slowing down other
phases of the compilation which depend on the number of arcs in the graph.
