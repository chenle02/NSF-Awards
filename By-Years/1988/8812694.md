Manganese undergoes dynamic redox cycling between reduced Mn(II) and manganese
oxides. These transfers dominate the biogeochemical behavior of manganese in
natural waters and sediments. Although the manganese redox cycle is likely to
have a major impact on the chemistry of other elements, particularly carbon,
such effects have not been widely studied. Thus manganese serves as a redox
catalysts for the transfer of electrons between organic matter and molecular
oxygen and plays an important role in the overall redox chemistry of sediments.
By studying the microbial and abiotic reduction of manganese oxides in
sediments, the work fills an important gap in our knowledge of elemental redox
cycles in sediments, particularly with respect to understanding the role of
manganese in the oxidation of organic carbon. Biogeochemical cycling of
manganese in this large freshwater system will provide an understanding of how
this element relates to the carbon cycle. Previous notions about how manganese
is reduced in anoxic environments have recently been changed by studies in Lake
Oneida and the Black Sea. These distinct regions have sulfide in common, however
the dominant cause of manganese reduction was due to organisms above the sulfide
interface. This rather surprising result adds impact to these studies in Green
Bay indicates that the results may be extrapolated to many other freshwater and
marine environments. It is important to oceanographers as well as meteorologists
to know how carbon is exchanged and cycled throughout the ocean.
