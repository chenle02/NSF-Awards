9504091 Steinfeld This U.S.-Argentina award is for a planning visit by Dr.
Jeffrey I. Steinfeld of MIT to go to Instituto de Quimica Fisica de los
Materiales, Medio Ambiente, y Energia (INQUIMAE) to develop an MIT-INQUIMAE
workshop to be held in March 1996, to lay the groundwork for future
collaboration and to set up meetings with a number of other Argentine
organizations who are engaged in developing links with MIT teaching and research
programs. Steinfeld administers an NSF Training Grant "Chemistry in the
Environment" which involves faculty in toxicology, physical and inorganic
chemistry. Argentina would like to develop a collaboration with MIT which would
enable them to train their scientists in environmental science and technology.
