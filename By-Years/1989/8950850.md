A structure-tectonics laboratory will provide facilities for teaching and
research in structural geology. Following an introduction to non- coaxial
strains using card deck exercises in a shear box, students will progress through
a series of increasingly sophisticated explorations of the physics of
deformation. Computer algorithms will reveal the consequences of coaxial and
non-coaxial strains and the behavior of the strain parameters in progressive and
multiple deformations. Digitizers and computers will facilitate data handling,
permitting students to concentrate on modern analytical approaches to
interpretation of the tectonic significance of their work. By adding a
photomicrography component, this laboratory will make it possible to strengthen
the petrology and economic geology courses as well as provide images for
analysis in structural studies. The laboratory will also support the increasing
interest in undergraduate research. The university will provide 50% matching
funds.
