This work will provide a coherent data set consisting of bathymetry, geophysics
petrology, and hydrothermal activity for a substantial length of the Mid-
Atlantic Ridge affected by the Azores hotspot. The overall aim to find the links
among the diverse types of data in order to contribute to more comprehensive
models of ocean crust formation. Petrologic sampling of a diversity of segment
types will reveal the scale of petrological segmentation of the Mid-Atlantic
Ridge, the relationships between petrological variations and segment type, and
provide data to test geophysical models of the organization and mechanism of
melt segregation and supply to the crust. Also, sufficient sampling to define
the fractionation trends for individual segments and to investigate the
relationship between major and trace element variations should reveal far more
about the nature of the Azores hotspot. Hydrothermal studies are designed to
inventory as completely as possible the amount of geothermal mass and heat
stored over this redge section, and to establish the number and location of any
hydrothermally active areas on this section of the ridge.
