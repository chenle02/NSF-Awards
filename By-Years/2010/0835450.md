The goal of this project is to design, implement, and research the use of two
types of embedded scaffolds, interactive-based scaffolds and resource-based
scaffolds, within a video game-based learning environment. A quasi-experimental,
pre-post design will be used to examine the impact of these two types of
scaffolds, as well a no scaffold treatment group, on middle school students'
STEM learning, problem solving, and interest.

While a wide range of video games are now being developed for educational
purposes, very little is known about how to effectively design and use embedded
scaffolds to support learning within these environments. This research will
contribute to the field's understanding of how to effectively design and use
embedded scaffolds to support middle school students as they learn about STEM
and other similarly complex topics. Providing well-designed video games that
effectively support learning has the potential to increase the accessibility of
high quality STEM materials that support both learning and interest in the
content areas.
