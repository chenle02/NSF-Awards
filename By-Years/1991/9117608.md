This award will provide for half the funds needed to acquire a computer-based
image analysis system to facilitate research of magmatic crystallization
processes. Lamar University has committed the additional funds necessary for
this acquisition.The PI plans to apply this relatively new approach to an on-
going study of the petrology of igneous rocks in the Stillwater Complex. He
plans to develop principles and techniques of quantitative petrographic analysis
which can be used to analyse and understand process- related and kinetic aspects
of a variety of igneous rock types. This RUI award will make it possible to
provide undergraduates with valuable and exciting research experience.
