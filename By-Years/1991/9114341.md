This award supports a long-term visit by Dr. Donald T. Dubin of the University
of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School
to work in the laboratory of Dr. Peter R. Stewart on the molecular evolution of
the bacterial genus Staphylococcus. Members of the genus Staphylococcus are
widespread in nature, as components of the normal flora of mammals and sometimes
as causes of disease. Dr. Dubin will spend a 6-month sabbatical leave visiting
the laboratory of Dr. Stewart, where he will exchange expertise relevant to
molecular characterization of staphylococcus genomes. He will apply Dr.
Stewart's procedures, including in vitro induction of deletions and pulsed field
gel electrophoresis of chromosomal DNA, to strains of staphylococci that are of
special interest for epidemiologic and molecular genetic reasons. These
techniques will be complemented by techniques with which Dr. Dubin's laboratory
has had extensive experience, including the oligonucleotide hybridization of
Southern transfers of chromosomal DNA and polymerase chain reaction-facilitated
sequencing of segments of genome expected to be useful in establishing
phylogenetic relationships; namely, segments of ribosomal RNA genes. The work
will be directed toward goals shared by the two laboratories including better
understanding of the interaction between environmental factors (such as heavy
metal pollution) and widespread agricultural and medical use of antibiotics and
intrinsic genetic factors, in the rapid evolution of staphylococcal species and
strains.
