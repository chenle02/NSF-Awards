Chandler-Gilbert Community College in Arizona is continuing its successful
program, called High-Tech Transfer Program Scholars (HTTPS), in which
academically talented but financially needy students in science, engineering,
computer science, and mathematics are given financial and academic support to
prepare them to achieve an associate's degree or transfer credits and continue
on to contribute to the STEM workforce. Special attention is paid to recruiting
and supporting students underrepresented in the STEM disciplines, particularly
drawing on the regional population of Hispanic and Native American students,
thereby broadening the impact of this program. Women and persons with
disabilities will likewise be encouraged to participate in the HTTPS program's
academic and extra-academic activities.
