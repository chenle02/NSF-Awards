This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing work of Dr.
Frederick D. Lewis at Northwestern University, who is studying organic
photochemistry. The investigation will utilize light to bring about chemical
changes, and it is expected to lead to the development of new or improved
chemical reactions and to provide an enhanced understanding of how chemical
reactions occur. The experiments to be carried out by Dr. Lewis are comprised of
studies involving two broad cagetories of reactions: (1) those in which
photoinduced electron transfer provides the driving force for subsequent
chemical reactions, and (2) those in which the photoreactivity of organic
molecules is enhanced by means of ground-state complexation with strong Lewis
acids. The ground states and the reactive intermediates (exciplexes and radical
ions) in these reactions will be characterized by transient spectroscopy and by
their chemical behavior.
