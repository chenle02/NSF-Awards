Atom-atom collisions, in the projectile energy range between 10 and 600 keV are
studied. Electron ejection cross sections will be measured for 10-300 keV
protons incident on atomic hydrogen. Fundamental properties of inelastic atom-
molecule collisions are studied by means of polarized photon scattered particle
coincidence techniques. Long-range correlation effects of Coulomb-interacting H+
+ H- + H+ are studied using 3-particle coincidence techniques. K and L shell
x-ray production will be studied to test theories of inner shell ionization by
low energy electrons. The results of these experimental investigations are
compared with predictions of theoretical models, and may be used directly to
model processes in high temperature plasmas.
