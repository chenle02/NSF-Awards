Microbial processes are very prominent in research and industry, but few
college laboratories, and fewer high school courses are able to present this
technology to their students. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
project from EDVOTEK, Inc. will conduct research focusing on the feasibility of
developing biotechnology teaching and learning resources, which include cost-
effective fermentation equipment. This equipment will be utilized with
investigative problem-based experiments. Along with the advantages in cost and
simplicity of fermenters, EDVOTEK proposes to craft laboratory experiments
illustrating a variety of processes. Kits of culture media, live inocula, and
all the accessories needed for each experiment will be researched. At this time
there is no fermentation equipment at reasonable cost ($500 to $1000) that can
simulate that used in the biotechnology industry. Likewise, there are no readily
available commercial experiments that can provide new approaches to teaching and
learning fermentation biotechnology. The project will contribute what is
currently unavailable: cost-effective fermentation equipment and accompanying
experiments and thereby enhance student understanding of biological concepts in
such a way as to illuminate student cognizance of the relationship between
laboratory activities and the solution of real-life biotechnology problems.
