Dr. Henry Taube, Chemistry Department, Stanford University, supported by an
award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program, will conduct
research in three areas. First, he will study vanadium complexes in non-aqueous
solvents. The effects of back-bonding on the chemistry of V(II) will be explored
using acetonitrile as a solvent, but some effort will also be devoted to
characterizing the higher oxidation states of vanadium and generating higher
oxidation state species by aerobic oxidation. The second area is the study of
mixed valence molecules. Here work on molecular hysteresis will continue. In
specific systems in which electron transfer is accompanied by structural change,
light of energy corresponding to that of the mixed valence band will be used to
convert one isomeric form to the other and determine the efficiency of the
conversion. Also, molecules based on aromatic poly-ring systems with
osmiumammines bound in the eta-2, -4 or -6 modes will be investigated. Linkage
isomerism in mixed valence molecules based on simple derivatives of benzene will
be studied. In the third area, the mechanism of activation for substitution on a
ligand by a co-ligand which is an oxidizing agent will be explored. The
particular system will involve cyclopentadienone bound to Ru(II), the effect of
which on the rate of substitution of co-ligand cyclopentadienide has been
measured. %%% These fundamental studies involve electron transfer and
substitution reactions of transition metal complexes of vanadium, ruthenium and
osmium. The results of these studies are relevant to the mechanism of action of
catalysts for organic reactions and to conversion of solar to electrical energy.
