The individuals constituting a species frequently differ in appearance from one
locality to another, but the processes which result in this variation are often
difficult to recognize. Processes producing such geographic differentiation
include chance events brought about by isolation or adaptation to local
conditions. Countering these processes is gene flow, the transfer of genetic
material from one location to another (e.g., via the movement of individuals).
Unfortunately, few examples exist where the interplay among such processes is
clearly understood. Island and mainland populations of snakes in western Lake
Erie provide a situation where the importance of gene flow can be studied with
relative ease. These populations are unusual because of the large amount of
color pattern variation they exhibit. Alternative explanations for this
variation differ in the amount of gene flow they require. This project aims to
measure rates of gene flow among island and mainland snake populations using gel
electrophoresis, a technique which makes use of genetically based differences in
protein structure to characterize variation within and among populations.
Coupled with information on local adaptation and on the geological history of
the region, this project will provide an unusually detailed picture of the
processes giving rise to geographic variation.
