Travel funds are provided for Professor Lai to travel to fermilab and Padova,
Italy, to work on the analysis of data from the Fermilab Collider. The data will
be used to continue the search for the quark known as "Top". An international
team is working on the search and Professor Lai has had a particularly close
association and productive with the Padova group, which he will continue.
