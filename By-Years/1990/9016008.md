This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Mark Silverman,
Department of Physics, Trinity College, and Dr. Jacques Badoz, Optics
Laboratory, Ecole Superieure de Physique et Chimie, Paris, France. The objective
of the project is to investigate the interaction of light with chiral media.
Molecules and molecular arrangements characterized by a left- or-right-
handedness (chirality) interact with polarized light to produce diverse
phenomena collectively referred to as optical activity. In this project,
experiments to measure the difference in specular reflection of right and left
circularly polarized light from selected optically active fluids and crystals
will be undertaken for the purpose of 1) resolving a fundamental controversial
issue in the electrodynamics of chiral media, and 2) determining the feasibility
of a new approach to the spectroscopy of chiral materials. The experimental
method will employ photoelastic modulation of the polarization of the reflecting
probe beam and subsequent phase-sensitive detection. From the resulting signal,
the generalized Fresnal coefficients for an isotrophic naturally chiral medium
will be measured for the first time as a function of angle of incidence and
wavelength, and compared with recent theoretical predictions. The interaction of
light with chiral media is of major interest in physics, chemistry, engineering
and the biosciences for both conceptual and practical reasons. The scientific
and educational significance of the proposed project is that it provides a
stringent test of inequivalent electrodynamic descriptions of chiral media. The
project will benefit from the complementary expertise and previous successful
joint work of the two investigators, as well as from the availability of special
instrumentation in the French laboratory.
