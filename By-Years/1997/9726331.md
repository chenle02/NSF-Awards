9726331 Doyle This award supports the participation of American scientists and
engineers in a U.S.-Japan seminar on Robust Virtual Engineering, to be held in
Pasadena, California, from October 5-10, l998. The co-organizers are Professors
John Doyle of the California Institute of Technology and Hidenori Kimura of the
University of Tokyo in Japan. The seminar will undertake a study of Robust
Virtual Engineering. The objective is to focus on constructing a theoretical
basis for virtual engineering and complex systems. The use of "virtual
engineering" suggests both a broader and more focused concept than "modeling and
simulation." It also makes explicit the role of analysis, insight,
understanding, design, and decision-making. The seminar will focus on physics-
based complex systems. Physicists typically do not develop their models so that
they can be incorporated naturally as elements of a larger system. Engineers
typically design systems using methods which are cautious and robust, but
without relying on detailed physical descriptions of the components. The session
will focus on encouraging the incorporation of more detailed physical
descriptions at just the right time and in just the right place for a much more
realistic picture of the ultimate limitations associated with the performance of
the system. It is expected that the interactions between the engineers and
physicists should assist in better planning for the future of virtual
engineering and complex systems. The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese
experts in this field will enable U.S. participants to advance their own work,
and will set the stage for future collaborative projects. Seminar organizers
have made a special effort to involve younger scientists. The proceedings of the
meeting will be made available on the World Wide Web. ***
