The objectives of this research are to design and implement a preliminary
version of a parallel programming language that will: 1. include efficient
implementations of general purpose constructs for both shared and distributed
memory parallel programming, 2. be capable of increasing the execution speed of
applications by at least two orders-of-magnitude, 3. run on a comprehensive set
of processors, 4. adhere to existing standards as closely as possible, 5. be
easy to use and understand, and 6. require minimal recoding of existing
algorithms and libraries.
