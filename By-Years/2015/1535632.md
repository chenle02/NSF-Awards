The project provides addtional support for the Antarctic Meteorological Research
Center (AMRC) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.&lt;br/&gt;The AMRC
currently supports distribution of meteorological data services within the
Division of Polar Programs (NSF USAP; United States Antarctic Program),and
provides access by US users and interested international meterological and
climatological scientists. Reflecting rapidly changing polar cyberinfrastructure
needs, the project also will establish a task force, of knowlegeable users, that
will provide guidance concerning the future sustainability of Antarctic
meteorological and climate data sharing and cyber-infrastructure needs. This
concerted effort represents the USAP's meteorological contribution to the NSF's
Geosciences Directorate broader Earth Cube program.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educational outreach efforts also extends into the
classroom. This outreach efforts aim to demonstrate the use of Antarctic
meteorological datasets to spur interest in high latitude weather, and to
improve student learning in STEM subject areas. Together with formal education,
the project will continue to be invovled with a broader outreach to the general
public.
