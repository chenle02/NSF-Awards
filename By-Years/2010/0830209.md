OPTIMAL TRIANGULATIONS FOR SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING

ABSTRACT FOR PROPOSAL#0830209

Recent progress in scientific computing motivates new triangulation problems. As
new numerical methods being developed, new geometric constraint formulations
that are key in the accuracy and convergence analysis of these methods emerge.
In this two-year project, practical and theoretically sound algorithmic
solutions for a number of triangulation problems will be studied. More
importantly, new software based on these solutions will be developed and made
available to the public. In particular, first ever software for computing acute
and non-obtuse triangulation problems will be deployed. Such software are sought
for in scientific computing as a geometric tool to be coupled with the widely
used finite volume methods as well as in graphics applications. Practical
algorithmic solutions for other triangulation problems such as minimum weight
Steiner triangulations which is expected to find use in networking applications,
will also be studied. In addition, parallelization of the aformentioned
algorithmic solutions will be studied within this project. The project will
ensure its broader impact through distribution and integration of new robust
software. Project personnel consists of one graduate student that will be
selected among underrepresented groups in engineering.
