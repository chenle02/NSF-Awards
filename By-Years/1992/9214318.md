Fairfield University requests support from NSF for connection of its campus
network to the area wide John von Neumann Computer Network (JvNCnet). JvNCnet
will provide operations management and information services and it will give the
University a 56 thousand bits per second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed
(1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone network. Students and
faculty research will benefit from the link. By linking to the mid-level and
national networks Fairfield faculty and academics will maintain a position of
leadership in research and educational innovation by profiting from remote
access to super computer centers, data bases and information services, high
speed communications, file transfer and remote login, and access to library
resources. This is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore
innovative educational resources.***
