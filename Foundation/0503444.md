Abstract

Award: DMS-0503444 Principal Investigator: Justin T. Moore

The Boise Extravaganza in Set Theory is an annual three day conference at Boise
State University devoted to set theory and related areas of mathematics such as
algebra, analysis, combinatorics, logic, and topology. It has occurred
continuously since the first conference in 1992. This proposal is a request for
travel and lodging support for the invited speakers and participants who attend
the conference (particularly students and junior researchers). The main goals of
the conference are as follows: (1) Provide the Western US with an annual
conference in set theory; (2) Provide an organized low-cost event accessible to
graduate students and young researchers; (3) Provide an opportunity for
interaction between the leaders in the field and set theorists early in their
careers; (4) Provide a forum for interactions between set theory and related
areas of mathematics; (5) Represent the many different sub-disciplines within
set theory; (6) Encourage participation by women and minorities when possible.
