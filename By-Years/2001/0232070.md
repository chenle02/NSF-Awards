The primary goal of the research is to predict the extent and diversity of near-
ridge subsurface microbial habitats by constructing thermodynamic and kinetic
models of the geochemical interactions between rocks, fluids, and microorganisms
in the hydrothermally influenced subseafloor. The geochemistry of ridge axis
subseafloor environments will be modeled by calculating the full range of likely
fluid compositions and available microbial energy. The work will build on the
current state of the art in reaction path and reactive transport models by
considering interactions between fluids, rock and microbes, involving a suite of
likely crustal compositions, phase-separated fluids, conductivity-cooled fluids,
and mixtures of these with seawater and conductively-heated seawater.
