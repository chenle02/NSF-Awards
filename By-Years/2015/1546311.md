The "Workshop on Springer Theory and Related Topics" will be held on October
9-11, 2015, at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. The webpage for the
workshop is http://www.math.lsu.edu/~pramod/UMass2015/. The workshop will expose
a large audience to the most important themes related to Springer theory and
provide updates on its applications in representation theory and other domains.
The goals of the workshop are: (1) to allow for cross-pollination of ideas among
researchers working in Springer theory and related topics; (2) to facilitate
exposure of the subject to young researchers in representation theory; and (3)
to build up a regional network in representation theory in the Northeast. This
award provides support for the travel and lodging of conference speakers, as
well as US-based participants who are graduate students, postdoctoral scholars,
scholars from groups underrepresented in the mathematical sciences, and
researchers who do not have federal support. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Springer
theory was developed by T.A. Springer in the late 1970's and it helps explain
the central role of a finite symmetry group (the Weyl group) in controlling the
symmetries of more complicated related groups (finite groups of Lie type, real
Lie groups, and others). Springer theory and its generalizations remain central
to many modern developments in representation theory, as well as the application
of representation theory in neighboring domains. Topics to be addressed at this
workshop include Lusztig's theory of character sheaves, links between Springer
theory and the representation theory of p-adic groups, affine Springer fibers
and applications, the geometric Langlands program, global and elliptic Springer
theory, modular Springer theory and connections to modular representation
theory, and connections between Springer theory and knot theory.
