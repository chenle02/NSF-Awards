Support will be provided for the International Conference on Magnetism to be
held in San Francisco, California, August 26-30, 1985. This conference will
bring together scientists and engineers from university, industrial, and federal
laboratories from all parts of the world, and will feature invited and
contributed papers in physics, chemistry, materials science, metallurgy,
ceramics, and engineering. This conference will include discussions ranging from
fundamental experimental and theoretical studies of lower dimensional systems
and random fields, to applications of magneto-optics, magneto-chemistry, and
magnetic storage of information in thin film ferromagnetic and magnetic bubble
devices. This major international conference occurs in the United States
approximately every fifteen years, and probably will not return before the end
of this century.
