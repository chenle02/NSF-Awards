This is an award to support research the objective of which is to obtain a
better understanding than now exists of the effect that airborne particles have
on regional visibility and climate. Data from laboratory experiments and field
measurements by this Presidential Young Investigator will be used to validate
existing radiative transfer computer models that have been developed to predict
the effects that aerosols have on transfer of light through the earth's
atmosphere. Results of this research are likely to be applied in improvement of
existing and formulation of new computer models for use in designing air
pollution control strategies. The results are also expected to assist in
elucidating the role that aerosols play in global warming.
