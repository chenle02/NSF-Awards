AST-0201636 Arras, Philip

Dr. Arras is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship
to carry out a program of research and education at the Institute for
Theoretical Physics at the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB). He
will conduct theoretical studies of the tidal interactions between stars and
planets. His work will explore the tidal effect of the primary star on various
orbiting objects: close-in extrasolar planets, Jupiter-type planets, stars which
are still forming, and ordinary low-mass stars. He hopes to use his calculations
to explain recent observations of extrasolar planets as well as observations of
Jupiter's atmosphere. For his educational component, he will develop two new
physics courses to be taught at UCSB: a graduate course on galactic dynamics,
and an undergraduate course on fluid mechanics called "The Physics of
California" that will apply the material to local natural phenomena such as
waves and earthquakes. ***
