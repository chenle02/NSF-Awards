The National Science Foundation has awarded a grant to the University of Central
Oklahoma for the acquisition of an automated DNA sequencer. This instrument will
provide the University with a fully functional molecular biology laboratory,
allowing faculty and students to perform a wide array of research projects at
their home institution. A large proportion of the Biology Department faculty
perform molecular biology research that will leverage the sequencer capabilities
for studies in the fields of viral/parasite-host species co-evolution,
population genetics, phylogeography, molecular systematics, molecular ecology,
and genome evolution. This research is conducted on a diversity of organisms,
including mammals, birds, reptiles, insects, plants, and fungi. Results from the
research conducted will be presented at scientific meetings and published in a
variety of peer-reviewed journals. UCO is a non-Ph.D. granting, predominantly
undergraduate, metropolitan university. A long-term goal of the university
emphasizes transformative learning, including the integration of research and
teaching activities, transitioning from traditional lecture-based courses to the
incorporation of more hands-on research and inquiry-based education. To aid in
this transformative learning goal, the Department of Biology encourages students
to engage in research activities, especially research projects with faculty
members outside of the traditional classroom. The department currently serves
nearly 900 undergraduate majors.
