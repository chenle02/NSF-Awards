This proposal seeks funding to conduct a pilot study to establish the
operational feasibility of an International Regimes Database (IRD), a large
scale computerized information system under development in cooperation with
IIASA (International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis). This database will
allow analysts to conduct systematic quantitative and qualitative studies
answering a wide range of questions about the role of international regimes in
environmental issue areas. Ultimately, the generalization of this database will
allow social scientists to formulate answers to major questions about
international regimes: Do they matter? What conditions control the formation of
regimes? Why are some regimes more effective than others? The project staff will
create both paper and computerized data forms as well as instruction guidelines
for the use of the protocol codes. Twelve to 24 cases will be coded during the
grant period. This project falls within the scope of the Human Dimensions of
Global Change initiative. It will be jointly funded by the a grant from the
TransCoop Program of the German-American Academic Council Foundation.
