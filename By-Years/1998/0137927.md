Proposal ID: AST 0137927&lt;br/&gt;PI: Gronwall, Caryl&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr.
Gronwall is awarded funds at Pennsylvania State University to carry out a multi-
wavelength study of the star formation history of the universe. She will use
optical, infrared, and ultraviolet observations of large samples of emission-
line galaxies to measure the density of the star formation rate at different
look-back times. Dr. Gronwall will use data obtained from many sources,
including the Hobby-Eberly Telescope, the Advanced Camera for Suveys on the
Hubble Space Telescope, and the Space Infrared Telescope Facility. The
observational results will be incorporated into Dr. Gronwall's models of the
evolution of galaxies over time.&lt;br/&gt;
