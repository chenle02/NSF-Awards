Travel support will be provided for 14 young researchers and 1 frontier session
organizer from US institutions to attend the 2011 Applied Probability Conference
to be held in Stockholm, Sweden. Priority for support will be given to
researchers who have received their PhD within the last five years and to
graduate students in the last year of their PhD programs, as well as worthy
candidates from underrepresented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Applied probability is an extremely active area of research and
interest in the field cuts across many scientific disciplines including
operations research, computer science, combinatorics, mathematics, statistics,
physics and biology. Researchers from these different fields raise different
questions about and bring different perspectives to similar problems. Thus,
there is great benefit in bringing together these researchers to enable cross-
fertilization of ideas. The Applied Probability Society is a focus group within
the INFORMS (INstitute For Operations Research and the Management Sciences)
professional society. Its biannual conferences have established themselves as a
leading forum in the field of applied probability. The conference will consist
of three plenary talks from distinguished speakers, two tutorial sessions, over
seventy invited and contributed sessions, each of ninety minutes duration with
three speakers. In addition, there will also be a few ``frontier'' sessions, in
which survey talks and open problems in areas of research at the cutting edge of
applied probability will be presented such as random matrix theory, smart grids
and systems biology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference plays a major role in
establishing connections between different areas of applied probability that can
potentially lead to significant new developments in the field. The conference
also serves an important educational purpose, enabling young researchers from
all around the world to present their work and at the same time keep abreast of
the latest advances in the field.
