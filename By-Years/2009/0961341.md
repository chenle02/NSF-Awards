Monetary incentives such as punishment and reward are widely used to enforce
cooperation. Previous research in this area has generally focused on how
incentives change monetary payoffs of actions. Recently, scholars have conducted
experimental research suggesting that the effectiveness of punishment depends on
its ability to express norms. This research contributes to this emerging
literature by offering further evidence on how to improve the effectiveness of
incentives by highlighting their communication role. The research team
investigates how profitability of punishment diminishes the norm communication
role of punishment and therefore mitigates punishment?s efficacy. Topics include
how the norm communication role of incentives can be affected by the framing of
incentives (e.g., a tax or a punishment) as well as by how the incentive is
implemented (e.g. public vs. private). The project studies how the signaling
role of reward can be a useful tool for improving reputation feedback systems
and solving the moral hazard problems in settings with asymmetric information.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate goal is to contribute to understanding how to
maintain social order and norm obedience in society and markets and to help
answer such questions as: 1) why norm violations are long-lasting in corrupt
societies; 2) how tax and punishment achieve different outcomes even though each
changes the payoffs of the target behavior in the same way; and 3) how the
market itself can solve the moral hazard problem. The findings of these studies
will have broad policy implications for all who use incentives to promote
cooperation, and will likewise demonstrate the importance of certain
communication previously ignored aspects of monetary incentives.
