This award will support the development of techniques for making in situ
analyses of oxygen and sulfur isotopes in oxide, silicate and sulfide minerals
using fluorine gas and laser heating for the liberation of oxygen and sulfur.
The technique development work will be carried out in the Geophysical Laboratory
of the Carnegie Institution of Washington which will provide necessary equipment
as well as technical and scientific personnel for the project. It is anticipated
that the improved method of stable isotope analysis will have application in a
wide variety of investigations where high-resolution, in situ, isotopic analyses
are required including, for example, siliceous cements binding detrital grains
in sandstones, phenocrysts in plutonic and volcanic rocks, zoned porphyroblasts
in metamorphic rocks, and crustiform deposits of sulfide, silicate, and oxide
minerals in ore deposits.
