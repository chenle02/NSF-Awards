Bdellovibrios are procaryotic predators which prey on susceptible gram negative
bacilli basteria. The unique predatory and intraperiplasmic growth phase makes
the lifestyle of the bdellovibrios different from that of other bacteria and
places these organisms in a distinctive class. Although the bdellovibrios are
widely distributed in nature, little is known about the diversity of the
organisms in various ecosystems. Characterization of different isolates of the
predatory bacteria has been insufficient to allow for more than a rudimentary
classification scheme and taxonomic system. The halophilic group of the
bdellovibrios are all placed in one group in the existing system. This situation
exists because state of-the art molecular methods used to differentiate among
bacterial species and subspecies have not been applied to the study of these
organisms. The aim of this project is to use the available molecular
fingerprinting and ribosomal RNA sequencing techniques to differentiate among
over 40 isolates of bdellovibrios in Dr. Williams' collection, which is the most
extensive one known. Isolates in this collection were obtained from various
environmental sources from wide geographical areas of the world including the
Chesapeake Bay, coastal waters of St. Johns Island in the Caribbean, Puerto
Rico, Bermuda, Hawaii, several isolates from soil, sewage and rivers in Russia
and water and soil samples from Nigeria. Another major aim of this project,
which is consistent with those of the Minority Career Advancement Award, is to
provide the Principal Investigator with the opportunity to develop expertise in
the application of molecular techniques to his area of expertise, the ecology of
the bdellovibrios.
