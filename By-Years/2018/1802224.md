This project involves research in the areas of analytic number theory and
additive combinatorics. An important class of problems in these areas concern
the distribution of prime numbers, a topic that has had important applications
in theoretical computer science, cryptography, and financial security. One of
the main goals of this research project is to make progress on the
distributional properties of primes and other related arithmetic objects, by
developing further the classical analytic tools and the more modern additive
combinatorial tools, and by understanding how to effectively combine these two
different tools together. It is hoped that the need for stronger results to
cater for applications in analytic number theory will drive the development of
additive combinatorics, and vice versa. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically,
the PI will continue his work surrounding additive problems involving primes by
developing and combining aforementioned analytic and combinatorial tools. The
classical approaches using the theory of L-functions and sieve theory have
achieved great results in this direction, and it is expected that by
incorporating tools from additive combinatorics one can go beyond what the
classical methods could achieve. The PI will also continue to investigate the
theory of Gowers norms for multiplicative functions and for the von-Mangoldt
function. These are "higher-order" extensions to classical exponential sum
estimates involving these functions. The study of general Gowers norms for these
functions is an essential analytic input for applying additive combinatorial
tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
