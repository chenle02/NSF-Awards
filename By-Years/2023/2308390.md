Ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) are comparable in size to ordinary spirals but
have dwarf galaxy-like luminosities. As a result, they possess extremely low
surface brightness, and as a consequence, significant numbers have only fairly
recently been cataloged. There is currently no coherent explanation for UDGs,
and their surprising range of properties (e.g., some UDGs are dark matter
dominated while others appear to lack dark matter altogether) suggest multiple
formation pathways. The research team will tease apart potentially distinct
paths of UDG origins through the integration of observations and theory for a
large sample of UDGs. Undergraduate students represent an integral part of this
research project and will have opportunities to make high impact discoveries.
This project will also have synergies with the Cal-Bridge program.

The research will combine photometric and spectroscopic data obtained with 8 and
10m-class telescopes and state-of-the-art simulations of galaxy and star cluster
evolution in a cosmological context. The fundamental properties to be studied
include UDG star formation histories, chemical abundance patterns, angular
momentum, dynamical structure, dark matter content, globular cluster (GC)
populations, and infall times. Key project goals include: (1) determining
whether GC-rich and GC-poor UDGs belong to distinctly different families, (2)
establishing the evolutionary connections between UDGs in different
environments, (3) between UDGs and other dwarfs, (4) testing a new formation
model for galaxies with no dark matter, and (5) identifying more examples of
these galaxies.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
