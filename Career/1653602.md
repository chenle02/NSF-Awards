Natural and social systems involving many interacting agents can accurately be
described by probabilistic models. This is the case for a large class of systems
in condensed matter physics, data science, finance, computer science, and pure
mathematics. The behavior of such complex systems depends crucially on rare
events, or extrema, that may have a large impact on their dynamics. This project
is a rigorous study of the fundamental patterns that arise in a wide range of
complex systems exhibiting many different extrema. The aim is to develop general
quantitative methods to understand the statistics of extrema of these systems
and to draw new connections with related problems in mathematics and physics. It
also involves the advanced training of students in the applications of
probability in data science, finance, and computer science in partnership with
practitioners in academia and in industry.

More precisely, complex systems can be viewed as stochastic processes with
strongly correlated random variables. The statistics of extrema of such
processes are still poorly understood from a rigorous point of view. Important
examples include disordered systems in statistical mechanics (e.g., spin
glasses), which are closely related to optimization problems in computer and
data sciences. The focus of the project is on developing new probability methods
in two instances: realistic spin glasses in statistical mechanics and the
Riemann zeta function in number theory. In particular, it builds on recent
progress in the description of infinite-dimensional models of spin glasses to
propose a new rigorous method to investigate the behavior of realistic (finite-
dimensional) spin glasses, which exhibit unusual magnetic behavior due to the
presence of many extremal energies. The program also outlines new directions of
research in pure mathematics by studying the Riemann zeta function as a
disordered system. The objectives are to develop methods of statistical
mechanics to study the extreme values of the Riemann zeta function in a short
interval of the critical strip, and to explore the implications in number
theory.
