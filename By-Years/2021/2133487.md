In software security, it is imperative to discover vulnerabilities in software
and patch them before attackers exploit them. Fuzzing, which tests a target
program with mutated inputs, is an effective technique for vulnerability
discovery. Whitebox fuzzing (also known as concolic execution) collects detailed
runtime information such as path constraints to precisely determine which input
bytes to change and how to change them. Unfortunately, concolic execution has
not been widely used, because of its low efficiency, lack of scalability, and
unsatisfactory usability. This project aims to bring vulnerability discovery
capability to the next level by significantly improving the efficiency,
scalability, and usability of concolic execution, and designing a fuzzing system
with concolic execution being the central component. The proposed research, if
successful, can push vulnerability-discovery research to another level: finding
vulnerabilities much faster than before, and finding vulnerabilities that are
otherwise impossible to find using the existing techniques. As a result, more
vulnerabilities can be patched before attackers find and exploit them, improving
the security and quality of software systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
aims to develop: (1) a fast binary-code concolic execution engine, which
significantly improves the efficiency of concolic execution for binary code by
automatically switching between concrete mode and symbolic mode; (2) dual
concolic execution, which combines source-code concolic execution and binary-
code concolic execution to achieve best efficiency and usability simultaneously;
and (3) a new hybrid fuzzing framework, in which concolic execution plays a
central role, in terms of whether or not to flip a branch, which testcase to
select next, and which testcases are discarded or synchronized with the other
fuzzers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
