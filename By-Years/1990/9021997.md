The objective of this research is to identify ways in which computer
simulations can be used to expedite the design of reading and spelling
instruction. In many fields, computer models serve as surrogates for real-life
situations. By running the models under various conditions, it is possible to
evaluate theories and examine their utility, thus vastly increasing the
likelihood that eventual real-life experimentation will be productive and cost-
effective. Only recently have methods been devised for simulating some of the
basic operations involved in learning to read. This research will extend these
models, developed by Terence Sejnowski and James McClelland, to incorporate more
of the natural complexities of reading than have been previously included. For
example, the research will extend the models to study how the process of
learning to read is affected by the way a word looks, the way it sounds, by the
number of syllables, by simultaneous practice on spelling, and by first learning
rules for pronouncing letter- sound units within words (phonics). The research
will use these computer models to guide classroom experiments. For over 200
years there has been controversy over the ways in which such factors influence
learning to read. As a result, "compromise" methods of teaching reading have
been adopted and have proved ineffective with much of the population. Survey
data have shown literacy in the United States to be at a dangerously low ebb,
with fewer than 5% of our citizens reading well enough to handle college-level
textbooks, for example. Knowledge gained by the use of advanced computer-
simulation technology as a guide to experimentation can help to put the practice
of reading instruction on a sound scientific footing.
