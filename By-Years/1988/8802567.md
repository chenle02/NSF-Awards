Meteorologists have long appreciated certain salient features common to most of
the rapidly intensifying cyclones in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics. The
interaction of a traveling short.wave and a long.wave trough, the relative
position of the upper.level disturbance and the surface low pressure center, the
latent heat released from condensation when the storm is further developed are
among the elements considered essential in explosive cyclogenesis. Taking a
theoretical approach, Professor Barcilon and Dr. Weng will use a nonlinear
two.layer Eady.type model to study the roles of planetary and synoptic waves in
extratropical cyclogenesis and the role of extratropical cyclones in the
evolution of large.scale circulation.
