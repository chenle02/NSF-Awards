Students first learn statistical thinking through simple graphics like bar
charts and histograms. At the college level, a graphical approach to statistics
is less often used. This is so in part because good graphics have only just
become available on computers. Possibly a more important reason is that while
numerical methods have a firm mathematical footing, graphical statistics have
consisted primarily of methods of graphing, without accompanying theory. In this
research, the project is developing a theoretically sound graphical approach to
regression analysis, which is the collection of statistical techniques designed
to understand how one variable depends on others. What differentiates this
project from others on graphics is the development of a unified theory to make
graphs more comprehensible, and much more useful in the analysis of data. The
project is producing self-contained teaching materials, textbooks and teacher's
aids, and presenting workshops for college teachers on how to use this material.
