The goal of this SLC Catalyst activity is to create a Center for the Science of
Learning in Urban Educating Institutions with a particular focus on school-based
learning of mathematics and science. The theme of "mental models" is proposed as
the focus in developing a more coherent view of how urban students cope with the
increasingly complex demands of academic learning in the important transition
years from middle school to college, and to explore more fully how their mental
models enhance or deter their academic progress. One of the scientific merits of
this work is the aim to bring more coherence to current conceptions of mental
models by assembling a team of experts from disciplines in the cognitive,
neurocognitive, and socio-cultural sciences who will synthesize current
understanding of the idea of mental models into a theoretical framework to guide
a series of carefully crafted studies to better document how urban youth learn
mathematics and science. The broader impacts of the research on how urban
students learn complex academic subjects through their mental representations
include the inventions of new learning strategies to enhance urban student's
academic progress, especially improving their opportunities to excel at skills
needed to succeed in academic studies and to be better prepared to enter
colleges and universities. We will utilize digital technology and distance
learning strategies to augment classroom-based instructional strategies.
Evidence from this research will be used to develop new curriculum materials and
teacher education programs to ensure that the work is widely
disseminated.&lt;br/&gt;
