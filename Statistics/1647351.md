This award will support the Multidisciplinary Complex Systems Research Workshop
to be held at the National Science Foundation in Arlington, Virginia, September
12-14, 2016. The workshop will bring together a diverse group of experts in
complementary areas of complex systems and will be preceded by a series of
weekly webinars. The overarching goal of the activity is to address scientific
issues that are relevant to the scientific community and bring to surface
possible areas of opportunity for multidisciplinary research in the study of
complex systems. The specific goals of the workshop include: 1) identifying the
most substantive research questions that can be addressed by fundamental complex
systems research; 2) recognizing community needs, knowledge gaps, and barriers
to research progress in this area; 3) identifying future directions that cut
across disciplinary boundaries and that are likely to lead to transformative
multidisciplinary research in complex systems. The outcomes of the workshop will
include the preparation of a report to inform the scientific community at large
of the current status and challenges as well as future opportunities in
multidisciplinary complex systems research as perceived by the participants of
the workshop.

The workshop is motivated by the observation that many processes in natural,
engineered, and social contexts exhibit emergent collective behavior and are
thus governed by complex systems. Because challenges in understanding,
predicting, designing, and controlling complex systems are often common to many
domains, a central objective of the workshop is to facilitate the exchange of
ideas across different fields and avoid disciplinary boundaries typical of many
traditional scientific meetings. The workshop participants will include experts
both in theory and in applications as well as a selection of postdoctoral
researchers and graduate students from various domains. Because of the cross-
disciplinary nature of the workshop, the participants themselves will become
aware of the latest developments in fields related to but different from their
own. This environment will foster discussions on the state of the art, potential
issues, and most promising directions in multidisciplinary complex systems
research. The inclusion of early-career researchers will help to promote the
transfer of this expertise to the next generation of engineers, mathematicians,
and scientists.
