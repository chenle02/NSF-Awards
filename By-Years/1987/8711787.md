The ultimate objective of this research is to obtain insight into the
mechanisms concerned in the activation of the egg during fertilization. Emphasis
will be on investigating how membrane potential changes as signals are
transduced into intracellular processes following sperm attachment.
Electrophysiological measurements on voltage clamped eggs will be combined with
video digital image processing to correlate electrical events with (a)
morphological changes in the living cell difficult otherwise to resolve, (b) the
occurrence of cortical actin filament assembly using fluorescently labeled actin
or phallicidin, and (c) changes in intracellular Ä±Ca2+! and pH and the
localization of these changes using fluorescent indicators and image ratioing
methods. Investigation of the mechanism whereby membrane potentials in the
neighborhood of resting (-70mV) suppress sperm entry (although activation
proceeds) will be pursued. The possibility that the suppression of sperm entry
is the consequence of an effect of negative membrane potential on assembly of
actin filaments will be investigated. Dr. Chambers's laboratory has been active
for many years in the study of the physiology of sea urchin egg activation at
fertilization. The sea urchin egg is chosen in these studies because this egg
(which has about the same size and yolk content as the human egg) is
transparent, large, readily available in large numbers and withstands laboratory
manipulations. In a more general context, the research is directed toward
understanding the mechanisms whereby a quiescent cell, at rest, is activated to
undergo mitosis, cell division and growth.
