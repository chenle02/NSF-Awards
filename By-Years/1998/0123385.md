Abstract

THERMES 2002 is a workshop/conference which will focus on the recent advances in
thermal management and characterization schemes, as well as forecasts and
analyses of future trends. It is to be held in Santa Fe, New Mexico, in early
2002. Thermal issues are key in electronic product development at all levels of
the electronic product hierarchy, from the chip to the ultimate system.
Shrinking system sizes are resulting in increasing volumetric heat generation
rates and surface heat fluxes in many products. In addition to the U.S.
participants, a significant international participation from Europe and Asia is
expected. Invited talks in selected emerging areas will be complemented with
contributed papers. Panel discussions focusing on technology and market trends
and identification of research challenges will be included. The funds will help
support travel for U.S. participants consisting of undergraduate and graduate
students, post-doctoral fellows, and non-tenured faculty with limited research
funding.
