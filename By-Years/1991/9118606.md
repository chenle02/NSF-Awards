The Knotted (Kn1) locus, defined by dominant mutations that affect leaf
development, was cloned by transposon tagging. Subsequent sequence analysis
demonstrated that Kn1 encodes a homeodomain, a DNA-binding motif encoded by a
number of Drosophila developmental genes. While the dominant, gain-of-function
mutations specifically affect the leaf, initial results demonstrate that in
normal plants, the protein is abundant in meristems and not detectable in
developing leaves. The present goal is to understand the wildtype function of
the Kn1 gene using both genetic and molecular approaches. Loss of function
mutations will be isolated in maize and the gene will be ectopically expressed
in transgenic plants to evaluate the phenotype and functional domains of the
gene. Unlinked suppressors will be isolated in Arabidopsis using either the
maize gene or a putative Arabidopsis Kn1 homolog. Sequences bound by the Kn1
protein in vivo will be immunoprecipitated using a monoclonal antibody to
determine what genes might be regulated by Kn1. Kn1 has many features expected
of a key regulatory gene including the homeobox, meristematic expression, and
provocative mutant phenotypes. Understanding how Kn1 functions may provide
fundamental insight into the genetic control of plant development.
