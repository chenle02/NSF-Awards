Data protection and recovery have become increasing important as business,
education, and government depend more and more on digital information.
&lt;br/&gt;Failure events do occur such as virus attacks, user errors, defective
software/firmware, hardware faults, and site failures etc that cause data
damage. To ensure business continuity and minimize loss, data storage systems
need data protection and recovery techniques. However, existing technologies
have severe limitations and unable to recover data in many situations. This
project aims at studying and understanding how data recovery is done in existing
data storage systems, and designing new architectures that will overcome the
limitations of existing technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to study
and understand the existing storage architectures, a new mathematical
formulation will be developed to model and analyze capabilities and limitations
of the storage architectures. This mathematical model provides a rigorous tool
for researchers and practitioners to investigate and understand storage system
architectures. &lt;br/&gt;Based on the new mathematical model, a class of new
data storage system architectures will be designed that will have the maximum
data recoverability. The new storage architectures make it possible for
organizations of different sizes to have a cost-effective data storage that
provides high data availability and allows quick data recovery upon failures. In
addition to the theoretical study, experimental prototypes will be developed and
implemented to demonstrate the feasibility, performance, reliability, and data
recoverability of newly designed storage architectures. Furthermore, the project
includes an education component that advocates a shift of emphasis from CPU-
centric computer engineering (CE) curriculum to data-centric CE curriculum. The
new curriculum provides CE students with in depth knowledge of data processing,
data communication, and data storage. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
