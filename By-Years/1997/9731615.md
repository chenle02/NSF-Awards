Undergraduates interested in research in field biology will be selected to
participate in a program at the University of Michigan Biological Station in
Pellston, MI. Students will both learn and live at the Station during the eight-
week summer session. The research experience will be the sole focus of their
activities during that period. Each selected student will work with a faculty
mentor, attend special evening workshops, attend weekly discussion meetings,
attend general seminars at the Station, and develop his or her own research
project (from conception of the ideas, through collection of data, to verbal and
written presentation of the study). Students will be selected on the basis of
academic excellence, letters of recommendation, and evidence of interest in
research. After participation in the program, each student will help in the
evaluation of his or her experience in the program.
