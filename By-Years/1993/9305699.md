The Institute of Statistics and Decision at Duke University will purchase a four
processor, 400 MIP, 512 megabyte computer with a one gigabyte disk, a high
resolution color printer, and systems personnel support. These items will be
dedicated to the support of research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment
and services will be used for several research projects, including in
particular: Statistical Image Analysis, Markov Chain Monte Carlo Strategies,
Multivariate Mixture Models, Optimal Sequential Designs and Stochastic
Optimization, and Bayesian Partial Differential Equation Models.
