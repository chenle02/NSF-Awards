Intellectual merit

This project will lead to the development of novel and efficient cofactor
regeneration bacterial strains for whole cell biotransformation of chiral
compounds, which are often used as intermediates in the synthesis of important
pharmaceutical compounds. The project will investigate the idea of using
modification of essential cell metabolic pathways for regeneration of the
cofactor and thus the integration of the engineered bioprocess with overall cell
physiology.

Broader impacts

The ability to regenerate cofactor efficiently will have impacts on a number of
processes. In addition, the framework developed in this work could be applied to
other systems for the production of many biochemical products that require the
cofactor NADPH for their biosynthesis. The projects will provide training
opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. Participation in this
type of research will provide graduate students with interdisciplinary training
in biochemical and metabolic engineering, biosystems engineering, biochemistry
and molecular biology.
