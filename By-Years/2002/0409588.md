Lehigh University establishes an International Materials Institute (IMI) on
glass science. The goal of the IMI is to advance glass science and education on
a global scale. The effort focuses on the functional aspects of glass science,
including glassy meta-materials (novel glasses and nanocomposites), functional
coatings, glasses engineered for strength, ionic functionality, optical
functionality, and bio-functionality. The IMI has a 'virtual' character as it
involves strong participation from Penn State University and from eight other
universities (Alfred, Cornell, Coe College, MIT, Alabama A&M, RPI, UC-Davis,
Ohio U) and two government laboratories (Livermore, Brookhaven). Foreign
participants are mainly from Western Europe (France, Germany, Greece, Czech
Republic, Italy, UK, Portugal), with one additional each from Japan, India and
Brazil. Three glass organizations representing the interest of glass companies
advise the investigators with industry's view of the most promising
functionalities. Activities of the IMI include international exchange programs
of faculty, postdoctoral associates and students; lectures and courses by senior
researchers; an REU program; multi-media education modules; pre-college
experiments and demonstrations; and annual workshops. The IMI activities will be
evaluated annually by independent experts.
