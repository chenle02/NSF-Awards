The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to reduce
damage from undetected hot-spots in turbine engines, a common industry problem
which impacts costs in repairs, maintenance, and unplanned downtime. Industrial
gas turbine production is expected to increase over the coming years and these
turbines are expected to operate at much higher temperatures to achieve higher
efficiencies, thereby being prone to more incidents that involve overheating.
Hotspots go undetected because current thermocouple systems are generally not
capable of being placed in pertinent areas and because of bulky cables that
restrict placement inside gas turbines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps
project is based on wireless passive sensors that have significant impacts on a
new class of sensor technology which is suitable for harsh-environment
applications such as turbines, rockets, and fuel cells. This technology can
provide reliable long-term sensing to increase the efficiency, improve the
operational reliability and reduce the pollution for many systems. A temperature
sensor using dielectric resonator structure, a low-profile reflective patch
temperature sensor, and a pressure sensor based on evanescent-mode resonator
structure, have been demonstrated with operation up to 1300C. These sensors are
made of high-temperature-stable and corrosion-resistant Silicoboron Carbonitride
(SiBCN) ceramic materials which are suitable for harsh-environment applications.
The pressure sensor uses an evanescent-mode resonator structure, in which an air
gap dimension decreases when the external pressure increases, causing a decrease
in the resonant frequency.
