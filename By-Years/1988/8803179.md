This award, under the auspices of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates
initiative, permits undergraduate students to participate in current research
activities under the supervision of faculty members actively engaged in research
at the graduate level and beyond. The project is expected to enhance the various
research activities by providing assistance to the investigators as well as to
increase the future pool of scientifically trained personnel to meet anticipated
national needs.
