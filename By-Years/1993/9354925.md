GER-9354925 University of Maryland-College Park Heiz ABSTRACT The University of
Maryland at College Park proposes to establish a new graduate traineeship
program in Ground Water Chemistry and Hydrology. A very talented faculty in this
field has been assembled over the past decade by several departments, acting
independently. Interdepartmental coordination of their activities did not begin
until recently. this traineeship program will be the catalyst for promoting the
further organization of these scientists and engineers into a nationally visible
group. Maryland can offer graduate students special opportunities to use state-
of-the-art analytical methods (e.d. AMS, EXAFS, TIMS, INAA) in their study of
ground water problems. The State presents an unusual diversity of ground water
environments and problems within easy reach of the campus. Although ground water
hydrology/hydrogeology is the fastest growing area of graduate hiring in the
earth sciences, the production of PhDs in this field has not increased in nearly
two decades. A 1991 NRC study has stressed the need for multidisciplinary
education in this field, a concept which this proposal addresses specifically.
Integration of fundamental science and engineering research is a goal of the
program. The program will be managed by the Maryland Water Resources Research
Center.
