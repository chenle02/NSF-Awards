This project focuses on enhancing the quality of undergraduate education for
electrical engineers by incorporating the most relevant demand areas in
technology into the undergraduate curriculum. The explosive growth in fiber
optics and optoelectronics is expected to create a huge demand for trained
engineers in that area. To make students proficient with state-of-the-art
technology, the project is developing two new laboratory courses in fiber optics
and optoelectronics. These two laboratories complement the courses in fiber
optical communications and semiconductor optoelectronic devices that are being
planned for the near future. These laboratories are providing hands-on
experiments that illustrate fiber optics and optoelectronics principles and
applications. The experiments are designed in such a way that the concepts from
the classroom are reinforced in the laboratory. The experiments vary in
difficulty from simple operations, such as handling and measuring the numerical
aperture of a multi-mode fiber, to very advanced procedures such as coherent
communications. The implementation of the new laboratory courses also includes
the incorporation of innovative teaching techniques such as active learning,
team learning, and corporate learning into the laboratories. *
