Dissemination of recent scientific findings on modern biodiversity research,
including molecular phylogenetic studies, has been a hallmark of the Missouri
Botanical Garden's annual fall symposium on Systematics. These two to four day
gatherings bring together ca. 400 researchers and students, in a program of
public lectures, informal meetings, and opportunities to use the library and
herbarium of this large botanical institution. Publication of the formal
presentations, usually within one year of the meeting, increases the impact of
the event and makes available to a worldwide audience these latest findings.
Topics for the next five years include: 1990, Biogeographic relationships
between Africa and South America; 1991, Computer databases in systematics; 1992,
Structure of biological populations and evolution; 1993, Andean biogeography;
and 1994, Origin and phylogenetic relationships of the major plant groups.
Senior researchers in the field as well as young investigators are typically
included in the roster of speakers, thus encouraging a new generation of
scientific study in systematics.
