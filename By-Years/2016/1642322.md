The Division of Chemistry supports a workshop entitled "Workshop on Chemical
Sciences Needs for Mid-Scale Instrument Development" organized by Professor
Marcos Dantus of Michigan State University and Paul Bohn of the University of
Notre Dame. This workshop brings together a diverse group of 35 participants
from a broad range of institutions and geographic areas to discuss opportunities
for instrument usage in the "mid-scale" range. These discussions focus on
instrument development activities that meet the needs of the chemistry
community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workshop addresses the following objectives:
define national needs in the chemical sciences for mid-scale instrument
development, organize needs assessment around chemical grand challenge problems,
and develop a report specifying prioritized objectives in chemistry. The broader
impacts are addressed by dissemination of the findings and recommendations which
start a broader conversation among key stakeholders in the US chemical sciences
community, including instrument developers, facility managers, and users, as
well as federal agencies supporting chemical sciences.
