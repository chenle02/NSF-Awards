This planning grant will build a regional coalition to coordinate the
mathematics in-service activities of several large and complicated systems.
Working with local consortia of business, basic education, and higher education
leaders working to achieve educational reform, the project director and senior
staff will coordinate the mathematics teacher enhancement activities of these
groups. The objectives include ascertaining 1) mathematics in-service needs, 2)
equipment and technology needs, 3) the types of in-service materials needed, 4)
the appropriate role of mathematics specialists, and 5) how to meet the needs of
a growing population traditionally underrepresented in the mathematical
sciences. Other objectives include summarizing the findings of relevant
literature and research, and beginning work on a model mathematics curriculum
and model school infrastructure. The project will culminate with the submission
of a Teacher Enhancement Program proposal. To accomplish these objectives the
proposers will form a national and a regional advisory board composed of leaders
from the constituencies served by the grant activities. During the twelve months
of the grant the project director and four senior staff members will meet
weekly. The Regional Advisory Board will meet monthly, while the National
Advisory Board will conduct business via the mail and telephone. Th grant
activities will benefit all schools served by Intermediate Units model for
cooperative efforts to improve mathematics instruction involving basic and
higher education institutions, business and industry, government, teachers, and
parents.
