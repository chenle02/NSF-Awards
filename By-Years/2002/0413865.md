With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
continues its support of the work of Professor Steven R. Kass of the Department
of Chemistry at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN. The research will
extend the PI's work on the gas phase chemistry of energetic organic molecules.
These experimental studies will be combined with high-level computations to
investigate the reactions of zwitterions, antiaromatic molecules, reactive
intermediates, and lithium substituted radicals. Zwitterions, species with both
a positive and negative charge, of are of extraordinary significance in
synthetic, biological, and materials chemistry. The proposed experiments are
designed to provide fundamental information concerning the effects of charge
separation on the structure and stability of these important species.
Investigations of antiaromatic compounds and reactive intermediates will be
carried out in order to determine the factors that contribute to the lifetimes
and stabilities of these highly energetic molecules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These
studies are expected provide a wealth of thermodynamic and kinetic information
that will impact upon applications ranging from proteomics to molecular
synthesis. &lt;br/&gt;
