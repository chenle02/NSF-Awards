Semantic analysis is automated analysis of programs, used to predict their
runtime behavior. Such analysis is complicated by the inherent difficulty of
determining semantic properties of programs. Existing semantic analysis methods,
such as data flow analysis and dependence analysis, deal with this problem by
seeking relatively weak semantic information. While these methods are efficient
and useful, they suffer from two drawbacks. First, many have not been justified
rigorously. The second drawback is the weakness of the semantic information they
provide. To rectify these drawbacks, this project will investigate (1) the
development of new semantic analysis methods based on analyzing path
executability conditions and formal specifications and proofs; (2) the
development of new applications of semantic analysis; and (3) the development of
prototype systems to demonstrate new semantic analysis methods and applications.
