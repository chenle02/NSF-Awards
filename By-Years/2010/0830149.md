ABSTRACT This project addresses fundamental questions on geometric and spatial
aspects of graphs and networks, with applications to road networks, sensor
networks, computer networks, and social networks. In particular, methods will be
developed for constructing effective geometric layouts of networks on surfaces
and in three-dimensional space and for analyzing properties of networks by
exploiting their geometric structure.

The focus of the project is the design and analysis of algorithms for graphs on
surfaces in the following three thrust areas: (1) algorithms for embedding
graphs on surfaces, including methods for greedy embeddings of graphs to
facilitate geometric routing, algorithms for manifold triangulation for a set of
points sampled from an embedded surface, and techniques for drawing trees in the
plane; (2) algorithms for graphs embedded on surfaces, including the study of
connections between partial cubes and integer lattices, the development of
algorithms for graphs embedded in non-Euclidean spaces, and the design of
methods for solving graph problems on quadrilateral meshes; (3) applications of
algorithms for graphs on surfaces, including applications of geometric graphs to
computer security and algorithms for road networks.
