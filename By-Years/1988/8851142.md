With the acquisition of a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer the chemistry
department is strengthening its laboratory courses by providing students with
additional opportunities to use instrumentation. Compound identification
capabilities are being increased, particularly in the Organic Chemistry Analysis
Laboratory. However the students also take a Senior Seminar, which is an
undergraduate laboratory research course, where the instrument is having a
decided impact on the nature of the problems that can be undertaken. The grantee
is matching the award from non-Federal sources.
