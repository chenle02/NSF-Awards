The proposed project carries out a theoretical investigation of a new, highly
efficient and transparent optical networking paradigm, called OMM-Net, which
avoids fast optical switching and buffering in the network core by scheduling
fast tunable lasers, and admission control and buffering at the network edge.
The boundary of the optical network is pushed closer to end users by combining
time and wavelength division multiplexing for mesh networks through effective
scheduling and global synchronization. OMM-Net views the network as a giant and
geographically distributed generalized Birkhoff-von Neumann switch in which the
network edge are its input/output ports and the fabric consists of fibers and
quasi-static wavelength-selective switches. End-to-end switching is emulated by
scheduling ultrafast tunable lasers at the network edge, in effect providing
sub-microsecond switching without requiring fast internal network node switching
and optical buffering.
