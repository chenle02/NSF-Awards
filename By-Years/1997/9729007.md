The research will examine the nature of the human sentence comprehension system
by examining two aspects of syntactic processing which have previously received
little direct attention: whether the comprehension system can maintain multiple
competing phrase structure representations in parallel or is instead limited to
considering only one possibility at a time; and how the comprehension system
handles subject verb agreement, which requires the tracking of syntactic
features across intervening material. Both of these issues have implications for
a variety of theories of sentence processing and ambiguity resolution. Examining
subject verb agreement also provides an opportunity to investigate very general
feature processing mechanisms required for a variety of syntactic and non
syntactic computations in human language comprehension, and permits
consideration of a series of novel predictions made by recent constraint based
lexicalist theories. These issues will be investigated with a variety of
techniques, including on line reading for comprehension, off line sentence and
sentence fragment ratings, sentence completion tasks, and analyses of published
text corpora. The experiments examining the possibility of parallelism will
determine ambiguity resolution preferences for an ambiguity not previously
investigated, and then use the ambiguity to consider the parallelism issue, as
well as how it interacts with working memory available to the comprehender,
which may be a factor in limiting parallelism. The experiments examining subject
verb agreement will investigate the mechanism underlying syntactic feature
tracking and the degree to which that mechanism is independent of non syntactic
(lexical, semantic/conceptual, and discourse) mechanisms. The results of the
experiments should lead to more finely specified linguistic, computational, and
psycholinguistic models of comprehension, and a better understanding of human
sentence comprehension in particular.
