Both particle size and shape have an effect on a great number of chemical
engineering processes such as slurry flow, pneumatic transport, filtration,
sedimentation, crystallization, and dust explosions. In this research effort, a
theory of the technique of morphological and size analysis is being developed.
The analysis includes particulate material growth and diminution processes in
static and dynamic situations, crystallization, dissolution, apparent and tap
density, effective angle of friction, and effective yield locus measurements.
The identification capability of a three-feature (size, shape, and color)
patterns will be tested.
