The goal of this project is to obtain the high resolution X-ray crystal
structure of an intact bacterial group I self-splicing intron. The
crystallographic target is the intron from the purple bacterium Azoarcus. This
intron is located in the anticodon loop of the pre-tRNA Ile. It is the smallest
group I intron identified to date. Yet, it retains the conserved secondary and
tertiary structural elements common to group I ribozymes and is exceptionally
stable. The first goal of the project is to obtain the structure of a complex
that retains all of its components, including the terminal G, the 5' and 3'
exons and the substrate helix. This structural information will be used to
explore how metal ions contribute to RNA catalysis and to investigate the
chemical transition state of the phosphoryl transfer reactions promoted by this
ribozyme. Ribozymes, such as this intron, are the molecules most likely to be
the progenitors of modern biological catalysts. Understanding how they promote
their reactions will provide valuable insight into enzymological function. The
research will provide opportunities for training at the interface of nucleic
acid chemistry and structural biology.
