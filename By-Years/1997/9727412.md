9727412 Becker Oregon Graduate Institute (OGI) will investigate a novel
segmented curriculum approach to graduate education. The approach, to be tested
in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, has the prospects for
reducing duplication, lowering cost, promoting curricular innovation, and
facilitating attendance of part-time working professionals. The basic approach
proposed is to decompose multi-credit (typically three or four credit) courses
into smaller one credit blocks that are uniformly spaced through a semester or
quarter. (OGI is on the quarter system.) In this manner, areas of commonality
can be covered so that they may be taken by a variety of students. This will
lead to larger class sizes for the core components of the classes. The
specialized portions of the classes may still have small enrollments, but these
small enrollments will be easier to justify for one credit classes than for
three credit classes. Segmentation would permit lower course development effort
than otherwise would be required, and would avoid having students studying
subjects that are not germane to their objectives. Segmentation would also
provide additional flexibility to practicing professionals engaged in the
process of lifelong learning. Segmented courses would permit enrollment for
periods in which these people are available.
