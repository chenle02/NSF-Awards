This award will support an international meeting on the evolutionary biology of
elasmobranch fishes. The elasmobranchs, which include the sharks, skates and
stingrays, constitute an important vertebrate group that, having diverged some
350 million years ago from their sister group the holocephalans, have conserved
many of their morphological characteristics with very little change. As such,
the elasmobranchs represent an under exploited model system that may be employed
to investigate many important biological and evolutionary processes. This
international meeting, organized by Prof. William C. Hamlett of the Medical
College of Ohio together with Prof. Bruno Tota of the Naples Zoological Station
in Naples, Italy, will provide an opportunity for scientists working with this
vertebrate group to present recent research findings, exchange information and
plan future directions for research and collaboration. The meeting will focus on
three areas: 1) reproduction, 2) neuroscience, and 3) systems biology/
physiology. Emphasis will be on research utilizing contemporary scientific
techniques as well as studies that place relevant research results in an
evolutionary context.
