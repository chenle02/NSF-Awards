The aim of the project is to develop a multimedia, PC-based, power system
simulator to interface, via real time data acquisition and control, to
programmable logic controllers. A variety of operations, ranging from simple DC
motor control to complex synchronous generator modelling can be simulated. The
goal of the multimedia presentation is to augment Junior- level power systems
labs with simulation-based exercises that "connect" the laboratory to the real
world. The simulation exercises provide videotaped illustrations of an actual
power plant, the operation and description of sensors, and a detailed
description of the control objectives.
