9313897 Conrad The project aims to investigate two key issues of the behavior of
electrorheological (ER) fluids: the effect of particle clustering in columns as
compared to single row chains, and the relationship between the flow stress and
the current density. The experiments on particle column clustering will be
performed with a pendulum balance. An attempt will be made to relate the
observed macroscopic behavior to particle arrangement, as well as to specific
atomic, ionic, and electronic mechanisms. The research will be carried out
within the NCSU University-Industry Consortium on ER Fluids which includes
Texaco R&D, Bridgestone-Firestone Research Laboratory, and Paar Physica, and in
collaboration with Ford Motor Company. Cooperative Research Project (IUCRP), in
response to the announcement on Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with
Industry (GOALI). If successful, the proposed project on ER fluids will have
applications in the development of flexible operated machines in manufacturing,
auto industry, textile, and materials handling. ***
