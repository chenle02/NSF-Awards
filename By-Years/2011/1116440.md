The goal of this research is to develop robust controllers for mobile boom
cranes. Such mobile cranes often operate outdoors. Therefore, it is important
for the controller to be robust not only to outside disturbances caused by the
terrain on which the crane is driving and possibly wind, but also to the various
lighting and background clutter that exists when a crane operates outdoors.
Conducting research at Kumoh National Institute of Technology will provide the
student with a unique opportunity to utilize an existing system to develop and
test a low-cost, robust control system. The specific objectives of this project
are:&lt;br/&gt;? Evaluate the Existing Image-Processing Algorithm.&lt;br/&gt;?
Develop a Robust Image-Processing Algorithm.&lt;br/&gt;? Design an Input Shaper
and a Feedback Controller.&lt;br/&gt;? Experimentally Evaluate a Combined
Feedback and Input-Shaping Controller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conducting research
at Kumoh National Institute of Technology in Gumi, Korea, will provide the
graduate student with valuable experience of international research
collaboration as well as access to facilities not available in the domestic
institution. The advisor has successfully collaborated with foreign colleagues
and will provide appropriate guidance to the student.&lt;br/&gt;
