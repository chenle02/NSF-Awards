This award provides the NSF portion of funding for a new survey of astronomy and
astrophysics which will address the needs of the field for the 1990's. A
committee will be created under the auspices of the National Academy of Sciences
and charged with preparing a priority-setting report. A group of leading
astronomers that was convened to consider the need for and nature of a new
astronomy survey concluded that eight to ten panels would be required to address
scientific areas and to provide a mechanism for broad involvement of the
astronomy community. The issuing of periodic surveys of astronomy and
astrophysics began with the Whitford Committee, which commenced work in 1962 and
issued a report in 1964. The Greenstein report was begun in 1969 and was
completed in 1972; the Field Committee started its work in 1978 and issued a
report in 1982. It is now time to prepare another decade report for the 1990's.
Dr. John Bahcall at Princeton University has been named to lead the effort.
