This project supports a graduate student in cultural anthropology who is
studying the cognitive structure of emotions in a rural area of Indonesia.
Studies have shown that cognition depends on organized structures of
information, called "schemas". Little is known of how children learn such
schemas. This project will explore how schemas develop in the process of
acquisition by children, how children's use of them changes, and how children
acquire them through social interaction. Methods will involve direct observation
and in-depth interviews. This research is important because comparative cases
and analyses of how children learn cognitive elements will give us material
useful in helping us understand how to deal with deficits and abnormalities in
this critical procedure.
