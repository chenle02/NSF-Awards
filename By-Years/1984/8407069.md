One of the goals of current research on machining is to provide adaptive control
of metal removal operations, so that they can be performed unattended by human
operators. This means that the control system must be able to correct for slowly
varying conditions such as tool wear, and for sudden events such as tool
breakage, formation of tangling-type chips, on-set of chatter, and other
phenomena. The general approach is to use the computer to make the in-process
decisions that would normally be made by a human operator. The principal
investigator will study qualitative changes in the (empirical) physical models
used to describe the metal cutting process. The principles of these models will
be embedded in the control computer. Past and present data will be fed into the
computer, which will 'adapt' the system not only by changing the processing
conditions, but also, if required, by changing the process model. Analytical
work will be followed by experimental evaluation.
