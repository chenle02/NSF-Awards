This grant will support archival and library research on a projected biography
of&lt;br/&gt;Johannes Wislicenus (1835-1902), a major chemist of the nineteenth
century whose career has yet to receive extensive study by historians. An
outgrowth of the PIs recently completed book on the early history of
stereochemistry, the goal of this project is to gather additional archival and
published material on Wislicenus's youth as the son of the radical free-thinking
theologian, Gustav Wislicenus (1803-1877), on his experiences as a failed
immigrant to America, on his professional development with Wilhelm Heintz at the
University of Halle, and on his role as director of three major research groups
in&lt;br/&gt;Zurich, Wurzburg, and Leipzig. The proposed biography will discuss
the formation of a scientific personality, religion and science, the atomic
theory in nineteenth-century chemistry, and the structure and purpose of
research groups in science. The completed biography will also frame Wislicenus
as a member of a particular generation of chemists born during the 1830s, and
make comparisons of Wislicenus's personal style of doing and teaching science
with other chemists of his generation. The final biography will therefore be of
interest to historians of science, German historians, and practicing
chemists.&lt;br/&gt;
