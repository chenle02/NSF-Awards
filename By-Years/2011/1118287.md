A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation for the
&lt;br/&gt;R/V Cape Hatteras, a 136-ft long research vessel owned by the
National Science Foundation and operated by the Duke/UNC Oceanographic
Consortium as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System
(UNOLS) research fleet. Two items were submitted for review. In order of
priority they were:&lt;br/&gt;1) Chelsea Fluorometer&lt;br/&gt;2)
ROV&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt; The principal impact of the
present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support for
scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of
their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo
separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition,
maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded
researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated
instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and
expanding the base of potential researchers.
