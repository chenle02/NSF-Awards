Tippur 9622055 The proposed research is aimed at developing a fundamental
knowledge base concerning mechanical integrity, particularly fracture, in a
class of new materials called Functionally Graded Materials (FGM). Failure
characterization and performance evaluation relative to piecewise-homogeneous
compositions and identification of appropriate materials property gradients for
best performance are currently lacking. The proposed research will provide full-
field information about the nature of stresses and deformations near cracks in
FGMs under quasi-static and dynamic loading conditions. A relatively new optical
technique called "Coherent Gradient Sensing" (CGS) will be used for the direct
measurement of crack tip displacement components and of the local mixed-mode
deformations as a function of the applied loading. ***
