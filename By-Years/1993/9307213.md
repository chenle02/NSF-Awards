9307213 Reno Research in the phenomenology of elementary particle physics at
high energy colliders will focus on processes due to the electromagnetic and
weak interactions. Strong interaction corrections to these processes are large.
Using the theory of Quantum Chromodynamics to compute strong force corrections,
detailed comparisons between theory and experiments will be performed.
Theoretical predictions for processes observed in collider experiments are
fundamental to increasing our understanding of the strong, weak and
electromagnetic interactions. ***
