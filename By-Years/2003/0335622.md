An Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) will be established
at the Georgia Institute of Technology, called the I/UCRC for Experimental
Research in Computer Systems (ERCS).

The I/UCRC is committed to fostering interdisciplinary research and establishing
a culture of experimental research reaching out to local and national industry,
to encourage participation and contribute to the regional and national economics
through the availability of intellectual talent and emerging technologies.
Operationally ERCS will create, develop, and evaluate hardware/software systems,
in the context of realistic end user applications, for platforms ranging from
embedded/real-time devices, to parallel/cluster systems, to the Internet and
facilitate the construction and management of such systems by creating new
principles, algorithms and techniques, software tools and mechanisms.
