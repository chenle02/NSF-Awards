Excited states of atoms and molecules may be studied in an environment
relatively free of collisions and other perturbations by the use of fast beam
techniques. The work in this proposal makes use of a very sensitive method of
detecting such states using resonant laser excitation to a very weakly bound
state followed by Stark ionization. Combined with this are very high resolution
techniques of microwave spectroscopy. Experiments are proposed to carefully
study the fine structure of high angular momentum Rydberg states of helium in
order to test predictions of relativistic atomic theory. Similar Rydberg states
of the H2 molecule will also be studied in order to yield precise new
information about the H2+ ion. Another application will be a precise measurement
of n=4 fine structure in atomic hydrogen which may lead to a new determination
of the fine structure constant alpha.
