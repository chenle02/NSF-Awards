The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to develop an
understanding of the market needs for a novel biodegradable tether and inserter
technology. Researchers have developed an inserter device which delivers a
temporary tether into living tissue that can constrain medical devices within
the body, while also permitting those devices to be easily removed if desired.
Numerous surgical and implant applications might benefit from commercialization
of this technology, and the market needs for these applications will be explored
in this project. A potential application of the technology is with postpartum
intrauterine devices (IUD) where this will mitigate medical complications caused
by IUD expulsion events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project focuses on a
novel technology for inserting a biodegradable tether into living tissue and
interfacing with existing medical devices. This technology must permit the
medical devices to be held in place during normal operation, but allow easy
removal when desired. Researchers have fabricated alpha and beta prototypes that
demonstrate reliable insertion of a biodegradable tether into explanted muscle
tissue and shown sufficient anchoring force to constrain a medical device. Using
the same tether, researchers have demonstrated easy removal of a medical device.
