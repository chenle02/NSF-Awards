In this research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, Professor Jacobs will carry out studies of the dynamics of molecular
ion scattering from well characterized surfaces. The goal of this work is to
explore the detailed dynamics of charge transfer, energy transfer, dissociation,
and abstraction reactions of molecular ions at metal and semiconductor surfaces.
State selected molecular ions are made to collide wth a well characterized solid
surface, and product yields and angle-resolved velocity distributions are
measured in a novel experimental apparatus. Detailed information about the
reaction coordinate for the ion surface collision can be extracted from these
measurements. %%% When a molecular ion collides with a surface, a number of
possible processes can occur. A detailed understanding of these processes is
important to an understanding of electronic materials processing, space science,
and thin film synthesis of novel materials. This research project explores the
detailed dynamics of ion surface collisions, using state selected incident ions
and state specific detection of scattered ions. A very complete picture of the
ion collision process emerges from these studies.
