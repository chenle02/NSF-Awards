University&lt;br/&gt;Title: Algebra in Stone-Cech Compactifications and its
Combinatorial Applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law
111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A right topological semigroup is a set S which is a
semigroup and a topological space and has the property that multiplication on
the right by any fixed element of S is continuous. If S is a discrete semigroup,
then its Stone-Cech compactification is, in a natural way, a compact Hausdorff
right topological semigroup. As is true of any compact Hausdorff right
topological semigroup, this Stone-Cech compactification has a smallest two sided
ideal, and this ideal usually has elaborate algebraic structure. This project
involves the study of the algebraic structure of the Stone-Cech compactification
and its smallest ideal and investigation of the combinatorial applications of
that structure, primarily to Ramsey Theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ramsey Theory
is that part of combinatorics that deals with the question of what sort of
homogeneous structures one can expect to find in some one cell of a finite
partition (or "coloring") of specified sets. For example, the simplest
nontrivial instance of the infinite version of Ramsey's Theorem says that
whenever the two element subsets of the set N of positive integers are finitely
colored, there must be some infinite subset of N all of whose two element
subsets are the same color. The principal investigator gained some fame many
years ago when he proved that whenever N is finitely colored, there must exist
in one color an infinite sequence together with all of its finite sums of
distinct terms without repetition. The original proof was elementary, but very
complicated. But in 1975, Fred Galvin and Steven Glazer showed that this "Finite
Sums Theorem" is a completely trivial consequence of the fact that the Stone-
Cech compactification of N can be given an algebraic structure extending
ordinary addition which is a compact right topological semigroup, and therefore
has idempotents, that is elements such that p + p = p. Since then, numerous
other applications of the algebraic structure of Stone-Cech compactifications to
Ramsey Theory have been found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
