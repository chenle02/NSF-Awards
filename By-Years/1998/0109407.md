This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate
a proprietary method of measuring atmospheric temperature starting at 10 meters
above the surface. Our concept, if successful, will overcome the current Radio
Acoustic Sounding System (RASS) low altitude and temperature resolution limits.
The temperature measurement accuracy will be increased by at least a factor of
two. This system will support research by providing a continuous low altitude
temperature profile for a better understanding of the atmosphere and improved
weather prediction. Localized weather forecasts are particularly important for
airports predicting fog, air quality control, controlled burns of grasslands and
forests, and uncontrolled forest fires. The ability to predict the behavior of
the smoke emanating from these fires is important since it is a threat to many
segments of the population.

Results from this research could provide accurate low altitude temperature
profiles to businesses that need local weather data (airports, fire departments,
television and radio stations, air quality control, and disaster management of
nuclear or chemical mishaps, etc.).
