With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
(CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Georgia will
acquire a 300 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to
carry out studies on a) probing cellular function with small molecules and light
(Dore); b) assessment of binding affinity and selectivity of anion receptors;
characterization of new organic materials; structure-relaxivity studies of
porphyrin dendrimers (Johnson); c) total synthesis of biologically active
natural products (Majetich); d) enzyme reaction mechanisms and kinetics
(Phillips); e) synthesis and structural organometallic chemistry (Robinson); and
f) alkane activation and metal-free supramolecular catalysis.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most
powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific
arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR
spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in a number of areas
including biochemistry and the development of new catalysts and novel materials.
