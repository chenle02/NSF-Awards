This is interdisciplinary research on understanding microstructural development
that occurs in mushy zones (solid- liquid interface region). Energy and mass
balance relations are employed to analyze the solidification of the two-phase
region. The objective is improvement of the predictive capability for structure
formation in real castings. It is expected that the research will have a strong
impact on solidification technology, including ingot casting, continuous
casting, and welding.
