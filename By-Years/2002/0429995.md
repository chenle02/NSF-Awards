An I/O Buffer Cache Architecture for Remote Direct Memory
Access&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will investigate a
low-cost buffer cache solution for improving performance of iSCSI end systems
over Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA). The use of RDMA protocols in modern
storage networking architectures can reduce CPU overhead and performance loss
due to the multiple memory-copy problem for end systems. An iSCSI-based IP
storage architecture over RDMA can provide cost-effectiveness and high-
performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are significant challenges in smoothing
out the disparities between iSCSI protocol and RDMA model, and reducing
performance loss due to inefficient memory utilization. This research addresses
these problems by conducting the following activities: 1) developing a unified
buffer cache hardware/software architecture for iSCSI applications over RDMA
protocol suite on both client and server sides by reducing the number of data
packet translations across iSCSI and RDMA boundaries; and 2) developing
propagate update protocols to resolve cache RDMA read and write failure
problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
