This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of biosensors. During the tenure of this three-year continuing
grant, Professor Rechnitz and his students will continue the development of
tissue based biosensors using plant and animal tissue materials as molecular
recognition elements in conjunction with a variety of transducers. This
research, which was begun under NSF grant CHE-8921156, will focus on two novel
initiatives. In the first, genetically modified plant tissue materials will be
used in order to achieve improved sensor stability and to extend the range of
possible analytes. In the second, biomagnetic current probes will be introduced
as transducers in the design of neuronal biosensors. It is expected that such
probes could function as non-invasive transducers and thereby improve the useful
lifetimes of chemoreceptor based biosensors. %%% This research is aimed at
overcoming some of the major technical problems encountered in biosensor
research and, more importantly, to introduce and provide conceptual advances for
the future development of analytical biosensors.
