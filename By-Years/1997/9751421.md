Macintosh computers with Maple software are being used in a laboratory component
of calculus III and differential equations. The implementation of this plan is
affecting students in the mathematics and pre-engineering programs. The
introduction of computer technology as a laboratory tool in calculus III and
differential equations is enhancing the teaching of these courses in many ways.
The opportunity for the student to create many examples allows the student to
make and test more conjectures than would be possible without technology. The
computers allow for the introduction of more sophisticated examples from real
data. This technology enables the student to see mathematics as an active tool
for solving realistic problems, as opposed to viewing it as an abstract,
isolated discipline. The impact of the project is reaching beyond the scope of
these two courses. The pedagogy developed during this program is intended to
enable the mathematics department to create laboratory components in future
courses in the mathematics program. *
