Professor Geraldine L. Richmond and other members of the Chemistry Department of
the University of Oregon are being supported to conduct a Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period of 1990-92, ten (10)
undergraduate students will spend ten (10) weeks each summer actively engaged in
a variety of research projects in the Chemical Physics Institute. Projects range
from mass spectroscopy of hypervalent ions and radicals and Raman spectroscopy
of clathrate hydrates to theoretical calculations of correlation effects in
atoms and molecules. Students will also participate in research seminars, weekly
meetings and a summer research retreat.
