This project is to conduct nondestructive testing of I-40 bridges spanning the
Rio Grande rift in Albuquerque. The bridge, a 1,275 foot long structure
consisting of three 3-span continuous units-each a two-girder steel welded with
bolted splices and floor system, is scheduled razing in mid 1993. The bridge
will be instrumented and tested by conventional as well as new, advanced
methods, such as resonance ultrasound spectrascopy (RUS) and electronic speckle
pattern interferometry (ESPI) to determine the impact of defects on the load
distribution, load capacity, and the potential for collapse under dynamic
earthquake loads. The project presents a unique opportunity to test the
effectiveness of various nondestructive testing methods (NDT), to obtain
valuable field data for evaluation of field cracking and other structural damage
first hand. Through NSF support, and based on the national interest in civil
infrastructural system problem as a whole, the New Mexico State Highway and
Transportation Department also commits substantial amount of support to this
project. This is a project supported under the Small Grants Exploratory Research
(SGER) Program.
