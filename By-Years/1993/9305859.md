This award provides partial support for operating the Purdue Rare Isotope
Measurement Laboratory (PRIME Lab), an accelerator mass spectrometry facility
making use of an FN (8 megavolt) tandem accelerator to measure extremely small
concentrations of rare cosmogenic radioactive nuclides of beryllium-10,
carbon-14, aluminum-26, silicon-32, chlorine-36, calcium-41, and iodine-129. The
accelerator mass spectrometry technique is uniquely capable of analyzing these
isotopes, and PRIME Lab is operated as a national resource for such analyses on
behalf of the U.S. geochemical research community. Accurate measurements of
these nuclides in natural samples enable determination of ages and can also be
used as tracers to reconstruct the migration of volumes of the solid earth,
oceans, ground and surface waters, and the atmosphere. In- house and outside
user projects needing such analyses include researchers in solid earth sciences,
planetary sciences, atmospheric sciences, ecology, archeology, and a wide range
of applications directed at global change research.
