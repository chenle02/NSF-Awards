The site of Casas Grandes, located in the Mexican state of Chihuahua, lies
immediately adjacent to well known archaeological sites in Arizona and New
Mexico. While prior work at Casas Grandes has indicated that this large complex
of structures was occupied between ca. 1,000 and 1,200 A.D., it remains
relatively unknown in contrast to its northern counterparts. In particular,
archaeologists understand neither how it relates to numerous other ruins in
northern Chihuahua nor how this entire complex interacted with Chacoan culture
in Arizona and New Mexico. Dr. Minnis and his collaborators will attempt to
answer these questions through a survey of the area which surrounds the Casas
Grandes site. They will conduct a reconnaissance to locate sites, determine the
size of each, and collect ceramics from the ground surface. These data will
allow the relationships with the Casas Grandes center to be determined and may
also permit the establishment of a relative chronology. On this basis it should
then be possible to plan a more detailed survey and excavation. In the U.S.
southwest before the arrival of the Spaniards, large impressive ruins testify to
the rise of an indigenous complex society which integrated large numbers of
individuals over thousands of square miles. What archaeologists have been unable
to determine is whether this is, in fact, a local development or whether it
developed though contact with similar entities to the South. If this latter is
the case, then Casas Grandes must have played a major role. Unfortunately, very
little data is available for this site or the surrounding region and Dr. Minnis'
research will help to fill this gap. This research is important for several
reasons. Understanding of southwestern prehistory has been hindered by the fact
that the Rio Grande, and international boundary, transects this region. In
comparison to the north, very little is known about developments in Mexico and
this has hindered our understanding of cultural development. This research
should help to redress this imbalance. It will also shed new light on the
development of indigenous cultures in the United States.
