The purpose of this project is to synthesize the research regarding the learning
and teaching of evolution, laying the empirical foundation for the development
of curricular resources. A truly effective curriculum, whether delivered in
formal or informal settings, should include not only appropriate content, but
should also be presented in a way that is developmentally appropriate,
capitalizes on effective teaching and learning strategies, takes into account
learners' prior knowledge and sociocultural background, and addresses the
emotional and motivational issues that may arise. The proposed synthesis project
consists of three stages. First, small groups of experts from cognitive and
developmental science, evolutionary biology, formal and informal science
education, and the philosophy of science will be brought together in a series of
regional meetings. Second, the output of these meetings, a series of publicly
released meeting summaries on the current state of research and practice, will
guide the design of a three-day workshop to be attended by the entire group, at
which the full framework will be assessed. Finally, subgroups will then be
charged with producing synthesis products for researchers and practitioners.
