Description: This project supports a collaborative research by Dr. R. D. Verma,
Chemistry Department, Panjab University, Chandigarh, India and Dr. J. M.
Shreeve, Professor of Chemistry at the University of Idaho, Moscow. The work
will focus on fluorine chemistry including development of new fluorine compounds
by introducing fluorine atoms to specific known chemicals and characterizing the
resulting new materials. The characterization will be via infrared, mass, and
NMR spectral techniques. The possibilities for major contributions in
agricultural, health and industrial environments are large. This research will
require updating facilities at Chandigarh to handle the difficult compounds
involved, including special glass and metal vacuum lines, and appropriate
reaction vessels. In addition to work in Chandigarh and Moscow, crystal
structure studies will be carried with Professor Roger Willett at Washington
State University in Pullman. Also gas diffraction studies on any small volatile
molecules of interest will be carried out at The University of Tubingen under
Professor Heinz Oberhammer Scope: This project brings together a very active and
productive Indian chemist with a senior Anerican scientist, who is an expert in
the field, to build up good research capability for fluorine research in India.
Simultaneously the field will benefit through the production of new compounds
and their characterization. This research could benefit the U.S. and India
scientifically as well as by applicability of some of the results to commercial
use in agriculture, health or industry.
