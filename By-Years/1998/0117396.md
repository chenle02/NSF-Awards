0117396&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Holman/OSU&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
develop and test techniques for extracting quantitative data on cross-shore and
along-shore currents in the near-shore zone from video images. One of the
motivations is to obtain better data on shear waves in the near-shore zone.
Results of the video analysis algorithms will be compared with in situ data from
the same site. Both video and in situ data were collected during an earlier
experiment at Duck, N. Carolina. Measurements of currents derived from the video
data at ten different sites will be incorporated into a numerical model of
finite-amplitude shear waves in a study of the effects of bottom dissipation and
horizontal mixing on these waves. &lt;br/&gt;
