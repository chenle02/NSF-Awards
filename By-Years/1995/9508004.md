9508004 Daines This pilot study involves an experimental project on melt
migration in peridotites. It investigates the role of melt-rock reaction if the
focusing of melt flow during melt migration in the upper mantle. The research
involves a series of experiments in which basaltic melts undersaturated in
pyroxene infiltrate synthetic peridotites composed of different proportions of
olivine and pyroxene. The experiments will be analyzed through detailed
characterization of microstructures, reaction fronts, and phase compositions,
and by one-dimensional numerical simulations.
