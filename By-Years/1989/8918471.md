The Principal Investigators (PIs) propose to continue with their current NSF
funded study of white dwarf stars and the post-hydrogen burning evolution
preceding the white dwarf stage. White dwarfs are highly evolved and very dense
stars, with masses similar to that of the sun but with radii more like that of
the earth. The specific goals of the proposed study are to better understand 1.
the structure and chemical abundances of white dwarfs; 2. changes of their
abundances with evolution; 3. mass loss and gain, especially for white dwarfs in
binary systems (cataclysmic variables); 4. number density of white dwarfs in and
mass contribution to the Galactic disk; and 5. origin of these stars as low-mass
main sequence stars. Topics such as classical and dwarf novae, accretion disks
of white dwarfs, the "hibernation" scenario of the nova outburst, pre-
cataclysmic evolution, binary white dwarfs, and a search for halo white dwarfs
are part of this investigation. The research will be done through photometry and
spectroscopy, with telescopes in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.
