This project will design an electromagnetic wave life-detection system for post
earthquake rescue operations. This system will detect the heart beat, breathing
or other movements of human victims trapped in collapsed masonry or reinforced
concrete structures. The system will consist of a central unit of microwave
components, a microprocessor- controlled clutter-cancellation unit and a
specially designed antenna system. Preliminary experimental results indicate a
high probability of success for constructing such a system. Realistic
performance criteria for field application of the system will be developed by
researchers at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. After the
functioning system is constructed, it will be field tested in realistic
earthquake environments constructed for urban search and rescue training and
testing.
