This project will support the completion of the photoemission spectromicroscope
MAXIMUM (Multiple-Application X-Ray Imaging Undulator Microscope) at the
Wisconsin Synchrotron Radiation Center (SRC). Phase I of the project, produced a
working prototype of MAXIMUM and micrographs produced by a scanning
photoelectron microscope with a resolution of one micron over a 1 millimeter2
area. The prototype serves two fundamental purposes: it demonstrates the
feasibility of technical solutions (in particular, the use of multilayer-coated
near-normal-incidence reflection devices - the Schwarzchild objectives - for
x-ray focussing); it now allows experience with a working microscope. Phase II
will transform this prototype into an even more advanced instrument, and into a
complete research facility for materials and biological sciences. The experience
gained during Phase I gives a unique advantage in completing this project. At
the end of Phase II. MAXIMUM will be made available to the general users
community through peer-review selection of research proposals based on merit.
