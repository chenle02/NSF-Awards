Rational choice models of elections predict that candidates adopt similar,
centrist platforms in order to win elections. While this theoretical finding is
very robust, it has received very little empirtical support. This is
particularly true for research on congressional elections. This project is
developing a theory to explain candidates' position taking during congressional
election campaigns. The theory predicts that candidates will diverge
significantly on election day due to the polarizing effects of primary elections
and limits on changes in policy positions -- both of which have been ignored by
earlier spatial models. To evaluate this model, candidates' locations are
operationalized using NOMINATE, a well-known statistical procedure based on
spatial theory. This measure is validated with Political Action Committee (PAC)
contribution data by examining which types of PACs donate to candidates. Both
types of data have temporal components that produce estimates for candidates
over time. The new measures improve previous ones as they can be estimates for
both incumbents and challengers. Finally, these measures test predictions
derived from the theoretical model.
