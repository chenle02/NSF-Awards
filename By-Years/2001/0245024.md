Gravitational waves are ripples in the very fabric of spacetime. The emission of
gravitational waves from black holes will be investigated. Black holes are,
perhaps, the most unusual objects in the known astrophysical universe. A close
binary system of black holes (or neutron stars) emits gravitational waves and
loses energy while the holes orbit each other and slowly spiral inwards. The
seemingly random trajectory of a star in an highly eccentric orbit about a
supermassive black hole can actually be followed for thousands of orbits by use
of careful theoretical analysis. The details of the emitted gravitational waves
in such systems will be determined theoretically, based upon our best
understanding of gravity and astrophysics.

Detailed knowledge of the features of the gravitational waves emitted during
many orbits of a black hole binary system greatly aids the ongoing experimental
effort to observe gravitational waves. Equally importantly, this knowledge also
allows interpretation of the observations, once they are made, and provides a
probe into the strongest gravitational fields imaginable with unprecedented
information about dramatic astrophysical systems, and the theory of gravity.
Further, the detection of gravitational waves from black hole binary systems
will open a new window on the universe, stir up interest for students in all
areas of science and mathematics and capture the imagination of every citizen.
