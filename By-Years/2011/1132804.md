Abstract Proposal: OISE-1132804 PI/Institution: Coppersmith, Susan N.,
University of Wisconsin-Madison

Drs. Susan Coppersmith and Mark Friesen from the University of Wisconsin-Madison
in conjunction with Dr. Xuedong Hu from the University of Buffalo propose to
establish a collaborative international network with Prof. Belita Koiller from
the University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil to perform investigations of
materials suitable for qubits and related applications. A key focus of the
proposed work is the research on the effects of silicon's conduction band
valleys on spintronic and quantum devices. Recent experiments have shown a
greatly enhanced valley splitting at a silicon/silicon-dioxide interface.
Several of the investigators in this proposal have shown that surface states can
lead to such an enhancement. Thus one goal of the proposed collaborative network
is to see if such a mechanism applies more generally which will enable enhanced
control of the valley splitting, and in turn could enable quantum devices that
can operate at higher temperatures. The experimental effort at Wisconsin will be
enhanced by the theoretical work being advanced at Buffalo. The US team will
also greatly benefit from the theoretical accomplishments of the Brazilian
researchers who under Dr. Koiller have significant expertise in studying quantum
physics in solid state materials.

Another benefit from the proposed the international network of investigators is
the involvement of US students and post-docs to collaborate and be mentored by
Brazilian colleagues with related but distinct expertise on the science of
solid-state spintronics and quantum information processing.
