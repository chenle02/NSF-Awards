This project will develop parallel algorithms for the description of problems
in wave propagation. A series of models based on the two-dimensional wave
equation will be considered. These are: i) the simplest representation of wave
motion, as described by the acoustic wave equation ii) wave propagation
described by the homogeneous formulation of the spatial displacements, and iii)
the corresponding heterogeneous formulation for spatial displacement.
Geometrically complex subsurface models can be investigated by the latter
formulation. In each case parallel algorithms based on finite difference
approximations will be implemented. The artificial boundaries to the physical
domain can be replaced by a damping boundary layer or numerically absorbing
boundaries. The accuracy and efficiency of the algorithms will be compared with
their serial counterparts. Additionally, the pseudospectral method, which may be
supposed to have greater accuracy, will be implemented for each of these models.
Its accuracy and efficiency will be compared with the finite difference
solutions.
