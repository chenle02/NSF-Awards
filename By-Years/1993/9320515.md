9320515 Lawler Research on Atomic Transitions Probabilities for selected rare
earth elements including thulium (Tm), dysprosium (Dy), and holmium (Ho)is
proposed. These elements are candidates for introduction into a new generation
of High Intensity Discharge (HID) lamps being developed in U.S. industrial
laboratories. Advanced HID lamps have promise for improving lighting efficiency
(luminous efficacy) and lighting quality (color rendering index). Lighting
consumes 20 to 25% of the U.S. electrical energy output. The fundamental
spectroscopic data to be measured under this proposed grant are urgently needed
for modeling and diagnosing these new lamp designs. The Wisconsin Atomic
Transition Probability Program will be extended to these rare earths. This
program has, since its inception in 1980, continually developed and applied
advanced laser and Fourier transform techniques to measure atomic transition
probabilities on neutral and singly ionized elements. Efficient new techniques
will be developed to deal with the very rich and complex rare earth spectra,
while maintaining the precision and absolute accuracy achieved in earlier work
on lighter elements. Close contact with industrial scientist will be throughout
this project. ***
