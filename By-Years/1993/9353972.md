9353972 Middlebrooks Five one week long Molecular and Cellular Biosciences
workshops will be conducted under the supervision of the project's Coordinating
Committee by chairs or co-chairs who are recognized as experts within the
topical area of the workshop. Each of these workshops will feature lectures
pertinent to the topic by nationally recognized scientists (these lectures will
be open to general audiences). Other workshop activities will include
demonstrations, topical discussions, as well as participation in hands-on
laboratory experiments. Participants (20 for each workshop, selected by the
Coordinating Committee) will be eligible to compete for "minigrants" of up to
$1,000 to develop lecture or laboratory material or methods for incorporation of
information presented into their curricula. Workshop co-chairs will be available
for follow-up visits to institutions in the coalition. At the conclusion of the
project, a two-day Reunion Workshop will be held, at which participants from all
workshops will be invited to make presentations or participate in discussions
describing the various ways in which information and skills learned via the
workshops have been incorporated into their curricula. ***
