The Trinity College Psychology Department is strengthening its curriculum by
equipping a new laboratory for the study of psychobiology. The biological basis
of behavior is evidenced by studying the brain mechanisms that mediate or
produce such behaviors. The psychobiologist has a rich assortment of methods to
study mechanisms that mediate behaviors important to the survival and well-being
of the organism. The student in this laboratory has the opportunity to study the
feeding, drinking, activity, memory and learning patterns of a laboratory
rodent, and to discover the brain areas or systems which may direct or mediate
such behaviors. The animal's sensorimotor reflexes, activity levels and
ingestive responses are examined pre- and post-pharmacological or surgical
intervention. Thus students are introduced to the science of objective
observation of the laboratory animal's various classes of behavior. Histological
examination of the brain tissue should provide significant information of the
bi-directionality of brain and behavior relationships. Such knowledge and
training provide the college student with an understanding of experimental
methodology in a critical area of science, and an objective view of the
important marriage of psychological and biological theories.
