In this Presidential Young Investigator grant, I expect to proceed initially
with three main projects. First, I will build a broad.band submillimeter SIS
heterodyne mixer with 500 GHz operation in mind. This will be used for
radioastronomy with collaborators at Bell Labs, and possibly at the Caltech
Submillimeter Observatory. I am mainly interested in improving the technology of
this receiver, and I find keeping an astronomically performing receiver to be
the best tool to verify we are addressing the most pertinent technology issues.
My second effort will be to begin work on Josephson oscillators for
submillimeter wave radiation sources. The approach I will take is to couple many
junctions together in a resonant cavity in order to achieve reasonable power
levels and linewidths. My third effort is an on.going experiment with Mark F.
Bocko as the principal investigator. We will use an SIS detector to investigate
techniques for exceeding photon.shot.noise limitations to sensitivity in
measuring a 70 GHz electric field. My contribution to this is primarily
theoretical, and secondarily toward the design of the experiments.
