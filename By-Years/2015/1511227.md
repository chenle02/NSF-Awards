U&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Affinity chromatography exploits the highly specific
interaction between molecules or ligands immobilized on a surface and the target
species of interest. In the proposed work affinity adsorbents will be generated
with the proposed molecules or ligands for both small and large scale
separations using the same synthesis scheme. These affinity adsorbents are
expected to be robust and amenable to multiple re-uses after sterilization. Yet,
it is expected that production of adsorbents for single-use applications with
high value biologicals will still be cost-effective. Collaboration with a North
Carolina State-based company will be undertaken to explore the development of
commercial membrane-based separation systems for complex biologicals.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To identify temperature-sensitive affinity ligands, a
peptide-based scaffold that changes conformation in response to changes in
temperature will be evaluated. Affinity ligands for two model targets will be
generated: CD117, which is expressed on hematopoietic stem cells, and TOM22, a
mitochondrial protein. Subsequently, the effectiveness of these ligands will be
evaluated in the context of cell and mitochondrial separation. Accordingly,
combinatorial libraries of peptides will be screened to identify peptides
binders for the model targets. Thermo-responsive ligands will also be
constructed using the peptides generated. Subsequently, the effect of
temperature on the binding affinity of these ligands will be evaluated. Finally,
the use of magnetic beads functionalized with the selected ligands will be
evaluated in the context of separation of CD117+ cells and mitochondria.
