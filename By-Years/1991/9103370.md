A group of about 20 organic chemists will be selected to receive travel
assistance to attend the Sixth IUPAC Symposium on Organometallic Chemistry
directed towards Organic Synthesis in Utrecht, the Netherlands which will be
held August 25-29, 1991. The U. S. chemists will present technical talks and
have the opportunity to interact with specialists from all over the world. The
possibility of travel support will be advertised and the applications will be
reviewed by a panel of scientists. Professional and geographic factors will be
considered in the final selection of participants. This travel grant is being
funded by the Organic Synthesis Program.
