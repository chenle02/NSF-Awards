9700844 Lau This project addresses basic materials research issues in the
combination of materials associated with metal contacts to gallium nitride. The
proposed research emphasizes fundamental mechanisms and processes along with
some of the practical aspects of nitride contact technology. The approach
involves a systematic study of barrier heights of various Schottky diodes, and
solid state reactions to produce intermediate materials such as platinum
silicide which lead to thermally stable Schottky barriers, and low resistance
contacts between metals and nitrides. The project emphasizes strong interlinking
between materials growth, characterization, physical property measurements, and
related device research efforts. %%% The project addresses forefront research
issues in a topical area of materials science having high technological
relevance, compact and efficient light sources in the blue-green spectral
region. The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a
fundamental level to important aspects of electronic/photonic devices and
integrated circuitry, in general. Additionally, the fundamental knowledge and
understanding gained from the research is expected to contribute to improving
the performance of advanced devices and circuits by providing a fundamental
understanding and a basis for designing and producing improved materials, and
materials combinations. An important feature of the program is the integration
of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally
and technologically significant area. ***
