Hyperspectral data consist of intensity readings of hundreds of bands from
ground or airborne spectrometers. The proposed research is to identify forest
species by means of (1) hyperspectral data measured directly from above forest
canopies in the field, and (2) hyperspectral data from airborne instruments
based on the understanding from part (1). This research is motivated by the
belief that the rich amount of spectral information contained in hyperspectral
data should improve the level of discrimination of forest species and by the
desire for a relatively simple method that can handle the large number of
spectral bands in hyperspectral data while tolerant of spectral noise. Data
reduction will be carried out via nonparametric techniques such as spline
fitting and penalized discriminant analysis (PDA) for interpretation and
classification purposes. Model selection criteria derived from the Minimum
Description Length (MDL) principle will be investigated as both general model
selection tools and criteria for spline knots selection and band selection for
data reduction based on curve data. Spatial PDA will be developed to classify
hyperspectral images from airborne spectrometers to take into account the
spatial dependence of pixels in the image. Correct recognition of forest species
is important in natural resource management, environmental protection,
biodiversity and wildlife studies. Conventionally reliable methods for tree
species recognition depend mainly on inventory in the field or on interpretation
of large-scale aerial photographs. The use of these methods is frequently
limited by cost and time and not applicable to large areas. Digital remote
sensing has been used to identify forest species of large areas, but two
problems are encountered: different tree species often have similar spectral
characteristics partly due to the lack of high spectral resolution and lack of
large number of spectral bands; and the same tree species may have distinct
spectral properties due to illumination conditions on which optical remote
sensing is based.
