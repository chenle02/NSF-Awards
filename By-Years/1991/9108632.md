This award will support a long-term research visit by Professor Anca Ralescu,
Department of Computer Science, University of Cincinnati to the laboratory of
Professor Michio Sugeno, Department of Systems Science of the Tokyo Institute of
Technology, Nagatsuta, Japan. They will jointly carry out research on three
important issues in the field of fuzzy logic: (1) fuzzy logic based concept
learning from examples and counter examples (2) fuzzy syllogistic reasoning and
its relation to other forms of inference under uncertain, incomplete, or not
totally reliable data (3) integrating quantitative semantics for knowledge
representation as proposed by fuzzy logic and symbolic knowledge representation
paradigm with enhanced expressive power. The project represents an excellent
collaboration between the Japanese and U.S. scientists. Professor Ralescu has
expertise in the management of uncertainty in expert systems. Professor Sugeno
is a well-known and established academic who was a pioneer in the area of
"fuzzy" methods. Currently Japan is at the forefront in fuzzy theory research
and implementation. At the same time research in the United States involving
fuzzy logic is minimal. Results of the research could contribute to the spread
of fuzzy logic based devices into the engineering environment by making it
possible to build fuzzy logic devices with limited intel- ligence. It may also
lead to a large number of commercial uses for fuzzy logic in the United States.
