9724281 Akansu, Ali New Jersey Institute of Technology Laboratory for Multimedia
Signal Processing and Communication New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) is
acquiring a high speed computing, data storage and retrieval facilities for
processing, compressing and displaying real-time image and video sequences. This
equipment will support research projects in image/video processing and
compression, and transmission over wired and wireless networks. Additional image
and video communication equipment will be acquired to support research projects
on channel characterization, performance analysis and simulation for image and
video communication. NJIT, Princeton University and Rutgers University are
founding partners of a recently established New Jersey Center for Multimedia
Research (NJCMR). NJCMR has been designated as a Research Excellence Center by
the New Jersey State Commission of Science and Technology with a funding level
of over $1 million per year for the coming 5 years. The MRI-funded equipment
will form part of a new laboratory for Multimedia Signal Processing and
Communication to support research projects within this Research Excellence
Center. NJIT has a leading position in the State as a distance learning provider
and the requested equipment will also be used to support multimedia technologies
research and their application for educational and learning environments, as
well as in advanced-level graduate course work on multimedia signal-processing,
compression and communication.
