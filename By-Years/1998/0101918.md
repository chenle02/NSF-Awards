The Escherichia coli gcvTHP operon, coding the glycine cleavage enzyme system,
provides one-carbon units for essential cellular methylation reactions. This
operon is controlled by gcv -specific (GcvA and GcvR)and global-acting (Lrp, CRP
and PurR)transcriptional regulatory proteins that are integrated into a
regulatory network that allows the cell to respond to multiple environmental
signals to either activate or repress transcription. The gcvB gene, encoding two
small non-translated regulatory RNAs, is controlled solely by the GcvA and GcvR
proteins. GcvA activates both operons in the presence of glycine, and represses
the operons when glycine is limiting. Repression by GcvA requires the negative-
acting GcvR protein. It is hypothesized that GcvR interacts directly with GcvA
and not with DNA to repress the operons. Generally, repressors must bind to DNA
to be functional. It is also hypothesized that a specific surface on GcvA
interacts with different subunits of RNA polymerase to activate the gcvTHP
operon and the gcvB gene. A combination of genetics, physiology and biochemistry
will be used to address two major and interrelated questions to understand this
regulatory network. First, what is the molecular mechanism used by the gcv
-specific regulatory proteins GcvA and GcvR to control expression of the gcvTHP
and gcvB operons? Second, how does a surface on the GcvA protein interact with
different regions of RNA polymerase to activate transcription at the gcvTHP
promoter versus the gcvB promoter? Since there are many functional and
structural similarities between the transcriptional apparatus from both
prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, understanding the mechanisms of bacterial
transcription initiation will contribute to our general understanding of gene
expression and its regulation.
