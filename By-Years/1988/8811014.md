The project implements an international industry/university/government
cooperative research (II/U/GCR) program between the United States and Sweden.
The program will couple the Center for Ceramic REsearch at Rutgers University
with the Swedish Silicate Research Institute, Stockholm University, and the
Royal Institute of Technology. The design of the program and selection of the
four ceramic research projects in the U.S. and the four ceramic research
projects in Sweden provides for parity in scientific and technical merit and
monetary level of effort. The II/U/GCR program will test and verify the proposed
international inter-institutional infrastructure and protocols and/or
modification of them as required. The program will also provide operational
evidence that NSF seed money can be used to initiate long term support from
industry for international industry/university cooperative research.
