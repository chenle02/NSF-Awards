This study focusses on the distribution and motion of galaxies. The Principal
Investigator, co-discoverer of the Tully-Fisher relation between neutral
Hydrogen profile linewidth and optical brightness of spiral galaxies, believes
that this tool can be refined to determine distances to an accuracy of twenty
percent. He will use this improved technique to determine the Hubble flow, both
in the local supercluster, and in more distant regions.
