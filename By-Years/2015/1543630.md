&lt;br/&gt;Over the past five years, the ACI CAREER program has supported early
career faculty involved in research related to cyberinfrastructure and
computational and data-enabled science and engineering. Building on past
successes, the 2015 CyberBridges workshop will again bring together ACI CAREER
awardees with nationally recognized leaders in core areas of cyberinfrastructure
to foster the continued development of CAREER awardees and the research
community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the workshop are
to encourage the development of collaborations and networking between CAREER
awardees and senior keynote researchers, to foster the development of the
cyberinfrastructure research community, to share challenges, needs, and
practices in curricula development and education, and to provide feedback to the
NSF on the challenges and opportunities faced by the community of
computationally focused CAREER faculty.
