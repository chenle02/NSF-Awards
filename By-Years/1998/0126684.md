Engineering - Other (59)

The project is adapting course and curriculum modification from several
engineering schools at Lake Superior State University. It involves the
development of a new integrated Energy Conversion Laboratory that will support
instruction in electro-mechanical conversion systems, fluid mechanics, heat
transfer, and modern industrial control. The laboratory is supporting seven
courses in the EE and ME programs. Undergraduate students and senior design
teams are working to integrate and implement the new laboratory. Project
evaluation involves an assessment model that includes measurable educational
objectives and department level review of each course. The investigators plan to
disseminate results of the evaluation process along with detailed descriptions
of the new trainers/interfaces and the data acquisition equipment by postings on
the University's web site and presentations at engineering education
conferences.
