This award will enable development and deployment of a production environment
for an electronic journal. The network- based application, which will be
particularly suited for remote collaborative research and writing activities,
will use sophisticated on-line editing capabilities. These will include detailed
version-control and provision for the collection and display of comments (during
both the preparation phase and post- publication). The 1990s will be the decade
of appearance of the electronic journal. Carefully structured development
efforts are essential to doing this successfully. The right people and the right
tools are available to provide confidence that this effort will produce a
valuable demonstration of the appropriate technology for these developments.
