9316337 Wyss This project involves the production of modern, portable software
tools that will enhance researchers' capabilities throughout the seismological
community by efficiently and effectively creating, managing and using
seismological databases. This work is in collaboration with U.S. Geological
Survey scientists and other Alaska institutes. It will build on prior efforts to
develop the Seismic Unified Data System (SUDS). One of the first implementations
of the product will be to implement a relational database from the approximately
4,000 earthquakes and one terabyte of continuous data annually recorded by the
Alaska Seismograph Network at the Geophysical Institute, University of Alaska,
Fairbanks to aid in research, understanding and mitigation of seismic and
volcanic hazards. This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard
Reduction Program. ***
