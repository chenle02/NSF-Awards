PANEL SUMMARY CTS-9411588 University of South Carolina at Columbia P. I.:
Michael A. Mathews The goals for each project were unclear. The proposal was
oriented too much towards words the equipment and not enough towards the
breakthroughs which may result from the projects themselves. The Instrument is
innovative and relatively uncommon. The PI has good experience with this type of
equipment. The educational component was exceptional, probably the best of all
the proposals in the competition. There is a lot of promise here and this could
be funded in the future if the projects could be explained in more detail.
Explain breakthroughs that could result.
