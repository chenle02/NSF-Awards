9522297 El-Haggan The Baltimore City Community College requests support from NSF
for connection of two college campus networks to SURAnet. SURAnet, a midlevel
network will provide operations management and information services and it will
give the two campuses access to the Internet, a collection of interoperable
networks that connect most research and education organizations in the United
States. The campuses need the Internet connections to be able to access
information resources throughout the state, the nation and the world. The
connection will benefit the faculty, staff students of the Baltimore City
Community College campuses as well as the community in general.
