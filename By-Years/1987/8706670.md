This project continues the investigator's recent work on economies characterized
by uncertainty and in which the market for assets is incomplete. The topics to
be addressed under this grant are: demand theory, constrained optimality,
pricing of non-redundant assets, existence of equilibria for a fixed asset
structure, and infinite-horizon economies. These topics are important and
progress in these areas will contribute to an improvement in other fields of
economics such as macroeconomics, finance, and monetary theory. Furthermore,
this research should shed light on a number of important questions in economics.
For example, can an active monetary policy be effective, and if so, is it
desirable? To what extent and under what conditions can business cycles be
induced by incomplete asset markets?
