This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop
high-performance graphene-based conductive inks for printed electronics to meet
its stringent cost, flexibility, and conductivity requirements. Components
printed with existing conductive inks are challenged by repeated flexing cycles
that can break conductive paths. In this project, a graphene filler technology
and a novel formulation will be used to achieve the combination of electrical,
mechanical, and environmental durability properties specified for the flexible
printed electronics at a price point that enables high-volume applications.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the
availability of a conductive ink that meets performance requirements of next-
generation printed electronics. The printed electronics market is growing across
multiple sectors driven by applications including radio-frequency identification
(RFID) tags for tracking inventory, smart packaging for anti-theft and anti-
tampering purposes, smart cards and printed displays. Conductive inks are a
critical component in printed electronics, and limitations of existing
conductive inks have curtailed market growth. The new graphene-based conductive
inks are expected to demonstrate flexibility and mechanical robustness that
improves lifetime and performance of printed electronics, while providing
significant cost advantage over silver-based inks currently widely used in
printed electronics industry.
