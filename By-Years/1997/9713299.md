9713299 Synolakis This action is to support the organization of a two-day
workshop on seafloor ground deformation models. The workshop is to be held at
the University of Southern California Marine Science Station on Catalina Island,
14-15 May 1997. The objective of the workshop is to examine the state-of-the-
art of interfacial seismology and tsunami hydrodynamics; in particular, whether
the initial conditions for the seafloor displacement inferred from seismic
records are adequate for tsunami runup computations. Whereas there have been
significant advances in hydrodynamics, these advances have concentrated almost
entirely and appropriately on the refinement of the inundation computations. At
the same time, despite anecdotal advances in seismology, these advances have not
been absorbed by the hydrodynamics community. As a result, hydrodynamics
modelers use very elaborate shoreline computations, while using -- at the very
best -- initial conditions based on a dislocation theory which has been in
existence for twenty years or more. Also, the usefulness of the hydrodynamics
computations to better define the ground deformation needs to be better
understood by the seismology community. Since inundation maps for the west coast
of the US are currently being prepared using tsunami runup computations, the
question of the determination of the ground deformation is critically important.
It is the objective of the workshop to provide a forum for seismologists and
hydrodynamicists to discuss advances, and to identify short-term research needs
to better use the respective results. In each of the one-day discussions, the
objective is to identify critical issues, to attempt to answer all the criteria
questions which lie within the present state-of-knowledge, and to discover areas
requiring more extensive study. At the conclusion of the workshop, it is
expected that the tsunami research community will be in a better position to
focus -- in a continuing way -- on the r emaining questions whose answers are
needed to quantify better the input provided by ocean-bottom pressure transducer
recordings to tsunami warning systems.
