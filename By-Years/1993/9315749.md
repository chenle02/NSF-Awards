9315749 Tyburczy The PI will study a series of texturally equilibrated partially
molten olivine-basalt systems at one bar total pressure, to examine the
influence of grain size, temperature, oxygen fugacity, bulk composition, and
melt fraction on the grain boundary electrical response. He will also develop
methods to extend this work to elevated temperatures and pressures (up to 2000 C
and 20 GPa) in a multiple anvil apparatus. The results of this study will be
important for the interpretation and modeling of magnetotelluric data and will
also shed new light on grain boundary transport processes in a variety of
geological environments. The ultimate benefits will be a more detailed
understanding of the temperature profile and state of the Earth's interior. ****
