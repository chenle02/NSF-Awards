This is a study of methane oxidation in marine sediments and in the water
column. The PI will focus on samples from the Black Sea Expedition, samples from
a forthcoming cruise to Australian coastal waters, and on chemostat experiments
in the Laboratory using sediments from Scan Bay, Alaska. Stable carbon and
hydrogen isotopes will be measured to provide an estimate of the presence and
the extent of anaerobic methane oxidation. The chemostat experiments will lead
to an understanding of the substrates and the mechanisms involved in this
oxidation process.
