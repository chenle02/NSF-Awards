ABSTRACT This research develops an approach to the structure of complex words
in natural languages which treats relations among words as defined by a network
of interacting rules instead of by their shared content of minimal signs (or
'morphemes'). It is thus 'a-morphous' in dispensing with morphemes rather than
in the sense of lacking form. Three general problem areas will be addressed.
First, if rules rather than morphemes are the foundation of word structure,
words should have much less internal non- phonological form than commonly
assumed. The investigator will examine the idea that most such structure, such
as that usually associated with the presence of boundaries or junctures, and
with a phrase-marker-like arrangement of morphemes into higher level
constituents, can be eliminated. Secondly, the research will pursue the notion
that a single class of phonological operations on word forms characterizes
phonology, word level morphology, and also the introduction of phonologically
dependent clitics. Treating clitics as "phrase level morphology" has significant
implications for several problems in syntax as well as for phonology and
morphology. Finally, the investigator will explore the implementation of
grammars of word structure of this type in the form of computer programs. Such
implementation involves several difficult issues, such as the proper
representation of the full autosegmental and metrical structure of a word; the
balance between general and language particular principles in the interaction of
sound structural rules; and the degree and nature of parallelism appropriate to
the parsing of morphological structure. %%% The linguistic theory of grammatical
structure at the level of the word -- "morphology" -- has long presented special
problems. In some ways structure at the level of the word seems intuitively more
obvious than other levels of grammatical struc- ture, such as the sentence, and
yet it has proven much more resistant to a comprehensive, coherent theoretical
account. One reason for this is the great diversity from one language to another
in the nature of what the speakers perceive as individual words. The
investigator in this project has been developing a quite novel theory of
morphology, which accounts for a number of phenomena which have been unexplained
in other theoretical models. The next phase of the research will test the theory
against certain problematic cases from a variety of different languages, and
will also implement the theory as a computer program, to enable further testing
of its consistency and applicability to a wide variety of cases.
