The post-doc supported in this grant is testing the
thermosphere/ionosphere/electro-dynamic general circulation model's sensitivity
to upper boundary conditions. Using the field-aligned interhemispheric plasma
model, he is specifying electron temperature, ion temperature, and oxygen ion at
the model's upper boundary as a function of season and solar activity. Both of
these models are compared with incoherent scatter radar data from Arecibo and
Millstone Hill Observatories to evaluate the capabilities at low and middle
latitudes. The post-doc will then make any further refinements. This delineation
of the model sensitivity to external forces and boundary conditions is needed
for future studies of the causes of variability in the atmosphere.
