This project applies artificial intelligence techniques to implement the concept
of intelligent attendants or guides whose behavior (even personality) can be
made to depend upon the attributes of the learner. The project accomplishes this
by developing a SIMPLE (a set of many rooms) to accompany the first electronics
course for students of electrical engineering. The SIMPLE emphasizes providing
quick and ample feedback to students about their performance on the analytical
and problem-solving aspects of electronics, including both simple exercises and
open-ended design problems. The learner gets immediate feedback, as well as the
benefits of learning independent self-assessment of work, on complex open-ended
problems without direct participation by the instructor. The goal is to immerse
learners in an intensely interactive computer simulated environment related to
the subject matter they wish to learn. In the simulation, the learner sees a
collection of connected "rooms" that may contain, at the pleasure of the
instructor, informative notes and explanations (with graphics), project
assignments, and tools (word processor, spreadsheet, text editor, and specialty
software such as MathCAD and PSpice). By touring the complex of rooms, the
learner acquires knowledge, accomplishes tasks, and demonstrates competence by
interacting with the simulated environment. A key part of the effort is to
publicize the SIMPLE and to provide relatively polished versions of several
archetypical rooms (on floppy disks and over INTERNET) for the Plus/HyperCard
environment to other faculty so that they can develop additional material for
this and other courses.
