Abstract

Proposal: DMS-9802106 Principal Investigator: Jerrold E. Marsden

This proposal intends to advance funamental research in reduction theory for
mechanical systems with symmetry in the following ways. First, the theory of
reduction by stages for group extensions will be developed in both the
Hamiltonian (cotangent, symplectic and Poisson contexts) and the Lagrangian
(variational context) points of view. Second, the geometry and dynamics of
Lagrangian reduction, especially the Lagrange-Poincare equations and the
Lagrange-d'Alembert-Poincare equations will be investigated. In addition, the
theory of geometric phases for systems reduced using invariants and Kahler
structures as well as the use of blowing up techniques in singular reduction,
and multisymplectic geometry will be advanced.

The engineering analysis of mechanical systems such as robotic locomotion and
control devices makes use of the proposers mathematical techniques in geometric
mechanics. This mathematical foundation will be of increased importance as the
sophistication of such engineering systems get more complex and exhibit more
exotic dynamical behaviors and require more delicate control strategies. The
topics in this proposal are critical enabling tools for such research and have
proven to be of great utility in a variety of systems such as satellite
stabilization and underwater vehicle dynamics. They are also being put to
fundamental use in numerical simulation packages for nonlinear dynamical systems
in mechanics, including collision, fluid, and elastic systems as well as in
satellite mission planning.
