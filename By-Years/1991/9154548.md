This project is for the 6th National Conference of Black Physics Students
(NCBPS) at Stanford University in February, 1992. The purpose of the conference
is to assist and encourage those black students who have already shown interest
and ability in physics to enter and complete Ph.D. Programs, and to initiate
research careers in Physics. The primary audience for the conference are
undergraduate students who are majoring in physics, or who have expressed an
interest in physics; a principal goal of the conference is to permit these
students, who are in the process of making career decisions that will shape the
course of their working lives, to meet and interact with black graduate
students, and senior black scientists who can serve as role models and mentors.
