The processes that ensure accurate chromosome segregation in mitosis and meiosis
are critical for cellular viability and stability. The centromere is an
essential chromosomal structure with multiple functional roles necessary for
faithful segregation of replicated chromosomes to daughter cells. This project
will provide new insights into molecular mechanisms that lead to formation and
maintenance of centromeres. In addition, the project will provide research and
training opportunities to postdoctoral, graduate, undergraduate and high school
students in the San Antonio area, many of whom are under-represented minorities
and underprivileged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to
determine the factors and steps responsible for centromere formation and
maintenance. Ubiquitylation of CENP-A protein is essential for CENP-A centromere
deposition and assembly; hence, the hypothesis is that identification of
ubiquitin-dependent CENP-A interactors will provide crucial information about
mechanisms that control centromere assembly and maintenance. The following
specific aims test this hypothesis: (1) determine the role of RAD50 (and the MRN
complex) in CENP-A deposition at the centromere and its stability in centromeric
nucleosomes (preliminary data implicate these proteins in ubiquitylation-
dependent interactions with CENP-A); and (2) determine the role of R-loops in
CENP-A deposition at the centromere (preliminary data implicate RNA helicase A,
which is involved in R-loop formation and resolution, in ubiquitylation-
dependent interactions with CENP-A). The intellectual significance of this work
lies in novel mechanistic information that is vital to understanding the
fidelity of chromosome segregation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
