Dr. Joel Cracraft and Kathleen Helm-Bychowski, at the University of Illinois,
Chicago are studying the evolutionary relationships of the Australasian birds-
of-paradise (Paradisaeidae) to other families of Australasian songbirds.
Phylogenetic relationships are assessed by comparisons of mitochondrial DNA
sequences between species. The phylogeny is determined by computer analysis, and
will be compared with a phylogeny based on anatomical data. The study will
provide important evidence about the origin and evolutionary history of the
birds-of-paradise, and help us to understand the diversification of the
Australasian birds. The phylogenetic study will also help us understand the
structure and function of the mitochondrial genes and how they are modified by
evolution.
