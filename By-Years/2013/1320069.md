As society becomes increasingly reliant on software systems to help plan medical
treatments, predict the future climate, guide investments in financial markets,
and mine noisy data to infer scientific facts, the risk that uncertainties in
the input data and defects in the software can create false alarms, or a false
sense of security, is high. This project will help address the gap between
highly complex probabilistic programs and tools for reasoning about them.
Probabilistic programs arise in important everyday applications that include
medical, engineering and financial risk analysis/decision making systems, large-
scale simulations, data mining, sensor noise filtering algorithms for cyber-
physical systems, and randomized algorithms. The presence of input uncertainties
and randomness built into the behavior of the programs can cause undesirable
behaviors and variable performance. Therefore, it is important to accurately
predict the probabilities of such undesirable behaviors, and expected values for
important performance measures.

This project investigates automatic program analysis tools for probabilistic
programs that will model the sources of uncertainty appropriately, and infer
bounds on the probabilities of assertions and expectations of performance
measures. Two flavors of inference procedures are being investigated: symbolic
procedures combining decision procedures with the theory of martingales and
statistical procedures using statistical hypothesis testing methods to infer
probabilistic annotations with statistical guarantees.
