This award funds three research projects in game theory. The first analyzes
strategic situations in which participants communicate freely, including making
statements with no strategic motives. The second project seeks to develop new
methods for determining which equilibrium results are consistent with specific
concepts of consistency. The third project analyzes how a profit-maximizing
multi-product monopolist will choose a marketing strategy when it has incomplete
information about demand. The goal here is to develop bounds on the maximum
possible sales, which could provide some insight into why such firms frequently
bundle goods. The results of these projects may create new tools for analyzing
bargaining, negotiation, and repeated market
interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first project analyzes a model without
the common explicit enumeration of all possible actions for the players; in
practice this limits communication possibilities. Instead the PI develops a
model in which players are able to freely announce their private information.
Using a new refinement of sequential equilibrium, the resulting outcomes are
often stable in the Kohlberg-Mertens (1986) sense. The second project presents
an argument that normal form perfection, rather than backward induction or
sequential equilibrium, captures the decision-theoretic consequences of dynamic
consistency in games. The researcher then develops an equilibrium-based analog
of rationalizability to address the issues of invariance. This means that
invariance is sought as a result rather than being imposed as an axiom. The
third project tackles a complicated problem in multi-dimensional optimal
mechanism design. While there are no known methods for providing useful
characterizations of the solution, in practice we observe that firms use simple
mechanisms. The project will examine whether good revenue bounds can explain the
wide use of these mechanisms.
