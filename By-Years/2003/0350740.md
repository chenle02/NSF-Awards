This award supports an international workshop to that will extend research
directions for understanding the continuous (re)design of processes in free/open
source software systems (F/OSS). Using widely shared knowledge
capture/management processes and tools, the dynamic communities that develop
F/OSS software develop and refine very large, interdependent, and moving sets of
software specifications and designs, concurrently with processes of
implementation repair, release, etc. This is a fundamentally new type of
software design process, effectively linking many interacting, continuous, open,
collective processes (which could easily become chaotic) to produce surprisingly
efficient, stable, useful, and circumscribed artifacts. The activities to be
accomplished under this workshop award include analyzing and finding ways to
extend current research on continuous (re)design in free/open source software
systems and communities; developing criteria for informing decisions on what are
the most intellectually rewarding and productive directions in these areas;
developing a set of specific new directions and critical issues for research in
these areas which meet those criteria; and formulating several sets of
recommendations for NSF on how best to focus new research efforts in these
areas. The themes investigated will include work practices and software
development tools employed in a wide variety of F/OSS development projects.
Numerous scientific, government, and industrial communities stand to benefit
from having frameworks and guidelines for how to continuously design, or how to
manage the continuous design, of complex software systems under the F/OSS model
as they strive to develop or manage complex software systems for internal
applications or external products, under economic pressure to improve their
software productivity and quality, while reducing costs.
