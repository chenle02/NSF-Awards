The National Science Foundation manages the U.S. Antarctic Program, the nation's
program of scientific research on the southernmost continent. This project has
the potential to create an appreciation in a wide audience of the history of
science on the Antarctic and the contrast with contemporary scientific
infrastructure that makes science possible.

The artist's goal is to make a visual connection between the historic huts of
the first scientific explorers--as the earliest occupied 'scientific structures'
on the continent--and current field stations and science stations, by
photographing the architecture of Antarctica and presenting it in a
chronological way.

The photographer will seek out buildings and structures which represent various
time periods, to show the transitions over time. He also hopes to document how
the functions of various buildings have evolved, how the extreme weather is
accommodated, how people shape their living and work space, and look at details
of materials and how they have withstood the extreme weather.

Secondarily, he wishes to visit scientists in the field who are working in the
same locations as the early scientists and explorers. With an eye to the
"continuity, or discontinuity of the science being done in the places that were
first studied 100 years ago."

This architectural and archival record will include a comprehensive look at
McMurdo Station, the nation's largest Antarctic research station, capturing the
facilities as moment in time, which will have value for future generations.

The National Science Foundation provides access to US Antarctic Program
activities in Antarctica but does not provide funding for this work.
