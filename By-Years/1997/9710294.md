This grant helps support expenses for key participants for this Geological
Society of America (GSA) Presidential Conference on `Ethics and the
Geoscientist` in Welches (Mt. Hood), Oregon. Co-sponsors are GSA, the American
Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG), the American Institute of
Professional Geologists (AIPG), and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The
conference is for a maximum of 100 invited and voluntary participants. The great
majority are geoscientists, but key participants include philosophers,
ethicists, attorneys, judges, planners, and journalists, representing academic,
governmental, and private sectors. The primary conference goals are to promote
dialogue within the geosciences community on ethical issues and to develop a
framework for assembly and dissemination of information on these issues. The
conference will emphasize how to foster and promote ethical behavior.
Discussions will identify and discuss types of ethical systems, cultural
controls on ethical behavior, case histories, issues in professional
certification and enforcement in an ethical framework, codes of ethics and legal
concerns associated with them, and means of instilling, fostering, and
communicating ethical behavior. The conference serves to assemble an
interdisciplinary group to serve as catalysts in future promotion of ethical
awareness, as well as disseminators and implementers for conference results. The
conveners will submit conference reports for publication in the literature of
their organizations and others who have expressed interest. Follow-up symposia
and posting of information on the web sites of geoscience organizations should
also develop.
