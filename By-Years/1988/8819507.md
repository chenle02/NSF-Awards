Studies of two-dimensional electron gas on the surface of liquid helium, and
three-dimensional solid helium-four, focussing on evidence for quantum
tunnelling of electrons or helium atoms. The solid helium-four study will be
conducted using ultrasonic attenuation, thermal conductivity, heat capacity and
heat pulse propagation experiments to look for quasiparticle excitations, defect
behavior, and evidence for the formation of a "supersolid"-- the solid state
analogue of a superfluid. Measurements of the escape rate of electrons from the
surface of liquid helium will be performed in order to characterize the
groundstate and excitations of the two-dimensional electron system.
