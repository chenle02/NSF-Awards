Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Normal plant growth and development is highly
dependent upon clathrin-mediated membrane trafficking for cell division, the
uptake and recycling of plasma membrane proteins critical for auxin transport,
nutrient uptake and hormone and pathogen signaling. More than a decade of
research has led to our current understanding of the complex network of proteins
and lipids required for endocytosis in yeast and mammalian cells. By comparison,
our knowledge of the mechanism of clathrin-mediated membrane transport in plants
is rudimentary. However, recent studies have demonstrated that the plant
endocytic machinery and its regulation have evolved to meet the unique
requirements necessary for plant morphogenesis and growth. Key to our
understanding the similarities and differences between clathrin-mediated
membrane transport in plants and other systems will be the comprehensive
identification and characterization of the evolutionarily conserved, along with
the plant-specific core and accessory machinery involved in the formation and
targeting of plant clathrin-coated vesicles and elucidation of the role of these
proteins in plant cell division. Proteomic, biochemical, genetic and imaging
studies are proposed to identify and directly characterize proteins involved in
the formation and targeting of plant clathrin-coated endocytic vesicles.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt; These studies will likely
provide new insight into the molecular dynamics of clathrin-dependent
trafficking in plants and evolutionarily divergent organisms. In addition, as
clathrin-coated vesicle trafficking is involved in a wide range of plant
processes, our results should generate fundamental knowledge that will in the
long term, aid in the development of improved crops with enhanced biomass yield
necessary for sustainable food, feed, and biofuel production. The work will also
involve the training of undergraduates, graduate students and post-docs who will
learn a variety of important techniques including computational techniques for
imaging.
