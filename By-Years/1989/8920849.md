>This award is the first under the new 5.Year Cooperative Agreement with
Cornell for the continued management, operation, and maintenance of the National
Astronomy and Ionosphere Center (NAIC). The research programs at NAIC include
radio astronomy, radar astronomy, and atmospheric physics. Recent results in the
areas of pulsar searches and timing, large scale structure of the universe from
redshift surveys, and radar observations of the planets have kept the
Observatory at the forefront of astronomical research. The atmospheric science
program is at the forefront of studies of upper atmosphere energetics and
dynamics. The principal research facilities of the NAIC are located near
Arecibo, Puerto Rico, and consist of the 305.meter radio telescope and its
associated radars and receivers and an HF heating facility. Additional
laboratory, office, and research support facilities are located on the Cornell
campus in Ithaca New York. The facilities of NAIC are available to all qualified
scientists on a competitive basis. More than 150 scientists use the observing
and data analysis facilities of the NAIC each year.
