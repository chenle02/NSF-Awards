IBN-9727532 PI: EDWARDS Some animals can produce venom that includes not only
slowly acting enzymes, but very rapidly acting neurotoxins, which are molecular
compounds that have drastic effects on the signalling or transmission properties
of nerve cells. These compounds may be used for prey capture, as in some snakes
and spiders, or for defense, as in some insects. Recently it has been discovered
that a potent rapid neurotoxicity remains in heat-denatured saliva of an insect
called the assassin bug, which squirts this venomous saliva at predatory larger
insects, causing rapid paralysis. This toxic activity appears to be from non-
enzymatic peptides. This Small Grant for Exploratory Research is to isolate,
purify and identify neuroactive components for comparison with known neuroactive
peptides, and to establish their mode of action using pharmacological studies on
insect nerve-muscle proparations. The working hypothesis is that the active
components are peptides that act at the neuromuscular junction, or act to
generally depolarize membranes by acting on specific channels or by creating
membrane pores. This work opens a potentially large new area of research,
because we know about some neurotoxic venoms from spiders and some from wasps
and bees, but virtually nothing about other insect neurotoxins. The potential
impact of this work in neuroscience is high because the few well-characterized
known toxins have led to particularly useful information about the molecular
structure of nerve cell membranes. This new venom may have novel molecular
properties, and the amounts of readily collectable venom are far greater than
for other insect or spider toxins, which could lead to an inexpensive commercial
source for pharmacology. The impact of this work in ecology is also likely to be
high because it will open questions about molecular evolution of insect venoms
as well as evolutionary development of insect defense strategies.
