To exercise leadership, science and engineering educators need to provide their
students with the tools to identify and respond appropriately to professional
problems with ethical dimensions. This project will develop an innovative
campus-wide program integrating ethics into the professional curriculum, a
program professional societies could adapt to their continuing education
programs. The project has four steps: 1) developing and offering workshops for
IIT faculty in how to teach professional ethics in how to teach professional
ethics in their technical courses; 1) providing institutional support (a
continuing seminar, case file, videos, and so on) for faculty introducing
professional ethics into their technical courses; 3) redesigning existing
capstone courses to include a design program requiring ethical difficult
cooperation among students in two or more professional programs; and 4)
disseminating results through a day-and-a-half working conference for staff and
volunteers in continuing education programs of professional societies and a
weeklong version of the workshop for faculty of other universities, as well as
through presentations at professional meetings and publications in appropriate
journals. This proposal focuses on an important area in Ethics and Values
Studies. The investigators are very well qualified; the plan is thoughtful and
feasible; university support is extremely good. Results are likely to improve
the teaching of engineering ethics on this campus and in undergraduate curricula
nationwide. Based on the merits of the proposal and the generally positive
review, support is highly recommended.
