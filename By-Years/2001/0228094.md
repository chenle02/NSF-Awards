This research involves the creation of a co-processor architecture evaluation
environment which integrates architecture-level simulation with industrial CAD
tools. The end-goal is to facilitate the design of high-performance domain-
specific co-processors. In the evaluation environment, the designer will have
the capability of 'test driving' a wide variety of design alternatives with
respect to real application ppograms. The mechanism is to `drop-in' components
into predetermined templates, gauge their effect on virtual machine instruction
execution, and use that information to evaluate virtual machine instruction
traces. There are three aspects to this research: (i) integrating existing or
user-constructed component libraries and synthesis tools into an architecture-
level model generator, (ii) integrating the same into an interprocessor network
simulator, and (iii) extending an existing architecture-level simulator to
include data parallel SPMD architectures. A graphic user interface is being
developed to help the user mix-and-match components. The resulting environment
will target not only professional designers, but also students in computer and
advanced digital design classes.
