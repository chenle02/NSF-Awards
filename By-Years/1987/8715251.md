A multidiscipinary project is in progress to determine the factors controlling
forest vegetation over the last 400 years at Itasca State Park, northwest
Minnesota. The approach is to reconstruct from independent lines of evidence
forests, including patterns of composition, recruitment, growth, and mortality,
and physical environments, including climate and fire, in a detailed fashion
across a one km2 study area. Patterns within stands will be agglomerated to
document both local stand and landscape patterns through the past. Methods
include analysis of fossil pollen, charcoal, loss-on-ignition, and thin-sections
of laminated lake sediments, fire-scars of 400 year old red pine trees, stand
age structures, tree growth via ring widths, soils, light regimes, and modes of
regeneration and mortality. Results will demonstrate many of the important
influences of changing physical environments on vegetation that can be used for
forest management and prediction of responses to changing climate, land- use,
and fire regimes.
