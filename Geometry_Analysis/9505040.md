9505040 Stern The proposed research has to do with the Hodge theory of singular
or noncompact varieties. The investigator proposes to realize the intersection
cohomology of a projective variety as an explicit complex of differential forms
equipped with a Hodge filtration. He also proposes to construct harmonic
automorphic representatives of de Rham cohomology classes of locally symmetric
spaces. Varieties are a central object in geometry and algebra as they arise as
solutions to polynomial equations in various dimensions. Intersection cohomology
is a way to understand how these varieties are situated in space by looking at
their various intersection properties.
