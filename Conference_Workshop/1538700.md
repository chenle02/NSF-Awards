The International Conference on Representation Theory and Commutative Algebra,
to be held April 24-27 at the University of Connecticut, will bring researchers
of all levels together to further explore the connections between the fields
mentioned in the title. Broadly speaking, representation theory attempts to
realize abstract algebraic objects in concrete terms, usually via collections of
matrices or other well-understood constructs. The philosophy is that to better
explore the behavior of a group (arising as symmetries of objects) or an algebra
(arising as functions between objects) or any other pertinent algebraic
structure, one can start by characterizing all manners in which such a structure
can act upon a set. Writing down such a characterization can be a tremendously
difficult problem, but there are fields of mathematics that can lead to deeper
understanding of these actions, including commutative algebra. This conference
will examine the data that can be gleaned about representation theory from this
point of view. The conference will seek to disseminate recent results while
inviting the next generation of junior researchers to take part in new
developments. Experts will share theoretical progress and lend perspective to
the questions, and early career participants will discuss their contributions
through poster presentations. For more details see

Algebro-geometric techniques have been applied to problems in representation
theory since the early seventies. The geometric point of view was put to use by
Kac in locating indecomposable representations of quivers, by Jerzy Weyman in
constructing free resolutions of defining ideals of module varieties, by Jerzy
Weyman and Harm Derksen in proving the saturation property for Littlewood-
Richardson coefficients, and by Alastair King in constructing moduli spaces of
representations. The aim of this conference is to address several specific
questions and a number of problems that have evolved from these geometric
approaches.
