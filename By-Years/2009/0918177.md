Insects perceive the world through chemical signals, like pheromones, that
communicate the presence of friends and foes, advertize the readiness to mate,
and indicate the availability of food. They evolved an olfactory system so acute
that they can find "a needle in a haystack" by smelling relevant information
broadcasted in the midst of complex chemical mixtures in the environment. In
addition, they "separate the darnel from the wheat" with a remarkable
selectivity that allows them to detect a chemical signal while being completely
insensitive to another molecule almost identical (from an anthropomorphic
perspective). By using biochemical, biophysical, molecular biology, and
electrophysiological approaches, the project will dissect molecular interactions
of moth sex pheromone with an odorant receptor and other olfactory proteins. The
goal is to unveil how these olfactory proteins contribute to the extraordinary
sense of smell of the insect. Understanding the molecular basis of the
inordinate sensitivity and selectivity of the insect olfactory system will open
the door for the development of not only strategies for insect pest control, but
also biomimetic devices for industrial and homeland security applications. In
addition, these research activities will be a platform for training graduate
students as well as for professional development of postdoctoral scholars for
academic and/or scientific careers. This project in synergy with other academic
activities will provide opportunities for training underrepresented minorities.
