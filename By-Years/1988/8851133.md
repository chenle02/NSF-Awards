Extending the work begun under a previous NSF grant, this two-year award will
support a comprehensive study of the mathematical sciences at the undergraduate
level. Entitled "Mathematical Sciences in the Year 2000," this study will assess
of the needs, resources, and opportunities in undergraduate mathematics
education. It will also promote dialogue within the mathematical community about
these issues and develop recommendations for the "renewal" of collegiate
mathematics. Products of the project will include three review papers describing
talent, curriculum, and resources. In addition, the award will support the
inclusion of undergraduate mathematics in the Mathematical Sciences Education
Board's forthcoming "Reports to the Nation."
