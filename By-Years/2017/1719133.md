The goal of this project is to develop interactive learning frameworks and
methods that can learn predictors based on complex, imperfect feedback
adaptively solicited in an on-line fashion from human annotators. Such
predictors can significantly benefit the practice of machine learning by making
it more accessible in domains where annotations are expensive. Currently, beyond
a handful of heuristic studies, the only well-understood interactive learning
setting is active binary classification, where a single annotator interactively
provides labels to a learning algorithm. The main challenge in exploiting richer
feedback is that human responses are inherently inconsistent and imperfect. This
project will overcome this challenge by assuming that the responses come from
unknown probability distributions with some mild yet realistic properties, which
will be exploited to provide methods that can learn reliably from complex
feedback.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this project will introduce a
general framework for interactive learning from imperfect, complex feedback, and
develop methods for three common cases: (1) Active Learning with Abstention
Feedback, where annotators can either provide a label or declare I Don't Know
(2) Active Learning for Multiclass Classification, where the goal is to learn a
classifier for a large number of classes and (3) Active Learning with Feedback
from Multiple Annotators, where the goal is to combine feedback from many
labelers with varying amounts of expertise subject to a budget. These problems
will be approached through two main tools -- adaptive hypothesis testing and
surrogate loss minimization. Combining these approaches will lead to principled
algorithms for building accurate machine learning predictors with low annotation
cost, which in turn, will benefit the practice of machine learning in domains
where annotated data is expensive.
