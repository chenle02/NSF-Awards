Mathematics is exceedingly complex, and avoiding mistakes is crucial to keeping
our mathematics correct, meaningful, and reliable. This project involves the use
of logic-based computational methods to support mathematical reasoning. The PI
will contribute to the development of a theorem prover called Lean, which can be
used to verify complex proofs and calculations. The system enables us to build
mathematical libraries that are verified on the basis of a formal axiomatic
system, with the computer checking each and every claim on the basis of a small
set of axioms and rules. The system will support exploration and the discovery
of new mathematics, and can also be used to verify properties of complex systems
in computer science, engineering, and finance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
development of Lean is based at Microsoft Research, Redmond, but it is an open-
source, community-based project that currently involves researchers at Carnegie
Mellon University, Stanford, and the University of Washington as well. The PI
will develop Lean's libraries and automation to support applications in fields
such as engineering and mathematical finance. Specifically, the PI and his
collaborators and students at Carnegie Mellon will extend the libraries for
analysis and measure theory and measure-theoretic probability, as well as parts
of algebra and homotopy type theory. They will also contribute to other types of
automation currently under development in Lean, and develop decision procedures
and algorithms for special domains. Finally, they will continue to develop
interactive online course material, based on Lean, to provide better educational
resources for logic and formal methods.
