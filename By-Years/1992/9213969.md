The Sondrestrom incoherent scatter radar in Greenland has recently been
upgraded with a new radar data acquisition system that allows measurements to be
made with a higher spatial resolution than ever before. The effort proposed here
will take advantage of the improvements to study two interesting and important
problems in ionospheric physics. The first is the appearance of thin layers of
metallic ions at altitudes near 110 km. These layers have been observed at lower
latitudes and have been explained as the concentration of meteoric material due
to shears in the neutral winds. At high latitudes this explanation does not
apply, so that the appearance of these layers in the Sondrestrom data is an
important breakthrough. The second topic of the proposed study is the enhanced
ionization at altitudes below 100 km that occurs at high latitudes during large
magnetic storms. This ionization is produced by energetic protons from the sun
and its presence at such low altitudes can produce dramatic changes in radiowave
propagation at high latitudes.
