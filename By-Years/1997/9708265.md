This award renews support for the Laser Research Facility at the Harrison
Spectroscopy Laboratory at MIT directed by Professor M. S. Feld. The support
derives from the Division of Chemistry and the Office of Multidisciplinary
Activities of the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences. The Laser
Research Facility is a shared research facility in which physical scientists in
chemistry, physics, environmental science, and engineering pursue a broad range
of problems using lasers and state-of-the-art spectroscopic techniques. The
research is focussed in six areas: spectroscopy of nanostructured materials,
Raman spectroscopy, ultrasensitive absorption-based laser techniques, picosecond
dynamics, optical physics and source development, and environmental science. The
Facility features undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral education and
training, as well as outreach through dissemination of scientific results and
topical seminars. The Laser Research Facility, as a shared facility with state-
of-the-art equipment and personnel skilled in its use, enables new research
opportunities to be seized upon and carried out quickly, economically, and
effectively. It leads to new collaborations and research programs that would not
exist in the absence of the facility.
