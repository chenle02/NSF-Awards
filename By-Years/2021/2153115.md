The Principal Investigator (PI) will study varieties. Varieties are defined as
the set of solutions of systems of polynomial equations. They are fairly easy to
compute and Nash proved every space can be well approximated by varieties. The
main aim of the project is to understand how varieties vary if we change the
coefficients of the defining polynomial equations, especially for the ones which
are positively curved. Such varieties are called Fano varieties. In particular
the research will try to understand situations when a family of Fano varieties
degenerates to one with singularities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI intends to
prove that among all Fano varieties, the K-polystable ones can be parametrised
by a universal space, called moduli space. As part of the this project, the PI
aims to show the moduli space is Hausdorff and compact. The PI aims to
understand which Fano varieties are K-semistable by understanding concrete
examples as well as some general phenomena. The PI aims to understand the
degeneration of Calabi-Yau manifolds, through the interplay between birational
and non-archimedean geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
