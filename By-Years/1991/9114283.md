Given the recent development in integrated optics and optoelectronics, it is
important to develop computer-aided simulation, analysis and design tools for
the these device and systems. A vectorial beam propagation method will be
developed as compared to the current scaler beam method where the polarization
characteristics of the optical field are neglected. The vectorial beam
propagation method VBPM to be developed will be applicable to optical structures
of arbitrary structural geometry and anisotropic media of arbitrary
inhomogeneity.
