Harris-Stowe State University, a small HBCU in the St. Louis metropolitan area,
serves approximately 2,000 students, ninety percent African American. Harris-
Stow also has a legacy of preparing candidates for careers in elementary and
secondary science and mathematics education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The HBCU-UP
project at Harris-Stowe has two main goals: to increase the academic achievement
level for first year students in mathematics and science courses; and to
increase the overall enrollment and graduation rates of students pursuing
teacher degrees in mathematics and science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The strategies
proposed make up the Retention Enhancement Program (REP) and the Teacher
Education Reform Program (TERP), and emerged as a result of a planning process
supported by an NSF HBCU-UP planning grant. Many of the strategies parallel each
other for the Retention Enhancement Program and the Teacher Education Reform
Program. These strategies include student support services (e.g. peer tutoring
and peer mentoring); curriculum reform in mathematics and science; enhancement
and expansion of research opportunities for students, including pre-service
teachers, and a residential summer academy for incoming students. The program
will be supported by a Director of Retention for Mathematics and Science who
will coordinate the retention and recruiting
efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the HBCU-UP project, Harris-Stowe State
University expects an increase in the number of teacher education candidates in
mathematics and science, and an increase in the retention of first year students
in mathematics and science. &lt;br/&gt;
