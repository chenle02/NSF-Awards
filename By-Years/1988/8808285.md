In the adult rat chamber model for PNS regeneration, the two stumps of a
resected sciatic nerve are inserted into opposite ends of a cylindrical silicone
tube leaving a 10 mm, 25 u1 gap between them. In a defined sequence--fluid
exudate accumulation, acellular matrix formation, cell immigration and axonal
regrowth- a nerve structure forms de novo in the chamber and sensory and motor
recoveries eventually take place. This research will complete the development of
a continuous perfusion system for the experimental administration of exogenous
agents, in particular: neuronotrophic factors, growth factors for Schwann and
other cells, and neurite-promoting extracellular matrix components.
