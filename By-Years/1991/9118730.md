Cryptoendolithic microorganisms colonize the upper few millimeters of limestone
rocks of the Antarctic desert. These microbes live in a critically extreme
environment, near the absolute limit of their physiological potential. Water
from snowmelt and light penetrate the rocks but growth appears to be limited by
the extreme low ambient temperatures. A climatic gradient has been observed to
span a range of sites located in the McMurdo Dry Valleys. This study will
quantify environmental conditions. Automatic data loggers will monitor the
microscale climate inside rocks, and computer models based on these measurements
will help identify the exact environmental threshold between life and
extinction. Transmission electron microscopy will be used to document the
degradation of dead communities and the formation of trace fossils. The
communities studied here have been proposed as a terrestrial model for the last
stages of life on early Mars. The results of these studies will serve to
reconstruct the process of extinction on Mars and suggest the form its present-
day traces might take. This project is jointly supported by the National Science
Foundation and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
