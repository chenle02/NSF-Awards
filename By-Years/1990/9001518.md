Block copolymers are of great technological importance and simultaneously
provide interesting opportunities to study basic statistical effects in physical
science. Although some aspects of the science of these copolymers are reasonably
well understood, very little is known about their behavior when dissolved in
binary liquid solvents or when they occupy the interface between two immiscible
liquids, each of which is a good solvent for one block of the copolymer. A
series of experiments will be carried out on diblock and alternating copolymers
dissolved in liquid mixtures to determine the effect of the polymer on: 1) the
thermodynamics and capillary wave spectrum of the liquid-liquid interface, 2)
interfacial development under mechanically driven interfacial instabilities, and
3) composition fluctuations in miscible liquid mixtures. In all three cases, the
liquid behavior is expected to affect the polymer conformation at the same time
as the polymeric degrees of freedom are affecting the interface(s), and the
measurements will be directed toward understanding this behavior.
