ABSTRACT--CTS-9310996 The proposal is for equipment that would allow
simultaneous Raman scattering measurements and OH fluorescence imaging on
turbulent jet flames to be carried out. The equipment consists of a back-lit CCD
camera, a lens coupled intensifier, and associated hardware. The camera will
allow instantaneous imaging of the important chemical species and structure of
the turbulent reaction zones leading to a better understanding of the effects of
dissipation rate and flame curvature on the finite-rate chemistry occurring in
these flames. This new camera can enhance the Raman detection limits sensitivity
and measurement accuracy over the old ICCD camera presently available. The old
camera will be used for the OH (PLIF) fluorescence imaging measurements.
