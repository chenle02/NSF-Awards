The purpose of this research is to develop an alternative interpretation of
layoffs which is fully consistent with an efficient labor market. Specifically,
this research will focus on theoretical and empirical work which analyzes quits
and layoffs within a matching framework that interprets separations as the
outcome of joint wealth- maximizing behavior. A dynamic representation will
replace the assumption of a sequence of spot markets. This will carry over to
the estimation of structural models of turnover and wage equation estimation in
the presence of endogenous turnover. Other aspects of the project include
analyses of (a) temporary layoff and recall, (b) the effect of subsidized
unemployment insurance, and (3) the testable differences between the joint
wealth-maximizing and rigid-wage models. $$$ The role for government
intervention in firm-worker relationships depends on how efficiently the labor
market operates when left to market forces. The existence of layoffs has been
interpreted by some as evidence that the labor market does not operate
efficiently in the allocation of labor and the mitigation of unemployment. This
project develops an alternative interpretation of layoffs which may be fully
consistent with an efficient labor market. Much of the project will focus on
examining the evidence as to whether layoffs are in fact consistent with an
efficiently operating labor market. Of possible policy relevance would be the
estimated effect on the unemployment insurance system of reclassifying would be
quits as layoffs to quality for benefits.
