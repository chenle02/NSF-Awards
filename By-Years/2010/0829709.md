OISE-0829709 (Matherly, University of Tulsa)&lt;br/&gt;?Strategic Initiatives
for University Internationalization?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt
;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a two-phase symposium on ?Strategic
Initiatives for University Internationalization? between universities in the
U.S. and Japan. The symposium will involve US and Japanese university officials
with responsibility for campus internationalization to share best practices and
encourages collaboration. Special emphasis will be placed on the role of science
and engineering education in university internationalization
strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first meeting will be held May 22-24, 2008
in advance of the annual conference for NAFSA: Association for International
Educators in Washington, DC. The meeting will explore U.S. and Japanese
perspectives on internationalization, comparative policy initiatives,
institutional approaches to campus internationalization, international
collaboration and consortia and mobility of students and researchers. Japanese
participants will be officials from twenty universities receiving special
?Strategic International Headquarters? grants from the Japan Society for the
Promotion of Science to become models in Japan for university
internationalization. U.S. participants will be officials from universities and
organizations that have been recognized for model programs, especially in the
area of science and engineering. A second symposium is scheduled in Japan for
December 1-5, 2008 beginning in Tokyo and including travel to universities in
other parts of Japan. U.S. participants will include a subset of the officials
participating in the May meeting. Special attention will be paid to
representation from a diverse group of U.S. universities, and to encouraging
follow-up collaborative activities in science and engineering research and
education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
