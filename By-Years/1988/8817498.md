Inducible defensive strategies against predators are demonstrably important in
marine, freshwater, and terrestrial habitats; however, only in benthic marine
systems have inducible defenses against competitors emerged as important
mechanisms of interaction. In addition to their ecological importance, inducible
defenses are powerful tools for the analysis of allocation shifts within
phenotypically plastic organisms and of the evolution of defense and aggression.
This investigation will employ an experimental approach to analyze proximate and
ultimate mechanisms of inducible defenses with the following three goals: 1. To
determine the size-specific costs and benefits of inducible responses to
predators (spines) and competitors (stolons), independently and in combination.
2. To determine the translocation patterns underlying the highly localized
growth and reproduction shifts associated with inducible defenses to predators
and competitors using a common currency of carbon (14C radioisotope). 3. To
assess the frequency of inducible defenses to predators (spines) and competitors
(stolons) in two different geographic and productivity regimes with the ultimate
goal of determining the relative biological selection pressures for the
inducible defenses.
