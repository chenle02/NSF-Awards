9308921 Wright This research grant will fund a study that should advance the
field of magnetic resonance microscopy by developing methods to acquire more
data per unit time than is presently possible and to improve the signal-to-noise
ratio of the data. Arrays of radio frequency sensors will be used. The goals are
the following: 1) to develop an understanding of the signal-to-noise performance
of the arrays; 2) to develop computer-aided design tools to model the
interactions between the arrays and the environment; 3) to minimize the noise
correlation in the array; 4) to develop inexpensive hardware to enable the use
of the arrays with existing and new systems; and 5) to evaluate the arrays. This
research on coil arrays is important since it will enable the fields of magnetic
resonance microscopy and functional imaging to be advanced and this research has
the potential to maintain the costs associated with these improvements. ***
