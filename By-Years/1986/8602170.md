This project is to support a Symposium on "Recent Trends in Aeroelasticity,
Structures, and Structural Dynamics" to be held on February 6-7, 1986 at the
University of Florida. The Proceedings of the Symposium will include papers on
the assessment of the present state-of-the-art and to indicate the trends for
future research efforts. The report will serve as a planning document and will
be widely distributed throughout the academic community.
