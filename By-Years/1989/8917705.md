Thid project will investigate the interrelationship of deformation and fluid
expulsion along the Oregon margin and specifically examine the transition from
stratigraphically controlled to fault controlled flow; existing measurements
ofintergranular permeability provide a basis for quantifying fluid flow along
stratigraphically-controlled conduits; evaluation of the effect of faults will
require direct measurements of permeability in fault rocks as well as estimation
of permeability along larger-than-sample size fracture networks. They will
sample a canyon wall what exposes a fault that is venting fluids; they will
determine the variation of permeability, porosity, grain size, cementation
state, and structural fabric development across the fault zone.
