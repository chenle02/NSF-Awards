The Department of Chemistry at Northwestern University will purchase a
Microcomputer Network and Graphics Work Station with the support of this award
from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program and the Instrumentation for
Materials Research Program. The instrumentation will be used to upgrade the
existing X-ray single crystal structure facility, to perform molecular graphics
and molecular mechanics calculations, and to process nuclear magnetic resonance
data. The areas of chemistry that will be enhanced by the acquisition include:
1) Natural product synthesis, including antibacterial agents 2) Polymer ionics
and ion transport 3) Metal cluster synthesis and structure 4) Construction of
models of proteins 5) Structure and dynamics of adsorbed molecules 6) Gas-phase
chemical reaction dynamics
