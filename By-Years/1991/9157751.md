The proposed research involves innovative groundbased observations of Jupiter's
magnetosphere and Io's extended atmosphere. The goals (1) to understand the
interaction between Jupiter's plasma and Io's atmosphere, and (2) to study the
causal connections between Io's highly-variable volcanoes, its extended
atmosphere, and the plasma torus.
