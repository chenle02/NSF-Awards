Indiana U. Very few studies have examined the linkages between migration and
life cycle events on a longitudinal basis. This award will allow the development
of analyses which connect migration to critical events as a working career
unfolds. The analysis will rely upon information regarding the timing of
migration and work history events through data from the Survey of Income and
Program Participation of the U.S. Census. Hypotheses will be tested from human
capital models and the framework of life course analysis using statistical
models that have already been developed for the analysis of longitudinal data.
The research promises new theoretical insights into the linked nature of events
in the life course and thus contributes both to this body of literature as well
as the migration literature. In an empirical manner the research will allow the
evaluation of how closely migration is associated with labor force activity and
to show the importance of specific events.
