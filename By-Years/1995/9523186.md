9523186 Jayne This research is to develop an aerosol mass spectrometer for size
and composition analysis of sub-micron size particles in the atmosphere. The
technology for this device will build on a combination of proven technology for
both aerosol sampling and mass spectrometry to develop a novel approach to
particle composition analysis based on hot wire vaporization of size selected
submicron particles. This spectrometer will have the ability to determine the
simultaneous chemical composition of the full range of aerosol particles,
without the use of expensive and delicate laser systems. The successful
development of this spectrometer will be more cost effective than most competing
systems now under development and will be useful in a wide variety of field
applications. These applications include environmental aerosol monitoring,
laboratory aerosol physics, and other studies of aerosol formation and growth
mechanics.
