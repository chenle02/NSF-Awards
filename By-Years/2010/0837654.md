This award provides travel support for Dr. Lawrence Barsalou and one of his
graduate students to present at the Tenth Annual Meeting of the European Social
Cognition Network (ESCON) in Volterra, Italy (September 3-7, 2008). Dr.
Barsalou's research addresses the hypothesis that the human conceptual system is
grounded in the brain's modal systems for perception, action, and thought.
Because concepts are grounded in these systems, they are represented as
simulations of experience and the situations in which it occurs. This research
has implications for social cognition, given that it suggests new ways of
thinking about how social knowledge for individuals, groups, traits, situations,
and so forth is represented. The conference draws researchers from all over the
world, including Europe, North America, and South America. More than 100
researchers are expected to attend, with an approximate distribution of two-
thirds junior researchers (graduate students and post docs) and one-third senior
researchers. The conference provides outstanding opportunites for junior and
senior researchers to exchange ideas, receive feedback on current research, and
develop new research projects.
