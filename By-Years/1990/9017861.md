Among the highest priority objectives of the Ocean Drilling Program are those
which concern fluid circulation in the oceanic crust and sediments, including
studies of hydrothermal processes associated with crustal accretion and aging
and of hydrogeological systems at accretionary margins. Fluid circulation in the
crust and sediments controls the alteration of crustal chemistry, transports
heat and alteration products, and plays a controlling role in determining
physical properties of margin sediment sequences. As permeability is the key
physical property that directly controls fluid circulation, its measurement in
situ and the determination of its variation with depth in various
hydrogeological settings is an important objective. This award will acquire and
deploy a recently developed technique for making rapid and detailed measurements
in boreholes. Although developed for continental drilling, the
injection/flowmeter technique should be adaptable for use from the JOIDES
Resolution and will give a more continuous and detailed record of permeability
than is presently available. The principal investigators have extensive
backgrounds in permeability studies and in developing techniques for downhole
measurements in both continental and oceanic boreholes.
