Three magnetic storms were identified by the joint SHINE-GEM-CEDAR magnetic
storm campaign as candidates for a broad and inclusive study of the dynamics of
magnetic storms. The periods to be studies are 10-11 May 1997, 24 Sept. - 1 Oct.
1998, and 18-31 Oct. 1998. This study will examine the spatial and temporal
evolution of the electric fields in the inner magnetosphere during the three
storm study periods. A global model for the storm-time electric field will be
obtained by mapping the ionospheric electric field (as determined from ground
based observations using the Assimilative Mapping of Ionospheric Electrodynamic
- AMIE - technique) into the magnetosphere along magnetic field lines. The
effects of penetration of electric fields to lower latitudes and hence the inner
magnetosphere will be incorporated by a detailed analysis of field-aligned
currents associated with the divergence of the ring current computed by the Ring
Current-Atmosphere interaction Model (RAM). The RAM model will also be further
extended to include the effect of wave-particle scattering of energetic O+ ions.
The model results will be compared with satellite data.
