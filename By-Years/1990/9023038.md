This award will partially support the Particles and Fields Conference to be
held in Vancouver, Canada; August 18-22, 1991. This is a meeting of the Division
of Particles and Fields of the American Physical Society, which will be held
jointly with the Division of Particle Physics of the Canadian Association of
Physicists on the campus of the University of British Columbia. Planary and
parallel sessions will cover most of the currently active high energy physics
topics and will provide a broad overview of what is being done now at the
various accelerator centers of the World. The award is for the partial support
of US students and post-doctorals, who would otherwise have difficulty obtaining
support.
