Mechanical Engineering (56)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing a
module on smart actuators for inclusion into three different courses within the
mechanical engineering undergraduate curriculum. The module is addressing the
important aspects of modeling, control and design of smart actuator-based
systems through a collection of specially designed lectures and laboratory
experiments. In this way, the students are being provided the knowledge,
understanding and skills for nano/bio related professional fields.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is building on the research expertise of the
PIs, leveraging their experiences and collaborative efforts in this area. The
PIs are designing, implementing and assessing the modules which are being
included in a junior level course on mechanical systems and controls, a senior
level mechatronics course and a capstone design course, each course at a
different institution. After completing the module, the students can understand
the fundamental concepts of modeling/control of piezoactuators, transfer the
knowledge to solve engineering problems at higher levels of abstraction and
recognize mechanical concepts in nano/bio technologies.&lt;br/&gt;
