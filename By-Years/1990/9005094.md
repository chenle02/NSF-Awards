The sensitivity of the present resonant-mass gravitational-wave detector is
limited by the relatively low electrical quality factor and the restricted
bandwidth of the transducers. In order to reach the potential sensitivity of
third-generation, ultralow-temperature gravitational-wave detectors, significant
improvement must be made in the transducers. Prof. Paik will construct, test,
and deliver new transducers to work with the most sensitive bar detectors at
Stanford and Louisiana State Universities. This collaboration will enable those
receivers to reach new levels of sensitivity within the next three years.
