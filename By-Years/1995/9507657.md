This award will support planning for an environmental database which will
integrate a suite of computer application software to facilitate access to an
analytic laboratory database through a networked geographic information system
interface. Initial work will focus on data collected by the McMurdo Long-Term
Ecological Research project, a large environmental research project located in
the antarctic. Planning activities will include a goals/requirements definition
workshop. Additional development and workshop activities are contemplated to
transfer the results of the project to other Long-Term Ecological Research sites
and the community of environmental researchers in general.
