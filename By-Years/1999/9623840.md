Abstract IBN 96-23840 Brodie &amp; Maple Parental Effects on Offspring Fitness
The proposed research will demonstrate and describe the influence that
Dendrobates pumilio parents on their offspring s fitness through parental
behavior. Parents may influence their offpring s fitness directly by influencing
offspring survival, or indirectly by influencing offspring phenotypes. A
combination of field manipulations and natural controls will be used
simultaneously to obtain estimates of natural variation in parental behavior,
the direct and indirect effects of parental behavior on offspring fitness, and
the strength of selection acting on parental behavior through offspring fitness.
D. pumilio display a discreet form of bi-parental care in which males care for
the eggs until they hatch and females care for the tadpoles from hatching
through metamorphosis. This research will investigate the effects of distinct
male and female parental behaviors (manipulated and natural) on offspring
growth, development, and survival. In Project 1, the frequency of feeding events
and number of nutritional eggs provided per feeding event will be manipulated to
determine the effects of variation in these natural behaviors on offspring. In
Project 2, experimental manipulations in field enclosures will be used to
investigate the effects of parental behaviors including hydration, protection
from fungal infection, and defense against predators and parasitoids on egg
development and survival.
