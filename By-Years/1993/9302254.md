The Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON) will operate the R/V
PELICAN during 1993 as a general oceanographic vessel in support of NSF-funded
research projects. The PELICAN is a 105' general research vessel constructed and
operated by LUMCON. The vessel is scheduled for 228 operating days in 1993, of
which 49 days are in support of NSF-sponsored programs. The ship operates
primarily in the Gulf of Mexico. This vessel is part of a fleet used by the
National Science Foundation to support oceanographic research projects. Most
oceanographic research projects require highly specialized equipment and
extensive support from a ship's crew members. An increasing number of research
projects require equipment that must be permanently installed on a ship and for
which the ship must be specifically designed. Such equipment also requires
highly trained crew members for maintenance and operation. These vessels do not
operate in the same manner as general cargo or fishing vessels, and therefore,
NSF supports the operation of a variety of vessels specifically dedicated to
oceanographic research. These vessels are operated by universities and research
institutions around the country.
