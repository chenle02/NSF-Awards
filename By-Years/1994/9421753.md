9421753 R. Davis It is proposed to provide partial travel support to ten young
US researchers and to several invited speakers to an international symposium
focused on the theory and applications of hydrodynamic diffusion of suspended
particles. The meeting will be co-sponsored by the International Union of
Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (IUTAM). Hydrodynamic diffusion refer to the
fluctuating motion of particles which in a dispersion due to multiparticle
interactions. This phenomenon has received an increased attention in the last
decade. This is the first symposium dedicated entirely to this subject, with the
objective to review the current research, identify research trends and new areas
od relevance in applications. The participants are from different research
fields, such as rheology, fluidization, granular flow, and from a variety of
disciplines (physics, applied mathematics, chemical, mechanical and civil
engineering). ***
