0112193&lt;br/&gt;Atzmon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Symposium on
Metastable, Mechanically Alloyed and Nanocrystalline Materials (ISMANAM 2001)
will be held at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan, during 24-29
June 2001. Nanostructured materials (e.g., nanocrystals or nanoparticles) as
well as amorphous and other metastable materials will be covered. Both
fundamental issues and applications will be addressed. As a forum for novel
ideas, the symposium is intended to promote contact between basic research and
technological needs for industrial applications. The program will include
invited and keynote lectures by internationally distinguished scientists as well
as contributed papers, in either oral or poster presentations. The symposium
proceedings will be published in the journal "Materials Science Forum." The
symposium Web site (http://www.ners.engin.umich.edu/ISMANAM2001) has further
details about the symposium. &lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;Research on nanostructured
materials and amorphous and other metastable materials has increased as
opportunities arise for industrial applications of these unusual
materials.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
