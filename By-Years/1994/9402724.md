9402724 BARSNESS The goals of this dissertation project are to analyze the
nature of social and culture change, and the conditions that constrain and
promote these changes. The study, based on ethnographic and archival analysis,
focuses on alterations that have occurred during the past 50 years in the
Tlingit village of Hoonah, Alaska. It is proposed that these changes were the
results of events beyond village control as well as deliberate decisions by
village leaders. Furthermore, it is suggested that social change may be
deliberately created by members of a society as a means to generate political
power. The project will fill a major gap in our knowledge of contemporary Native
American social organization and contribute to anthropological knowledge of
cultural transformation. ***
