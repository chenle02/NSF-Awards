9314016 Reddy The research objective is to determine fundamental data on phase
stability in intermetallic aluminides, based on thermodynamic, mass transport,
and high temperature environmental properties. Alloy systems to be studied are
aluminides in the titanium-aluminum and niobium -aluminum alloy systems with and
without ternary additions. Solid-state galvanic cell measurements are employed
in the range of 600 to 1000 degrees Celsius to determine the activity, activity
coefficient, and Gibbs free energy of formation. The ternary additions are in
the range of 5 to 25 atom percent and include molybdenum, hafnium, and vanadium.
This research develops needed thermodynamic data for these potentially useful
alloys. %%% The aluminide systems are selected based on their unique structural
properties and practical significance. These high temperature intermetallic
alloys have significant potential for use in the aerospace and automobile
industries. ***
