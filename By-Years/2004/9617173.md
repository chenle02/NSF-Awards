Graham, James AST 96-17173 Dr. Graham will calibrate and apply infrared surface
brightness fluctuation measurements of galaxies as a cosmological distance
indicator. The observational part of the study will use a variety of telescopes
to calibrate the method on nearby galaxies and then observe distances two to
three times farther than before, as far as the Coma cluster. The theoretical
portion of the research will use stellar population models to investigate the
predicted behavior of infrared surface brightness fluctuations and to compare
them with observations.
