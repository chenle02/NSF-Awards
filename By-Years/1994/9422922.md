9422922 Peter Phillips Model choice, model simplification and the determination
of good models for prediction are all important elements in empirical
econometric research. When times series are nonstationary, an aspect of model
choice is how to model the nonstationarity of the data (e.g., stochastic trends
versus deterministic trends versus trend breaks). Although difficult this choice
has a substantial impact on the performance of out-of-sample forecasts and
forecast confidence sets. Furthermore, in practical business and financial
research we are sometimes faced with the need to model or predict large number
of series simultaneously. In such situations we need automated procedures for
model selection that can take account such critical aspects of a series as its
stationarity or lack thereof. The first of the three projects in this research
is concerned with the development and justification of such procedures for use
in the analysis of economic time series. The methods employed are Bayesian and
build on ideas on model determination, hypothesis testing, and forecasting in
the presence of non-stationarity that the PI has put forward in recent research.
The second project by the PI looks at kernel regression when the errors are
nonstationary. Although kernel regression theory is quite well developed in the
stationary time series case, there appears to be no theory for case of unit
roots or integrated processes. One problem with kernel regression in this case
is that estimators are often inconsistent. The research develops modified kernel
estimators that are consistent in the presence of nonstationarity both with and
without long memory. The third project is an extension of the PIs work on "fully
modified" VAR (FM-VAR) estimators. These estimators can take advantage of
potential cointegrating links between series without having to be explicit about
their form or dimension and without preliminary testing. This research extends
the previous work so as to allow for I(0), I(1) , and I(2) regressors
simultaneously in the same VAR. It proceeds without making any specific
assumptions about the degree of cointegration or the order of cointegration of
any of the regressors, and without pretesting of the cointegrating rank.
