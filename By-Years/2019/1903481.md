The goal of this study is to improve our understanding of the basic physics of
arc discharge plasmas. Plasma, often called the fourth state of matter, is an
ionized gas that is present in almost every aspect of everyday life; and an
electric arc discharge is one of the most basic plasma phenomena that are used
in industry and observed in nature. Examples of electric arcs include lightning,
spark plugs for combustion, plasma torches, arcjet facilities for supersonic and
hypersonic flows, and devices for nanomaterials synthesis. Depending on the
conditions of their generation and maintenance, arc discharge plasmas have a
wide range of properties and parameters, many of which remain poorly understood.
This study will be performed using both numerical simulations and state-of-the-
art laser diagnostics to expand the understanding of arc discharges. Training
the next generation of plasma scientists and engineers will be provided through
this project while awareness about plasma technologies and its importance will
be raised to local K-12 students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite its long history,
the conditions for local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) in atmospheric pressure
arc discharges are poorly understood due to limited experimental measurements of
plasmas in thermal equilibrium. Conventional probes and optical measurements
pose significant challenges since the arc core is a high temperature environment
with high intensity of radiation. The focus of this project is to investigate
the validity of the LTE assumption in an arc discharge operating in atmospheric
pressure. Specifically, the research objectives are to: (i) develop a
multidimensional nonequilibrium plasma model of a non-ablating nitrogen arc
plasma coupled with a radiative heat transfer model; (ii) establish theory and
analysis of the Coherent Rayleigh-Brillouin Scattering (CRBS) technique for
plasma flows; and (iii) validate the computational results against experiment
data, including the translational temperature obtained from CRBS and the
vibrational state of nitrogen obtained from Optical Emission
Spectroscopy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
