The PIs propose to add a state-of-the-art 95 GHz (3.2 mm wavelength) radar to
the Facility for Atmospheric Remote Sensing (FARS), which currently includes
three polarization lidars and a variety of passive sensors at their permanent
structure at the University of Utah. This scannable Doppler polarimetric radar
will yied the following cloud data quantities: radar reflectivitryu factors in
the V and H planes, and hence linear depolarization ratios and differential
reflectivities, and the measn and variance of radial cloud particle velocityu.
System sensitivity should permit cloud studies ranging from many fair weather
cumulus to high cirrus clouds. This radar will be integrated into the ongoing
Project FIRE studies of cirrus clouds to enhance the datasets and and provide
new insights into cirrus properties using the multiple remote sensor approach,
and particularly with regard to the Doppler measurement capabilities.
Measurements of supercooled altocumulus cloud layers will receive special
attention, and will serve as inputs for mixed-phase microphysical, radiative and
dynamical models to help answer basic questions about the growth and nucleation
of these layer clouds.
