This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project aims to develop
a manufacturing process to synthesize metal oxide, sulfide and other
nanoparticles. The subject method simply involves mixing of common dry chemical
starting materials and heating the resulting precursor material to a modest
temperature. The objective is to demonstrate feasibility and scalability of this
low-cost manufacturing process. Methods of dispersing aggregated particles in
aqueous and polar solvents will be also be
investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this project
will be the potential to offer a cost-effective and environmentally-friendly
process to produce a broad spectrum of high quality nanoparticles. Current
methods of making nanoparticles involve heavy energy consumption, large amounts
of waste, and/or purification problems. The synthetic approach in this project
has the potential to become the method of choice to supply novel nanoparticles
in many low to high technology applications. It is anticipated to obtain
nanoparticles with particle sizes less than 15 nm, size variations within
Â±10-20%, and purities as high as 99.9999%.
