9420174 Fasman Membrane proteins, such as receptors, ion channels, transport
channels, hormone receptors, etc. represent an important class of proteins.
Understanding their structure would reveal important aspects of their functional
role. However, crystallization of membrane proteins has proven to be difficult
and this has raised major stumbling blocks to obtaining their three-dimensional
structure. To date, the structures of only a few membrane proteins have been
determined by X-ray diffraction studies or by electron microscopy. The proposed
studies are to further develop a new approach for the crystallization of
membrane proteins by making them water soluble by conjugation to
methoxypolyethylene glycol (mPEG), a water soluble polymer. These conjugates
have already been formed with two membrane proteins, bacteriorhodopsin and porin
and have been found capable of refolding to their native structures. Preliminary
experiments have shown that one of these conjugates, mPEG porin, can be
crystallized, but the crystals are as yet too small for X-ray diffraction
studies. Research is proposed to further develop the method to a point where
useful crystals can be obtained routinely and to carry out X-ray diffraction
studies with one or more of these protein conjugates. ***
