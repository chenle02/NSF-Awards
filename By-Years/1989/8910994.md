This Research Initiation Award is for a study of stability problems in Cartesian
compliance control of robotic manipulators. Dr. Chung will extend his successful
technique for hexapod leg control to the domain of more general compliant
manipulators. The technique involves Jacobian analysis of force errors in joint
space to determine situations requiring torque feedback contradictory to an
overall force goal. A more general technique of stabilization using passive
compliance will also be studied.
