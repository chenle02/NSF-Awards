This workshop at Arizona State University brings together social scientists to
present research on immigration, its impact on transnational migration, diverse
populations and communities, and law and policy. Participants include twenty-
five U.S. and foreign scholars whose research interests reflect a variety of
disciplines (e.g., sociology, anthropology, economics, geography, public policy,
public health) and different contexts--from the U.S. to Europe to Africa.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants' research and discussion will address several
questions, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- What are the varied historical and
contemporary reasons for the movement of populations (refugees, laborers,
etc.)?&lt;br/&gt;-- What are the consequences of transnational migration for the
sending and receiving countries?&lt;br/&gt;-- What are the relationships between
and among immigration, refugee flows and race-based hate crimes including rape
and ethnic cleansing?&lt;br/&gt;-- How does immigration affect notions of
citizenship, identity and belonging?&lt;br/&gt;-- What factors explain
historical and contemporary legislative responses to immigrants and refugees? To
what extent can theories of racial threat and moral panics help explain these
responses?&lt;br/&gt;-- Are we witnessing new patterns in offending by and
victimization of immigrants (with particular attention to human trafficking,
victimization of day laborers, and victimization of immigrant women by violent
partners)?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators leading the conference will
produce a report that summarizes trends that emerged in findings reported and
identify promising agendas for future social science research.
