Kinetic theory concerns the dynamics of a large number of particles, such as
flows of air or water, plasmas, neutron transport, and radiation transfer. In
classical mechanics, such systems can be described under different scales. In
the microscopic scale, Newton's laws track the position and velocity of each
particle. In the macroscopic scale, fluid mechanics and thermodynamics provide
effective tools to predict the behaviors of averaged statistical properties like
pressure and temperature. Kinetic theory forms a bridge between these two
approaches and utilizes probabilistic tools in the position-velocity space, the
so-called phase space, to obtain a mesoscopic description. The probability
density of particles present in the phase space satisfies the Boltzmann equation
or the Landau equation, which are evolutionary partial differential equations.
This project focuses on the kinetic equations in bounded domains, where the
particles may be reflected or absorbed by the physical boundary. The purpose is
to develop novel mathematical tools to characterize the multi-scale behaviors of
these particle systems in applications such as medical imaging, fluid mechanics,
and nuclear fusion. The project provides opportunities for research training of
graduate students.

This project concentrates on the theory of hydrodynamic limits, a key step to
tackle the so-called "Hilbert's sixth Problem" to treat physics in an axiomatic
manner. The aim is to study the asymptotic behavior of kinetic equations when
the Knudsen number, which measures the relative distance a particle can travel
between two collisions, shrinks to zero. The focus is in justifying the validity
of asymptotic approximations of kinetic equations in the presence of boundary
layer effects, where the geometric correction of the boundary is non-negligible.
The investigator will develop new boundary layer decomposition, regularization,
and reflection extension techniques.
