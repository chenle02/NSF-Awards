This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program
entitled, "NUE NME Minor: Minor in Nanoscience and Molecular Engineering", at
the University of Washington (UW) under the direction of Dr. Rene M. Overney,
develops an undergraduate, discipline-tailored Minor in Nanoscience and
Molecular Engineering (NME Minor) for multiple departments within the University
of Washington's College of Engineering and College of Arts and Sciences. Through
the NME Minor undergraduate students enhance their education via a hands-on
introduction to diverse approaches towards nanoscale phenomena and molecular
engineering while remaining grounded in a major discipline.

The NUE NME Minor program is under the auspices of two UW centers-the
Genetically Engineering Materials Science and Engineering Center (GEMSEC, a NSF-
funded Materials Research Center, MRSEC) and the Center for Nanotechnology (CNT)
that provide additional resources and offer integration into national nano-
education frameworks through the 30 MRSEC Programs and the National
Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network (NNIN). The NME Minor program also builds
on ongoing efforts among UW, Edmonds Community College, and North Seattle
Community College to bridge the disconnect between educational developments in
nanotechnology at the community college and university levels.
