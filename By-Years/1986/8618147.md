This proposal builds upon prior support, which applied the theory of convex
projections to reconstruct or recover information from incomplete image data, to
develop new and robust image reconstruction/restoration algorithms of a class
useful in computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound
tomography. Three specific problem areas will be addressed: how to extend
earlier research on direct Fourier reconstruction in parallel-beam tomography to
the fan-beam case; how to develop optimum sampling strategies in magnetic
resonance imaging, especially when time constraints on data acquisition impose a
limited-view geometry; and how to develop robust computerized tomography
reconstruction algorithms that do not require a fixed projection geometry like
the parallel-beam or fan-beam configurations, yet allow reconstruction in a
reasonable amount of time. This work should yield significant advances in both
computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging that will prove useful in
medical applications and in industrial applications of nondestructive evaluation
and quality control.
