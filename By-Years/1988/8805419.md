The archaeological site of Beidha, located in Southern Jordan, was the focus of
eight seasons field research between 1958 and 1983. The low tell covers an area
of approximately 2935 square miles, and extensive excavations have uncovered
almost this entire area. Six main village levels have been identified and 70
structures examined. Radiocarbon dates indicate an occupation during the 8th and
7th millennia B.C., and this Neolithic site documents the early stages of the
transition to agriculture and herding in the Near East. Dr. Byrd participated in
the excavation and has access to the archaeological notes, field plans, and
artifacts. He will analyze these materials to examine changes in the
organizational structure and nature of activity areas during the long occupation
sequence. Analysis will include the orientation and arrangement of buildings,
circulation pathways, building size features and contents. This data set will
provide a unique opportunity to examine changes in community organization, in
household configuration and activities, and in production of specialization. The
Neolithic period in the Near East saw the rise of a social system which is
characteristic of complex societies such as our own. Through examination of this
process, archaeologists can gain insight into how complex societies which
characterize both developed and developing countries arise and are maintained.
