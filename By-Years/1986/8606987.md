A geotechnnical ressonant column cell capable of subjeccting cylindrical soil
specimens to longitudinal and torsional exictation is procured. The resonant
eolumn cell will be uused in conjunction with a conventional triaxial loading
system to provide a hybrid testing apparatus capable of static immposed loads
(confining pressure, axial compression and torsion), and dynamic longitudinal
and torsional loads. This hybrid system will permit studies of dynamic soil
properties under a wide range of stress amplitudes and under conditions of
stress induced anisotropy.
