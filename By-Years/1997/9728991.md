The Field Museum's Fossil Invertebrate Collection is recognized internationally
for its vast size and ongoing significance to research in systematics,
evolution, and paleoecology. The collection includes about 320,000 specimen lots
with as many as 2 million individual specimens. However, specimen overcrowding
has hampered efforts to realize the full potential of the collection.
Implementation of the project outlined in this proposal will result in a better
organized, less crowded, and more easily accessible collection. The project will
successfully address conservation issues, first by curating much of our backlog
holdings, and second by alleviating crowding of specimens. The taxonomic
division of this material and the integration of specimens into a
temporal/systematic framework is viewed as the most practical and scientifically
beneficial manner in which to treat it. This project outlines the reorganization
and move of the entire collection, and additional primary curation by staff and
visiting curators for type specimens, echinoderms and Paleozoic gastropods. The
recent move of paleobotanical collections to new facilities has provided
additional cabinet space more than sufficient for this need. The curation and
incorporation of the backlog material in collections will result in effectively
"new" specimens becoming available to the scientific community.
