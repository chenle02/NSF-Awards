9361617 Dichter The PIs will identify several areas in which pyrgeometer design
could be improved and will outline experiments to verify the enhanced
performance. The goal of the proposed program is an instrument that
significantly exceeds the minimum requirement of the BSRN network of 5% (or 10
W/m2) measurement error and is close to the WMO-defined performance level for a
secondary standard total solar pyranometer (1% measurement error). ***
