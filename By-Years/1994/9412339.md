9412339 Hansen The most common model used in applied econometrics to study the
properties of time series is the "unit root model." A multivariate
generalization of univariate unit roots which allows for common unit root
components is the model of cointegration. In most applications, testing for unit
roots or cointegration are viewed as useful preliminary steps in the building of
an empirical models. But in many cases, cointegration emerges as an implication
of an economic model and cointegration tests can be used to directly test the
model. Examples include studies of the life-cycle model, the present value model
of stock prices, real business cycle models, models of the term structure of
interest rates, a model of intertemporal consumption, and the long-run money
demand function. But unit root and cointegration tests can not be used for many
economic applications because they are not powerful enough to discriminate among
competing hypotheses given the typical number of observations available in
economic data. This project develops a method for increasing the power of unit
root and cointegration tests dramatically by using information that is ignored
by more conventional methods, generalizes this method to all cases, uses the
technique of local-to-unity asymptotics to investigate the adequacy of the
asymptotic approximations in finite samples, and reexamines the Nelson- Plosser
data set to see if the improved tests can shed light on the stochastic
properties of the series.
