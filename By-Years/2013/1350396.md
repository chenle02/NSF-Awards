An Abelian differential defines a flat metric on the underlying Riemann surface.
Varying the flat structure induces an action on moduli spaces of Abelian
differentials; this is called Teichmueller dynamics. A number of questions about
the geometry of Riemann surfaces boils down to the study of the orbits under
such dynamics. The proposed project aims to explore Teichmueller dynamics using
tools in algebraic geometry and to develop applications to the geometry of the
moduli space of Riemann surfaces. The ultimate goal is to establish a
correspondence between dynamical properties of these orbits and the intersection
theory of their closures in the moduli space. Moreover, the intersection
calculation can determine the cycle class of an orbit closure in the moduli
space, which in turn provides crucial information towards understanding the cone
of effective divisors, cone of curves, Chow ring structure, and birational
models for the moduli space. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic geometry and
dynamical systems are two important branches of modern mathematics. The former
uses algebraic (polynomial) equations to study geometrical structures, while the
latter applies analytical tools to describe the time dependence of a moving
point. Despite the fact they initially seem unrelated, the principal
investigator plans to explore their inner connections by constructing algebraic
equations to measure the behavior of Teichmueller dynamics. In a sense this is
analogous to introducing coordinates in Descartes geometry. The proposed project
also opens many avenues for student and postdoctoral research. The principal
investigator will continue to integrate his research with undergraduate,
graduate and post-graduate training as well as workshop organization. More
precisely, he plans to develop a student mathematics symposium, advise student
research projects, design new courses in algebraic geometry, create a junior
scholar visiting program, and organize a series of conferences and workshops
with a focus on students and young researchers.
