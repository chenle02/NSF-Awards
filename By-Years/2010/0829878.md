The aim of this research is to develop and refine general techniques for the
design of improved approximation algorithms for hard combinatorial optimization
problems. Such problems arise in many important application areas such as
telecommunications or transportation. The focus will be on the most challenging
problems that have resisted intense research for the last few decades. Some of
the tools that this research plans on both using and developing come from
polyhedral combinatorics, an area concerned with the study of polyhedra related
to combinatorial optimization structures. Linear programming approaches have
been much used in the design and analysis of approximation algorithms, but the
full power of polyhedral combinatorics has not been exploited yet. Remarkable
recent progress on connectivity problems highlights the potential of polyhedral
techniques. Many more such connections are waiting to be discovered, and this is
precisely the main goal of this research.
