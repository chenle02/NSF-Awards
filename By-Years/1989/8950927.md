With funds provided by this NSF-ILI grant and a local match, Sinclair Community
College has greatly expanded its undergraduate Organic Chemistry courses through
the purchase of a Varian EM360, Mhz NMR. This acquisition provides students with
hands-on experience in using the instrument and direct experience in identifying
the structure of products they synthesize. Organic Chemistry I has been modified
so that students are introduced to NMR theory during the last half of the fall
quarter. Introduction of the instrument in the laboratory coincides with the
theorectical lectures. Students verify the identity of their laboratory product
using IR and NMR spectroscopy. Students have access to the NMR during
approximately 15 laboratory exercises in three organic chemistry courses. The
institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
