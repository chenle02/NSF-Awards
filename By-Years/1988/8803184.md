Thin films of superconducting oxides containing copper will be prepared by
decomposing volatile metalorganic complexes. The films will be characterized and
compared with bulk materials. Attempts will be made to deposit the films on
perovskite and MgO substrates in order to ascertain if added stability could be
obtained by the use of such substrates. A second goal of the research will be
directed towards the utilization of an RF glow discharge to perform plasma-
assisted metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). Preliminary studies
have indicated that high quality aluminum oxide films can be produced on silicon
substrates at temperatures of 350 C by the decomposition and oxidation of
aluminum isopropoxide using an RF glow discharge.
