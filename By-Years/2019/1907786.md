Inequalities are a vital component of information theory and comprise one of the
most versatile mathematical tools in an information theorist's toolbox.
Breakthroughs in obtaining strong information inequalities have invariably led
to significant progress on longstanding open problems in information theory, and
in turn contribute to the advancement of computer science, probability theory,
and combinatorics. This project aims to advance the state-of-the-art knowledge
of information inequalities by identifying and addressing key gaps in the
existing literature. Being able to provide a better characterization of
information inequalities and narrowing existing gaps can greatly increase our
understanding of what is feasible in many computationally intractable problems
in computer science and mathematics. The project will also support the
educational goals of the investigator by training multiple graduate students
working at the interface of engineering and
mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project consists of a specific set of
research questions that will uncover novel theoretical aspects of information
inequalities and will lead to new mathematical strategies to establish novel
inequalities. The work will be divided into the following sub-projects, each
with a distinct set of research objectives: (1) Perform stability analyses of
fundamental information inequalities; (2) Develop a principled approach for
establishing new information inequalities by leveraging sub-additivity
properties in information theory; and (3) Explore applications of stability
results and proof strategies to areas beyond information theory, such as
probability, queuing theory, and combinatorics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
