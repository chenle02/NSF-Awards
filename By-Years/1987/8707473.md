By any standard, Vannevar Bush was one of the central figures of the twentieth
century. An aggressive, young electrical engineer who joined the staff of MIT in
1919, he rose through the ranks to become in 1932 the Institute's first vice-
president and dean of engineering. In 1939, he moved to Washington to assume the
presidency of the Carnegie Institution, one of the country's prestigious private
foundations and sources of support for basic science. However, the threat of war
quickly diverted his attention towards problems of a different sort; in short
order, Bush catapulted into the leadership of the drive to mobilize science and
engineering for the American war effort. The subsequent accomplishments of the
National Defense Research Committee and the Office of Scientific Research and
Development are well known, especially their managements of the projects that
led to improved radars, the proximity fuse, synthetic penicillin, and the atomic
bomb. These successes brought notoriety to the scientific community and
influence to Bush who played a key part in the public debates and legislative
battles that produced the Atomic Energy Commission and the National Science
Foundation. Specifically, Dr. Owens' examination of Vannevar Bush, concentrating
on the period 1940-1955, illuminates his life and career during this critical
period during which important connections between American engineering and the
"politics" of American science emerged and enables us to understand his
significance in the wider context of American History. Dr. Owens study will make
an important contribution to understanding the great contemporary dilemmas that
touch science, political power, national security, and the contribution of
technical expertise to social progress.
