The Keck Consortium in Geology proposes to recruit ten minority students each
year for inclusion in two of the Consortium's undergraduate field research
projects during 1993-94 and 1994-95. The students will have completed their
sophomore college year and will be supported on their home campus by an on-
campus faculty sponsor. The students will spend three to four weeks in the field
and one to two weeks writing and illustrating a final report covering their
field research project. The results of their effort will be reported in poster
session format at the annual Keck Research Symposium in Geology and published in
the Research Symposium Volume. One research project for 1993-94 will be located
in Quetico Provincial Park, Ontario and will deal with the Precambrian geology
along a terrane boundary. The second project will be in southern Vermont and
covers the glacial and hydrologic aspects of the Vermont Valley. The projects
1994-95 will be located in Quetico Provincial Park and in the region of Clark
Fork, Wyoming.
