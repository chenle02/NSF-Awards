*** 9604872 Thumm The scattering of positive atomic ions from metal surfaces is
studied theoretically using a novel technique, Weyl wavepackets, to include the
effect of the continuum levels on the transition probabilities. Applications of
the methodology to chemisorption and catalysis will be investigated. ***
