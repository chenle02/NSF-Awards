The research objective of this award is to develop efficient and effective
algorithms for sequential decision making problems when the input data of the
problems are unknown or uncertain at the beginning of the decision period.
Applications of this research are broad, including online routing problems,
online advertisement allocation problems, dynamic pricing problems in revenue
management, and various other online resource allocation problems in service
systems. If successful, decision tools that are developed in this research will
enable decision makers to better cope with uncertainty in practical problems by
absorbing, analyzing and utilizing data in an online fashion, which can be
viewed as a substantial step to meet the challenges presented by the era of big
data. Besides, this project also serves as a great educational opportunity.
Graduate students involved will benefit from the training provided by this
research. New graduate courses will be developed based on this project and
topics in the research will be incorporated in the Principal Investigator's
(PI's) teaching materials.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;To achieve the goals of this
research, the PI will develop decision rules that can simultaneously learn the
input data structure in the underlying problems as well as optimize the long
term objective value. Such decision rules are called learning-while-doing
algorithms, as it will balance two objectives, one is the exploration of the
underlying data structure (i.e., learning), and the other is the exploitation of
the structures that have been learned (i.e., doing). Theoretical performance
guarantees as well as practical implementation strategies will be derived from
this research. Specifically, the PI will (1) further study the design and theory
of learning-while-doing algorithms in different and more complex problem
settings as well as their robustness; (2) investigate implementation issues; and
(3) apply the algorithms to various important and practical problems. Among the
applications, the PI plans to integrate learning customer choice behavior into
revenue management problems, which will complement recent interest in such
models. The PI also plans to apply the method to problems in the management of
the smart grid, which is an emerging application of online decision making
problems. From the theoretical point of view, the study of the algorithms will
advance the understanding of the tradeoffs between learning and doing in such
problems, and the analysis will establish important connections between
optimization and probability, which will be of independent interest to the
research community.
