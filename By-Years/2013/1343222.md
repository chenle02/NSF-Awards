Existing spectrum-sharing paradigms have set clear boundaries between primary
and secondary networks. There is very limited node-level cooperation between
primary and secondary networks. This project develops a new and bold paradigm
that explores policy-based network cooperation as a new dimension for spectrum
sharing between primary and secondary networks. The benefits of this paradigm
are numerous, as it allows integrating resources from two networks. To move this
new paradigm from concept to reality, this project aims to (1) develop
fundamental understanding of policy-based cooperation through mathematical
models and optimization, (2) explore new achievable rate regions through the use
of advanced physical layer technologies, and (3) develop distributed
optimization algorithms that can offer performance approaching the theoretical
limits. For prototype, the project implements the policy-based cooperation on a
48-node testbed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project investigates a new paradigm
and technologies that enable more flexible and efficient sharing of the radio
spectrum. New mathematical models developed in this research will help gain
fundamental understanding of the benefits of the new paradigm. The use of
advanced physical layer technologies will further push the performance envelopes
of achievable rate regions. New textbooks will be developed and used in
classrooms at Virginia Tech and other universities. Special efforts to
broadening participation by female and underrepresented students are planned
through an on-going NSF REU site for cognitive radio communications and Virginia
Tech's participation in Pacesetters, a program organized by the National Center
for Women and Information Technology.
