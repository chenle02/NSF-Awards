The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry (IBO) program of the
Division of Chemistry, National Science Foundation, supports Dr. Hilary Godwin
(as PI)and Dr. Brian Hoffman (as co-PI) of the Department of Chemistry,
Northwestern University, and Dr. Kristin Bowman-James (as co-PI)of the
Department of Chemistry, University of Kansas, for the organization of the
Workshop "Frontiers of Inorganic Chemistry" to be held September 2001 at Copper
Mountain, Colorado. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Workshop will bring together
experts from the various sub-disciplines of Inorganic Chemistry and from the
various schools across the country to address (i) what questions remain to be
examined in the various fields of inorganic chemistry? (ii) what new frontiers
in Inorganic Chemistry will likely emerge and require exploration in the medium
to long term? (iii) how can inorganic chemistry help to fuel technological
advances? and (iv) how can inorganic chemistry best balance the desire for
specific scientific advances with the fundamental and ongoing needs for non-
directed basic research?. A report will be issued from the Workshop that will be
submitted to NSF and made available to the entire chemical community through the
web.
