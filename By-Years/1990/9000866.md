The objective of this work is the active involvement of undergraduate students
in atmospheric research at New Mexico Tech. Students will be selected from a
variety of colleges throughout the country as well as from New Mexico Tech. Many
of the research opportunities will be related to field experiments or otherwise
will make active use of Tech's collection of apparatus designed to measure
chemical, physical, or electrical properties of the atmosphere. Some of this
equipment may be operated at Langmuir Laboratoryfor Atmospheric Research,
located in the Magdalena Mountains west of Socorro. It is hoped that these
experiences will lead to more students selecting science as a program of study
and career.
