9504282 Bonahon Francis Bonahon studies low-dimensional topology and hyperbolic
geometry. One of the fundamental tools in these two fields has been the notion
of measured geodesic laminations. The space of measured geodesic laminations is
a certain completion of the space of simple closed curves on a surface. Bonahon
has developed a differential calculus on this space of measured geodesic
laminations and is applying his techniques to study 3-dimensional hyperbolic
manifolds. For instance, this has enabled him to analyze the degree of
differentiability by which the geometry of the convex core of a hyperbolic
3-manifold varies as a function of the hyperbolic metric. He is currently
working on the problem of classifying hyperbolic 3-dimensional manifolds up to
isometry. Many problems in topology, geometry and mathematical physics involve
the consideration of all simple closed curves on a surface. Here, a surface can
be something as simple as a plane from which we have removed a finite number of
points (to be thought of as obstacles); a simple closed curve is a curve in the
plane which avoids the obstacles, ends at the same point where it started, and
does not cut itself in between. The problem is to understand when it is possible
to deform one such curve into another without crossing the obstacles. This is
analogous to considering all possible ways to wrap a string around a certain
number of vertical pegs. To study these curves, it is useful to go one step
higher in abstraction by considering `generalized curves' which occur as limits
of curves. This is a typical process in mathematics, analogous to the one by
which, to understand all rational numbers (such as 2/3 or 47/23), one has to
consider all real numbers (such as pi or square root of 2). Bonahon is
developing a differential calculus on the space of generalized curves, analogous
to the classical calculus on the space of real numbers. This enables him to
compute derivatives for certain natu ral functions on the space of simple closed
curves and to obtain estimates on their variations. ***
