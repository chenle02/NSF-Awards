Inversion of surface displacement and strain data allow one to estimate the
geometry of the dislocation of slip on that surface. The PI will improve
geodetic inversions by: (1) computing more accurate Green's functions,
incorporating effects of elastic heterogeneity, and (2) simultaneously inverting
for the geometry of the dislocation surface and the spatially varying slip,
allowing for correlations amongst these parameters.
