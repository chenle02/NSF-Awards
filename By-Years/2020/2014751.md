This award will support approximately 25 students to attend 2020 International
Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA) to be located in San
Diego, CA, USA from February 22 - 26, 2020. HPCA is widely recognized as one of
the top-tier conferences in the field of Computer Architecture and has attendees
from academia, both students and faculty, and from the industry. Students who
attend the conference will be exposed to intellectually stimulating research by
attending the many talks, panels, keynotes, and poster presentations at the
conference.

Students receiving travel grants through this award will learn the importance of
good communication skills as well as learn about what it takes to conduct high
quality research, through interactions with speakers, faculty, and peer student
groups. The award also seeks to enhance the diversity of the attendees, thus
maintain a balance between underrepresented and other groups among the
participants supported from the grant.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
