Technical abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores the dynamics of
nanomaterials, employing atomic-scale spatial resolution, femtosecond temporal
resolution x-ray techniques to answer a fundamental question: How do the
dynamics of nanoscale materials differ from that of bulk materials? Snapshots of
nanoscale phase transitions will be captured as these processes occur, providing
a new window into the ultrafast atomic-scale rearrangements that fundamentally
determine the efficiency, stability, and speed of functional devices. These
experiments will elucidate the rules that govern nanoscale phase transitions in
real time and lead to new ways of controlling these processes at the atomic-
scale. An integrated educational outreach program involving visits to a nearby
middle school will be carried out, in which students will be exposed to the
results of this work through demonstrations meant to motivate and develop
excitement about nanotechnology and science in
general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project investigates how nanosized systems transform, using the equivalent of
stop-action photography to visualize the pathways that nanoscale materials
follow. Novel experimental techniques enabling atomic-scale resolution, real-
time measurements are used to capture the first steps in processes fundamental
to the efficiency and speed of technologically relevant devices. The output of
this program will be a basic understanding that will potentially enable the
engineering of new materials with unique and technologically useful properties.
An integrated outreach program will be carried out as part of this project, in
which the results of this work will be presented in a non-technical manner to
students at an economically-disadvantaged middle school, with the goal of
developing student interest in science.
