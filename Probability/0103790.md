Probability models from statistical mechanics are a framework for studying how
small-scale randomness produces global-scale phenomena, such as phase
transitions, which are essentially nonrandom. Alexander proposes to investigate
the following aspects of the subject. (1) The Ising model conditioned, by fixing
an excess of the minority spin, so as to exhibit the formation of a large
droplet, with emphasis on the critical size of this excess and the discrepancy
between the actual and ideal shape of this droplet. (2) Percolation models also
conditioned to exhibit the formation of a large droplet, with emphasis on lower
bounds for the local fluctuations of the boundary. (3) Mixing properties and
decay of correlations and connectivities for spin systems and percolation
models, particularly in finite volumes. (4) The spectral gap and rate of
convergence to equilibrium, for the stochastic Ising model at low temperature.
(5) Potts models in which the external field(s) and the boundary condition are
opposed to each other. (6) The use of percolation ideas to create a model which
mimics certain features of the freezing of water which contains impurities. The
project aids human resource development through the support of one Ph.D. student
working on similar problems.

This work is part of an ongoing effort by mathematicians and physicists to
understand various systems in the natural world in which nonrandom global-scale
phenomena reflect aspects of small-scale randomness. Examples include (i)
magnetic properties of materials; (ii) waves traveling through irregular
materials, such as seismic waves through the earth's crust; (iii) impurities in
semiconductors; (iv) composite materials with special properties; and (v)
percolation of liquid through a porous material, such as water or oil through
underground rock. It has long been understood that many qualitative aspects of
the relation between small-scale randomness and macroscopic properties,
including critical phenomena, do not depend too closely on the particular system
being studied. One can therefore gain insight into real-world phenomena by
studying abstract systems not intended to model specifically magnets, or porous
rock, or any other particular part of the physical world. The systems need only
exhibit parallel features, such as clustering and critical phenomena. The
systems which Alexander will investigate--percolation, random cluster models,
Ising and Potts models, and other spin systems--are examples of such abstract
systems.
