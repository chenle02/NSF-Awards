The brain has pathways of nerve fibers that run between cell groups, to carry
information in a code, since the signal itself is simply the firing pattern of
individual nerve fibers. Two major kinds of coding have been proposed. One
proposes that each fiber from a sensory organ carries a certain kind of
information alone, so that for example a class of fibers from the tongue are
active only when there is a sweet substance but not when there is a sour one;
this coding is called a "labelled line." The other proposes that the brain takes
in the varied pattern of activity from a whole group of fibers, where each one
has a somewhat different response to a whole range of stimuli, and determines
from the overall pattern that one taste, for example, is "more sweet" while
another is "more sour"; this coding is called the "across-unit pattern." This
proposal uses a novel exploratory approach of artificial stimulation in the
taste pathway to try to mimic the sensory activity. Stimulation to mimic the
neural responses to sugar taste will be paired to licking of plain water by the
animal, and the animal will be conditioned to avoid that experience. If the
behavioral taste aversion is transferred to cause avoidance of naturally licking
other sweet substances, then this technique will be validated as an important
way to study what features of spatially and temporally distributed patterns of
input are important for the brain to act on in producing relevant behavior.
Results will be important to virtually all sensory systems, and to
bioengineering/computational models as well, because of the active interest in
how labelled lines or parallel processing work in distributed systems.
