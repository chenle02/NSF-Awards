This action funds an NSF National Plant Genome Initiative Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Biology for FY 2014. The fellowship supports a research and
training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to
broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan
for this fellowship to John T. Lovell is "Determining the genomic basis of
heterosis and apomixis in Panicum grasses". The host institution for the
fellowship is the University of Texas, Austin and the sponsoring scientist is
Dr. Thomas Juenger with collaborators Drs. Dan Rohksar (DOE Joint Genome
Institute), Jeremy Schmutz (HudsonAlpha Biotechnology) and Timothy Sharbel (IPK-
Gatersleben, Germany).

Training objectives include bioinformatics, quantitative genetics and
physiology. Broader impacts include the development of undergraduate mentoring
programs and the inclusion of underrepresented groups.

To meet the future needs of a growing population, the efficiency of both food
and biofuel production must be improved. One widely successful mechanism to
accomplish this goal is hybrid breeding. Researchers have greatly improved yield
in maize, canola and many other food crops by taking advantage of increased
growth and reproduction of hybrid offspring (heterosis). However, these
successes have not been realized in switchgrass and other lingo-cellulose
biofuel crops despite evidence of high levels of heterosis. Research conducted
through the tenure of this fellowship will provide a framework to achieve hybrid
breeding goals in switchgrass by addressing two objectives: 1) to determine the
genetic basis of heterosis in switchgrass and related species using genomic
tools, and 2) to assess the feasibility to fixing heterosis across generations
through the induction of asexual seed production (apomixis).
