A novel surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensor/filter device based on the "pass" and
"stop" frequency bands of phononic lattices is proposed. The device uses the
piezoelectric properties of the ZnO material system, in order to achieve the
generation/detection, and propagation of acoustic waves through phononic
lattices on a planar integrated device. The work will explore the properties of
such device, explore the concept of acoustic wave propagation through phononic
lattices experimentally, and the practical capabilities of&lt;br/&gt;phononic
lattices for ultra-high frequency filter applications and biomedical sensor
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This proposal addresses
the development of a novel SAW type device that is capable of exploring
experimentally the properties of a class of artificially made lattices, the
phononic lattices. Furthermore, it provides a functional device capable of
ultra-high frequency response suitable for developing secure mobile
communication systems and high performance acoustic, gas, and bio-immunosensors.
Due to the novelty and potential applications of the device intellectual merit
is considered very high.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This device will
revolutionize wireless and mobile communication systems as it can achieve ultra-
high frequency band pass filters, and furthermore, this capability of
substantially higher operational frequencies will lead to the development of
sensors with much higher selectivity and detectivity, such as those currently
using quartz microbalance for immunosensing, with tremendous implications on the
detection of pathogens and other bio-hazards.&lt;br/&gt;
