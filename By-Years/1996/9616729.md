Cohen, Judith AST 96-16729 Dr. Cohen will analyze existent spectroscopic data
sets from the Keck telescope. These include observations of about 200 globular
clusters around M87. The study will derive the abundances and kinematics of the
M87 globular system and further the knowledge of the rotation, metallicity and
velocity dispersion of the M87 halo.
