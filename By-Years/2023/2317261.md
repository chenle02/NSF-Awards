Advances in research on magnetism and magnetic materials are occurring in
geophysics, geochemistry, nanoscience, condensed-matter physics, and to a great
extent, along the boundaries between these fields. An interdisciplinary
discussion of critical developments in the applications of fine particle
magnetism in the geosciences, as well as their fundamental physical foundations,
will help to advance our understanding of Earth's surface environment, tectonic
history, and its deep interior dynamics. This award supports the Conference on
Rock Magnetism and its Applications, June 5-8, 2023 in Minneapolis, MN,
continuing a biennial series of conferences started in 1992.

The broad goal of the Summer Conference series is to bring together present and
future leaders in the field for in-depth discussion of fundamental aspects of
rock and mineral magnetism, and applications in global geophysics, tectonics,
extraterrestrial magnetism, and surficial environmental studies; these
discussions are intended to be more intensive, interactive and sustained. One
explicit aim of the 2023 conference is to explore iron cycling through time and
a leading expert on the biogeochemistry iron cycle will be invited as a keynote
speaker and participant. Another key objective is to discuss grand challenges in
paleogeography and tectonics. Students and early career researchers will be
supported to attend the meeting. A session is planned to discuss increasing
diversity in the US paleomagnetism and rock magnetism community.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
