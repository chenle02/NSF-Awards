Infectious diseases such as the medieval Black Death (plague), 20th-century
Ebola, and SARS-CoV-2 have shaped patterns of human mortality past and present.
This project advances our understanding of human infectious diseases and their
impact on human populations and societies. The investigators bring together
bioarchaeological, genetic, and paleoepidemiological expertise to examine a
prehistoric settlement where signs of epidemic disease and catastrophic
mortality have been detected. The project can advance knowledge of how deadly
infectious diseases have behaved and evolved in human populations and broadens
the comparative context for modern-day research on disease prediction,
prevention, and control. The project also supports student training and
mentoring in STEM, public science outreach efforts, and international scientific
collaborations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers reconstruct health and
mortality profiles in addition to estimating demographic information and
pathological indicators. Mortality patterns are compared to those of other known
deadly infectious diseases, especially the Black Death, during which the elderly
and frail individuals of all ages were disproportionately killed. In addition,
bone and tooth samples are collected for genetic analysis using state-of-the-art
techniques to identify the pathogen that caused the catastrophic mortality. With
a pathogen identification the investigators can examine geographic and temporal
variation in the mortality patterns it produced. The project data can generate
models available to researchers interested in further analyses of genetic and
environmental factors influencing human health and disease in past
populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
