ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Looking Forward --Scaling Up the Digital Image
Archive of Landscape Change&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is phase two of work begun
under an earlier award. Geologic archives of landscape response to climate
change and human impact (pond and alluvial fan sediments) are the subjects of
this project. The first phase demonstrated the feasibility of the project, the
high level of interest in the high school community, and the value of the
resulting image bank to a variety of constituencies. Phase two of the pilot
project continues to bridge gaps both between university research and high-
school education and between history and science. The program connects high-
school students and teachers, University of Vermont faculty, staff, and
students, museum curators, town officials and librarians, and the Education
Specialist for the Perkins Geology Museum at the University of Vermont.
Townspeople work with each student to find at least two historic photographs
clearly showing human/landscape interaction and assist the students as they
attempt to relocate the place from which each photo was taken. Students and
townspeople submit their work over the web using templates developed under this
funding project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
