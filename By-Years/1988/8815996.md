With the recent dramatic increase in available computing power, numerical
optimization has become an attractive tool for the design of complex engineering
systems. However, use of these techniques in design has been hindered by (i) the
difficulty to translate in a faithful manner the actual design problem into
mathematical optimization problem, (ii) the inability of classical optimization
tools to efficiently take into account the many distinctive features of
optimization problems arising in a design context, and (iii) the unavailability
of software tools offering to the designer a powerful as well as congenial
environment supporting such capabilities. The investigators seek an
optimization-based design methodology that accommodates the inherent trade-off
driven character of most design problems. This methodology calls extensively
upon the designer's knowledge and experience and emphasizes man-machine
interaction.
