This is an EAGER proposal to support 2 graduate students in research which
responds to an immediate need concerning critical questions focused on
transferring, managing, and the organizational issues of large digital datasets.
The basis of the project capitalizes on a very important event: The Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) scientific dataset is being transferred from one
repository to two others, from a national laboratory to a university library and
also to a university-based group of astronomers - from one kind of workforce to
two others. This is a pivotal moment to study in the organization of digital
knowledge in astronomy and how that knowledge will be developed.

The transfer of the database between the three workforces, although highly
planned, will face multiple strategic difficulties that will require members of
all workforces to develop a new form of knowledge at the interface of their
different practices. Those who become adept at this interface of knowledge and
data transfer will possess knowledge crucial to the designers of data
repositories and those who make use of them. Understanding changes,
organizational structures, identifying differences and managing cultural and
technical issues can be extremely informative to proposed approaches in the
cross-disciplinary/cross-workforce science of the future.
