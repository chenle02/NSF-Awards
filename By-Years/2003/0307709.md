The Yellowstone Park Foundation will work over four years to develop, evaluate
and install exhibits and integrated educational programs for a state-of-the-art
visitor education center at Old Faithful Geyser, Yellowstone National Park. This
facility will help the nearly 2.6 million on-site annual visitors and the tens
of millions of on-line visitors understand and appreciate the most significant
display of geysers and hot springs on Earth and the unique microbial life forms
that live in these thermal waters. The exhibits and programs will focus on
current and emerging research critical to understanding issues and solving
environmental problems facing society today. Visitors and distance learners will
understand why research on Yellowstone's hot springs has spurred advances in
various scientific and technological fields, and how the natural processes
occurring there affect their everyday lives.

In addition to the various scientific perspectives presented, the ideas about
Yellowstone held by early explorers and visitors, artists and Native Americans
will help make the exhibits and related programs relevant to a broader audience.
The exhibits and audiovisual media will be multi-lingual, using the most
appropriate current technology to present information in the four major non-
English languages spoken by Yellowstone visitors. A special emphasis will be
placed on the development of curriculum-based activities that serve school
groups from the tri-state area surrounding the park, including virtual field
trips for students.
