Current methods for determining the slip vector or sense of shear for brittle
fault zones of any age or seismic capability are largely based on the
orientation of striations. Brittle fault zones lacking striations are difficult
or impossible to analyze kinematically by these methods. The primary objective
of this research is to test the general applicability of a new, symmetry-based
method for stereographically and statistically determining the synoptic slip
vector in non-striated fault zones. The model will be tested by measuring and
analyzing Riedel structures and folds developed in the basal, gouge-filled shear
zones of several Cenozoic to Recent landslides or rock avalanches in the
southwestern US where the slip vector is known. Results will help validate a new
method for determining slip directions in unstriated brittle faults which are
common in nature.
