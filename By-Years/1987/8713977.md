National interest is being directed toward the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)
that was proclaimed by President Reagan in 1983. This vast area of the ocean is
essentially unexplored because the technology and the financial resources needed
are not available. Extensive research is needed to develop the knowledge base
required for technology development suitable to this difficult environment. The
workshop proposed in this application is planned as a continuation of an earlier
conference which brought together a group of scientists and engineers
knowledgeable of the technological needs in the ocean environment. The San Diego
Workshop will continue the planning and result in the development of a research
agenda that can serve as guidelines for future research funding in ocean systems
engineering.
