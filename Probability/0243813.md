0243813 Talagrand Mean field models for spin glasses (such as the famous
Sherrington Kirkpatrick model) exhibit some completely new phenomenon of
probability theory, that at a high level can be described as the existence of
intricate structures among the near extreme values of large families of
correlated random variables. The rigorous study of these models is still in its
infancy, and the main goal of this proposal is to pursue it. Two of the specific
goals are to obtain a better understanding of the low-temperature phase of the
p-spin interaction model, and to start the study of the new Hamiltonians
introduced by F. Guerra in his broken replica-symmetry bound for the Sherrington
Kirkpatrick model. One of the central themes of probability theory is the
emergence of a kind of order out of large number of random events. This is
expressed by classical theorems, such as the law of large numbers. These
classical results relate to situations where the random events are independent,
that is, the outcome of one does not influence the outcome of the others. Such
an assumption is unrealistic in practice. We investigate the emergence of new
types of collective behavior in large collections of random events, where each
event can, and will, influence the outcome of the others. The specific
mathematical models have been motivated by the behavior of magnetized particles,
and are known as "spin glasses".
