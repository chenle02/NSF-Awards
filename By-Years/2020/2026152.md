The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop fetal heart rate monitoring
technology as part of the wearable fitness technology market, empowering women
and clinicians to manage maternal health during pregnancy. The proposed system
can disrupt the traditional fetal monitoring methods as the only wireless
solution enabling real-time, continuous monitoring when a pregnant woman is
exercising. This technology will potentially improve the quality of health and
wellness of women and their babies during pregnancy, having the potential to
offer new evidence-based guidance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the technical challenge of
developing a wearable fetal monitoring device for pregnant women, specifically
tailored for use during exercise. The project will use dry electrodes designed
to minimize motion artifacts and improve the quality of the recorded signal,
embedded in an abdominal compression garment for ease of use and comfort. The
project will also develop machine learning algorithms to separate the confounded
maternal and fetal electrocardiogram (ECG) signals and movement artifacts. The
project objectives include: (1) optimize spatial density of sensors for accurate
measurements; (2) identify the best sensor-incorporating smart clothing design
based on functionality; (3) develop and refine signal processing algorithms for
accurate filtering and data analysis; and (4)validate the performance of the
resulting prototype for accurate fetal monitoring during
exercise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
