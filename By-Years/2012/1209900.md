This action funds Tanya Gordonov of University of Maryland, College Park to
conduct a research project, entitled "Controlling genes with electricity,"
during the summer of 2012 at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. The
host scientist is Dr. Matthew Wook Chang.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is in developing a way to control
genes with electric signals. This will introduce a new way to control cells much
more precisely than presently possible. Possible applications include studying
otherwise intractable genetic problems that need novel treatments and solutions
and creating cells that can better produce biofuels, act as sensors, clean up
oil spills, and help in the treatment of diseases.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
