The overall goal of the Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation
(LSAMP) program is to assist universities and colleges in diversifying the
nation's science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by
increasing the number of STEM baccalaureate and graduate degrees awarded to
persons from LSAMP populations. LSAMP populations are defined as persons from
groups underrepresented in the STEM enterprise: Blacks and African-Americans,
Hispanic and Latino Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native
Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders.

Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech), a member of the Peach State
Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (PSLSAMP), led by the
University of Georgia (UGA), will host the alliance's second Bridge to the
Doctorate (BD) cohort for the 2023-2025 academic years. The cohort will consist
of 12 LSAMP alumni pursuing STEM graduate degrees at the institution.

The BD program at Georgia Tech creates a campus-based ecosystem that supports
students financially, intellectually and socially while helping them develop the
networks and social capital to succeed in future academic and professional
careers. Using a multi-tiered (circular) recruitment and retention strategy, BD
trainees will engage in a variety of activities sponsored by the Center for
Engineering Education and Diversity (CEED) and other STEM departments to achieve
success in STEM graduate degree completion.

The outcome of the BD program implementation contributes to increased diversity
in STEM graduate education and the workforce in STEM research and research-
related careers in the nation.
