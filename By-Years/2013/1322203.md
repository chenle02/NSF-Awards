This ethnographic study will examine scientific and ethical practices involved
in caring for and rehabilitating of animals in zoological facilities in the
United States. It will employ participant observation, in-depth interviews, and
archival research to explore how ideas about care and rehabilitation - including
which animals can be sheltered and how best to determine and meet their needs -
shape human-animal interactions and how these ideas and interactions have
changed over time. Ethnographic research will take place in three private, non-
profit zoological facilities.

This project will build on a growing body of work on multispecies ethnographies
in anthropology and in other disciplines that seeks to illuminate how human-
animal interactions in a range of scientific and applied contexts shape human
understandings of animals and multispecies relationships.

This project will contribute to the training of a graduate student in
anthropology. In addition, the resulting Ph.D. dissertation, articles, and
public presentations will inform a deeper understanding of the ethics of animal
treatment in contemporary US society.
