This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in plant genetics
involves the research group of David B. Stern, the Boyce Thompson Institute For
Plant Research, Cornell University, and the research laboratory of Francis-Andre
Wollman, Institut de Biologie Physico-Chimique at the French National Center for
Scientific Research in Paris, France. The award provides travel support and
subsistence to Dr. Stern, his postdoctoral researchers, and graduate students.
The objective of the research is to characterize the regulation of chloroplast
gene expression in unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardii. The project
takes advantage of French expertise in characterization and provides access to
specialized equipment for the fluorescence analysis of mutants. It will advance
understanding of chloroplast gene expression.
