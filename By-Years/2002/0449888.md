In this CAREER award, experimental petrology techniques will be used to explore
the dynamic chemical environments of magma chambers and volcanic conduits
through studies of mass transport, reaction kinetics, and phase transformations.
Crystallization of hydrous silicate melt at magma reservoir and conduit
conditions will (1) monitor the evolution of the sizes, quantities, and shapes
of crystal populations during decompression from magma chamber conditions, (2)
address the crucial and persistent problem of nucleation phenomena, and (3)
determine the mechanisms and rates of crystal growth, particularly at small
cooling-driven and devolatilization-driven supersaturation. A key feature of
these studies is the combination of experimental work with frontier analytical
techniques in transmission electron microscopy and electron backscatter
diffraction. The research is expected to rigorously test quantitative models of
crystal size distribution evolution in closed systems and make a fundamental
contribution toward deciphering magma transport history from the crystal
textures of erupted rocks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the
proposed studies center around an integrated plan for scientific research and
human resource development. A research experience program for K-12 teachers in
volcano-petrology (RET/V-P) will provide an opportunity for teachers to
participate in research activities with undergraduates and graduate students for
six weeks during the summer. The goal is to achieve a collaborative lab group
wherein undergraduate students pursue senior thesis research projects, graduate
students gain leadership experience mentoring the undergraduates and teachers,
teachers deepen their confidence and mastery of science content, and the
ensemble benefits from exposure to different learning perspectives.
