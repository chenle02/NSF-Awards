9610022 Grigoriu A new method for analysis of solid mechanics problems, termed
the Random Walk Method (RWM), is developed. This method is a local method in
that it provides the response at a discrete location without having to solve the
governing equations over the entire domain. The response at a discrete location
is then extracted from this field solution. The advantages of the method lie in
that it is simple to use, always stable, accurate, and ideal for parallel
computations. The method is applicable to both deterministic problems as well as
problems with random material properties, boundaries, and boundary conditions.
