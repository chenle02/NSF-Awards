Mobile computing has been an indispensable part of modern life. However, diverse
manufacturing limits make current mobile devices far from ideal for being used
anytime, anywhere. Traditional solutions design individual mobile devices for
different application scenarios by exploring tradeoffs among the various design
perspectives, but cannot scale to the increasing complexity and performance
requirements of future mobile applications. Instead, the vision of this project
is Interconnected Mobile Computing (IMC), which fully interconnects multiple
mobile devices owned by the same user via wireless networks and allows these
devices to complement each other via cooperative resource sharing. IMC aims to
fundamentally remove the physical boundary between mobile devices and hence
augment the mobile computing capability provided to the user. The success of
this research could fully unleash the potential of heterogeneous mobile devices
and allow insertion of highly pervasive and cognitive mobile applications into
every aspect of human life. The results from this research are likely to foster
new research directions on mobile computing and benefit a broader scope of
cyber-physical systems such as industry control, remote sensing and connected
healthcare. The project will actively apply the research results into
development of undergraduate curriculum, engage under-represented students into
research, and exploit the research outcomes for K-12 educational and outreach
programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project intends to develop key enabling
technologies in wireless networks and mobile systems that ensure the efficiency,
adaptability and generality of IMC. More specifically, this project consists of
three closely intertwined research thrusts: (i) reducing the wireless
transmission latency of resource sharing between mobile devices by designing an
extra wireless communication channel that dedicates to IMC; ii) ensuring
adaptability of resource sharing to various network and system dynamics by
designing distributed network algorithms for resource sharing decisions; and
iii) systematically supporting generic resource access between remote mobile
systems via development of new mobile OS interfaces. The proposed technical
designs will be implemented and evaluated over a medium-scale mobile testbed of
software-defined radios and off-the-shelf mobile devices, and will also be
validated by large-scale trace-based emulation.
