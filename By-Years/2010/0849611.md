This project provides scholarships and support for students in 26 STEM majors
within associate degree programs in order to increase the number of academically
talented students earning degrees and pursuing careers in areas that are
designated as national and state priorities for education. In meeting the need
for an increased STEM workforce, the project functions to 1) provide up to 33
scholarships each year for financially disadvantaged students, including those
from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups; 2) provide the support needed
for successful associate degree completion; 3) provide transfer assistance to a
STEM degree program in a four-year institution; and to 4) provide job placement
assistance. Scholarship recipients receive ongoing academic assistance through
regular meetings with faculty advisors, and peer mentoring and tutoring through
an academic support center. Students explore careers through internships,
meetings with industry representatives, touring of local businesses, and
attending career fairs and academic and industry conferences. The program also
features a mandatory one-credit course, taught by the S-STEM project team, which
emphasizes real-world applications and fosters understanding of the importance
of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary work in STEM fields.
