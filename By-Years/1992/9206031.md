The principal investigator will study phase transitions in rock- forming
minerals. Specifically, he will document the effects of impurity content and
strain fields on the transformation process in order to establish the behavior
of impure and defective crystals at high temperature, utilizing transmission
microscopic, single- crystal and powder X-ray diffraction, impedence, and
calorimetric techniques. In general he hopes to better understand the mechanisms
that drive spontaneous structural distortions that occur in Earth materials at
elevated critical termperatures.
