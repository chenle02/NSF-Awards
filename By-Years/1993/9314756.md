9314756 Nerem This conference will focus on recent advances in Tissue
Engineering. It will be held concurrently with a conference on "Biology of
Physicochemical Interactions at the Cell Surface". In addition to the opening
keynote address, these two conferences will have three other joint sessions
focusing on basic principles. The first of these will explore how cellular
interactions and extracellular matrix influences cell function and tissue
modeling: the second, on biomaterials, will discuss currently available methods
for fabricating artificial tissue scaffoldings and new approaches for
synthesizing novel attachment substrates using biological molecules; and the
third will focus on concepts in the regulation of biological activity by
mechanical stresses. In addition, there will be a series of five sessions
directed towards recent experiences in the development of organ-specific tissue-
engineered biological substitutes. ***
