Research in structural optimization has grown considerably in recent years, in
part due to the emergence of powerful supercomputers. However, structural
practitioners have achieved uneven success in obtaining optimal design parameter
for large- scale structures. The purpose of the proposed research effort would
be to develop efficient and reliable iterative procedures for minimum-weight
design of large structures subject to multianalysis-type constrains (e.g.,
displacements, stresses, natural frequencies, and elastic stability).
Developments in numerical methods would be carefully reviewer to select the best
procedures to initiate, promote and accelerate convergence of optimal values for
structural design parameters. The procedures would be organized into structured
computer programs to permit periodic updates and enhancements. The validity of
the proposed procedures would be checked against data available in the open
literature and data generated in the course of a limited program of proposed
experimental work. The focus of the effort would be to suggest efficient design
procedures for structural practitioners. A three-year research project is
proposed.
