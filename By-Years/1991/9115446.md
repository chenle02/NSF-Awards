This award supports research by one of the leading observers in the field of
observational cosmology on questions of the distribution and evolution of
galaxies, and the origin of radio galaxies. Investigations of the mechanisms
responsible for the more rapid evolution of galaxies in rich environments will
be carried out, and the relation between radio galaxies and their surroundings
will be probed. In a related effort, the distribution of galaxies on very large
scales will be studied.
