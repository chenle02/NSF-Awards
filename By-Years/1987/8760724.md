Electron loss spectroscopy for vibrational analysis is an established technique
best suited for adsorbates on polished metallic surfaces. A departure from the
standard instrumentation will allow vibrational measurements on practical
surfaces such as rough metallic oxides. The technique derives increased
sensitivity and vibrational resolution from using low energy electrons in a way
which maximizes the interaction cross section and the collection efficiency for
loss electrons. Estimation of the sensitivity increase is difficult because the
cross sections at low energy are not well known, however, at least an order of
magnitude is expected from the increased collection efficiency. The technique is
ideally suited for time resolved vibrational analysis on practical surfaces
which cannot at present be done.
