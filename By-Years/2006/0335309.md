0335309&lt;br/&gt;Avrutsky&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose to study
waveguide formation in high energy He ion-implanted barium borate (BBO). This
material is known to be the best choice for generation of entangled photons
through spontaneous parametric down-conversion. Our technology will become a
basis for creating an integrated optical source of entangled photons. Such
sources will find applications in the new field of quantum information, which
includes quantum cryptography, quantum computing, quantum teleportation, and
quantum dense coding. All currently available schemes for the generation of
entangled photons use bulk nonlinear crystals. Availability of BBO waveguides is
expected to enable development of robust and efficient integrated optical
devices.&lt;br/&gt;
