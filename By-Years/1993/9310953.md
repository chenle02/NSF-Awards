In response to a petition made to the National Research Council's Committee on
Atmospheric Chemistry to establish an institution aimed at recent or expectant
Ph.D. recipients on the threshold of independent research careers in atmospheric
chemistry, the PIs have organized the second in a series of colloquia designed
to introduce these young scientists and their thesis and/or post doctoral
research to one another and to representatives of the major funding agencies
involved in atmospheric chemistry and closely related topics. The PIs have
organized a meeting to be held at Harvard in Cambridge, 18-19 June 1993 in
conjunction with the 1993 Gordon Research Conference on Atmospheric Chemistry to
be held in Newport, RI 21-25 June 1993. In addition to the young scientists,
representatives from NSF, NOAA, NASA and DOE will participate in this
colloquium.
