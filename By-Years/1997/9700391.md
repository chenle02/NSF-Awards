One focus of this research is the development of new methods for the solid-phase
synthesis of glycosylated ribonuclease A using an engineered subtilisin and
glycosyltransferase as catalysts. The second focus is the development of simple
and conformationally constrained mimetics of sialyl Lewis X, a tetrasaccharide
ligand binding to E- and P-selectin during inflammatory reactions and
metastasis, with improved stability toward enzymatic hydrolysis and higher
affinity than the parent ligand for the receptor. With this renewal award, the
Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Chi-Huey Wong of the
Department of Chemistry at the Scripps Research Institute. Professor Wong will
focus his work on developing new and practical chemo-enzymatic methods for the
synthesis of glycoproteins and complex carbohydrate mimetics in order to study
the effects of carbohydrates on protein structure and function, to probe
carbohydrate-receptor interaction and to exploit carbohydrate-based therapeutic
potential.
