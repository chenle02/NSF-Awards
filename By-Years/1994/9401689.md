The focus of the research is the design and evaluation of hardware assets and
software techniques to improve the performance of the memory hierarchy of high-
performance systems. Processor speed has steadily improved during the last
decade but memory latency and bandwith have been progressing at a slower pace.
Several techniques to reduce or tolerate high memory latencies have recently
surfaced. Some of these techniques are evaluated using trace-driven and
instruction-level simulations of benchmarks. A major thrust of the effort is to
devise improvements in the simulation techniques, e.g., by using selective
sampling and parellel discrete event simulation, so that performance results can
be obtained faster. The experiments in parallel simulation serve as a test bed
to customize programs for parallel execution. Additional projects continuing
present reserch include the design of cache coherence protocols with various
block sizes for transfer and coherence. These protocols are geared towards a
reduction in contention in the interconnect of shared-memory multiprocessors and
a decrease in the amount of traffic caused by sharing. Similar goals are the
subject of software techniques such as compiler directives for bypassing the
cache and placement of data in the right levels of the memory hierchy.
