The goal of this research program is to discover the details of the sulfide
mineral oxidation reaction mechanism. A series of measurements of oxidation
rates for several different sulfide minerals, show different reaction orders for
different minerals as well as two distinct ranges of activation energies. These
differences are presumably caused by differences in the overall reaction
mechanism. The P.I. have used thermodynamic and kinetic information on
individual aqueous sulfur species and elementary reactions taken from the
literature to construct a general model of the sulfide mineral oxidation
reaction mechanism. They propose to refine this model using experimental data,
gathered as part of this research, on the effects of various catalysts and
inhibitors (chemical probes of the mechanism) on the rate of the overall
reaction and on the distribution of sulfur species in the reacted solution.
These data will eventually be woven into a quantitative numerical model that
should prove useful in a wide range of scientific and technological endeavors.
