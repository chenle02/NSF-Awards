The recent acquisition of a state-of-the-art nuclear magnetic resonance
spectrophotometer (Varian EM 360L) is enabling the chemistry department at CUNY
Lehman College to implement major curriculum revisions in the organic chemistry
laboratory courses, to introduce important NMR-based experiments in physical
chemistry, instrumental analysis, and biochemistry, and to enhance student
learning in undergraduate research. Since the undergraduate enrollment at this
institution is predominantly minority, these revisions will significantliy
affect undergraduate instruction for this group which has been traditionally
underrepresented in science, mathematics and engineering.
