Coupled climate models require dynamically consistent and accurate ocean
modules. Climate projections are expected to require some degree of
parameterization for the eddy component of ocean flows well into the future. The
objective of this project is to contribute to ocean eddy parameterization by
means of novel examinations of ensembles of ocean simulations. Ensemble
approaches are common in climate modeling but have not been employed for
studying the ocean dynamics. A North Atlantic ensemble with a particular focus
on the Gulf Stream will be analyzed and contrasted with the interior of the
North Atlantic. The Gulf Stream exhibits exceptional dynamical features and is
expected to highlight the benefits of novel approaches provided by ensembles.
The North Atlantic interior eddy field is expected to take on very different,
detectable characteristics. The outcomes of this project are expected to improve
understanding of eddy parameterizations in both ocean and climate
models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the proposal lies in the
development of the theory behind quantitative ensemble analysis and its
application to a collection of North Atlantic simulations. The techniques will
be ported to the analysis of several North Atlantic regions differing in their
leading order dynamics. This analysis will clarify the various roles of the eddy
field within the global ocean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
