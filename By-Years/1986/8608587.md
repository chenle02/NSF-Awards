This project is a Workshop which is to be held in Europe with bridge engineers
from the European community. The objective of the Workshop is to learn various
techniques used by the European bridge engineers to extend the life expectancy
and duration of the different types of bridges. The Workshop will enable
American bridge engineers to exchange information with their counterparts and
thus to develop relationships for future cooperation.
