This is an award to provide renewed support for completion of a project
initiated under NSF Grant No. 88-07774 to investigate a novel concept for
decontamination of water that contains organic pollutants. Prior work had
indicated that in the presence of polyethylene oxide, decomposition products of
irradiation were scavenged from solution suggesting that free radical species
formed during irradiation were coupled to radical sites formed on the polymer.
The work to be conducted will concentrate on the dose-rate effect of electron
beam radiation to determine whether the observed coupling of free radicals
formed during radiation is proportional to their concentration which in turn is
proportional to dose-rate. The investigator plans to modify the electron-beam
accelerator used in prior work to allow a ten-fold increase in dose rate and
plans to use a pulsed linear accelerator made available for his use in MIT's
Plasma Fusion Laboratory to achieve dose rates several orders of magnitude
larger than possible by use of the Van de Graaff accelerator previously used in
his research. The presence of organic contaminants in water is a problem of
considerable significance as it relates to usefulness of water for municipal and
industrial purposes. This research on a method for destruction of these
contaminants by use of ionizing radiation is expected to provide guidance for
its potential use in engineering design of processes and systems to
decontaminate water and wastewater.
