Dr. Thomas Phillips, in conjunction with ten major users, proposes to set up a
resource center for immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization technologies
at the University of Missouri. The center would include, and funds are requested
for, a confocal fluorescence microscope, a computer graphics system for three-
dimensional reconstruction of confocal microscope images, a low-light microscope
and camera for fluorescence studies, and an associated image processing system
for ration imaging of indicator dyes to determine cellular pH or ion
concentrations. The center will incorporate some already existing equipment: a
transmission electron microscope, microtomes and a cryostat. This facility would
complement existing campus-wide cores for monoclonal antibody production and
oligonucleotide synthesis. Various units within the University will provide 50%
of the capital costs, long-term salary support for staff, substantial existing
equipment, and funding for laboratory renovation and continuing service
contracts.
