This project will continue ongoing work related to the shape of the core/mantle
boundary and to structure and material properties inside the core. It will
continue inversion of core phase travel time data for core structure and other
parameters. This inversion includes the effects of structure inside the outer
core induced by boundary topography and by gravitational forces. It will also
model the effects on the earth's forced nutations of: (a) the inner core
(including possible inner core structure), and (b) outer core viscosity in the
presence of non-hydrostatic core/mantle topography. Part (a) will include an
attempt to model and expected inner core nutational normal mode.
