9510109 Willis Dr. Willis wants to compare the structure and activities of
nematode lin-14 with that of the insect juvenile hormone at the molecular level.
If there are similarities, then she will be able to focus on whether such a gene
as lin-14 might act directly on insect cuticular protein genes. This research
will shed light on the regulatory effect of juvenile hormone on insect
metamorphosis. ***
