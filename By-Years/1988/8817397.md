In this project, laboratory experiments will be used to determine the
quantitative influence of buoyancy effects due to stable stratification on
turbulent mixing of heat, salt, and momentum. Results will be applied both to
interpreting ocean microstructure measurements, and to computational ocean
models. Specific problems include: parameterization of turbulent transport in
terms of the Prandtl number, Vaisala frequency, Richardson number, large scale
flow gradients and flow evolution history; the influence of background or
turbulence-generated internal waves on mixing and measured quantities; and
comparative studies of 2- versus 3-dimensional turbulent mixing and evaluation
of recent theoretical scalings. New optical measurement techniques to be used
include laser Doppler anemometry and laser-induced fluorescence.
