The proposed work will be an observational program designed to characterize
upper thermospheric and exospheric conditions and their temporal variability.
The fundamental objective is to measure all important composition and dynamic
parameters in the upper reaches of the earth's atmosphere. The PI will establish
techniques to determine thermospheric winds below and above the F- region peak,
the escape flux of atomic hydrogen and its thermal and non-thermal partitioning,
the velocity distributions of hydrogen and helium, and the independent transport
of light ions. The project's broader objective, besides driving observation and
theory to a unified description of upper atmospheric processes, is to improve
understanding of the evolution of planetary atmospheres.
