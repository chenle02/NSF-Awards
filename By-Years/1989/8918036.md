Basic questions concerning genes in natural populations of free.living soil
bacteria in the genus >Bacillus> are addressed by these studies. Questions
include: the amount of genetic variability present in nature; whether the
exchange of genes between bacterial cells is common; and whether wild bacterial
populations consist almost entirely of independently multiplying clones, with no
lateral exchange of genes between cells of different clones. Many bacteria
exchange genes between different bacterial cells, processes of exchange akin to
the familiar sort of sexual reproduction of animals and plants. Several
different mechanisms of "sexuality" are known for bacteria; one is known as
"transformation". Transformation occurs when the DNA of one type of cell passes
through the environment and is picked up by another cell and inserted into the
recipient cell's DNA. Thus a genetic exchange occurs and the recipient cell
acquires new biological properties. For example, the recipient cell may acquire
a gene which allows it to obtain energy from a new source in its environment, or
it may acquire a gene which makes it resistant to a natural antibiotic produced
by a neighboring and different type of bacteria or a fungus. Exchanges which
influence hundreds or thousands of bacterial functions in nature are possible.
An understanding of the genetic variability and amounts of genetic recombination
of bacterial populations will allow prediction of the abilities of these
populations to change in their environments. The exchange of genes in natural
populations of bacteria can have both beneficial and harmful effects. Genes
which adapt soil bacterial populations to changing agricultural conditions can
spread and better adapt these beneficial organisms to their role in the movement
of nutrients to plants. However, genes which cause plant diseases could also be
spread. Naturally pathogenic genes for animals and humans, for example anthrax
disease which is produced by >Bacillus>, could conceivably move around in wild
bacterial populations. Thus it is important to understand completely how and
when genes move around in bacterial populations.
