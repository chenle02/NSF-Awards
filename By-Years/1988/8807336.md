This research is in the theory of Lie groups. This subject continues to expand
as questions from geometry, number theory and physics continue to lead into it.
Mostow's researches deal with lattices in Lie groups. Piatetski-Shapiro's work
deals with L- functions aspects of Lie groups. Garland's project, in
generalization of loop groups, is to study Chevalley groups over an arithmetic
surface. Howe will study applications of the Heisenberg group to diverse parts
of mathematics. This is a broad research program centered around the theory of
Lie Groups. The applications will be in geometry, number theory and physics and
possibly other areas of mathematics.
