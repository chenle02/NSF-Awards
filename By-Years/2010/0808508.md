PI Kodrick Brown DDIG Proposal number 0808508 Title: DISSERTATION RESEARCH:
Behavioral and ecological factors mediating the co-occurrence of two Gambusia
fish species

Increasing habitat alteration has put previously geographically separated
species into secondary contact. The mechanisms by which two closely-related
species avoid hybridization when they come into contact are of great interest.
Hybridization avoidance can be driven by differences in ecology and/or behavior.
This is the first study that attempts to consider the relative roles of both
mechanisms in hybridization avoidance in a model fish system. To determine how
two species of fishes are avoiding complete genetic introgression, this study
will measure the degree of hybridization in the wild and in a semi-natural
population experiment using standard molecular techniques. The molecular data
will be examined in light of other laboratory and field studies for this
project. It is expected that both ecology and behavior play an important role in
the maintenance of the two species' unique identities. This project will broaden
the scope of current molecular investigations by linking both behavior and
ecology to overall hybridization dynamics. Broader impacts: This study will
provide research experience for underrepresented undergraduates at the
University of New Mexico. This research will facilitate collaboration with state
and federal agencies and university researchers. Because one of the study
species is federally endangered, opportunities exist for participation in public
education forums, organized by these state and federal agencies, to inform the
public about status and management of native wildlife within the State of New
Mexico
