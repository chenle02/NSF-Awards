This proposal focuses on several fundamental computational issues involved in
the parallel implicit solution of partial differential equations arising from
optimal control and the variational formulation of physical problems. The goals
of the research include, but are not limited to, the following:

(1) The formulation and analysis of provably efficient, robust and scalable
multilevel algorithms for the optimization and solution of systems defined by
partial differential equations.

(2) The development of software embodying the above algorithms and its
dissemination within the manufacturing, engineering and scientific community.
The proposed software will extend the scope and effectiveness of the existing
codes PLTMG, MC, and SNOPT that have been developed by the investigators at UC
San Diego.

(3) The attraction of advanced graduate students into this research area, which
generally concerns the analysis and computational study of systems arising in
the sciences and engineering.

The investigators have combined expertise in optimization, numerical methods for
partial differential equations, and parallel computation. This research program
is intended to provide graduate students with a broad educational experience in
an environment in which these different aspects of scientific computation are
integrated. A key aim of the research is the transfer of new results to the
manufacturing, engineering and scientific community. Mathematical software is
one of the most effective means of technology transfer. Conversely, a crucial
component of effective algorithm development is close association with engineers
and scientists facing real-world problems. The investigators will continue and
broaden their collaboration with researchers in other areas of applied science
and technology, including manufacturing, environmental modeling, electrical
power optimization, biomolecular modeling, computer graphics, solid mechanics,
aerospace and finance. All these applications have benefited from and
contributed to existing algorithms and software.
