This proposal focuses on how weather forecasters make use of imperfect
information in making predictions. The investigators were seen to provide an
unusual and appropriate mix of skills needed to test several important
theoretical questions about how experts assess the quality of information and
important applied questions about how weather forecasts could be made more
reliable. The project involves two experiments, using expert weather forecasters
as the primary subject group, that will (a) compare the accuracy of forecasts
made in limited vs. full information conditions and (b) test the consistency and
reliability of information acquisition by examining how different forecasters
make use of the same limited information base. The use of operating weather
forecasters is viewed as particularly appropriate because, despite the fact that
meterorologists often are viewed as the paragon of excellence in real-world
probability judgments, their decision making processes and their ability to
interpret and make inferences on the basis of incomplete information has not
been thoroughly studied. The results will be general interest as a study of how
experts make use of incomplete information and how human-computer interactions
should be designed to provide assistance to decision makers facing complex
forecasting demands under conditions of limited information.
