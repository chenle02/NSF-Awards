The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to explore
translation of environmentally friendly ways to produce hydrogen gas from
hydrogen sulfide, a waste stream common in energy operations. The sulfur content
of extracted hydrocarbons is increasing, and these sulfur-heavy gases require
additional processing. The proposed technology cleans this sulfur-heavy gas in a
sustainable process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the
development of a technology for low carbon production of hydrogen gas from
sulfur-rich gas streams common at oil and gas production and processing
facilities. The technology is a chemical looping process that produces hydrogen
from hydrogen sulfide and water via iodine intermediates. The process comprises
two reaction and two separation steps. The first step is the reaction of
hydrogen sulfide, water, and iodine to produce hydroiodic acid and sulfur
dioxide. The second step requires the degassing of sulfur dioxide from the
aqueous mixture at elevated temperatures. The mixture is vaporized and the
hydrogen iodide is catalytically decomposed into hydrogen gas and iodine. This
reaction step has been particularly well explored, with many experiments testing
various catalysts and conversion rates. Finally, the stream is cooled, and
hydrogen gas is flash separated from the mixture of iodine, water, and
hydroiodic acid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
