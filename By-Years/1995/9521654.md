9521654 Meroney This award is for supporting the 2nd. International Symposium on
Computational Wind Engineering that will take place in August 4-8, 1996 at the
Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO. The purpose of this meeting is to
examine the accomplishments and challenges posed by the rapid development of
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) as applied to the discipline of wind
engineering. CFD shows significant promise as a means to predict, estimate and
mitigate the impacts of extreme winds on buildings, facilities and the
infrastructure. The research community, the private sector and the population of
wind hazard prone areas will benefit from these exchanges and transfer of
knowledge. ***
