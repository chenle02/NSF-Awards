THE CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM FOR HYPERBOLIC 3-MANIFOLDS

The PI, Jeffrey Brock, will synthesize diverse techniques in the deformation
theory of hyperbolic 3-manifolds to address classification problem for
hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Brock will undertake joint work with K. Bromberg that
employs the theory of hyperbolic cone-manifolds to show that each tame
hyperbolic 3-manifold M is approximated by geometrically finite 3-manifolds.
This conjecture, known as the Density Conjecture has recently been solved by
Brock and Bromberg in certain cases. Brock will also work toward completing
joint work with R. Canary and Y. Minsky to prove Thurston's ending lamination
conjecture, which predicts that a tame hyperbolic 3-manifold is determined by
its topology and its end invariants: combinatorial invariants attached to the
``ends'' of a hyperbolic 3-manifold. In new joint work with Bromberg, R. Evans,
and J. Souto, Brock will study the question of whether each algebraic limit of a
sequence of geometrically finite hyperbolic 3-manifolds is itself topologically
tame. This joint project has implications for a conjecture of Ahlfors that the
limit set of a finitely generated Kleinian group has either measure zero or full
measure in the Riemann sphere.

Classifying mathematical objects plays much the same scientific role as
classifying biological, chemical, or physical phenomena in the development of
these fields. For example, with the human genome "cracked," scientists may now
isolate specific genetic causes or predispositions to diseases, greatly
furthering the ability of science to address these problems. In the proposed
research, Brock will endeavor to solve the classification problem for a
"generic" class of 3-dimensional spaces, the "hyperbolic 3-manifolds." These
non-Euclidean spaces have geometry locally like our own Euclidean space, but
their large scale geometry is expanding exponentially: for example, light rays
(a metaphor for geodesics) emanating from a point-source diverge exponentially
rather than linearly. William P. Thurston's revolutionary and pioneering work in
the 1970's and 1980's showed that almost all 3-manifolds are hyperbolic, and
went on to raise as many questions about hyperbolic 3-manifolds as it answered.
From his contributions, a compelling conjectural picture of the right
classification of hyperbolic 3-manifolds has emerged as a lasting problem for
researchers in the field of geometry and topology. Recent work of the PI and his
collaborators has put the solution of this problem within reach; the PI will
make use his NSF support to facilitate ongoing collaborations to solve this
fundamental problem, thereby making a "database" of hyperbolic 3-manifolds
available for wider use by other mathematicians and physicists alike.
