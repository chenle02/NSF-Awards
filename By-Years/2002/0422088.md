This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a
portable, rapid and specific capillary channel based immuno-sensing system for
food pathogens. The tests will be able to detect concentrations of <10 cfu/ml of
various microorganisms (Salmonella, Listeria, Escherichia Coli) in less than 1
hour in contrast to current methods that typically require 24 to 48 hours for
preliminary data to become available and typically 3-7 days for definitive
results. The capability of the proposed instrument to achieve this significant
leap forward in performance was demonstrated by the Phase I results. The Phase
II objective is to further refine the instrument with the high performance, ease
of use, and low per sample cost needed by the food processing industry.

The commercial application of this project will be in the areas of food safety
and bio-defense. Microbial contamination of food products by pathogenic bacteria
is a major concern of our society. Contaminated food is estimated to cause 76
million illnesses, 325,000 serious illnesses resulting in hospitalization, and
5,000 deaths in the United States each year. The economic impact of food-borne
illnesses has been estimated as high as $10 billion annually. Recent events have
also made it clear that the threat from pathogens intentionally introduced into
the nation's food supply can be real, with significant economic implications.
