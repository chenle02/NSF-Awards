The broader impact of this I-Corps Team project is a new collagen-mimetic
material that will lead to the development of safer, cheaper, and customizable
products for medical applications. Collagen has applications in medicine,
pharmaceuticals, personal care products, food industry, and leather industry.
The incidences of transmission of pathogens from animal products have added to
the market pressure for safer, non-mammalian sources of collagens. The novel,
collagen-mimetic fibrils are expected to be a safe collagen-alternative for many
collagen-related applications. These new materials can be designed to cater the
needs of specific applications and is potentially more versatile and effective
than the traditional collagen products. The potential commercial impact is a new
generation of collagen-related biomaterials for skin care, bone and joint
health, controlled drug release devices, and wound
healing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps Team project will identify and
establish relationships with potential partners across the medical field and the
personal care industry. Collagen has long been sought after for its combination
of tensile strength and biocompatibility. The emerging peptide biotechnology
raised hope of producing collagen-mimetic peptides that can be a safe,
economically viable alternative to collagens extracted from animals. Until
recently, however, protein design could not produce peptide materials that adapt
to the fibril conformation of natural collagens. This project builds upon the
development of the first of such fibril-forming triple helical peptide. The
self-assembled collagen-mimetic fibrils have the characteristic axial repeating
structure reminiscent of that of the D-period of fibrillar collagens in tissues.
The collagen-mimetic fibrils can be used as molecular scaffold to create
biomaterials that have the supramolecular structure and the tensile strength
comparable to that of natural collagen fibrils. The bottom-up approach makes it
possible to customize the materials for specific applications.
