Gary N Cherr IOS-0843649 Defensins at the Interface of Male and Female Innate
Immunity

The mammalian female reproductive tract has immune responses to protect against
foreign invaders, including the attraction of white blood cells to the area. How
sperm cells overcome these defenses as well, and at the same time, play a role
in white blood cell attraction, are key questions in reproductive biology. The
central hypothesis of this grant seeks to link these two important steps of
mammalian reproduction into a unifying concept. The investigators have recently
demonstrated that molecules called beta-defensins uniformly coat the entire
surface of mammalian sperm during maturation in the male tract. Beta-defensins
are key effector peptides of innate immunity found throughout the animal
kingdom. These peptides have potent antimicrobial activities and act as chemical
attractants. While the expression of beta-defensin peptides by reproductive
tissue has been described in several invertebrate species, the presence of beta-
defensins on the sperm surface is a novel finding and has only been recently
described in mammals. Their presence may reflect adaptations of these peptides
for internal fertilization. It is proposed that sperm-associated beta-defensins,
which form a uniform surface coat on spermatozoa, promote fertility by first
protecting sperm from immunorecognition by the female reproductive tract and
then providing enhanced innate immune protection in part by attracting white
blood cells. The investigators propose to test these ideas through a combination
of in vivo and in vitro experiments using a mouse model. This innovative project
will yield answers to longstanding questions in reproductive biology and will
provide insights into the sources of variation of reproductive fitness in
mammals. The understanding of these mechanisms holds significance for managing
reproduction in domestic species, evaluating reproductive fitness in wildlife,
and maintaining reproductive health in humans.
