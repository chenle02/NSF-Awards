A joint workshop, to be held at the new Euler International Mathematics
Institute of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences in Leningrad during the period May
13-26, 1991 will focus on two key areas of interest in mathematics, complex
analysis and mathematical physics. The meeting is being organized by Dr. Edward
Saff of the University of South Florida and Dr. A. A. Gonchar, Academician
Secretary of the Department of Mathematics of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences.
Ten of the thirteen U.S. participants will receive partial or full support from
this award for travel to the meeting. Its results will be internationally
published. This project fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
knowledge by enabling leading researchers in the United States and the U.S.S.R.
to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual
interest and competence in the field of basic scientific research on the basis
of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
