9614118 Jacobson The project is a study of the effects of aerosols and clouds
on climate. The research will be carried out with regional and global scale
computer models that simulate gas chemistry, aerosol processes, dynamics, and
radiation. These numerical modeling tools are aimed at developing a better
understanding of the effects of aerosols and clouds on temperatures. The
research incorporates a number of modeling tasks that include: (1) quantifying
the overall effects of aerosols on regional and global temperatures; (2)
studying the variations of aerosol composition and size on temperatures; (3)
evaluating the effects of aerosols on vertical temperature profiles; (4)
assessing the day and nighttime effects of aerosols on temperatures; (5)
studying the direct effects of clouds on temperatures; and (6) comparing
simulation results to data and other aerosol models. Results from these modeling
activities will generate new information that will improve aerosol and cloud
parameterizations within climate change models.
