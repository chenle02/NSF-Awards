NSF Award Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a fundamental change ongoing in
the computer industry. Instead of increasing clock frequency, which increases
power dissipation, CPU chip manufacturers are using advances in semiconductor
technology to increase the number of cores on a processor chip. This shifts the
burden of improving program performance from chip manufacturers to software
developers. Many industry experts believe that programming multicore processors
is now the most important challenge facing the software
industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compiler technology for parallel architectures is
not effective for irregular applications that use linked data structures such as
trees and graphs. These data structures are ubiquitous in important application
areas like graphics, mesh generation and linear system
solvers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops a new approach for
parallelizing and optimizing irregular programs for multicore processors. The
key insight is that optimistic parallelization is essential for irregular
programs. Transactional memory is an attractive way to implement optimistic
parallelization; this project will design, implement and evaluate new
transactional models that exploit properties of high-level program abstractions
rather than simply tracking low-level reads and
writes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results will be disseminated through publications
and by making the software transactional memory system available for
downloading. Technology transfer to leading companies is another avenue for
disseminating results.&lt;br/&gt;
