1126627 &lt;br/&gt;Aufdenkampe&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research
Instrumentation grant supports acquisition of a high-sensitivity stable isotope
ratio mass spectrometer (Delta V plus with Conflo IV universal interface) at the
Stroud Water Research Center (SWRC). The new instrumentation will provide
enhanced capabilities and greater sensitivity analyses than currently available
at the SWRC. The new IRMS system will be put to use in several funded projects
with the overall goal of exploiting hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen and carbon stable
isotopes to track organic matter cycling in soils and stream environments.
Natural abundance measurements and heavy isotope tracers will be used to track
energy and carbon flow in stream ecosystems. Data from these measurements will
support the development of dynamic mathematical models describing the movement,
quantity and quality and transformation of nutrients through surface earth
hydrological processes. Studies in collaboration with regional scientists
engaged in NSF-funded Long Term Research in Environmental Biology (LTREB) sites
and a regional Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) will be
facilitated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***
