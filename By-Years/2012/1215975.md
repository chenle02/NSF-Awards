The Symposium in Memory of Patrick Veyssiere: Understanding the Mechanisms
Controlling Plastic Flow, will be held at the TMS 2012, 141st Annual Meeting
March 11-15, 2012 in Orlando, FL. This annual conference is organized by The
Minerals Metals &amp; Materials Society (TMS), to bring the Metals and Materials
community together to present, learn about, and discuss recent developments in
the field. Technical Sessions will be held on Dislocation Organization, Plastic
Flow, Screw Dislocations, Lattice Friction, Intermetallic Alloys, Nanograined
Materials and Deformation Mechanisms. The aim of this symposium is to bring
together scientists from these different communities to communicate about
interrelationships between experiment and simulations in these topics. NSF
funding will be used to defray the costs of registration fees for 7 students and
4 selected speakers or attendees who will be identified by the organizing
committee. The organizing committee may invite qualified candidates by
contacting university departments and/or laboratories that are known to have
strong programs in areas related to the symposium topic. Every effort will be
made to encourage candidates from underrepresented groups to apply for these
registration fee waivers.
