Their research will characterize in detail the thermodynamic behavior of metal
crystal surfaces. The emphasis will be upon the phase behavior as a function of
temperature and ad-atom coverage. It will contribute to the understanding of
equilibrium crystal shapes and surface roughening transitions. Currently, there
is a substantial body of theoretical work on these topics, but experiments on
their microscopic aspects are lacking. Crystals which are mis-cut from symmetry
directions will also be studied extensively. Such surfaces may undergo "phase-
separation" if the free energy gained is sufficient to offset the concomitant
increase in surface area. They will pursue studies of such behavior on copper
surfaces.
