9315797 San This project is on research to redirect, by a genetic perturbation,
the cellular carbon fluxes in E. coli in order to reduce acetate production.
Decreased acetate formation is intended to reduce product inhibition and thereby
increase both recombinant protein production and cell growth. The decrease in
acetate is caused by the introduction of a Bacillus acetolactate synthesis gene
(ALS) which causes an increase in the formation of acetoin. This research will
be an example of the use of metabolic engineering to increase product yields.
The effect of the added ALS gene on the redistribution of various reaction
fluxes, especially those associated with the pyruvate branch point, will be the
focal point of this research. In addition, the modeling and analysis of these
flux changes will be performed by adapting established pathway analysis
methodologies. ***
