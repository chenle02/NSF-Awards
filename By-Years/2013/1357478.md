This award funds a graduate student mentoring program that is part of the
Economics Pipeline Program, which works to broaden participation in the
economics profession. The mentoring program helps students from under
represented groups navigate a number of critical stages in their development as
scientists as they go from the early stages of graduate study through completing
dissertation research and starting their first post-doctoral position. Students
meet regularly with their program mentors at a variety of professional
conferences around the country. An annual workshop brings all participants
together for research presentations; this workshop is held in conjunction with a
summer program aimed at undergraduate students who are interested in careers in
social and economic science. The graduate students therefore both benefit from
working with their own mentors and are able to serve as mentors in turn to
younger students.
