The proposed research concerns algorithmic and combinatorial problems of
computational geometry in a non-planar setting. The following problem domains
will be considered: higher-dimensional convex problems, in particular questions
about their decomposability and query problems such as point location and ray
shooting; finally, the notion of a Riemann surface as a potential computational
and conceptual tool in computational geometry.
