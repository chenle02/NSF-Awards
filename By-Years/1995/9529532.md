Abstract - Reklaitis - 9529532 This grant is to provide support for the travel
expenses of fourteen U.S. Academic participants to a workshop that will explore
world-wide industry/ university/ government (IUG) research collaboration models
in the chemical sciences and engineering. The purpose of the workshop is to
resent and discuss such models which are being employed outside the U.S., that
is, in Europe, the Pacific Rim, and North America. The intended result is the
identification of best practices and components which may be appropriate for the
U.S. environment. The workshop presentation, discussions, and recommendations
will be captured in a final report which will be widely disseminated in the
chemical research community. It is envisioned that this workshop will serve to
launch a regular series of workshops which will continue the process of
assessing innovations in IUG collaboration models. Research collaboration is
dynamically evolving around the globe should be monitored to provide the U.S.
chemical research community with information about successful and transplantable
practices. .
