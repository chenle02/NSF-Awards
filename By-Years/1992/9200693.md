ABSTRACT CTS-9200693 William E. Stewart The development of a numerical model and
the optimization of the independent parameters for analyzing ice crystal growth
in falling film flow is proposed. The model will be used to maximize the crystal
growth rate in the falling film. The heat transfer and ice crystal growth
simulation results will be compared to some previous experimental results. The
numerical model will incorporate the interaction between the falling film fluid
and the ice crystals by means of enhanced, effective thermal conductivities and
reduced, effective viscosities. The proposed research will establish a numerical
model that can be used to optimize the parameters that govern ice crystal growth
to maximize crystal growth rate.
