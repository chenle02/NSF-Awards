Through the US Ignite initiative, the National Science Foundation (NSF) seeks to
demonstrate the potential and capacity of ultra-high speed broadband networks,
seeding demand for and investment into their development. In coordination with
other project components, including the communities that comprise the Ignite
test network, the NSF plans to conduct a two-phase open innovation challenge,
wherein individuals and project teams compete for prizes and funding to develop
applications that make use of ultra-high speed networks. These applications will
deliver innovative and valuable services in areas of national priority,
including smart health, clean energy, cyber-learning, smart transportation,
public safety, and advanced manufacturing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mozilla has a
long history of designing and managing Open Innovation Challenges. The
organization uses the challenge model to drive participation in shaping product
development and innovation. Challenges pair the agility of open innovation, the
generativity that comes from the freedom to propose new ideas, diverse
perspectives, crowd sourced insight, and accidental encounter with resources and
support for projects able to demonstrate measurable impact. Through US Ignite,
Mozilla will leverage its experiences to drive ultra-high speed broadband
application development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A successful U.S. Ignite prize
competition will provide an accessible vision of what is possible with next-
generation networks, demonstrate that potential with deployments addressing
national priorities, and galvanize a network of gigabit application developers.
