9400170 Appelquist This grant is for the latest in a series of conferences held
yearly at the Aspen Center since 1985. The one-week session in January has as
its subject "Particle Physics Before the Year 2000". Both theoretical and
experimental presentations are made. Issues discussed are of greatest current
interest in particle physics, e.g. electroweak interactions, symmetry breaking
and CP violation. The setting provides an opportunity for close interaction
among theorists and experiments particularly hospitable to younger scientists.
