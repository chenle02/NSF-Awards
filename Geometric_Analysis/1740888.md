The Between Geometry and Relativity summer school (July 17-21, 2017) and
conference (July 24-28, 2017) will be held at the Erwin Schr√∂dinger Institute
(ESI) in Vienna, Austria, as two major focus events of the Geometry and
Relativity program (July 17-September 8, 2017). The program will bring together
doctoral students, promising young researchers, and leading experts to discuss
spectacular recent developments in the nexus of geometric analysis and general
relativity, to assess new avenues for investigations, to support existing
collaborations, and to promote new ones. In recent years, gravitational wave
experiments such as that of LIGO have seen striking advances, confirming
phenomena anticipated by general relativity (Einstein's theory of gravitation).
These developments have led to a new surge of activity in the study of
cosmological models, black holes, and other areas in the field. The summer
school is designed to introduce aspects of the field to graduate students and
other junior investigators, and at the conference participants will learn about
a range of current research questions. The ESI program affords young researchers
the opportunity to enhance the development of their research program through
interaction with established and emerging leaders in the field. This grant will
provide support for graduate students and other junior investigators from the
U.S. interested in attending the conference and/or summer school, and who would
otherwise be unable to do so without this support.

The study of the Einstein equations as a model for gravitational phenomena
involves deep and fundamental relationships between geometric analysis and
physics. Spectacular progress has been made in recent years on several fronts,
including the study of wave equations on black hole space-times (with the
eventual goal of understanding black hole stability), cosmic censorship,
dynamical formation of black holes in vacuum, topology of black holes, and a
better understanding of the moduli space of solutions to the Einstein constraint
equations that govern geometry of initial data for the Cauchy problem. Recent
advances in numerical analysis of gravitational phenomena highlight the need to
push the theoretical boundaries of the initial value formulation (both in
constructing solutions to the constraints and in understanding the evolution of
these initial data sets) and to create a bridge between the researchers in these
areas. The purpose of the summer school and conference is to introduce graduate
students and other junior investigators to the tools needed to approach such
results and to frame some outstanding open problems in the field. Details of the
program are available at the program webpage:
