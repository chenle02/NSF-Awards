The Pittsburgh State University will initiate a three-week, residential Young
Scholars project in Chemistry and Biology for 36 students entering grades 8,9.
The students' interest, confidence, and enthusiasm for science will be
heightened. This age group was selected to affect future curricula choices.
Participants learn basic research methodology, gain discipline content, and
perform research under the direction of senior faculty. Ethical considerations
are integrated into daily activities. Special sessions focus on the values and
philosophies practitioners and citizens must consider. Career Exploration
opportunities include developing "Personal Plans" and visits to regional
practitioners of science to see "what scientists do." Follow-up involves school
visits, campus speakers, and student presentations in the Junior Science
Academy. Project assessment includes short and long term follow up.
