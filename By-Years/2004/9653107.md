In today's science education reform efforts, teachers are being asked to teach
with different materials, and in different ways than they themselves were taught
or learned to teach. This chemistry course will provide future teachers with the
solid underpinning needed to understand chemical concepts, and an experience
base from which they can draw upon in their teaching. This course will be
designed jointly by university chemistry instructors, students, and practicing
teachers. It will use hands-on, learner-centered, and inquiry-based pedagogies
to promote deeper learning. The course will offer strong chemical content and
provide students with a model of effective science teaching. Students will
define, design, and carry out investigations of real-world issues. There will be
a focus on the human side of science through inclusion of historical, cultural,
and environmental perspectives. This project will produce a model of effective
chemistry teaching that will be applicable to any undergraduate non-majors or
majors chemistry course. The goals of this course are to increase the chemical
knowledge base of non-science majors and to provide experiences that will enable
them to become life-long learners of science. The objectives are; 1) to develop
inquiry-based units that use investigative types of experiences which show the
doing of chemistry based on real-world issues, 2) to model effective teaching
methods, 3) to produce materials that show the human/cultural aspects of
chemistry as well as its impact on society, 4) to model authentic assessment
methods that develop a broad, comprehensive picture of a student's overall
learning
