This program will use archival data from the Very Large Telescope (VLT) and the
Keck Observatory to probe quasar winds. It will result in improved statistical
studies of the link between the absorption line properties and optical and radio
properties of quasars. This will be accomplished by studying intrinsic
absorption line systems through their variability and through comparison of
photoionization and hydrodynamic model predictions of absorption features with
the data.

Broader impacts of the work include training of undergrad and graduate students,
and outreach to the local community via the established yearly Astrofest, a four
night festival of astronomy attracting over 1500 members of the general public
each summer.
