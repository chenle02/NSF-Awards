The project will support participation of US-based mathematicians, especially
those in the early stages of career, in the international conference, "Finite
Dimensional Integrable Systems 2022", to be held at the Tel Aviv University,
Israel, on June 20-24, 2022. The conference will bring together leading experts
in this important and fast growing area of research, along with mathematicians
in the early stage of career and graduate students. The conference web site is

;&lt;br/&gt;The conference, "Finite Dimensional Integrable Systems 2022", is
focused on integrable systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom, the
most classical and popular part of the theory of completely integrable systems
that goes back to the works of Lagrange, Jacobi, Kovalevskaya, Noether, Poincare
and others. In the second half of 20th century, KAM theory and the work of its
founders (Kolmogorov, Arnold, Moser) gave a new perspective on integrability
problems and stimulated further progress in this area. New powerful methods,
based on the interplay between a priori disconnected branches of mathematics and
physics, have been recently developed: methods of complex analysis, symplectic
and complex geometry, Lie theory, representation theory, and computer algebra -
they are all used in the integrability theory. As a result, new integrable
systems have been found, new applications of integrable systems in physics and
geometry were discovered, new tools for the study of integrable systems were
developed and many questions, open for a long time, have been answered. The
conference will survey recent progress in this field, present open problems,
outline new directions of research, look for new applications, and foster new
collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
