Dr. Tai-Ping Liu, Stanford University, and Dr. Long-an Ying of Peking University
will collaborate on shock wave theory. Professor Ying is a leading mathematical
scientist in Beijing. He has worked on numerical analysis, partial differential
equations and mathematical modeling, and pioneered the concept of infinite
elements in computations. Recent work has been on the qualitative behavior of
combustion waves and finite difference for hyperbolic partial differential
equations. Collaboration will focus on the behavior of discrete shocks, the
effects of dissipation on combustion waves, and other issues on the nonlinear
stability and instability of nonlinear waves for hyperbolic and viscous
conservation laws. Professor Ying's experience in numerical analysis and
inviscid combustion waves complement well the PI's interest in dissipations for
conservation laws.
