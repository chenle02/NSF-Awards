With increasing data processing needs, many applications belonging to areas such
as communication networks, computational biology, e-commerce, etc. require the
processing of very large data sets under time and space limitations. This need
makes it necessary to seek new, more efficient algorithmic models involving
resource restrictions. The main objective of this project is to explore the
tradeoffs between limiting the computing resources (time, space, access to
input) available to an algorithm and the resulting loss in accuracy and
effectiveness. By testing quantitative properties as well as qualitative ones,
the link between the efficiency/effectiveness of property testing and those of
approximation algorithms can be investigated. To this end, this project involves
devising sublinear algorithms for checking combinatorial properties of various
types of large data objects such as sequences, graphs, and sets. This task can
be achieved through intelligent random sampling of the data, minimizing the
number of bits of the input that the algorithm needs to access through either
reusing samples or choosing samples carefully so that each accessed bit yields
as much information as possible about the input.

The broader impact of this project is in improving the understanding of
resource-bounded computation on different types of large data. The new meta-
techniques developed are expected to apply to a variety of problems in different
application areas which now see the processing of input as a major bottleneck.
For students of computer science, these techniques bring a new point of view to
understanding the possibilities and limitations of computation as well as an
understanding of data-related limitations and bottlenecks of certain types of
applications that need to be addressed via unconventional models.
