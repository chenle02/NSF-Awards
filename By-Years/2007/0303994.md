This Nanotechnology in Undergraduate Education (NUE) award to Professors Delana
A. Nivens, Will E. Lynch and Ronald R. Williams of Armstrong Atlantic State
University provides for the introduction of nanotechnology in "vertical threads"
throughout the university's chemistry curriculum. Synthesis, spectroscopy and
adaptation of nanomaterials will be incorporated into the laboratories of a
variety of chemistry courses from freshman to senior level. Using vertical
threads, general chemistry students will be introduced to the vast, novel and
interdisciplinary nature of nanomaterials, thereby maximizing the impact on both
chemistry majors and other science majors. Vertical threads allow students to
revisit the same nanomaterials with an expanding variety of applications.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal for this award was received in response to
the Nanoscale Science and Engineering program announcement, NSF 02-148, category
NUE. The focus is on developing laboratories that will introduce the field of
nanoscience to undergraduate students. The project is expected to have a
positive impact on educating female and minority students and also on students
from rural communities.&lt;br/&gt;
