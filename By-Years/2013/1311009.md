This action funds Paul Seung Soo Kim of Drexel University to conduct a research
project in Mechanical Engineering during the summer of 2013 at the Korea
Institute of Science and Technology in Seoul, Republic of Korea. The project
title is Fabrication of Light Activated Micro-grippers for Cellular Robots. The
host scientist is Dr. JinSeok Kim. This project develops tweezer-like microscale
grippers (~15Ã¬m) composed of photoresponsive materials using a light fabrication
technique similar to the one used to develop computer chips. The grippers are
being attached onto the fresh-water microorganism, Tetrahymena pyriformis, using
magnetic and chemical adhesion. These inorganic attached grippers will be opened
and closed with various colors of light. The combined microbe and gripper are
controlled as a single microbiorobot with potential uses in biomedical
applications and microassembly. The developed platform is anticipated to serve
as a prototype for microrobots functionalized with some inorganic actuator.
Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce. Furthermore, this academic and cultural experience will be
promoted and shared through mentoring via various organizations, programs, and
symposiums.
