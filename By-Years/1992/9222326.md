Discovery and Analysis of Extremely Low Metallicity Stars, Horizontal Branch
Stars, and A-Type Stars in the Galactic Halo. Dr Beers will carry out follow-up
spectroscopic and photometric observations of candidate low metallicity stars,
field horizontal branch stars, and apparent main sequence A-type stars
discovered in an ongoing survey. Observations of the low metallicity candidates
will provide a significant increase in the numbers of stars with metal
abundances less than 1/1000th of the solar value, thereby enabling a wide range
of investigations concerning the formation and evolution of our Galaxy.
