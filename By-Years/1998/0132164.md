This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will proceed
with the development of a fully automated and integrated pest management (IPM)
system. The goal of IPM is to minimize reliance on pesticides by emphasizing the
moment-to-moment knowledge of the field situation to dynamically make decisions
and deliver timely, targeted actions. Current IPM programs use data collection
technologies from early 1900s, thus lacking speed and integration necessary to
generate reports required by decision-makers who need to act quickly. With the
Phase II development of a robust centralized Internet hub housing expert systems
for automated data analysis, reporting (with GIS) and quick distribution of
information, the benefits to agriculture will be
unsurpassed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The company targets its suite of field data
management and decision-making tools the pest management market.
