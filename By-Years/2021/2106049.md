Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE) is requested to support operations
by the West Coast Van Pool (WCVP). The Pool currently consists of 15 modular
laboratory vans that are all owned by either by NSF or Oregon State University.
The pool is managed by Oregon State University and portable research vans are
shipped all over the world in support of sea-going science. The Van Pool
supports scientific operations and data collection aboard National Science
Foundation (NSF) supported research vessels by supplying required additional
specialized portable laboratory space and associated instrumentation. This
proposal seeks SSSE for the following
equipment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Replacement LSCs for West Coast Van Pool Isotope
Portable Laboratory $78,700&lt;br/&gt;Water bag for load testing overboarding
equipment $18,332&lt;br/&gt; $97,032&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The
principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of
the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 19-602). It provides infrastructure support for
scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of
their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo
separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition,
maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded
researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated
instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and
expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
