A person moving through the world must judge his or her own path of motion,
locate moving objects and judge the direction of motion of those objects. In
theory, the brain can accomplish these tasks using visual motion information as
well as the depth information from binocular stereo vision. However, it is not
known how these two sources of information are combined. In this project, a
computational model of neural processing will be developed to investigate how
the brain combines motion and stereo cues to identify moving objects for a
moving observer. Concurrently, experiments will examine how moving observers use
motion and stereo to identify and judge the 3D direction of motion of an object.
The results of this research will provide needed information about how neurons
combine motion and stereo cues to locate and judge the direction of moving
objects for a person who is moving. This will increase our understanding of
fundamental mechanisms of the visual system. It will be useful in understanding
how drivers make judgments about the motion of cars or pedestrians as they drive
on busy streets, which could aid policy decisions regarding drivers and traffic
rules. Additionally, because the research will be conducted at an undergraduate
college, its educational impact is substantial. Undergraduates will have an
opportunity to participate in leading-edge scientific research and perform their
own research projects. This will expose them to fields of scientific endeavor
that they would not otherwise encounter during their college years. Recruitment
of women undergraduates and other underrepresented minorities to engage in this
research will be a priority. Finally, the results and examples from this
research will be incorporated in a course in computational vision, taught by the
PI, so that the results will be disseminated to students who did not work
directly on the project.
