This project will contribute to the application of logic to computer science,
specifically complexity theory, database theory, and asymptotic combinatorics.
The project has three parts. The first part is a systematic investigation of
algorithmic problems about paths in graphs from the viewpoint of logical
expressibility. Important path problems will be classified according to their
expressibility in the DATALOG query language or in extensions of DATALOG with
negation. The second part is an exploration of connections between fixpoint
logic and computational complexity. In addition, a structural theory of
optimization will be developed according to the logical definability of
optimization problems. The third part is a study of asymptotic probabilities on
finite structures, such as zero-one laws and associated decision problems for
extensions of first-order logic under variable probability measures.
