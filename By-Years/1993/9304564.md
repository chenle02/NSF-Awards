This project is concerned with an international workshop on "Digital Video for
Intelligent Systems (July 8 and 9, 1993 at University of California, Irvine)".
The objectives of this Workshop are to review the state-of-the-art and to
identify future trends in Digital Video Technology for Intelligent Systems. The
application of machine intelligence range from sophisticated computer-based
systems for industry, medicine and science to simpler systems for the home.
Examples include computer-aided design, transportation systems, visualization of
phenomena in scientific experiments, business systems, adaptive control, robotic
vision, computer-aided education, modeling of human anatomy and physiology,
large visual data bases, personal communications, and intelligent appliances for
the home. Digital video is a fundamental enabling technology for most of these
intelligent systems. This Workshop is intended to foster further collaboration
among academic and industrial researchers including government agencies and
public institutions, in the field of digital video for intelligent systems.
