9550550 Kass The American Association for the Advancement of Science is
requesting a planning grant of $49,845 to support a one-year planning effort
that involves front-end research and a series of parent focus groups. This
initiative will help to design a national undertaking to stimulate parent
involvement in science and mathematics education. Anticipated outcomes include:
a widely published review paper that will summarize the research literature and
current parent involvement projects, and that will suggest promising strategies
to increase parent involvement in science and mathematics education and; a major
initiative, spearheaded by AAAS, to develop parent involvement activities and
programs that can be linked to AAAS's community-based science projects and other
projects nationwide.
