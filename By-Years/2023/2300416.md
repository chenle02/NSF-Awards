The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP)
through Research Initiation Awards provide support for junior and mid-career
faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities who are building new
research programs or redirecting and rebuilding existing research programs. It
is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research
capability and effectiveness and improve research and teaching at the home
institution. This award to Albany State University supports faculty and
undergraduate research experiences as they seek to improve the decontamination
process of Escherichia coli O157:H7, non-typhoidal Salmonella and Listeria
monocytogenes bacteria to increase the shelf life of different foods by
utilizing elevated hydrostatic pressure/high pressure processing (HPP), mild
temperature, and natural antimicrobials.

The specific objectives of this project are to: 1) conduct a comprehensive
study to compare traditional heat-based pasteurization and HPP decontamination
process of Escherichia coli O157:H7, non-typhoidal Salmonella and Listeria
monocytogenes with mild temperature; 2) evaluate the synergistic effect of
natural antimicrobials combined with HPP to inactivate E. coli O157:H7, non-
typhoidal Salmonella and L. monocytogenes; and 3) investigate biofilm formation
of E. coli O157:H7, non-typhoidal Salmonella and L. monocytogenes over time on
stainless steel and plastic surfaces at different pressure stress and
temperatures. This project is expected to enhance foodborne pathogen
decontamination using the synergistic effect of less than 600mpa pressure
combined with other environmental factors such as mild temperatures and
antimicrobials that will assure the quality and fitness of food for
distribution. These results can also help food industries to validate existing
food decontamination processes and improve food cost effectiveness.
Additionally, the development of this research focus at Albany State University
will strengthen and improve the existing food safety knowledge, practice, and
attitudes of undergraduate students, as well as enhance the STEM education
learning experience.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
