Pseudo-random number generators are a critical component of many computational
techniques including algorithms based on Monte Carlo methods. The emergence of
parallel computers, particularly MIMD systems capable of many independent
calculations, requires the development of parallel pseudo-random number
generators if their range of applicability is to reach its full potential. This
research will extend and generalize previous analytical results which represent
generators for parallel processors. In parallel applications the correlations
between generators on different processors are as important as correlations
within a single sequential generator. Promising generators will be tested in an
actual MIMD environment within a Monte Carlo calculation that solves the
electronic structure Schrodinger equation for small clusters of helium atoms;
however, effective generators will be useful in any parallel Monte Carlo
calculation.
