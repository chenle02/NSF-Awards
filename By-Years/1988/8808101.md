This international conference on Nonstandard Analysis will feature a series of
five principal talks given by Professors H. J. Keisler, Ed Nelson, and Ed
Perkins. There will be a number of special sessions covering a variety of topics
including applications to probability, mathematical physics, mathematical
economics, functional analysis, and differential equations and dynamical
systems. Some support is available for participants, including graduate
students. The conference will be held July 31 - August 6, 1988 on the Smith
College campus, and is under the direction of Professor Frank Wattenberg of the
Mathematics Department at the University of Massachusetts. Nonstandard Analysis
is a field of mathematics known for its techniques for analyzing limiting
phenomena.
