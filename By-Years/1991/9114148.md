The intense heat sources associated with laser processing of materials often
affect the microstructure of the part being processed. For example, in laser
beam welding, the resulting high cooling rates tend to produce brittle
microstructures in high hardenability materials. Such materials are normally
pre-heated before welding and may also be subjected to post-weld heat treatment.
Conventional pre-heating and post-weld heat treatment are often either too
expensive or impractical to use. Such heat treatments reduce productivity and
may affect other parts of the material. To eliminate these problems, the
researcher's will investigate the split-beam laser welding concept, where the
laser beam will be split into two, resulting in a dual heat source. The leading
minor source will pre-heat the material while the major source will be used for
the actual welding. This pre-heat by the leading source will achieve the lower
cooling rate induced by conventional pre-heating in a single step. Such control
of microstructure by splitting of the laser beam can be extended to other
materials processing applications such as surface heat treatment. The work will
include a thermal analysis of the problem, followed by (and to a large extent
parallel with) an extensive experimental program both to verify the analyses,
and to elucidate the potential benefits of the split-beam laser materials
processing concept. The experimental task will constitute the bulk of the
research project.
