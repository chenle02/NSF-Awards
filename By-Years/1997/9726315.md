This award supports Dr. Stanford E. Woosley, a post-doctoral student, and a
graduate student from the University of California-Santa Cruz in a collaboration
with Wolfgang Hillebrandt of the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in
Garching bei MÂ¼nchen. The groups will combine their expertise to investigate the
evolution and dynamics of massive stars. These short-lived giants explode as
supernovae giving rise to entire new generations of stars, black holes, neutron
stars, and the elements that make up all matter. Specific topics to be
investigated are evolution of massive stars, the evolution of the progenitor of
the bright supernova SN 1987A, the explosion mechanism for massive stars, the
explosion mechanism for massive stars, `failed supernovae,` models for gamma-ray
bursts based on the accretion of stellar-mass objects by black holes, and
neutrino-driven winds.
