Accelerated bone loss with age in Eskimo populations has interested
anthropologists for decades. It is hypothesized that diets high in protein and
acidity are a contributing factor in human bone replacement and bone loss
(osteopenia). The importance of diet is suggested by comparisons of pre- and
post-Contact Eskimos with Southwest Pueblo maize agriculturalists. This
dissertation project is designed to test the hypothesis of dietary influences
using controlled animal feeding experiments and human skeletal populations. In
addition to providing insight into prehistoric populations, this study
contributes to our understanding of skeletal changes among the elderly.
