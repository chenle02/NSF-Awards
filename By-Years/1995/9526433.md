9526433 Hooper This grant provide $119,529 as one-half support of the costs of
acquiring computer upgrades to replace antiquated control systems on an X-ray
fluorescence spectrometer (XRF) and inductively- coupled plasma-mass
spectrometer (ICP-MS) as well as obtaining a new energy dispersive spectrometer
with imaging capabilities and new crystals for the electron microprobe at the
GeoAnalytical Laboratory at Washington State University. This lab is heavily
used by members of the earth sciences community both within the Pacific
Northwest and elsewhere. These upgrades will allow uninterrupted, high-quality
whole rock analyses for outside users and both the continuation of the PI's
research on the petrology and geochemistry of flood basalts as well as multiple
and varied graduate and undergraduate research projects. ***
