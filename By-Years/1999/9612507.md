ABSTRACT 9612507 Fruehan This award provides phase out funding for the Carnegie
Mellon University Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Iron and
Steelmaking for its final year of support in the I/UCRC Program. The center
performs fundamental research in ironmaking, steelmaking, refining, and casting;
educates students with strong technical skills applicable to the steel and
steel-support industries; establishes a forum to discuss the long-term research
needs of the industry; and provides a mechanism for leveraging industrial funds
through cooperative research government support. In addition, the award supports
the NSF evaluator to provide data to the NSF to evaluate the performance of the
center.
