This proposal outlines three lines of work to build evaluation capacity. The
first line of work involves applying the techniques of "principled discovery" to
determine the complexities of contingent intervention effects using selected
EHR/STEM data sets. The second line of work is the design of a strategy for
evaluation portfolio management. The expected result is a guide for the
allocation of evaluation resources to different types of evaluation studies. The
third line of work is the development and institutionalization of effective ways
to report and disseminate key evaluation findings to the press at AEA meetings.
Collectively these three activities should contribute not only to evaluation
capacity, but also to research and evaluation in general.
