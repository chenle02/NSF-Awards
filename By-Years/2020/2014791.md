The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project is to protect American workers and the environment from leaks of
methane, the primary chemical in natural gas and landfill gas. At high
concentrations, methane gas is explosive and can be harmful or fatal if inhaled.
Methane leak detection is currently conducted by skilled technicians using
handheld sensors, an expensive and labor-intensive process that can be unsafe.
This project aims to build low-cost monitoring stations that can automate the
methane leak detection process and allow remote real-time monitoring. This
project will develop algorithms for low-cost monitoring hardware used in outdoor
settings typical of active oil and gas fields and landfills. The research will
enhance the precision and accuracy of outdoor methane leak detection while
making it affordable for industry and thereby reducing methane
leaks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed SBIR Phase I project will advance
algorithms to improve the performance of a low-cost and field-deployable
spectrophotometer for methane emissions monitoring. This project will develop a
field spectrometer that can operate autonomously in outdoor environments without
calibration. Specifically, this project focuses on employing instrument-specific
methods for accuracy and precision enhancement and for rejecting confounding
effects. Classical multivariate modeling methods are improved upon with
instrument-specific wavelet methods to tolerate changes in the instrument
condition induced by environmental conditions. Additionally, an optimization of
the speciation method is proposed to reduce confounding effects due to the
presence of unknown gases and to generate a speciation quality
indicator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
