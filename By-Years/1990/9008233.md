Differential geometry of infinite dimensional manifolds is basic to the study
of quantum field theory. The principal investigator will extend his results on
iterated integrals and the Witten current for the Dirac operator developed under
the previous grant to the setting of supersymmetric conformal field theory. He
will continue his development of analytic tools for loop spaces. These include
logarithmic Sobolev inequalities, singular integral estimates, deRham cohomology
and the Feynman- Kac formula. Lastly, he will investigate applications of
Connes' theory of non-commutative differential geometry including links to
quantum field theory. Classical field theory involves assigning to each point of
four-dimensional space-time a vector or scalar quantity such as the electrical
field or temperature. In quantum field theory usually some sort of operator or
function is assigned to each point in space-time. Using inner products, from
these operators an observable quantity may result which then can be checked by
repeated experimentation. In this project subtle properties of quantum fields
will be investigated using infinite dimensional hypersurfaces and a
mathematician's tool known as loop spaces.
