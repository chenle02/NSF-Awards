This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) project focuses on
computational and statistical methods to evaluate comparative genetic map data.
Two new statistical approaches, the colinearity test and the genome matrix, will
be explored and developed further. Both methods will be applied to an existing
biological problem that needs reassessment - the comparative map of the grasses.
Both methods will be implemented in computer programs that will be released to
the scientific community. Eventually, these methods will prove useful not only
for interpreting comparative genetic map data but also for interpreting physical
map and comparative sequence data.
