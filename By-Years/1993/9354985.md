9354985 Sowder Five graduate research traineeships are being requested for the
new doctoral program being offered jointly by San Diego State University and
University of California, San Diego. The goals of the program are to educate
individuals who will be well-versed both in a subject area (mathematics,
physics, chemistry, or biology) and in the cognitive issues related to learning
that subject; who will maintain a strong connection to educational practice
through teaching and applying research to instruction and assessment and who
will influence the educational process through their contributions as
researchers, educators, administrators, and developers of formal and informal
educational materials. This program results from a partnership between
interdisciplinary faculty groups at the two universities. Each partner brings
distinct and complementary contributions to the program. Together, these two
faculties provide a unique approach to the fields of mathematics and science
education, an approach that is simultaneously based on the changing natures of
mathematics and science and their place in undergraduate education and on the
learning and teaching of basic science and mathematics concepts. The
traineeships will allow an additional five applicants to be admitted to the
program. Special efforts will be made to recruit from underrepresented groups.
