This grant is to support a proposal requesting funds for travel grants to
support U.S. logicians participating in the IXth International Congress of
Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of Science to be held in August in Uppsala,
Sweden. This Congress provides one of the principal international summer
meetings for logicians; this year its importance is increased due to the fact
that the Congress includes the 1991 European Summer Meeting of the Association
for Symbolic Logic. American representation at this meeting is important not
only for the benefit of researchers from other countries, but also for the
Americans themselves. Being large and drawing from many different subjects, this
meeting offers a singular chance for a researcher to understand the possible
connections that his/her own work has on other areas of the mathematical
sciences.
