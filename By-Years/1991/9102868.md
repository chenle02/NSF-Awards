This grant will support a symposium, November 15 and 16, l991 at the University
of Texas at Austin, on the research areas of automatic theorem proving and
artificial intelligence. The symposium will be held in honor of Woodrow Bledsoe,
a leading figure in combining the resolution and equality approaches of
traditional automated reasoning with the heuristic approaches of artificial
intelligence to achieve high performance inference. The symposium will provide
an opportunity to analyze recent programs in these areas and to further the
interplay between them.
