This project aims to develop the probabilistic analysis of several problems of
Euclidean combinatorial optimization while principally focusing on concrete
questions involving minimal cost paths, minimum spanning trees, Steiner trees,
and minimal cost matchings. One critical line of investigation concerns the
possibility of a central limit theorem for subadditive Euclidean functionals,
especially for the length of the minimal spanning tree of a random sample.
Connections between this problem and the theory of continuum percolation are
strong, and progress in either of these two areas can be expected to have useful
impact on the other. The overall significance of the project comes in part from
the fact that probabilistic methods in the theory of algorithms have already led
to a number of well acknowledged computational breakthroughs, and additionally,
from the observation that computational problems have many sustained
interactions with topics that are central to probability theory, like the theory
of martingale inequalities, Gaussian processes, and empirical processes. This
project aims to develop the applications of probabilistic methods to problems
that are of concern to computer scientists, operations researchers, and others
who engage questions of optimization of discrete systems. The particular feature
of the problems of main interest to the proposal is that of a close connection
between geometry, optimization, and natural probability models for random sets
of points in Euclidean space.
