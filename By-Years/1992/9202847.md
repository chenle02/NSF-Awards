This project will extend the PI's current investigations on chemical mediation
of seaweed-herbivore and invertebrate-predator interactions to include: (1)
complex interactions of prey nutritional value with chemical and structural prey
defenses, (2) an understanding of how larval and spore defenses differ from
those of the adult, and why (exposure to different consumers?, increased
exposure to UV without adult structures that provide shade?, etc.), and (3) the
role of learned aversion by vertebrate versus invertebrate consumers in
affecting both prey and consumer dynamics. Because benthic seaweeds and
invertebrates play a trophically and ecologically important role in near-shore
communities and are rich sources of novel secondary metabolites that function as
defenses against consumers and have potential applications as pharmaceuticals,
agrochemicals, and growth regulating substances, understanding how these
organisms respond chemically to ecological and environmental threats can provide
fundamental information about how marine systems function, and can suggest
strategies for applied uses of marine natural products.
