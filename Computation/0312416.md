Luo The imvestigator studies conditions under which certain convex cones can be
represented or approximated by linear images of the positive semidefinite matrix
cone. These conditions are the essential tools for the exact finite
reformulation of semi-infinite constraints arising from robust optimization. The
project focusses on cones of nonnegative mappings and applications to robust
optimization, analysis of interior point methods for adaptive filtering and
robust beamforming, and efficient optimization methods for the design and
analysis of multi-user communication systems and for decoding and detection in
multi-input-multi-output wireless communication channels. The theoretical issues
are all strongly motivated by the need to develop efficient optimization
algorithms for problems in signal processing and digital communication systems.
The project aims at developing new computational techniques to solve problems in
the information and communication technology area. The latter area has, over the
last thirty years, been relying mostly on traditional numerical optimization
methods, which can run into difficulty when the problem size becomes large or
when data rate is high. In this project, the investigator studies ways to use
state-of-the-art optimization techniques and computational tools to resolve some
well-known computational bottlenecks from the information and communication
technology area.
