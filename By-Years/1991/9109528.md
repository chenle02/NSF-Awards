An exchange network is comprised of people or other units such as organizations
interconnected in a group. The participants are occupants of positions in the
network, and the connections between any two participants or collectively in the
group as a whole may be exclusive or inclusive. Inclusion occurs when two or
more exchanges must be completed for a benefit to be realized from any of the
exchanges. This condition is in contrast to exclusion which occurs when only one
exchange must be completed for a benefit to be realized. Having to make many
exchanges is seen as weakening power or control. The aim of this research is to
examine inclusion as a basis for power in exchange networks. A series of
experiments investigates a variety of networks in order to quantitatively
determine the joint effect of inclusion and exclusion and tests a theory that
predicts that the effect of inclusion increases with the number of exchanges but
is completely eliminated when exclusion is also present. The study of the
condition of exclusion has dominated research on exchange networks. This project
will contribute to the understanding of power relations in exchange networks by
systematically investigating the condition of inclusion.
