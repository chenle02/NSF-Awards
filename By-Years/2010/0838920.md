Abstract

Georgia Tech investigators will provide an improved data synthesis in the area
of air-sea interaction, combining available satellite data, historic and recent
field observations and improved turbulent flux models for the high wind
conditions that are so common in the Southern Ocean. A proposed new ~20 year
flux climatology for Southern Ocean atmospheric exchanges of heat, water vapor
and momentum will be produced. This is necessary for continued refinement of our
understanding of the variability of coupled ocean-atmosphere processes and their
important feedbacks into the global climate system. In several instances both
the magnitude and even the sign of the Southern hemisphere air-sea flux terms is
uncertain. A broader impact goal is the establishment of a web-site aimed at
scientific users of new in-situ and flux data sets for the Southern Ocean, along
with the development of seminar courses at GIT.
