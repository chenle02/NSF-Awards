NSF support is requested for a symposium designed to serve as an inspiration to
women studying, working, and teaching in STEM fields. The symposium will be held
October 5 and 6, 2018, at the Babson Executive Conference Center in Wellesley,
Massachusetts. This symposium will bring together women at all career stages in
STEM, with the goal of connecting women and strengthening their connections in
their fields. The award will help fund room rental costs as well as travel and
hotel costs for the three keynote speakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As is well
documented, women continue to be underrepresented in the sciences. Although a
higher percentage of women than men currently earn college degrees, fewer women
go into STEM fields, and those who do are more likely to drop out. This
symposium offers a venue for discussing issues of recruiting and retention, as
well as broadening the participation of the STEM
workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
