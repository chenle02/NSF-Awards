9413808 Jensen This award provides for the following research and teaching
equipment: a five-axis milling machine and tooling, a scientific data and
visualization computer system, surface measurement instruments (optical
comparator, toolmaker's microscope, etc.), piezoceramic actuators/sensors
interfaced to an adaptive controller, and cutting tools with internally mounted
heat and force sensors and associated telemetry systems. This equipment will be
used in five research programs and in the Mechanical and Manufacturing
Engineering curriculums at Brigham Young University. Interdisciplinary efforts
using this equipment will continue their focus on the elimination of machining
errors and the subsequent hand finishing of complex sculptured machined parts.
Coupled with the funding of this request, more extensive research will study
aspects of complex machining of sculptured parts. The impact to the nation's
manufacturing infrastructure could be a substantial decrease in the cost to
manufacture molds and precision machined parts for the automotive, aerospace and
plastic industries. This research will help restore competitiveness to the
American machine tool, mold, and die industries which have seen a continued loss
of business to overseas competition during the past decade.
