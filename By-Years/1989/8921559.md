This dissertation research focuses on explaining the emergence of the post-World
War II research-policymaking apparatus in the United States. The research will
determine how science policy's present development has been shaped by the
decisions made during the period prior to the war until the establishment of the
National Science Foundation in 1950. In addition, this project will describe and
analyze current proposals for reorganizing research policymaking in the United
States. The project will involve archival research as well as analysis of
scholarly and popular materials. Historical research and an institutional
analysis of the current political climate will provide the basis for assessing
the prospects for implementation of any of the current proposals.
