The PI will develop a theoretical framework with regard to a new hypothesis on
the cause and effect of the water cycle. The hypothesis will be examined using
both physical and observational arguments. Based on his conceptual model of
maximum entropy production, the PI will consider a differentially heated ocean-
atmosphere system with a poleward heat transport and will calculate meridionally
changing quantities such as the transport of atmospheric water. The hypothesis
is that the hydrological cycle is coupled to surface temperature and the energy
transport. This theoretical study has implications for the representation of the
water cycle in general circulation models.
