They will continue their muSR studies in solid state physics. A major emphasis
will be on the new high Tc superconductors and related compounds. They will
continue to determine depolarization rates for these materials and especially
the newer ones, make measurements on single crystals and investigate both
experimentally and theoretically the field distributions from the magnetic
vortices. The more classic superconductors will also be studied. Magnetic
structure will be searched for in the compounds related to these systems to look
for unpaired electrons. Hydrides will be studied with emphasis shifting to
amorphous systems. They will begin studies of conducting polymers. The
experimental program will take place at Brookhaven National Laboratory and at
TRIUMF.
