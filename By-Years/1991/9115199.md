The PI has been using the NCAR community climate model version one (CCM1)
coupled with a mixed layer ocean to study the climatic effects of CO2 and other
trace gases (OTGs) CH4, N2O, CFC13 and CF2C12. His experiments suggest that OTGs
provide an important heating source to the earth-atmospheric climate system.
Because the radiative-forcing behavior of CO2 is very different from the OTGs,
the PI's model simulations show that different radiative forcing can lead to
quite different climatic effects. This research program will continue the study
with emphasis on the climatic feedback. Three tasks are proposed. First a
detailed diagnosis of CCM1 simulations with focus on climate feedback. Second,
use of the CCM2 to study the climatic effects of C02 and OTGs. CCM2 includes
major improvements in physical and dynamical parameterization and is much more
realistic for climate studies. Therefore, comparisons of the climatic effects
due to atmospheric trace gases between CCM1 and CCM2 offer a unique opportunity
to study their sensitivity to model formulations. The third task is to evaluate
the feedback effect of cloud optical properties, which has been identified
potentially to be a strong negative feedback mechanism during climate changes.
This research is important because it seeks to increase understanding of how
trace gases influence climate.
