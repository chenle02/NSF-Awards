The award provides funding to help defray the expenses of U.S. participants in
the "Conference in Analysis and Partial Differential Equations" that will be
held July 7-12, 2013, on the campus of the University of British Columbia in
Vancouver, Canada.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program for this event will include
presentations on a variety of topics in the theory and application of partial
differential equations (e.g. optimal transport, calculus of variations,
Liouville-type theorems for nonlinear elliptic systems). The participants
include many of the recognized world leaders in the field. The conference
program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other
young scientists to present their work.
