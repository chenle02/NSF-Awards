This is a study of the science and technology policies of six American states
that differ in the level of their industrialization and the size of their
science and technology base. The investigators will conduct interviews and
collect documents for case study analysis of both antecedents and effects of
policies in New Jersey, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Washington, California, and
Rhode Island. Hypotheses identify several factors that may favor development of
science and technology policy: predisposing structural conditions, economic
transformation and stress, state political capacity, business leaders,
involvement of the mass public, and state governor initiative. Factors that may
oppose development of science and technology policy are: individualistic or
traditional political culture, traditional businesses, labor unions, minority
and community groups, agricultural and rural interests, elements of the mass
public, state legislators, and state economic development agencies. This study
will provide many insights of value for policy makers in the areas of science,
technology and economic development. It will also contribute to our
understanding of regional differences within the United States, and to the role
that central institutions of society play in determining state's responses to
the challenges and opportunities created by rapidly- changing science and
technology.
