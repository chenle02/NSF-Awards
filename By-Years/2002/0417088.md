Mechanisms of Chromosome Breakage and Rearrangements Induced by Repeats that
Adopt DNA Secondary Structures

Chromosomes of many eukaryotic organisms including humans contain a large
number of repetitive sequences. Several types of commonly present DNA repeats
can be arranged in sequence motifs which are able to adopt hairpin and cruciform
secondary structures. Inverted repeats, AT- and GC-rich micro- and
minisatellites comprising this class of sequence motifs are frequently found in
chromosomal regions that are prone to gross rearrangements such as
translocations, deletions, inversions and amplifications. Recent studies
indicate that a double-strand break (DSB) occurring at the sites of the inverted
repeats (IRs) and long tracks of CTG/CAG triplet repeats can be an initial event
in generation of chromosome rearrangements. However, little is currently known
about the mechanisms underlying this type of genetic instability. The overall
goal of this study is to understand the mechanisms by which repeats that have
potential to form hairpins and cruciforms can initiate DSB's and subsequent
chromosome aberrations. The study will be done using a newly developed model
system in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The specific objectives are (1) to
determine the molecular mechanisms by which hairpin- or cruciform-associated
DSB's lead to gross chromosomal rearrangements; and (2) to identify genetic
pathways that contribute to DSB formation at the sites of unstable repeats. The
information obtained as a result of this research will improve the knowledge of
molecular events responsible for chromosome instability. The research heavily
relies on the active participation of undergraduate and graduate students. The
research team carrying out this study is expected to include female researchers
and minorities, who will be recruited from the student population at Georgia
Institute of Technology.
