John Walz Abstract The traditional methods for studying deposition of colloidal
particles onto solid surfaces are the rotating disc and packed bed experiments.
When the results of such experiments are compared with current theoretical
models, substantial discrepancy is frequently observed. Possible reasons for
this disagreement include the large number of factors affecting the deposition
rate and the fact that the measured rate in these experiments represents an
average over many particles and capture sites. This research proposes a new
approach to studying particle capture through the use of two novel optical
techniques: total internal reflection microscopy (TIRM) and radiation pressure
(or "optical tweezers"). These techniques will allow measurement of the
deposition rate of a single particle at a fixed position on a solid surface to
be taken under carefully controlled conditions. The objective will be to measure
the effect of specific factors on the rate of particle capture. The experimental
apparatus will be designed such that ionic strength, viscosity, fluid velocity,
particle size, and net particle weight can be adjusted. The results of these
measurements will provide new insight into deposition mechanisms applied in a
large variety of industrial processes.
