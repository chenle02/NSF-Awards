This project involves research in ergodic theory. Ergodic theory in general
concerns understanding the average behavior of systems whose dynamics is too
complicated or chaotic to be followed in microscopic detail. The particular work
to be undertaken by Professors Lind and Tuncel is in the area of "symbolic
dynamics". A symbolic dynamical system is a collection of two-way infinite
strings of symbols from a finite alphabet. These strings satisfy a formation
rule which specifies which symbols are allowed to follow which as one moves
along the string. Symbolic dynamical systems have recently found widespread
application in the modelling of data transmission. Some of the particular areas
of investigation will involve the dynamics of commuting automorphisms of compact
groups, the construction of Markov partitions using self-similar tilings of the
plane, and codings and invariants of Markov chains. The work stresses
interactions between the fields of ergodic theory, algebra, and geometry.
