There is a present need to characterize trace elements in electronic materials
at impurity levels of sub parts-per-billion. This award is for the development
of such an instrument for stable trace element analysis of electronic materials
using Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS). While AMS has been applied to
radioisotope determinations with extremely high sensitivities, existing AMS
instruments are not designed for stable element analysis and can not adequately
perform these measurements without extensive modifications. We propose an
instrument with an ultra-low sample-contamination UHV sputter ion source which
injects mass-analyzed negative secondary ions from the sample into a 3 MV tandem
accelerator. During tandem acceleration, electrons are stripped from the ions;
for charge states greater than 2+, only atomic ions survive. Momentum/charge and
energy/charge discrimination, followed by velocity and total energy detection,
provide unambiguous elemental identification with a sensitivity of 1 part-per-
trillion. The proposed instrument will provide a super-sensitive trace analysis
technique which is applicable to a large variety of samples.
