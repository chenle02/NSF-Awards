9406959 Ma The Department of Mathematics at the Southwest Texas State University
will purchase a SUN SparcServer 1000 which will be dedicated to the support of
research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for several
research projects, including in particular: 1.) Extremal Cayley Digraphs on
Finite Cyclic Groups, proposed by Xingde Jia; and 2.) Monomial Conjecture - A
Computational Approach, proposed by Yonghao Ma
