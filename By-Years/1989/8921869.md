The sixth International Conference of Archaeozoology (ICAZ) will be held in
Washington, DC on May 21-25, 1990. To date, over 400 individuals have expressed
interest in attending and most plan to present papers. This National Science
Foundation will provide travel and subsistence expenses for a minimum of 20
participants. Archaeozoology is a discipline concerned with the analysis and
interpretation of zoological remains from archaeological sites. Analysis of such
fauna provides several kinds of crucial information to archaeologists. It
provides insight into the diet of different prehistoric groups. As complex
societies such as states develop, faunal remains yield crucial data on the
development of economic and market systems and the centralization of political
authority. They also shed light on prehistoric hunting and herding strategies
and how these developed over time. Finally, analysis of faunal remains provides
importance evidence on past climates and environments and how they were affected
by human groups. Because archaeozoology is a broad intellectual field with many
practitioners in both the Old and New Worlds, communication is extremely
important. The ICAZ conferences have offered an very successful way to meet this
need, and the Washington meeting should prove no exception. NSF support will
assure that the most important papers will be presented. American science will
benefit because U.S. researchers will be exposed to the most significant work
now carried out in other parts of the world.
