AST-0206051 Halpern, Jules P.

The successful program of discovering and characterizing the optical afterglows
of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) using the two telescopes of the MDM Observatory will
be continued and expanded to take advantage of the increased event rate and
prompt positions expected from the HETE-2 and Swift space missions, and to
incorporate infrared photometry. In the first year of this three-year program,
target-of-opportunity observations will be continued based on approximately 6-8
bursts per year in the northern hemisphere that are located within hours by the
BeppoSAX, RXTE, and/or HETE-2 satellites. In the second and third years,
beginning with the year 2003 launch of Swift, the expected localization rate
will increase to the point at which it will become feasible to schedule
specific, coordinated observing programs on both telescopes. It will become
possible for this team to make optical identifications within minutes of a GRB
event, which affords the opportunity to obtain multicolor optical light curves
on the MDM 1.3m telescope, and either infrared light curves or time-dependent
absorption-line studies on the MDM 2.4m. The investigators will be able to
respond in a prompt, coordinated way to about a dozen such localizations per
year. These data will be used to study the temporal decay and spectral evolution
of GRB afterglows in order to diagnose the energetics of the fireball, and to
diagnose the circumstellar environments in which these explosions occur, e.g.,
uniform ISM, stellar wind, or superbubble. ***
