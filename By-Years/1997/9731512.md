HUNEKE, 97-31512 This award supports research in commutative algebra and
algebraic geometry. The principal investigator will continue to investigate a
group of long standing questions centered around the process of reduction to
positive characteristic, especially in regard to the developing theory of tight
closure. Particular emphasis will be placed on the relationship between tight
closure, reduction to positive characteristic, and vanishing theorems in
algebraic geometry such as the Kodaira vanishing theorem. Closely related work
will be done on questions concerning uniform bounds in Noetherian rings, and in
particular on the uniform Artin-Rees conjectures. This is research in the
closely related fields of commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. In essence
these fields are quite similar to the 19th century study of equations and their
solutions. The relationship between algebraic equations, such as polynomial
equations, and geometry goes back at least to Descartes and the idea of
coordinatizing the plane. Commutative algebra studies the solutions of such
polynomial or power series equations by forming an algebraic object, called a
ring, which consists of the 'generic' solutions. The algebraic properties of
these generic solutions then give insight into the geometric and algebraic
nature of the equations. The field combines techniques from a number of other
areas including combinatorics, topology, and analysis.
