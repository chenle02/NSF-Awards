An experimental study is proposed to investigate the heat transfer enhancement
due to longitudinal vortices in plate-fin channels of compact heat exchangers,
generated by projections punched out of base fin material. Smoke injection and
liquid crystal tracer particles would be used for flow and temperature field
visualizations. Local and overall heat transfer coefficients and pressure drops
would be obtained. Results would be documented in the form of correlations for f
and Nu, that are developed on the basis of phenomenological assessment of the
flow field.
