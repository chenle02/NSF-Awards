CBET-0811639, Sharfstein&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monoclonal antibodies and Fc-
fusion proteins produced in cultured mammalian cells represent a significant
fraction of the recently approved and pipeline biopharmaceuticals, providing
critical new therapies for diseases such as breast cancer and rheumatoid
arthritis. Despite the widespread use of mammalian cell cultures for production
of immunoglobulins and immunoglobulin-like compounds, many fundamental questions
about cell physiology and culture conditions, and their role in production of
these proteins, remain unanswered. In particular, elevated culture osmolarity,
whether directly applied or as a result of feeding strategies, has been shown
been shown to increase specific productivity but to decrease overall viable cell
density. This project is a multidisciplinary research program to understand the
physiological responses of cultured mammalian cells to hyperosmolarity and to
design cellular and process engineering strategies to optimize protein
production in response to
hyperosmolarity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
