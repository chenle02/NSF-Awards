Plant productivity is largely dependent on the photosynthesis rate of leaf
canopies throughout the growing season. Because the environment surrounding a
leaf is constantly changing, plants must modify the photosynthetic apparatus to
compensate for the effect of environmental change if they are to maintain high
rates of productivity. While recent work has focused on elucidating mechanisms
of the photosynthetic response to rapid, short-term change in the environment,
understanding of the mechanisms driving acclimation to seasonal, long-term
change is limited. This work will study the mechanisms controlling the
acclimation of photosynthesis to long-term changes in the environment,
specifically light and CO2. The principal hypothesis is that following a change
in light intensity or ambient CO2 level, the amount of protein invested in the
component processes of the photosynthetic apparatus will be adjusted so that a
balance is maintained between each step in the photosynthetic pathway. Thus, if
a change in the environment leads to a single step limiting photosynthesis,
nitrogen and carbon would be reallocated from nonlimiting processes and invested
into the limiting process, increasing the rate of the limiting process and the
overall photosynthesis rate. In fully acclimated plants, resources may be
allocated optimally so that no single step limits photosynthesis. This work will
improve understanding of the factors limiting growth, photosynthesis, and
resource use efficiency in realistic environments. Our ability to identify
beneficial traits, and to model and predict the performance of crop as well as
wild plants will be substantially enhanced. In light of the significant change
in global environments, particularly with respect to atmospheric warming and
rising CO2, an improved ability to predict how plants respond to long-term
environmental change will be invaluable for estimating the impact of global
change on natural and agricultural ecosystems.
