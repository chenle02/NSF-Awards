In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division, Kent Kirshenbaum of New York University will
explore novel N-alkyl glycine oligomers, peptoids, with folding capabilities
that engender unique three-dimensional structures and valuable functions.
Peptoid oligomers will be synthesized to include a specific sequence of a large
variety of N-substituted glycine monomer units, and a native chemical ligation
strategy will be used to piece together peptoid oligomer fragments into complex
sequences. Work will be performed in tandem with computational chemists in order
to establish guidelines for folding peptoid macromolecules and peptide-peptoid
hybrids into ordered tertiary structures. The long-term objective is to learn
the rules that govern peptoid folding and to establish a predictable
relationship between the sequence, the structure and the function of peptoid
oligomers. The broader impacts will include training undergraduate and graduate
students across the disciplines of synthetic organic chemistry, polymer
chemistry, macromolecular science, and chemical biology. The project will also
expand a highly successful NSF-supported science outreach effort at New York
University, the Experimental Cuisine Collective. Presentations to the public
will include discussing the roles of different macromolecules in diet and human
health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will examine how to
synthesize large molecular structures that mimic the sequence and three-
dimensional structures of proteins. The development of such systems could
address critical unmet needs in pharmacology and could provide new strategies
for the discovery of enzyme-like catalysts. The science outreach activities will
educate the public regarding the science of food and cooking, creating a venue
for the discussion of chemistry principles and their influence in everyday
phenomena.
