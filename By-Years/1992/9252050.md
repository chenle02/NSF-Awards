This project provides equipment to enhance the hands-on experimentation and data
processing capabilities of the environmental sciences laboratory at Muskingum
Area Technical College. The equipment consists of six Hach spectrophotometers
interfaced with six personal computers; six wet chemistry labs are being
established in the same facility to complete the enhancement. The additional
equipment will allow for more experiments and data collection and analysis to be
completed by students in seven different courses in the regular curriculum, and
at least two of the special problems courses that are offered each year.
Muskingum Tech's environmental sciences program meets the training needs in a
three county service district and beyond, and offers associates degrees in
Environmental Resources Management (ERM) and Parks, Recreation, and Wildlife
(PRW). Hands-on training is offered in spills management, resource management,
water and air pollution control, hazardous materials management, groundwater
hydrology, and a variety of other areas. Faculty members have designed a
laboratory to maximize the potential use of space and of laboratory time to
enhance the hands-on learning experience of students. The result will be
graduates who are better-prepared for immediate employment or upper-division
work.
