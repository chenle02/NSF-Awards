0230782&lt;br/&gt;Sooyong Lee&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
supports a planning visit for developing collaborative research work in
autonomous robot navigation with researchers at Korea Institute of Science and
Technology (KIST) in Korea. Autonomous robot navigation is one of the key areas
in mobile robots that would be used for various applications such as vacuuming,
remote monitoring, and transporting disabled or elderly
people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
