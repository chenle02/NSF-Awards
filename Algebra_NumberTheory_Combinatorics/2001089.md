Algebraic varieties are a class of geometric objects obtained by gluing together
sets of solutions of polynomial equations. In string theory, a branch of
theoretical physics, algebraic varieties are used to describe fine pieces of our
universe. In this theory, everything is made of tiny strings which travel
through spacetime, and trace out algebraic curves in some algebraic varieties.
Gromov-Witten invariants, originating from physics, are virtual counts of
algebraic curves in algebraic varieties satisfying prescribed incidence
constraints. They are used in physic to describe the structures of our universe.
They also provide new approaches and insights to classical problems from
algebraic geometry. Despite their importance, these invariants are very
difficult to compute. The primary goal of this project is to develop a new
method to calculate Gromov-Witten invariants by investigating the boundary of
the gauged linear sigma model from physics using tools of logarithmic structures
from algebraic geometry. This project provides research training opportunities
for graduate students.

In more detail, this project focuses on studying the geometry of the gauged
linear sigma model (GLSM) using stable log maps of Abramovich-Chen-Gross-
Siebert. The GLSM proposed by Witten in the 1990s can be viewed as a deep
generalization of the hyper-plane property of Gromov-Witten invariants in all
genus. However, the moduli stacks in GLSM which carry the perfect obstruction
theory for defining GLSM invariants are in general non-proper. This presents a
major difficulty in calculating GLSM invariants. Recently, log compactifications
of hybrid-type GLSM were constructed by Chen, Janda, and Ruan using stable log
maps. These compactifications provide proper moduli stacks carrying a reduced
perfect obstruction theory whose associated virtual cycles recover the GLSM
virtual cycles. This project is an integrated study aiming at a new
computational method for calculating Gromov-Witten invariants by investigating
the structures of the virtual cycles of these log compactifications.
