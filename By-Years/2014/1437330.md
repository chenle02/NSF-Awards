The cell nuclear envelope is the physical barrier between the cytoplasm and the
nucleus. The envelope regulates gene expression by allowing the access of
proteins to DNA through passageways called nuclear pores. The nuclear envelope
is unique in that it has two lipid bilayers (not one as is the case with cell
membranes). The bilayers are maintained at a regular (and large) distance of
nearly 45 nm. How these two bilayers are maintained at that regular spacing, and
how they fuse together to form nuclear pores are current open questions in
biology; this award is focused on answering these questions. By discovering an
explanation for protein-mediated control of bilayer separation, this research
will ultimately help develop new strategies for treating diseases that have been
linked to mutations in the nuclear envelope proteins. The research program will
provide opportunities to recruit outstanding students from underrepresented
groups at the University of Houston (UH) and the University of Florida (UF). The
findings of the research will be disseminated through journal publications,
conference presentations and graduate and undergraduate courses at UH and
UF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will promote a collaborative partnership
between investigators involving experiments, modeling and simulations to
elucidate the fundamental physics that underlies nuclear lipid bilayer
structure. The experimental work will discover how SUN proteins, which are
conserved across different eukaryotic cell types and link the nucleus to the
cytoskeleton maintain lipid bilayer structure and integrity. Theoretical work
will seek to interpret the experimental findings in the framework of continuum
mechanics, by computing the energetics of bilayer separation and fusion. The
numerical and experimental findings will be used together to explain the
mechanism of bilayer separation.
