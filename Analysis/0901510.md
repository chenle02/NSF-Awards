The theory of von Neumann algebras is a non-commutative integration theory
which was first developed by F. Murray and J. von Neumann as a tool for
understanding representation theory for groups as well as providing a
mathematical framework for quantum mechanics. Recently the appearance of new
rigidity phenomena in von Neumann algebras has led to deeper understanding and
to the solutions to many longstanding problems both in von Neumann algebras and
in other areas such as orbit equivalence ergodic theory and measurable
equivalence relations. There has also emerged recently a connection between
deformation/rigidity theory, free probability, group cohomology, and
derivations/quantum Dirichlet forms on von Neumann algebras. It is the intent of
this author to investigate these new connections in order to gain more
understanding of the relationship which is developing, and to use this
understanding in order to approach some deep problems from new perspectives.
