0138153&lt;br/&gt;Keniston &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award
supports research experiences in India for graduate students at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The opportunity for students to
conduct research is a new component of MIT's international program in India,
which currently supports experiences in industry and teaching. Funding from
NSF's Office of International Science &amp; Engineering will enable four MIT
graduate students to do research at some of India's leading centers of research
and higher education. The program is designed to integrate them into
groundbreaking research at India's finest institutions, allow them to explore
careers in research, and finally, to give them global experience early on in
their education and training. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: The PI is well
connected with Indian institutions/researchers and has recently completed a term
as visiting professor at the Nehru Centre for Advanced Studies, Indian Institute
of Science (IISc), Bangalore. His collaborations with Indian colleagues at the
IISc, the Indian Institute of Information Technology, the Indian Institute of
Technology-Madras, and the National Centre for Biological Sciences have led to
the development of opportunities for students in leading edge areas of
telecommunications, information technology, genomics, and neurobiology. In
addition to providing a unique research experience for MIT graduate students, it
contributes to creating a globally-engaged workforce.
