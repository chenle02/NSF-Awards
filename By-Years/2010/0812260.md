This project focuses on enhancing existing document representations with
representations of semantic content at a subdocument granularity; representing
documents from multiple perspectives; and leveraging the attention and domain
knowledge of end-users to improve document representations. This will lead to
improvements in the retrievability of documents in future searches. The research
will provide one of the first systematic studies of the potential added value of
interpretation and labeling efforts contributed by a community of end users. In
addition to evaluating the results of this particular approach to improving
information retrieval, the work will contribute needed tools for evaluating
incrementally-added indexing. An outcome of the research will be evaluation
techniques that will be applicable to other research on incrementally-added
indexing. The project builds a successful, interdisciplinary collaboration with
the national, public, healthcare portal in Denmark, with strong participation
from the government partner as well as physicians in Denmark who help to design
the studies.&lt;br/&gt;
