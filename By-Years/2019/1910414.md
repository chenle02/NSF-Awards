Galaxies are the factories of cosmic creation. This project will simulate the
formation of galaxies using a supercomputer to understand how gas cycles in
galaxies. The broader impacts of this work will be felt through the mentoring of
early-career scientists in research and the wide dissemination of pedagogical
videos. These videos will share the results of this research and the methods
behind it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The circumgalactic medium (CGM) surrounding
galaxies serves as their fuel tank, waste dump, and recycling center. Inspired
by novel integral-field instruments, this project will compile a new public
database of spatially-resolved CGM observations and build new simulations to
address key problems in the formation of star-forming disks and galaxy
quenching. This project has two key science goals: (1) to pin down the
kinematics and metal content of CGM gas that may be accreting, escaping, or
recycling as disks form and evolve, and (2) to characterize the abundance and
kinematics of cold gas in the inner halos of passive galaxies as a constraint on
quenching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
