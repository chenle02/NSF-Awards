The Semiconductor Device Laboratory at the University of Virginia will purchase
a Reactive-Ion Etching system to support continuing advances in the technology
of devices for use at sub-millimeter radio wavelengths. This laboratory has
fabricated Schottky diodes which have been used successfully as radio-frequency
mixers at frequencies as high as 2500 Gigahertz. Devices for use at these
frequencies and beyond require dimensions of less than one micron. Such
dimensions are achieved only with difficulty and imperfectly by current methods
of chemical "wet" etching. Further advances in increasing maximum operating
frequency, reducing noise, and reducing conversion loss in sub-millimeter wave
devices require alternatives to wet chemical etching. The widely acknowledged
feasible and necessary alternative is Reactive-Ion (Dry) Etching.
