9406029 Wells The Death Valley region is the most extended crustal section in
the western Basin and Range Province. Numerous studies have led to two models
with varying predictions for the slip rates along the strike-slip faults. This
project will employ tectonic land forum techniques and new isotopic surface
dating methods to elucidate the rate and style of deformation of the Black
Mountains terrane in Death Valley, a parameter difficult to determine by other
means. Results will help discriminate between the competing models and should
also make a significant contribution to the application of isotope geochemical
techniques to geomorphology problems
