This award will provide partial support for a conference, organized by the
Engineering Foundation, on the "Future Directions for Lasers in Medicine and
Surgery". The conference will be held in late February, 1993 and will bring
together engineers, scientists, clinicians, and representatives from industry
and federal agencies. The conference will review the status of the field,
identify those areas where applied research and developmental efforts are needed
and those problems where fundamental technological research is warranted. The
areas of presentation and discussion that will be covered in this conference are
interdisciplinary in nature and specific to the biomedical focus area. Regular
meetings of professional societies are unlikely to have participation from all
the communities that will attend this conference. This conference should
stimulate research by biomedical engineers into important areas associated with
lasers in medicine. The results of this conference will be written and
distributed by the Engineering Foundation.
