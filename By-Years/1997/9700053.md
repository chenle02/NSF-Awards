The purpose of this research is to design and analyze discrete algorithms
solving hard combinatorial graph problems. Because many of these problems are
NP-hard, an exact solution is often not feasible; in such cases approximation
algorithms are a viable alternative. In addition to attacking approximation
problems that seem to require new strategies, a main goal is to investigate the
applicability of design principles developed successfully for traditional
discrete optimization problems to comparable tasks occurring in other areas, in
particular in Computational Molecular Biology and Operations Research. As
problems of very similar combinatorial flavor are found in different areas, it
can be expected that many solution methods are extendible as well. For example,
previous research has resulted in the comparison method to analyze the
approximation of the Maximum Independent Set problem for bounded degree graphs.
A bipartite graph is used to compare an optimal solution with a solution found
by an approximation algorithm. It can be expected that this method will have
many more applications. The research plan includes new approaches to algorithm
design applicable to various problems in algorithmic graph theory including
Steiner trees and the graph isomorphism problem. Another goal is to study the
limits of approximability by polynomial time algorithms. While several
spectacular results have been obtained in this area, for many approximation
problem the gap between the quality of the approximate solutions obtained in
polynomial time and the proven hardness results remains large.
