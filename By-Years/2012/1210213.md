This action funds Boon-Ling Yeo of University of California, Davis to conduct a
research project, entitled "Optimal Regulation and Management of Nitrogen to the
Atmospheric, Terrestrial, and Aquatic Ecosystems," during the summer of 2012 at
Motu Economic and Public Policy Research in Wellington, New Zealand. The host
scientist is Dr. Suzi Kerr.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in advancing environmental
management of a dynamic pollutant, which takes different forms in the
atmospheric, aquatic, and terrestrial ecosystems. The research provides novel
insights for developing an efficient multimedia pollution permit trading scheme
with rules governing trades both within and between airborne and waterborne
nitrogen emissions. The multidisciplinary nature of the research, which combines
biogeochemistry, economics, biology, and social sciences, can lead to a coupled
human-ecosystem-based approach for managing nitrogen pollution and connect
ecological research results to human demands for ecosystem services and
regulations.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
