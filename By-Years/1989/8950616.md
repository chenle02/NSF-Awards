The undergraduate biology offerings in General Zoology and Biology of
Invertebrates will be upgraded with new microscopy and photographic equipment.
The equipment will also be available for student research projects. Some of the
new equipment will replace obsolete equipment, some is new, and, since it will
be used in the Freshman course, large numbers of students will be affected by
this improvement in the undergraduate curriculum. The university will provide
50% matching funds.
