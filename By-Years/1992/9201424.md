This research project will extend the illustrative and informal models of
iteration in engineering design that are available at present. Formal methods
for guiding the refinement of engineering designs at each iteration will be
developed that permit the designer to make better decisions during the design
process. The set-based representation and manipulation of uncertainties in
engineering design developed previously will be extended to combine the
imprecise results from each design step to guide the next step. Since
engineering design informally converges to a solution (in most cases) now, we
believe that developing a formalism for guiding the design refinement will also
produce an understanding of the conditions under which the iterations are
convergent. This, of course, has profound implications for design, in that very
early indications of the possibility of convergence of several different
candidate designs may be able to guide the designer to pursue (at least
initially) those candidates with the best indications of convergence.
