This award is for support of research to study the portion of the West Antarctic
Ice Sheet which feeds in to the Ross Ice Shelf. Radar soundings by both airborne
and ground-based systems comprise the necessary elements of this research. These
activities are an essential part of the Siple Coast Project and the new WAIS
initiative which have as goals: 1) Determination of the configuration and mass
balance of the Siple Coast region of the West Antarctic ice sheet, 2)
Determination of the physical controls of ice flow in this region, and 3)
Prediction of the future behavior of this region using numerical models. These
models will be enhanced by an understanding of the relative motion between the
surface and bed in the grounded region just upstream of the grounding line.
