Proposal Number: ECS-9705704 Principal Investigator: C. L. Tang Title: Broadly
tunable femtosecond optical parametric sources In this research, the unique
capabilities of the femtosecond optical parametric sources developed by the PI
under a previous grant will be used to study carrier dynamics in semiconductors
and quantum well structures. The carrier dynamics studies will focus on carrier
capture and escape, and electron and hole dynamics in III-V compound
semiconductors (AlxGayAsz and GaAs). Compound semiconductors and quantum wells
are extremely important for microelectronics and laser applications. Direct
study of the carrier dynamics has been impossible to date due to the need for
both ultrafast and infrared spectral region probes to study the fast carrier
dynamics involved. The PI's development of the needed sources will enable a
first time direct study. Some further source development research, to extend the
range of the optical parametric oscillator (OPO) source from 330 nanometers to
18 microns, is also planned under this grant. This research will create a
broadly tunable source with a range extending from the near-ultraviolet to the
mid-infrared, which will be a powerful tool for many applications.
