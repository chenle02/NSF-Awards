Layered manufacturing refers to the fabrication of a physical part by depositing
material, layer-by-layer, under computer control. The fabrication of multi-
material structures as well as the embedding of prefabricated components is
possible using layered manufacturing. Mesoscopic devices and functioning
assemblies can also be made directly. The automation of layered manufacturing
depends on proper CAD representations of non-homogeneous objects and computer
algorithms for extracting process information from the CAD models. Present CAD
systems are unable to represent non-homogeneous and multi-material objects. This
project addresses these problems. Research tasks include the design and
implementation of algorithms and the subsequent fabrication of multi-material
parts in several media.
