9509847 Hu This U.S.-Argentina Cooperative Research grant will support the
collaborative research of Dr. Bei-Lok Hu and three advanced graduate students
from the University of Maryland College Park with Drs. Esteban Calzetta, Juan
Pablo Paz, and Diego Mazzitelli of the University of Buenos Aires in quantum
statistical field theory in gravitation and cosmology. Themes to be investigated
include decoherence and quantum-to-classical transition; galaxy formation in
inflationary cosmology; phase transition in the early universe, and general
relativity as an effective theory. The experienced collaborators have probed the
laws of nature and the structure of space-time at the Planck scale, obtaining
results on early universe and black hole processes. The concepts and techniques
of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and the formalisms of quantum
stochastic field theory established in their joint work are to be further
developed and applied to problems on relativity and cosmology under this grant.
The team, including advanced graduate students, will collaborate closely in the
generation and pursuit of new ideas and problems within the themes described.
