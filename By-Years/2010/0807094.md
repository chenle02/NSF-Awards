Proposal # 0807094

Investigators from the University of North Carolina Greensboro have received
funding to determine the importance of methane cycling in food webs of Arctic
lakes. The main hypothesis is that the production, oxidation, and incorporation
in to food-webs of carbon derived from methane is greater than for carbon
produced by photosynthesis in the numerous small, shallow lakes of the Arctic.
The project will develop a novel, integrated understanding of the energy and
carbon linkages among methane producers, methane oxidizing bacteria, and higher
trophic levels in rapidly changing Arctic lake ecosystems.
