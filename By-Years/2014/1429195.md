With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and
support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), and the
Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), Professor Lisa
Berreau from Utah State University and colleagues Cheng-Wei Chang, Alvan Hengge,
Yujie Sun and Jixun Zhan will acquire a 500 MHz NMR spectrometer. In general,
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools
available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials
chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching
as well as research by postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students at Utah
State University, the USDA Poisonous Plant Research Laboratory, and the regional
USU campus at the Uintah Basin. It will also impact outreach activities
involving minority student populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is aimed
at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as
(a) advancing metabolic engineering and synthetic biology; (b) understanding the
roles of metals in biological systems and developing reagents for biological
use; (c) developing new carbohydrate-containing molecules with useful biological
activities; (d) understanding the details of phosphate ester hydrolysis
reactivity in biological systems; (e) developing new catalysts for water
splitting reactivity with relevance to solar energy production; (f) identifying
poisonous plant toxins; and (g) advancing natural products synthesis.
