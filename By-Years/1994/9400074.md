9400074 Wootters An REU Site will be continued in the Physics Department of
Williams College. About half of the students will come from Williams and half
from other schools. Each student will work at Williams for ten weeks, during
which time she or he will be a member of a small research group consisting of
between two and five undergraduates and advised by one faculty member. The
students will be divided about equally between experimental and theoretical
physics. The particular projects we have in mind are in the following areas:
quantum information theory, optical fiber lasers, laser cooling, and cryogenic
masers. In addition to their research projects, the students will participate in
daily teas and weekly seminars provided specifically for the REU students, as
well as weekly lunch and lecture open to all science students and faculty at
Williams. ***
