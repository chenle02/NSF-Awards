The long-term goals of this research is to advance the theory of nonlinear 0-1
programming, to design efficient algorithms for the main type of such problems
arising in engineering and to make largely available the corresponding codes.
Further investigations will be undertaken towards the improvement of exact and
heuristic solution methods for unconstrained, constrained and hyperbolic
nonlinear 0-1 programs, and their application to reasoning under uncertainty in
expert systems (probabilistic logic) and to machine load balancing problems in
flexible manufacturing. Interactive activities include teaching preceptorial
courses on Case Studies in Operations Research and on Integer Programming and
giving guest lectures. Additionally, Dr. Jaumard will lead seminars on recent
research problems. This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to
provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in
the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women to pursue
careers in science and engineering by providing greater visibility for women
scientists and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic
institutions. By encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a
valuable investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.
