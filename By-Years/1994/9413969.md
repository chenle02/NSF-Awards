The projects discussed in this proposal represent interdisciplinary work in the
Department of Chemistry and other Departments at Iowa State University dealing
with a common theme: the importance of protein structure and dynamics for
protein function. The problem discussed in this proposal range from the assembly
and folding of proteins, the structural role of proteins in determining
efficient energy transfer among naturally occurring photosynthetic pigments, and
the way in which proteins interact with surfaces. In order to address these
representative problems, dedicated equipment is required. Because proteins are
the central theme of proposal, instruments to synthesize and to purify long-
chain peptides on a large scale and to characterize their structural integrity
are requested. The carefully designed proteins will be subjected to studies
described in the text that characterize their interactions with surfaces either
by Fourier transform infrared and Raman techniques or that monitor their
reactivity on time scales from hundreds of femotseconds to hundreds of
nanoseconds by various time- resolved techniques.
