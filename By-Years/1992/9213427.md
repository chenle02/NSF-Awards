This project involves safety and fault-tolerance problems raised in the
development of safety-critical computing systems. There are many computer
applications in which safety and not reliability or availability is the
overriding concern. Reduced or altered functionality of such systems is
acceptable as long as no harm is done. Theoretical research will focus on the
specification and design phases of the software lifecycle. Specifically, the
project will develop a framework of definitions of safety, establish the
responsibility of the software engineer within that framework, and design
software architectures to support the development of safe software. It will
investigate the possibility that an enhanced form of software reuse can be
exploited to facilitate rapid development of specifications and designs for safe
software. Empirical research will focus on a case study which will involve
certain aspects of the software for an experimental safety-critical medical
device. The device, known as the Magnetic Stereotaxis System, is a new approach
to various forms of therapy for brain disorders. Software safety specifications
will be constructed and a prototype built. Reuse libraries populated by a small
number of parts derived from the case study will be built and used in subsequent
studies of reuse technology.
