Shelton BES-0406451 The intent of this Workshop is to show how the Interagency
Metabolic Engineering Working Group (MEWG) has supported the missions of the
participating Agencies. An Agency representative will introduce a Speaker on a
particular topic of interest to the Metabolic Engineering Working Group. Five
Speakers are scheduled to discuss the Metabolic Engineering associated with
Plant Cells, Animal and Insect Cells, Microbial Cells, Health Science and
Computational Biology. In addition, there is to be a Keynote Speaker. Continued
research efforts in these areas will lead to important information that will
enable the realization of the full potential of Metabolic Engineering within
Agriculture, Environmental Biotechnology, Energy Development, Marine
Biotechnology, Medicine, and beyond.

The Workshop is scheduled to be held at the National Science Foundation (NSF) on
February 6, 2004. Information generated at this Workshop may be useful for
planning purposes for MEWG and the Biochemical Engineering/Biotechnology (BEB)
Program in the Bioengineering and Environmental Systems (BES) Division of NSF.
Information from this Workshop will be distilled into a report for NSF and the
MEWG.
