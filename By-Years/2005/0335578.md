This small grant for exploratory research will support development of novel
techniques for extending the ability of computed tomography (CT) imaging to be
used as a front-line non-invasive screening tool for detection of cardiovascular
vulnerable patients. Coronary heart disease (CHD) is still the major cause of
death in most of the developed countries, including the United States. The grant
will develop and validate the computational framework that will allow mining CT
imaging data to extract information that will allow the detection and
classification of plaque. This will in turn lead to the development of a
quantitative method for the cumulative risk assessment of vulnerable patients.
