*** 9760607 Smith This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
will explore linear arrays of amorphous silicon (a-Si) thin-film transistor
(TFT)-photodiodes to achieve a large cost reduction and an increase in
throughput and spatial resolution for computed tomographic (CT) systems. These
systems are targeted to the agile manufacturing and rapid prototyping markets. A
technique for compensation of the photocurrent persistence characteristic of
a-Si will be examined, and a detector and data-acquisition system based will be
developed for this technology. Successfully implemented, a-Si detectors will
improve both the price and performance of CT systems used for dimensioning of
production parts and for reverse engineering of parts lacking digital
descriptions. These improvements in price and performance will accelerate the
introduction of CT as an important tool for these rapidly evolving technologies.
