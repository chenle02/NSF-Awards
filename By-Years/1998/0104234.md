EPIC (Eastern Pacific Investigation of Climate processes in the coupled ocean-
atmosphere system) is an activity of the US CLIVAR Program. EPIC 2001 consists
of four components focussing on (i) intertropical convergence zone/warm pool
phenomena; (ii) cross-equatorial inflow into the intertropical convergence zone;
(iii) upper ocean structure and mixing and (iv) an exploratory study of boundary
layer cloud properties in the southeasterly tradewind regime. The field phase of
EPIC 2001 is scheduled for a 6-week period during the interval Sept 1 to Oct 15,
2001. In addition to the eight awards made by ATM, this collaborative research
has awards made by NSF/OCE and NOAA/OGP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under this award
(collaborative with Molinari/SUNY Albany, ATM 0002387), the PI will examine
factors responsible for the fluctuations in the strength and position of the
East Pacific ITCZ on weekly time scales. The variations of the ITCZ convection
as a function of the diurnal cycle will also be examined. The work is important
because it will improve understanding and modeling of climate variability over
the Eastern Tropical Pacific.
