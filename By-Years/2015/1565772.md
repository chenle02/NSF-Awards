In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms A
Program and the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program, Professor Mary Jane
Shultz of Tufts University is examining single-crystal ice surfaces. Single
crystal studies revolutionized models of catalysis leading to more efficient
processes ranging from fixing nitrogen to make fertilizers that enable the Earth
to sustain a growing population, to the catalytic converter in automobiles that
vastly improve air quality. Similarly, detailed images for single crystal ice
surfaces are expected to impact understanding of interactions that govern
biological, atmospheric, and geological processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project combines emerging ability to grow single-crystal ice selecting any face
with cutting-edge instrumentation to measure interactions at the ice surface.
Due to its hexagonal structure, ice is uniaxial. It would not be surprising to
find that both energy transfer and adsorbate interaction differ from face to
face as well as changing with orientation. Ice is a wonderful material for
connecting the macroscopic observable structure with the underlying molecular-
level structure. This connection is fascinating to multiple age groups, making
research laboratory results accessible to wide audiences. Thus not only will
technique development have a broad impact on the study of soft material
interfaces, it will also connect everyday experiences such as driving a car in a
snowstorm with the environmental impact of that car's exhaust.
