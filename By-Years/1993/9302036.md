9302036 Valsiner This U.S.-Brazil Program award will support the collaboration
of Jaan Valsiner of the Carolina Consortium on Human Development at the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Maria Ferreira of the Brazilian
Consortium on Human Development at the University of Sao Paulo at Ribeirao
Preto. The project aims to explore social ecology of child development. The
Carolina Consortium involves the University of North Carolina, North Carolina
State University, and Duke University. The Brazilian Consortium involves the
University of Brasilia, University of Sao Paulo at Ribeirao Preto, State
University of Campinas, Federal University of Pernambuco, and Federal University
of Fluminense. Research topics in this group-to-group interaction include the
construction of semiotic means in adult-infant interaction; cooperation and
competition in children's peer-group relations; co-constructivist analysis of
parental and teachers' roles in educational settings; life-course analysis; and
children's development of literacy in sociocultural contexts. All of the
institutions involved in this collaborative effort will benefit from an exchange
of knowledge and methodologies and the establishment of an organized framework
among Brazilian and U.S. developmental scientists. ***
