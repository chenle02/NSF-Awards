This is a joint Clarkson-Yale University project for the investigation of novel
computational techniques to exploit intrinsic characteristics of boundary
element analysis (BEA), for truly large scale problems on contemporary/emerging
computers, removing bottlenecks to high performance computing by examining steps
currently consuming up to 95% of overall computational resources. Special regard
is given to the effectiveness of these techniques in the design process where
solution of sequences of evolving problems and design sensitivity analysis are
required. Iterative equation solving, vector/parallel numerical integration, and
iterative reanalysis and design sensitivity analysis, in a high performance
computing environment, is being investigated. The knowledge gained, will
facilitate the use of significantly more refined BEA simulations, predicting
system response with increased fidelity, earlier in the engineering process, add
to the general efficiency of BEA vis-a-vis finite element and finite difference
analysis, and help make tractable the coupling of accurate three-dimensional
simulation with programmed intelligence in overall analysis and optimization
systems of practical utility in the mainstream of engineering and design.
