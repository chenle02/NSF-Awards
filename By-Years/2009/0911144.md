This award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Division of Chemistry, supports the research of Prof. Barbara Wyslouzil and her
students at The Ohio State University. The goals of this experimental program
are to measure the formation rates and the structure of nanodroplets. Nanometer-
sized droplets form by vapor condensation in both ambient and industrial
environments, and are crucial elements in many health, environmental, and
industrial challenges. Accurately predicting the rate at which these phase
transitions occur and the structure of the final droplets are critical for
developing reliable models of industrial processes, climate, and atmospheric
chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;The results stemming from this work are of interest to
researchers in nucleation, aerosol science, cloud physics, and materials
science. The project provides a rich research environment for undergraduate and
graduate students that is highly interdisciplinary and that builds on a
longstanding international collaboration. A community outreach effort to bring
clouds into the classrooms of both home schooled and public school students is
also planned.&lt;br/&gt;
