With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Southern University will acquire a 400 MHz NMR
Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out research in a
number of areas, including a) materials science; b) environmental toxicology; c)
mechanistic organic chemistry; d) biological toxicology; e) peptide synthesis;
and f) molecular endocrinology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the
elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out
frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in
environmental sciences, synthetic organic chemistry and biochemistry.
