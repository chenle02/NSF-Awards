The early evolution and diversification of the dinosaurs remains largely
unresolved, due to the scarcity of complete skeletons of certain transitional
forms of Triassic age. Dr. Paul Sereno proposes to begin field collections in
Triassic-aged strata in Argentina, in collaboration with in-country specialists.
Preliminary finds suggest that new collections will provide critical
observations of dinosaur anatomy that will settle long-standing controversies
over ancestor-descendant relationships. Dinosaurs are but one of the major
reptile groups that diversified in the early Mesozoic. The proposed research has
the potential to advance our understanding of dinosaur evolution. It also has
implications for the study of crocodiles, flying reptiles and birds, all of
which are descendants of that period of differentiation. International
scientific cooperation will also be improved.
