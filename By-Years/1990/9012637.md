This project represents a comparative study of larval release rhythms and the
environmental factors that control egg hatching in caridean shrimp of the genus,
Palaemonetes. Grass shrimp from estuaries exhibiting different tidal cycles and
a freshwater pond/lake will be used as test organisms. >Palaemontes pugio> and
>Palaemonetes paludosus> will represent the estuarine and freshwater habitats,
respectively. The major objectives of this project are: 1. to determine the type
of hatching rhythms shown by grass shrimp species from the two habitats; 2. to
ascertain the presence of endogenous control of the hatching rhythm and the
environmental parameters to which they are entrained; 3. to establish the
site(s) of control of endogenous hatching rhythms in grass shrimp from the two
habitats; 4. to ascertain the presence and nature of any chemical cue that
synchronizes the hatching of eggs; and 5. to correlate hatching rhythms with the
prevailing environmental parameters in the two habitats. The results of this
investigation will represent the first comparative account of egg hatching
rhythms of grass shrimp from diverse habitats and will provide a unique
opportunity for testing previously proposed larval release models. The project
will contribute to our understanding of the basic types of hatching rhythms and
the interrelationship between the ecology of adult shrimp and hatching rhythms.
