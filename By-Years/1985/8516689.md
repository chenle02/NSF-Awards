Large scale radio networks are growing rapidly because of the demand for the
transmission and sharing of information among many users. A key feature of these
networks is that each transmission is a potential source of interference for all
terminals within range of the transmitter. For such networks the use of spread
spectrum signaling is highly desirable. Spread spectrum systems are
characterized by the use of one or more distinct codes assigned to each terminal
and modulated onto the carrier along with the digital data. Since most of these
signaling techniques combat multiple-access interference without stringent power
requirements, they are suitable for radio networks with mobile nodes. The
specific research objectives include: development and analysis of purely
broadcast spread-spectrum communication schemes, exploration of the efficient
use of channel access protocols for (single-hop) spread-spectrum radio networks,
performance evaluation of single-hop, spread-spectrum cellular mobile radio
networks, and analysis and design of multi-hop, spread-spectrum radio networks.
