The research proposed includes: 1. Finite size scaling effects in dynamics, 2.
Investigation of systems with random fields and other types of random
interactions, 3. Optimization problems which involve random graphs and
applications of spin-glass methods and 4. Research on localization properties of
fractals and Monte Carlo simulations of a supersymmetric model.
