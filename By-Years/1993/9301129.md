Combinatorial pattern matching encompasses a large class of problems that are
now emerging in several application areas. The most important application areas
are molecular biology where a myriad of pattern-matching problems occur, and
test processing in the larger context of storing, manipulating, searching, and
information gathering from large collections of texts. For example, the need for
approximate pattern matching is expected to grow as more and more text is being
read by OCR (Optical Character Recognition) devices which often make errors.
This project studies fundamental issues in combinatorial pattern matching that
are motivated by these two application areas. Theory and practice are
interleaved in this project with practical problems motivating most of the
theoretical questions and, in at least two cases, the other way around. The
potential contributions of this work include the identification, abstraction,
and unification of important problems in this area, and the development of
algorithms and software tools for their solutions.
