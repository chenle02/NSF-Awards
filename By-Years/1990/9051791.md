A laboratory of Next workstations is shared by mathematics and computer science
students for their comprehensive projects in differential equations and in
computer science. The computer is an essential research tool in differential
equations and enables significant research experiences by undergraduates. The
networked multitasking workstation environment provides both the tools and a
laboratory for significant computer science projects. The grantee provides funds
for this project that are an equal match for the NSF award.
