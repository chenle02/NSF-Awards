A principal aim of the upper-level geology curriculum at Hamilton College is to
give students direct experience in acquisition and interpretation of geological
data, including those obtained using modern instrumentation. Use of modern
analytical equipment in the curriculum will ensure not only that students gain
experience in acquiring, understanding, and interpreting quantitative data, but
also that they will bring a more sophisticated perspective to their upper level
courses, in which critical reading of primary literature is an important
concern. The geology department will establish a modern X- ray laboratory in
order to achieve these goals. This laboratory will consist of an integrated
X-ray diffractometer and X-ray fluorescence spectrometer interfaced with a
personal computer. Such a facility will give students the opportunity to perform
sensitive mineralogical and geochemical analyses of geologic materials. This
facility will be intimately integrated into the curriculum through laboratory
exercises in Geochemistry, Igneous/Metamorphic Petrology, Sedimentary Geology,
and Mineralogy courses. The college requires a senior project of all students,
and availability of X-ray diffraction and X-ray fluorescence instrumentation
will significantly expand both the types of projects that students will be able
to undertake and the quality of the results. The college will match the award
with an equal amount of funds.
