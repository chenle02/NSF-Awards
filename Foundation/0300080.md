Laskowski is continuing his research into model theory. In the first set of
problems he investigates several distinct combinatorial situations that arise in
different contexts, including recursive model theory and classification theory.
In each of these situations a definable group is known to be present as well as
an action of the group on the combinatorial configuration. Laskowski will
continue his investigations into what specific properties such a group must
possess. As the group is acting on the configuration, such results would
immediately yield restrictions on the complexity of the configuration. In many
different settings, Laskowski has been able to apply some of the tools from
Descriptive Set Theory to answer questions in model theory, primarily for
theories in a countable language. Recent developments give him hope that the
Main Gap for omega1-saturated models is within reach. A third problem is to
continue his investigations into the algebraic underpinnings of various fuzzy
logics. Specifically, he is aiming for a sharp bound on the computational
complexity of determining which sentences are logically valid in various fuzzy
logic systems. By building on previous results, this question is cast in terms
of various embedding questions between certain ordered abelian semigroups.

Model theory is concerned with the interplay between theories (i.e., sets of
sentences in a very formal language) and classes of algebraic structures
(models). As one strengthens the theory, the class of models of the theory
decreases. In particular, some theories are strong enough to obviate specific
configurations from appearing in any model of the theory. Much of Laskowski's
prior research to date, as well as much of the proposed research, concerns
understanding the mechanisms by which this elimination can occur. Fuzzy logics
have been useful in computer science and operations research for some time, but
only recently have significant attempts been made to provide a firm mathematical
basis for them. Laskowski and his graduate students have recently made progress
in this regard, and the investigator will continue working in this area.
