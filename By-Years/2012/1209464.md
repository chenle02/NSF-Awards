The elaborate songs and plumage ornaments of birds are generally thought to
advertise male quality; therefore, females that respond to displays should gain
a reproductive benefit through increased quantity or quality of offspring.
However, in order for females to continue responding, signals must be honest,
suggesting that some mechanism prevents males from cheating. For species that
breed over multiple years, two processes that contribute to aging may ensure
signal honesty by enforcing a trade-off between investment in sexual displays
and investment in longevity. One process involves telomeres, which are repeated
DNA sequences that serve as protective caps on the ends of each chromosome and
shorten with age; the second process, oxidative stress, occurs when the by-
products of cellular metabolism damage DNA and other cell constituents. The
investigators will measure sexual signals, reproductive success, telomere
shortening, and oxidative stress in a wild population of common yellowthroat
warblers breeding in upstate New York. They will explore trade-offs between
reproductive investment and aging in two ways. First, they will look for
relationships between sexual signals, lifetime reproductive success, telomere
shortening, and oxidative damage in our long-term data set. Second, they will
use hormone implants to experimentally increase reproductive investment and
measure the resulting impact on telomere loss and oxidative damage. Individuals
that invest heavily in sexual signals are expected to pay a high cost through
fast physiological aging and reduced longevity. Understanding the way that
complex suites of traits interact to determine lifetime reproductive success is
essential in predicting evolutionary outcomes that shape important life history
traits, such as aging patterns and reproductive strategies, both within and
across species.
