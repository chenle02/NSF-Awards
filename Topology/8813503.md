The main thrust of this project is an attempt to find new relationships between
homology and homotopy. The long-range goal is to find a connection between
spectra on the homology side of the Brown-Peterson spectra and spectra on the
sphere side. Some form of symmetry should explain left-right phenomena observed
in the generalized homology of its own omega spectrum. A first step in this
project is to compute the homology of the spaces in the omega spectra for
Ravenel's spectra. Other projects include improving results for non-immersion of
products of real projective spaces and a continuing attack on the Johnson
question.
