This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a
continuously operating water monitoring device for the detection of chemical
warfare agents and hazardous chemicals. Prior Phase I work demonstrated the
feasibility of this method and resulted in the construction of a bench-top model
that could respond rapidly to contamination, that was resistant to environmental
and chemical interference, and that could operate for extended periods of time
without user intervention. In Phase II, this model will be modified into a
small, self-contained, inexpensive prototype. Several optimized prototypes will
be constructed for field trials under operational conditions.

The commercial application of this project will be in the area of bioterrorism
and homeland security.
