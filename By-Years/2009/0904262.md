The proposed research is on Topological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT) in
dimensions two and three. TQFTs produce topological invariants of geometric
objects such as knots and 3-dimensional manifolds. We shall study applications
of TQFTs to classical topological problems such as finding whether a given Serre
fibration over a surface (or more, generally, over a 2-dimensional orbifold) has
a section. This will require a careful study of Homotopy QFTs introduced by the
author in 1999. In another direction, we will give a general algebraic framework
for 3-dimensional state-sum TQFTs and connect the latter to 3-dimensional
surgery TQFTs as follows: the state sum TQFT derived from a finite semisimple
monoidal category C is isomorphic to the surgery TQFT derived from the Drinfeld
double of C. The proof will use the technique of bottom tangles due to
Bruguieres-Virelizier-Habiro.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantum physics has
invariably served as a source of new mathematical insights and techniques. One
such insight introduced about 20 years ago by the Fields medalists E. Witten and
M. Atiyah is called Topological Quantum Field Theory. It allows us to approach
real-world geometric objects such as surfaces of solid bodies or knotted circles
in the space from a new, physical perspective. We will use this viewpoint to
address certain geometric problems concerning the surfaces. In particular, we
will answer several classical questions raised well before the introduction of
Quantum Field Theory. We will also study a connection between mathematical
techniques arising from Quantum Field Theory and from Quantum Gravity. This
study will involve deep algebraic techniques introduced by another Fields
medalist V. Drinfeld. This project will exhibit new facets of the fundamental
connection between physics, geometry, and algebra.
