The Department of Mathematics at Sonoma State University will initiate a first
phase of a mathematics laboratory for several courses. In remedial mathematics,
students will work problems in algebra and geometry while in calculus students
will conduct experiments. In addition the Mathematical Models and Numerical
Analysis curriculum will be updated and classes will be held in the mathematics
laboratory
