Abstract Wallach

This project will study several related problems in representation theory, non-
commutative harmonic analysis and algebraic group theory. In representation
theory it involves the construction, study and application of small unitary
representations of real reductive groups. In harmonic analysis, it involves
dropping the K-finite condition in Paley-Wiener theorems for rapidly decreasing
functions on a real reductive group. This analysis will be applied to proving a
version of the Casselman-Wallach theorem depending on parameters. This theorem
will imply a meromorphic continuation of non-K-finite Eisenstein series. Related
to these more analytic problems we will study the algebraic problem of
determining graded multiplicities for the irreducible constituents of the action
of a reductive algebraic group on an affine cone. The latter work also has
applications to the analysis and to the study of measures of entanglement in
quantum computing.

Representation theory has its roots in nineteenth century invariant theory,
early twentieth century quantum mechanics and mid-twentieth century number
theory. In this first decade of the twenty first century the theory has returned
to its roots. The nineteenth century invariant theory emphasized concrete
questions on binary forms with algorithmic solutions. These problems have
reemerged and are now being generalized to apply to quantum computation. Early
quantum mechanics studied puzzling and weird measurements involving photons,
electrons etc. These phenomena led to the Hilbert space approach to quantum
mechanics. The philosophical debates of the early quantum mechanics have
reemerged as quantum information technology. The Hilbert space approach also
gave birth to representation theory, which has as one of its main applications
in number theory. The Langlands program has established a goal for the twenty
first century to establish a non-commutative class field theory (Wile's proof of
Fermat's Last Theorem is actually proof of a special case of the Tanayama-
Shimura conjecture which is a special case of the Langlands program). This
project is in the interface of all of these exciting directions.
