The assessment of seismic hazard involves specifying the likelihood, magnitude,
location, and nature of earthquakes that might have damaging effects at the site
of construction; and estimating the intensity, duration, and frequency
characteristics of the induced ground shaking. This project is applying
statistical techniques to investigate the adequacy of the Poisson-Independent-
Exponential (PIE) model of earthquake occurrence used in most seismic analyses
in the United States. However it is recognized that the PIE model is not
consistent with the physical process of crustal strain accumulation and release
associated with earthquakes. Therefore the research is also exploring
alternative models of seismic hazard and its uncertainty, especially those
models which include the effects of non-stationarity and memory patterns in
earthquake occurrence. The research focuses on the inadequate understanding of
seismicity of continental interiors, specifically within the central and eastern
United States. This is a region where the short historical earthquake record
available cannot be trusted to be representative of future hazards. The record
of earthquakes in China is the only one that can be used to assess "memory
models" of seismicity in intraplate regions. The project involves a
collaboration with the Institute of Geophysics in the PRC State Seismological
Bureau: the long catalog of earthquakes in China is being used to explore and
calibrate models of seismicity with memory. For intraplate regions, many
engineering decisions related to earthquake hazard mitigation involve great
uncertainties. As a result, this research project is expected to contribute
significantly to the assessment of earthquake hazard in the central and eastern
United States.
