9522642 Fuller This proposal involves research into the dynamics and structure
of multi-component polymeric materials. Several problems will be investigated in
the course of this work, and will make use of a newly developed rheo-optical
method available in our laboratory: polarization modulated Raman scattering
(PMRS). The primary objectives of the work are the following: 1. Development of
Two-Dimensional Raman Scattering (2D-RS), 2. Orientational dynamics of
homopolymer melts near the glass transition, 3. Dynamics of compatible polymer
blends, and 4. Flow-induced Migration in Polymer Solutions. %%% This work
provides a molecular-level basis and rheo-optical technique to understand flow
phenomena and dynamics among polymeric materials during flow, processing,
molding, and solidification. ***
