9523169 Turner This award provides partial support for the seventh and eighth
annual SUNYA Topology and Group Theory conferences, October 13-15, 1995, and
October 11-13, 1996, in Albany, New York. The conferences concentrate on
combinatorial group theory and low dimensional topology. The invited speakers in
1995 are Robert Bieri, Mikhael Gromov, Narain Gupta, William Menasco, Chuck
Miller, Richard Schwartz, and Efim Zelmanov. It is axiomatic that algebraic
topology draws heavily upon group theory, but one charm of the subject of these
conferences is that the flow is substantially in the other direction, with
topology repaying its debt in shedding light on the properties and structure of
groups. ***
