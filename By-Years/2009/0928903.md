The Tuskegee University (TU) HBCU-UP Targeted Infusion Project (TIP) will infuse
genomics into the undergraduate curriculum of the Biology Department. This TIP
will provide highly interactive, inquiry-based approaches to acquaint students
with the emerging field of genomics. To accomplish this goal, one introductory
course and two advanced level genomics courses will be developed and newly
designed genomics modules will be incorporated into existing courses including:
Advanced Genetics, Advanced Biotechnology, Molecular and Cell Biology, Botany,
Microbiology, and Research Methodology. In parallel, a series of complementary
project laboratories will be developed to provide students hands-on, minds-on
experience with genomics research and facilitate current research activities of
faculty and students at TU. Students enrolled in these courses will be better
prepared to enter the 21st century scientific workforce, particularly in the
emerging fields of genomics. The teaching materials (including hypertexted
laboratory manuals) developed at TU will be disseminated via open access
courses, presentations, publications, and workshops for faculty members. The TU-
TIP project will provide educational innovations for universities and colleges
nationwide.
