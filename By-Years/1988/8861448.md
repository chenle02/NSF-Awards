One of the most promising applications of epitaxial III-V on Si materials
technology is the monolithic integration of optoelectronic functions with Si
integrated circuits. While simple implementations of this integrated technology
have been demonstrated, there has been little attention paid to the types of
heterostructures that are best suited for integration of GaAs and Si device
functions from both material and device perspectives. The purpose of this
program will be to develop a set of standard III-V heterostructure components
that can be used as building blocks for lightwave applications, particularly
optoelectronic integrated circuits, fabricated by epitaxial growth on large-area
Si substrates using OMCVD. Phase I of this three phase program will determine
the feasibility of such a technology through an evaluation of AlGaAs/GaAs
epitaxial structures grown by OMCVD on Si substrates. The experimental
structures will be representative of those needed for the fabrication of optical
sources, detectors. waveguides, and modulators. The growth and properties of
these structures will be investigated. Phase II will focus on the monolithic
integration of these components on Si substrates. In particular, we will explore
selective epitaxy to implement be integration of the different components. Phase
III will focus on the commercialization of this device technology.
