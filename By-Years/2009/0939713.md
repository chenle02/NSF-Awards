This proposal requests funding to assist approximately 10 US-based graduate
students to attend the 2009 USENIX Annual Technical Conference, the premier
forum for advanced professionals from academic and industrial backgrounds to
meet and discuss the latest research in systems software.&lt;br/&gt;USENIX?09
will be held in San Diego, CA from June 14?19, 2009. The conference will consist
of 3 days of training and a 3-day technical program. In addition to attending
the conference events, students receiving assistance will serve as scribes for
the conference sessions to write summaries for a later issue of ;login:
magazine, will be required to attend the Student Birds-of-a-Feather session to
interact with senior members of the research community specifically interested
in meeting students in a casual and informal atmosphere, and will be strongly
encouraged to present posters and works in progress as part of the selection
process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits. The goal of the conference
is to bring together researchers from across the networking and systems
community ? including computer networking, security, cloud computing, and
operating systems ? to foster cross-disciplinary approaches and to address
shared research challenges. This cross-disciplinary emphasis makes it well-
suited as a target for student participation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts. Participation in USENIX?09 and similar conferences is a valuable and
important part of the graduate school experience. It provides students with the
opportunity to interact with more senior researchers in the field, and exposes
students to leading work in the field. The support requested in this proposal
will enable the participation of students who would&lt;br/&gt;otherwise be
unable to attend the conference.
