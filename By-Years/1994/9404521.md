9404521 Pernarowski Several projects related to the bursting electrical activity
of the pancreatic beta cell are studied by the investigator. Analog and
biophysical models for single cell bursting electrical activity are used to
model the behavior of discrete clusters (islets) of N coupled cells. For the
analog cluster model, the steady state analysis for large N is examined in the
context of a mapping problem to ascertain the effect that coupling has on the
solution behavior. Also, continuum limits that describe islet electrical
activity are examined. These models are parabolic partial differential equations
that contain a small parameter. Asymptotic analyses are used to examine the
existence and stability of steady states, travelling waves and spiral waves. The
investigator studies the difference between the electrical behavior of single
beta cells and clusters of beta cells through the use of mathematical models.
These studies are important because the beta cell is the only insulin secreting
cell in the body and the electrical behavior of such clusters has been strongly
correlated to insulin release rate.
