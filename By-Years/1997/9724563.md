Abstract This proposal describes the types of plant biology research and range
of reach-in and walk in controlled environment chamber capabilities that are
required in the three complexes on the Purdue Agriculture campus. The proposal
further describes how unique environmental capabilities of the new equipment in
the three clusters will be networked, managed, and made available to funded
programs in a truly multi-user instrumentations system.
