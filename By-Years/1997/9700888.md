This Research at Undergraduate Institutions project, supported in the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, focusses on the preparation and
characterization of chiral nuclear magnetic resonance shift reagents formed by
coupling paramagnetic lanthanide ions with chiral resolving agents. Professor
Thomas J. Wenzel and his undergraduate students at Bates College will combine
the results from this work with known chromatographic retention data for optical
isomers so that the assignment of the absolute configuration of enantiomers can
be made from resolved nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. This work has
application in the areas of the pharmaceutical industry and in magnetic
resonance imaging reagents. Methods that permit the direct determination of the
configuration of optical isomers will be developed by Professor Wenzel and his
undergraduate students at Bates College. Reagents will be prepared that interact
with optical isomers in a way that leads to resolved nuclear magnetic resonance
spectra. Knowing how these reagents shift nuclear magnetic resonance spectra
will permit the assignment of configuration to the optical isomers. This work
has potential for application in pharmaceutical chemistry and in the are of
magnetic resonance imaging.
