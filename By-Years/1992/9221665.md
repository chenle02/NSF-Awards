The South Pole Air Shower Experiment (SPASE) is a large (approximately 100 meter
square) array of scintillation detectors which measures very energetic particles
produced by interactions of cosmic ray with the Earth's atmosphere. Spase was
first installed at South Pole in late 1987 and has operated almost continuously
since then with several improvements. The experiment is intended to search for
sources of gamma rays with the expectation that such sources would also be the
long sought sources of charged cosmic rays. In the first 5 years of operation
SPASE has not found an unambiguous constant source, though there is a candidate.
There are also candidate pulsed sources which may have been detected. These
results are consistent with all similar experiment in the Southern Hemisphere.
It is planned to operate SPASE in conjunction with the new detectors which are
being installed as part of the AMANDA (Antarctic Muon And Neutrino Detector
Array). These new detectors will provide additional information on the muon
content of the air showers and therefore reduce the charged cosmic ray
background and increase the likelihood of detection of gamma rays.
