A new Laboratory is being created to enable the Computer Science Department to
offer its majors experience in the design and implementation of parallel
computing systems. The students work with three types of parallel systems:
extensively pipelined uniprocessors with multiple execution units,
multiprocessors using shared memory, and message passing multiprocessor systems.
The new course completes a sequence of three courses; the other two courses are
a lecture course in computer architecture, and a laboratory course in
microcomputer systems design. In the new laboratory each group of two students
works with an Intel 386 based IBM AT clone equipped with a CSA Transputer board,
a Microway i860 board, and a logic analyzer board. The ATs are networked to a
laboratory file and print server, and furnish I/0 facilities to the installed
boards. The Intel i860 provides the vehicle for investigating parallel
uniprocessors. The Transputer board introduces students to message passing
multiprocessor systems. A 16 node reconfigurable Transputer system, hosted by a
separate AT, permits the students to implement on a real multiprocessor the
software that they have developed, and enables them to investigate the link
operation and link driver/receiver design. Microway's 860 boards are each
equipped with two links which will enable the student to develop an asymmetric
multiprocessing system with the Transputer. Shared memory multiprocessors are
made up of existing multiple Intel 8086 boards housed in a Multibus equipped
card cage.
