This action would provide support for the involvement of a small group from the
University of California, Principal Investigator, Harry H. Bingham, in an
experiment at Fermilab to study aspects of production of very rare particles
with the "beauty flavour." The experiment uses state of the art silicon devices
and sophisticated electronic techniques to pick out the very rare collisions of
high energy protons from the accelerator on a nuclear target which result in
production of these particles. The group is also involved in the analyses of
data from completed experiments involving high energy gamma ray interactions
with protons in bubble chambers and with other high energy photons in an
electronic spectrometer facility which was housed in a e+e- collider at SLAC.
Data from a further experiment with a bubble chamber which had been exposed to a
beam of neutrinos is also to be analysed using the funds requested.
