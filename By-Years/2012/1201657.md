In September 2010, NSF-TCUP and the NSF Directorate for Engineering made PEEC
awards to four Lead institutions. These Lead colleges each formed collaborative
partnerships with additional colleges or universities. A total of sixteen (16)
institutions have partnered to receive PEEC awards. The PEEC program is making
it possible for tribal colleges to develop and implement pre-engineering or
engineering degrees at their institutions by forming collaborative partnerships
with university-colleges of engineering to which TCUP students may
transfer.&lt;br/&gt;A two day workshop, located in Minneapolis, will focus on
the best practices for successfully recruiting and retaining students in pre-
engineering and engineering. During the workshop participants will discuss
issues and participate in formal sessions during which they will share
experiences and ideas about the future of pre-engineering and engineering at
tribal colleges. A primary focus will be to improve matriculation success rates
and the continued development of degree programs at the tribal colleges. NSF-
TCUP and Directorate for Engineering officials will participate, as will expert
consultants. One outcome will be a publication of the workshop proceedings to
include recommendations for program growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development
of effective engineering degree tracks, appropriate curriculums, methods of
instructional delivery, along with the necessary support mechanisms can produce
models that can be adapted by other colleges and universities to better serve
all underrepresented groups. The workshop will add to the national discussion
about broadening participation by sharing how PEEC projects contribute to the
global body of knowledge specific to engineering education.
