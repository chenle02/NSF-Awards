9714047 Schubert Research in III-V nitride material system has resulted in
significant improvements in material quality over the last few years, and has
resulted in the demonstration of high temperature transistors, efficient light
emitting diodes, and lasers emitting in the ultraviolet and blue regions of the
optical spectrum. However, in order to produce, reliable GaN-based devices,
several materials challenges must yet be overcome, including increasing the
p-type dopant concentrations attainable in these structures. In this work, Prof.
Schubert and his graduate student propose to overcome this p-doping limitation
by means of "superlattice doping". Superlattice doping, the short period
compositional modulation of uniformly doped semiconductors, promises to decrease
the effective activation energy of acceptors in GaN, thereby enhancing the free
hole concentration by approximately one order of magnitude. Abrupt and
parabolically graded composition modulation in the AlGaN/GaN material system
will be investigated and the influence of the grading on in-plane and
perpendicular hole transport will be studied. ***
