Abstract

Award: DMS-1011793 Principal Investigator: Thomas H. Parker

This project involves analytic aspects of the theory of pseudo- holomorphic and
harmonic maps. The PI's recent work with Junho Lee has established a remarkable
link between Gromov-Witten theory in dimensions 2 and 4. The first project aims
to complete this program (with Lee) by explicitly calculating the local GW
invariants that determine the GW invariants of a wide class of Kahler surfaces.
The planned technique, a homotopy of operators together with the symplectic sum
formula, should be useful in other contexts. GW is especially effective in
making predictions about Calabi-Yau 3-folds. The second proposed project seeks
to use geometric analysis methods to prove the Gompakumar-Vafa Conjecture, which
is a fascinating prediction by physicists that the plethora of GW numbers are
determined by a more limited collection of "BPS numbers". In a third project,
the PI and J. Lee aim to prove that, under certain hypotheses, the space of
stable $J$-holomorphic maps is generically a smooth manifold, a long-sought
result. Finally, Project 4 is a study of the finite-time singularities of the
harmonic map heat flow. The idea is to use analysis on path space to show that
the maps develop "necks" whose images converge to geodesics in a precise manner.

One of the most notable developments in recent mathematics has been the
remarkable confluence of ideas coming from string theory, algebraic geometry,
and symplectic geometry. A major part of the story revolves around the idea of
counting holomorphic curves in algebraic manifolds (this is a geometric
formulation of one of the most fundamental programs in mathematics: classifying
the solutions of systems of polynomial equations). The counting problem was
studied for 100 years with few results. Then, around 1990, it was realized that
the problem can be translated into symplectic geometry and tackled using the
machinery of mathematical Gauge Theory, a theory that arose from interactions
between mathematics and physics. This "Gromov-Witten invariant" approach quickly
led to formulas answering some of the original curve-counting problems. This
project is aimed at further developing Gromov-Witten theory using the methods of
geometric analysis, and applying similar techniques to related problems in the
theory of harmonic maps.
