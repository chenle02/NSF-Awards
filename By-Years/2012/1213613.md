This grant supports a workshop to be held in Arlington, VA in January 2012 on
Sustainable Chemistry. The workshop aims to identify key areas where fundamental
research in the core disciplines (Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, Materials
Science and Engineering) is needed to advance the goal of increasing the
sustainability of chemical processing and manufacturing. This is expected to
include strategies to reduce or eliminate the use of rare elements and other
scarce materials, reduce the use of freshwater and energy, and increase the
feasibility of recovery/recycling.

The workshop will explore multidisciplinary approaches and articulate the need
for a systems-level view of sustainability, including science, technology,
economics and societal impact. This is likely to require new educational
approaches to train the next generation of researchers to incorporate such
thinking into their research design. The added value created by funding research
efforts that incorporate investigators with different perspectives and from
different disciplines will be apparent. The broad recommendations to the
scientific community as well as specific examples will be incorporated into a
widely available report.
