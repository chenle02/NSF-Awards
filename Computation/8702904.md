The investigators propose to carry out computer - assisted research in
mathematics. Several projects are proposed in which computers will play a
crucial role: in working out examples, in helping to formulate and test
significant conjectures, and in actually carrying out key computational steps of
proofs of theorems that are not feasible to do by hand. Areas of interest
include; 1. Large simple groups, knots, partisan games, lattices and sphere-
packing. 2. The stability of matter. 3. The equidistribution of exponential sums
over finite fields. While these areas represent disparate (but not disjoint)
mathematical disciplines, the unifying and compelling aspect is the need for
computational and technical resources that the investigators can share.
