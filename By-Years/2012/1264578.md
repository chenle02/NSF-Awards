This proposal sets out a goal to understand the dynamics of nanopore-Room
Temperature Ionic Liquids (RTIL) interactions better, in order to improve the
ability to design better supercapacitors for energy-storage. The specific
objective of this research is to investigate, using atomistic simulations, the
electrically-driven transport of RTILs in nanopores and its applications in the
charging dynamics of supercapacitors.

Success of this project can help the development of new energy-storage
approaches by providing a better understanding of the fundamentals of RTILs in
super-capacitors that use nanoporous materials. The PI has an active plan to
train undergraduates, participate in K-12 outreach activities, and to publicly
share the PI?s Molecular Dynamics codes for modeling charged interfaces, which
is an efficient way of disseminating the outcome of this research.
