With this award, the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division is
funding Professor Jeffrey Johnson of the Department of Chemistry at the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to develop new catalytic,
enantioselective methods for the construction of heterocycles using readily
accessible strained building blocks. Prior NSF-funded research has revealed a
unique mechanism for tetrahydrofuran-forming annulation reactions between donor-
acceptor cyclopropanes and aldehydes. From this point, other useful heterocycle
constructions, including asymmetric variants, have been achieved. The
mechanistic understanding gained to date is expected to drive the discovery of
new reactions that allow simple access to structures not easily reached using
existing methods. Examining new chemistry of donor-acceptor cyclopropanes and
exploring the reactivity of heretofore unexplored donor-acceptor strained
systems is expected to provide a diverse set of reaction products. A complete
exploration of the useful yet underutilized "carbon as a nucleofuge" paradigm
will lead to useful reaction patterns. Experimentation in these areas will also
provide fertile ground for fundamental studies of reaction mechanism in
transformations that involve ground state-destabilized building blocks.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of a general platform for heterocycle
construction using strained ring activation is of fundamental importance to
organic and medicinal chemists. The exploration of myriad activation modes for
the donor-acceptor substrates is likely to enhance adoption of the methodology
in academic and industrial laboratories. Graduate student coworkers will become
adept at a broad range of synthetic and analytical techniques that can be
applied to a variety of problems. Through the continued inclusion of student
researchers via the AVS Project SEED program, ethnic minorities that are
historically underrepresented in the sciences will have access to cutting edge,
yet tractable science.
