This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
will enable twenty U.S. graduate students to attend the XIV International
Conference on Organometallic Chemistry in Detroit, Michigan, August 19-24, 1990.
The conference is expected to attract more than 500 scientists with demonstrated
research interests in organometallic chemistry and particularly its applications
in new materials. The primary goals of the 1990 meeeting are to provide
opportunities for full participation both to young researchers in the United
States and to scientists from less-developed nations, to stimulate interaction
between academic and industrial chemists in the U.S., and to provide a forum for
the latest developments in the broad field of organometallic chemistry.
