Can one efficiently compress search problems with small witnesses into problems
whose size depends on the length of the instances? Recent results have given
strong negative evidence, for example, that one cannot efficiently map the
problem of finding a clique of size k to a problem of size polynomial in k.
These question has surprising applications to parameterized complexity,
cryptography, probabilistic proof systems and structural
complexity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will look to extend these results
to a number of different directions including showing similar results for
probabilistic compression which seem to require new breakthroughs in
pseudorandom generators. Also can ever compress a function f that depends on m
instances of an NP problem of size n to a single instance of size polynomial in
n where the AND function seems to be the major barrier. Finally this project
will explore new applications of this line of research as well as other related
topics in computational complexity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While this proposal
takes a theoretical approach to instance compression, in the long-term continued
research in complexity will help focus efforts when trying to tackle difficult
computational problems that arise in practice. This project explore these
problems with graduate students as part of their thesis research. Research from
this project will be desseminated through conference and invited presentations
and publications in conferences, journals and on the Internet.&lt;br/&gt;
