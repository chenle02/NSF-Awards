The proper spatial and temporal control of gene expression is essential for the
normal growth and development of an organism. Gene expression is initiated by
transcription but active degradation of mRNA is also necessary for strict
temporal control. In eukaryotic cells there are two primary pathways for general
mRNA degradation: a decapping-dependent pathway that utilizes
5'-exoribonucleases and a 3'-pathway that acts on mRNAs subsequent to
deadenylation. Cell viability requires at least one of these pathways to be
functional. In yeast, 5' decay is the major degradation pathway, but in
mammalian cells evidence suggests that 3'-decay predominates. In addition to
degrading mRNAs, the 3'-decay pathway blocks translation of poly(A) minus RNA
that might arise as intermediates of degradation or from expression of viral
messages such as the endogenous killer virus in yeast. The major components of
this pathway are a heterotrimeric protein complex composed of Ski2p (a putative
ATPase/RNA helicase), Ski3p and Ski8p, the Ski7 protein and a multisubunit
exoribonuclease complex called the exosome. All components are required in vivo
for 3'-decay. The Ski2/3/8 complex is thought to act as an adapter to facilitate
mRNA 3'-degradation by the exosome. However, little is known about the molecular
mechanism of 3'-decay and the interplay of the 3'-decay machinery with the
translation apparatus. This project focuses on the biochemical function of the
Ski2/3/8 complex and its interaction with Ski7p and the exosome in yeast.
