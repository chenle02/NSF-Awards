This research makes an innovative application of the statistics of extreme
values to predict tsunami wave heights. The approach has been applied in recent
years, with good success, to predict floods and storm waves. The application of
this methodology to tsunami research is new. The study will specifically resolve
the following three significant issues in tsunami prediction: calculating the
symptotic distribution that is appropriate to estimate extreme tsunami wave
heights, finding the correct approach to use the historical record to predict
tsunami parameters, and evaluating the impact of uncertainties in predicting the
100- and 500-year tsunamic wave heights.
