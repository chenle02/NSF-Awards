This project is developing a set of learning materials and laboratory modules in
tele-healthcare to be used in undergraduate electrical and computer engineering
curricula. The materials are organized into five project-lab trees and ten
topic-subject trees that are self-contained and that may be used in any order.
Specific topics covered by the new laboratory materials include design project
in cardiac monitoring, mental health monitoring, medical security and long-
distance medical transmission. The learning materials are being developed using
a four-dimensional pedagogy that engages students with different learning
preferences and allows for asynchronous delivery. The project includes rigorous
formative and summative evaluation plans with both qualitative and quantitative
components coordinated by an experienced independent evaluator. The evaluation
plan is designed to establish the quality of the materials and to ensure the
project goals are met. The projects results are being disseminated through
conferences and journal publications and through direct contact with four other
institutions of higher education with diverse student bodies. The materials
developed in this project are being placed in the NSF sponsored National Science
Digital Library.
