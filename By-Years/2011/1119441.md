A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation on the R/V
Atlantis, a 274? general purpose Global vessel; the R/V Knorr, a 279?general
purpose Global vessel; and the R/V Oceanus, a 177?, general purpose,
Intermediate vessel. All three vessels are operated by Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System
research fleet. The request includes three items listed by priority:&lt;br/&gt;
1) Oxygen Titrators&lt;br/&gt; 2) SBE 9+ CTD&lt;br/&gt; 3) Laboratory plugmolds
and GFI circuits&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt; The principal
impact of the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure
support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in
support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually
undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The
acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-
funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated
instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and
expanding the base of potential researchers.
