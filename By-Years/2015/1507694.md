With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Division of
Chemistry and the Genetic Mechanisms Cluster in the Division of Molecular and
Cellular Biosciences are funding Dr. Alex Evilevitch from Carnegie Mellon
University to investigate the mechanism by which a virus infects its host. This
research project is directed at the study of the physical-chemical mechanisms
essential for infectivity and replication of viruses. The findings are of
fundamental importance for virology and physical virology in general.
Specifically, this project will provide new insight into physical conditions
necessary for the successful delivery of a virus genome into the cell nucleus
and for the subsequent process of assembly of new virus particles within the
cell. This project will expose undergraduate students to biophysical research
methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Herpes Simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a
prototypical model system to study the general infection mechanisms of
herpesviruses and other viruses that release their genome into the cell nucleus
without capsid disassembly. During viral replication, an ATP-dependent motor
packages the viral genome into a preformed capsid through a unique opening
created by the portal complex. Between rounds of replication, the virion must be
sufficiently stable to ensure that the packaged genome is retained within the
capsid. Conversely, during infection, the virion must be unstable enough to
allow genome release into the cell nucleus. A precise balance between these
physical aspects of the viral capsid and its encapsidated genome is crucial to
the viral replication cycle. Using HSV-1 as the primary model system, this
project will investigate the roles of intracapsid DNA mobility, internal DNA
pressure and capsid stability for viral replication with respect to retention of
the packaged genome inside the capsid and its subsequent ejection during
infection. These studies aim to provide new insights into the key mechanisms
facilitating, as well as inhibiting, viral infectivity.
