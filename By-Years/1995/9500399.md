ABSTRACT Christine Grant North Carolina State University CTS-9500399 The fouling
of metal surfaces is a widespread problem in the chemical and food processing
industries. Fouled heat transfer surfaces lead to increased costs due to added
heat transfer surface area, energy losses, maintenance, and production losses
caused by unit down-time. Poor yield and off-specification production due to
inefficient cleaning results in substantial economic losses. In the United
States the costs associated with fouling in the food and chemical industry have
been estimated to be 1.8-2.9 billion dollars per year. The proposed research
focuses on two specific process areas where decontamination is a major problem:
(1) the removal of fouling residues generated during high temperature milk
processing (e.g., aseptic processes) from stainless steel pipes and (2) the
removal of oils from stainless steel tubes.
