Many real-world phenomena can be modeled by dynamic networks whose connectivity
as well as activity changes over time. Hence, there is a growing interest in
elucidating the structure and dynamics of such networks. Existing approaches to
this problem focus mainly on utilizing either coarse network properties or
global structural features to comprehend network dynamics. Such methods often
rely on extensions of network features of static networks to understand dynamic
networks and fail to capture the rich dynamics of real-world networks.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This exploratory project explores a hierarchical approach
to decomposition of network structure and dynamics that can explain changing
dynamics at multiple scales ranging from node-level to community-level. The
approach is novel, and because of its untested nature, somewhat risky. The
research is organized around three aims:(i) Develop information-theoretic flow
based approaches that can extract multiple layers of dynamics by simultaneously
optimizing for explicit community structures and partial flow dynamics in
complex networks. (ii) Develop a computational framework for dynamics-aware
network summarization that preserves the flow dynamics of graphs and provides a
summary of the large-scale graph dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
advances the current state-of-the-art in network data analytics. The resulting
tools for elucidating the structure and dynamics of complex networks at multiple
scales could potentially transform the way we understand, design, engineer, and
control complex networks. The project enriches research-based training and
outreach activities at Wayne State University.
