The Second Topical Meeting on Picosecond Electronics and Optoelectronics is
organized under joint sponsorship by the Optical Society of America and the
asers and Electro-Optics Society of IEEE. It is scheduled to be held January
14-16, 1987, at Incline Village, Nevada. The purpose of the meeting is to bring
together researchers in the areas of electronics and oelectronics who share a
common interest in the physics and technology picosecond solid-state devices,
their multi-gigahertz applications and altrafast measurement techniques. Serving
as meeting cochairs are professor C.H. Lee, U. Maryland, and Dr. F. Capasso,
AT&amp;T laboratories, and Dr. H. Morkoc, U. Illinois/Urbana. The organizers of
the meeting are acknowledged leaders in the field, and the topic area is central
to long term research directions within the QEWB program. One Solid State and
Microstructures Program, Lightwave Technology Program, and QEWB are providing
joint funding from NSF. Partial support for this meeting is also being provided
by AFOSR, ARO, ONR, and the Optical Society of America.
