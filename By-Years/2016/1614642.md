A major goal in engineering of biological systems is to predictably reprogram
the genetics of cells to control a cellular function, such as to produce readily
detectable indicators of metabolic states or environmental conditions. Although
recent years have seen numerous advances towards this goal, the sophistication,
performance and scale of mammalian genetic circuits trail their microbial
counterparts. In this collaborative project, investigators from the US (Boston
University) and the UK (University of Warwick) combine experimentation and
computational modeling to develop a new genetic technology tool that will enable
mammalian cells to respond to a signal to reprogram genetic circuits with memory
capabilities. The memory feature is crucial to enable recordings of past events
in complex environments where continuous monitoring is not feasible, which will
be potentially useful for biopharmaceutical production. This project provides
interdisciplinary training opportunities for high school, undergraduate, and
graduate students in quantitative experimental methods and cell biology.

This project will develop new tools for controlling mammalian cell gene
expression using a class of DNA modifying enzymes called serine integrases.
Serine integrases have advantages over the better characterized tyrosine
recombinases due to the presence of recombinase directionality factors that bind
to serine integrases to modify its conformation, permitting the reverse reaction
to occur. To achieve this goal the PIs will: 1) perform detailed analyses of
serine integrase (Bxb1, PhiC31, TP901-1 and TG1) activity and specificity in
mammalian cells; 2) design, build and test inducible, rewritable memory switches
for biopharmaceutical production; and 3) design, construct, and test a serine
recombinase-based genetic circuit with reversible memory capabilities. This work
will provide in-depth characterization of the specificity and toxicity of serine
integrases and develop a novel decoder system for the reversible genetic circuit
through integrated experimentation and computational modeling.

This collaborative US/UK project is supported by the US National Science
Foundation and the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council.
