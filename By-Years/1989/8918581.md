Just as ensembles of traits may evolve, so may the system of inheritance that
affects the expression of those traits. The evolution of readily observable
traits such as body size, brain size, etc. is well understood from numerous
studies. We know how rapidly (or slowly) such observable traits evolve. Basic
evolutionary facts about systems of inheritance, however, are virtually unknown,
despite their importance to modern evolutionary theory. We do not know how
rapidly the inheritance system evolves. The system of inheritance for a set of
observable traits is assessed by measuring the degree of resemblance between
parents and their offspring for those traits. To assess the inheritance system
of any particular population, we must measure resemblance in many sets of
parents and offspring. The necessity of a large sample of relatives in each
population or species has frustrated comparative studies of inheritance. The
proposed project will use animals (garter snakes and water snakes) in which
large samples of parents and their offspring can be readily assembled. These
animals have the further advantage that evolutionary relationships are already
known from biochemical work. Consequently, systems of inheritance can be
compared among closely and distantly related species and rates of evolution can
be determined. Modern evolutionary theory often assumes that systems of
inheritance evolve so slowly that they are effectively invariant. The proposed
project will constitute the first strong test of that critical assumption in
natural populations of organisms.
