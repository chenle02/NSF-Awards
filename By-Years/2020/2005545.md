Formal deductive verification -- machine-checked proofs of program correctness
using tools such as proof assistants -- is an effective way of building very
high assurance secure components, such as operating-system kernels and
cryptographic communications primitives. Existing logics, tools, and methods for
program verification apply either to low-level languages (such as C) or high-
level functional languages. But real-world systems are programmed in a mix of
languages: low-level imperative languages for components such as operating-
system (OS) kernels and cryptographic primitives; high-level languages for most
applications, for OS-management code, for cryptographic protocols, and for the
runtime systems of the high-level languages. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project
develops methods and tools for formal verification of high-level language
programs linked with low-level programs, proved correct to a unified
specification that crosses the boundary with no gaps. The high-level language is
the functional programming language inside the Coq proof assistant, verified
using Coq’s logic, and compiled (provably correctly) with the CertiCoq compiler.
The low-level language is C, verified using the Verified Software Toolchain
(VST), and compiled (provably correctly) using the CompCert verified C compiler.
The new Verified Foreign Function Interface (VeriFFI) exploits synergies between
CertiCoq’s toolchain and VST/CompCert to enable such unified
verifications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
