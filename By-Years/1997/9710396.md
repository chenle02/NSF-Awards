Abstract Collier 9710396 This research explores the intersections and conflicts
among legal orders in Chiapas, Mexico where active debate over how to create a
multi-cultural democracy is ongoing. The increasing penetration of the cash
economy and state law into indigenous communities has been rapid. The research
builds on the investigator's work done in the same region in the 1960s that
analyzed "Zinacanteco law." The current exploration of ongoing economic and
political changes in Zinacantan focuses on how people in Tzotzil Maya township
are revising and reimagining their dispute management procedures in response to
the apparently contradictory forces of economic modernization and political
pressure to emphasize ethnic distinctiveness. By focusing on the concept of
"reconciliation," she investigates how women and men of various ages and
economic conditions are invoking notions of "indigenous" and "human" rights to
argue over the meaning and enforcement of traditional customs. The research uses
established anthropological methods of interviewing, case record analysis, and
participant observation.. Three kinds of changes in the legal system will be
analyzed: dispute management procedures, who initiates settlements, and the
discourse of indigenous custom. The project extends theoretical developments in
anthropological analyses and applications of dispute resolution. %%% This
