The Shelf Mixed Layer Experiment (SMILE) is a cooperative research program
designed to address the fundamental question of how the surface boundary layer
over the continental shelf responds to atmospheric forcing. The SMILE field
program will be conducted over the nortern California shelf from November 1988
to mid-May, 1989, and will consist of five main components: A long- term moored
array, a short-term moored array, shipboard Conductivity/Temperature/Depth (CTD)
and Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) surveys, a coastal meteorological
array to observe variability of the marine atmospheric boundary layer, and
overflights with an instrumented aircraft to measure atmospheric forcing, Eight
investigators at four institutions will participate. Beardsley (WHOI) is the
lead P.I., while Davis (Scripps), Friehe (UC-Irving), and Dorman (San Diego
State) propose to participate through subcontracts to WHOI.
