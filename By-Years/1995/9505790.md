IRI-9505790 Rao, H. Raghav SUNY-Buffalo $44, 498 - 12 mos This research is in
discrete resource allocation among multiple agents in an environment of
incomplete information. The problem is considered from the viewpoint of a
coordinator. The existence of incomplete information makes the issues involved
particularly complex. A decision and information theoretic perspective is being
used to study multiple information structures, the nature of information flows,
computational costs, and team problem solving. A comparative analysis of various
information and communication structures for multi-agent decision-making will be
undertaken, based on the concepts of spatial and logical entropy, with all of
the likely significant costs included in the analysis. The results are expected
to be significant both for the practical use of decision and information
theoretic models and for providing insights into harder problems in discrete
resource allocation under incomplete information.
