0402772 Khire The proposed alternative remediation technology using alternating
current (AC) may significantly reduce the remediation cost and shorten the
treatment period for remediation of contaminated soils or sediments located in
vadoze or saturated zones. In the proposed research, two separate large-scale
bench-scale tests on a clayey soil contaminated with: (1) phenanthrere (a PAH);
and (2) lead will be subjected to amplitude and frequency modulated AC signal.
The applied AC signal will be modulated to "tune up" with the net capacitance of
the soil. This will cause oxidation-reduction reactions during the charging and
discharging of the hypothesized nano-capacitors made up of negatively charged
clay particles and positively charged cations adsorbed on the clay particles.
