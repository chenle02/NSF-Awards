9311427 Koropchak This grant in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program is
for the development and characterization of an ultrasensitive, universal
detector based on condensation nucleation light scattering. The detector will be
coupled with chromatographic separation techniques that provide molecular
specificity. The detection mechanism involves the creation of an aerosol from
the chromatographic column effluent, removal of the mobile phase solvent,
followed by condensation nucleation with argon which increases the analyte
particle size to about 10 micrometers. This produces very effective light
scattering particles, and significantly enhances the sensitivity of the
detector. This device could be a universal detector for both HPLC and SFC. %%%
Professor Koropchak and his students will investigate the potential applications
of an aerosol-based, universal detector for liquid and supercritical fluid
chromatography. ***
