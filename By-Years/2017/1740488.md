The workshop "Simulating QCD on Lefschetz thimbles" will be held between June 28
and June 30, 2017, at the European Centre for Theoretical Studies in Nuclear
Physics and Related Areas (ECT*). This workshop will bring together researchers
in the area of Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) to study a promising new
approach to solving QCD on the lattice that is expected to alleviate
deficiencies of current methods. Developing reliable methods of calculating the
properties of QCD is important, because QCD is the theory of strong interactions
that binds fundamental particles known as quarks and gluons into protons and
neutrons, the building blocks of atomic nuclei. If successful, the new approach
will have significant impact on the experimental program at the Relativistic
Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop represents a good opportunity for junior
researchers to further their training and improve their careers. To make this
possible, NSF funding will provide partial travel support for junior scientists,
graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, to attend this workshop. The focus
of this activity on new methods to solving Lattice QCD at finite density is
expected to improve the understanding of experiments at relativistic ion
colliders that study the quark-gluon plasma properties and the location of the
QCD critical point.
