This proposal seeks to initiate a four-week summer program with follow-up
academic year activates for 20 students entering their senior year in high
school. The program is a residential Young Scholars program in several
environmental sciences. One of the major activities of the project involves each
student designing an environmental based research project and pursuing active
field and laboratory research in Yellowstone National Park. Faculty members from
Northwest College will serve as research scientists and mentors to the students.
