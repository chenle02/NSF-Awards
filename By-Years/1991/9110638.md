This study will develop an improved model of the head-tape interactions in high-
speed magnetic tape storage mechanisms. In particular, the coupled dynamics of
the rapidly moving flexible tape and the air foil bearing, which develops
between the tape and the recording head, will be modeled and a closed form
solution will be developed. The model is expected to provide information about
pressure distribution, head-tape separation and other technologically important
parameters.
