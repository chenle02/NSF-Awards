This project will provide for the dissemination of the results of projects
supported by the Undergraduate Course and Curriculum Development and Curriculum
Development in Mathematics programs. Projects in mathematics, physics,
chemistry, and computer science are all currently being supported at Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute, Dickinson College, University of Wisconsin, and The
University of Connecticut, each making significant impact on introductory
curricula in their respective disciplines. The purpose of this project is to
bring together some principal investigators of projects funded through these NSF
curricular development programs and to have them present their experiences at a
panel at the ASEE Annual Conference in June 1992. The American Society for
Engineering Education covers the whole gamut of engineering disciplines and
provides an opportunity each summer for many educators to exchange ideas at the
ASEE Annual Conference. The panelists will discuss their projects in a small
presentation and will answer questions from attendees at the meeting in order to
better acquaint the attendees with the type of development and progress that is
being made in introductory college and university science curricula. It will
also present the attendees with a better view of the opportunities for support
that are provided by the NSF programs.
