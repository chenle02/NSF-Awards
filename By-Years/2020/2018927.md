This Eastern Regional Network (ERN) CI-Research Alignment project organizes six
information-gathering events: four workshops and two All Hands Meetings. These
events are aimed at building and sustaining regional partnerships that simplify
multi-campus collaborations to advance the frontiers of research, pedagogy, and
innovation. With a deeper understanding gained through the four workshops,
augmented by wider discussions at the two All Hands meetings, the ERN is better
positioned to ensure impact across broad institutional types, research
disciplines and pedagogical approaches, and well versed in relevant technical
and administrative challenges and opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two
workshops focus on learning from the Cryo-EM and Materials Discovery communities
about their research workflows and their computational, storage, and network
requirements. These workshops also cover data management plans, types of
collaborations (national and international), and the pain points associated with
sharing data and resources between institutions. A third workshop brings
together university Vice Presidents of Research, Chief Information Officers,
General Counsel, Institutional Review Board directors, and other ERN
representatives to discuss the CI Sharing Policies needed to simplify sharing of
data, infrastructure, and expertise between universities and across state lines.
The final workshop, “Broadening the Reach,” includes researchers, educators, and
senior administrators from under-represented colleges and universities,
including MSIs, HSIs, and HBCUs. This workshop ensures that these institutions
can develop strategic and attainable CI plans and successful, sustainable CC*
funded initiatives that leverage the regional ERN
collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
