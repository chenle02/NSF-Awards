This collaborative EAGER activity addresses an important and long term problem
in the nation's cyber infrastructure (CI) -- the breadth and depth of network
engineering talent engaged in research and education networking at the
operational and engineering levels, and the associated education and training
opportunities made possible through direct engagement by network operations
experts. This activity focuses on undergraduate training for network engineering
and operations, structured around a training and internship program centered at
Indiana University, with a strong partnership established with the University of
Montana. The primary element in the internship program is a Networking
Fundamentals course over a 10-week period using inquiry-based learning
techniques. The program also includes weekly seminars and working internships in
operational environments at Indiana University leveraging their roles in campus,
national and global network operations and monitoring. Student recruitment will
emphasize EPSCoR jurisdictions. Student surveys will be used to evaluate the
program?s effectiveness. The activities leverage an existing network engineering
relationship between Indiana University and the University of Montana in which 2
students from Montana interned with Indiana?s GlobalNOC. The University of
Montana will expand their student involvement under this funding and improve the
course material. Intellectual merit is found in the effort?s exploration into
the effectiveness of inquiry based learning approaches in the context of network
engineering education at the undergraduate level. Broader impact relates
directly to the potential for these activities to significantly increase
education, workforce, and training opportunities in network research and
engineering in real operational settings across EPSCoR jurisdictions.
