The Lax-Nelson Lagrangian theory of an arbitrary dielectric crystal in
interaction with the electromagnetic field will be applied to several
interactions. The elastooptic effect will be studied in a crystal near a second-
order phase transition. This will explore how the asymmetry of the linear
elastic stiffness tensor, produced by coupling to rotation and recently
predicted by this theory, can be measured. The recent prediction of this theory
that natural optical activity can arise form three distinct mechanisms in
crystals and produce terms having two types of frequency dispersion will be
extended to magnetically induced optical activity (Faraday effect). The acoustic
analog of optical activity, acoustic activity will also be explored. The
frequency shift of optic modes caused by the application of stress or an
electric field will be calculated and related to the elastooptic effect. A
resolution to the Minkowski-Abraham controversy will be presented based on the
general conservation laws of real momentum and pseudo-momentum expressed in the
spatial and material coordinate systems respectively and upon our previous
analysis of the general nonlinear stress tensor of a dielectric crystal in
interaction with the electromagnetic field. The Lagrangian theory will be
generalized to include intrinsic spin of the particles composing the crystal
lattice. This will allow treatment of ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic
interactions. This will be accomplished by the introduction of Grassman
variables.
