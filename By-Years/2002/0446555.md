Shaul Mukamel of the University of California Irvine is supported by the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program of the Division of Chemistry for
research into the development of theoretical techniques for the calculation of
electronic and vibrational dynamics in complex molecules. The research involves
a special emphasis on predicting the signatures of these dynamics in novel
nonlinear spectroscopic probes. In particular, Mukamel is developing a dynamical
approach to understanding electronic excitation in aggregates and single
molecule junctions; is carrying out research into a method for photon counting
statistics in single molecule spectroscopy; is considering nonlinear spontaneous
fluctuations, response, dissipation and intermolecular forces; and is looking at
the distribution of work in driven molecules and nonequilibrium steady states.
This work is having a broad impact on other fields, particularly experimental
studies of these systems. In addition, Mukamel is continuing to offer, on a
permanent basis, his Chemical Physics Summer School which has been particularly
successful at introducing young researchers to this theoretical field.
