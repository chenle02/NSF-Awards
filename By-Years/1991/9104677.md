Recent work by the PI's and others has shown that the role of fluids in the
deformation of earth's crust is extremely important and yet imperfectly
understood. The interaction of fluids with active deformation zones (faults) is
a profitable area for research because many of the fault rocks contain evidence,
in the form of fluid inclusions, for the physical and chemical conditions that
prevailed during faulting. This study will test a general hypothesis that the
presence and separation of dissolved CO2 in fault zone fluids plays a crucial
role in earthquake generation. Two active normal faults in Utah will be used as
test sites for the presence of CO2-rich fluids and paleo-fluid pressure
gradients. In addition, the relationship between fault zone structure and fluid
channels will be quantified. The results will have major impact and our
understanding of fluids in fault initiation and propagation processes and will
enhance understanding of earthquake mechanisms.
