From September 2010 to June 2011 the Christchurch area in New Zealand
experienced a series of large earthquakes and aftershocks. In February 2011, an
aftershock of the first earthquake hit 10 km south of Christchurch, claiming
many lives. Some of those people were killed in landslide events triggered by
this quake. Subsequent earthquakes triggered landslides in these same areas. As
the city rebuilds, there is a need for understanding the hazards and risks
associated with coseismal land sliding. This research will result in a hazard
map that can be used by the Institute of Geological and Nuclear Science (GNS
Science) and other government decision makers. This research will be conducted
at GNS Science under the guidance of Dr. Chris Massey who worked to document
landslides triggered by these earthquakes.

In the non-seismic community, research has been done via statistical analysis
using data from landslides triggered by non-seismic methods. These analyses use
regression to determine how different factors affect the potential failure of
slopes. The method is gaining popularity as it produces a hazard map that covers
a great amount of area. Using these same methods, this proposal is to do the
statistical analysis so that a hazard map can be created of the Christchurch and
surrounding area from a database created after the February earthquake. This
hazard map can then be compared to the June earthquake to see how well it
predicts the land sliding that actually occurred. The main focus of this project
will be to create the statistical model which can be used to analyze the data
from the second earthquake in subsequent research projects. This NSF EAPSI award
is funded in collaboration with the Royal Society of New Zealand.
