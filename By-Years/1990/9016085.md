A one-day symposium will be held at the annual meeting of the American Society
of Zoologist in San Antonio, Texas, in December 1990. Animals are either
oviparous (egg-laying) or viviparous (live-bearing). Viviparity, often
considered a characteristic of mammals, has evolved independently in four of the
five classes of vertebrates, namely fishes, amphibian, reptiles, and mammals.
Birds are the sole exception. Evolutionary modification of the embryonic
developmental program an maternal reproductive physiology facilitated the
transition from oviparity to viviparity and form the basis of the new maternal-
embryonic relationships. As a group, vertebrates offer unique opportunities for
comparative and evolutionary studies of viviparity will be taken. Interactions
among a diverse group is anticipated. Proceedings of the symposium will be
published to provide a widely available reference for assessing progress in this
developing field.
