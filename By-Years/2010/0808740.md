This award provides funding for a 3 year continuing award to support a Research
Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering Site program at Oklahoma State
University (OSU), in the College of Engineering, Architecture and Technology
(CEAT) and the College of Education (CoE) entitled, "RET Site: Transitioning
Engineering Research to Middle Schools (TERMS)", under the direction of Dr.
Karen A. High.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Research Experiences for Teachers (RET)
in Engineering Site involves a total of 21, 6th-9th grade teachers from three
local public school districts, 7 each year for three years, and two REU students
per year in combined research and K-12 content development. The program consists
of pre-visit preparation, a six week summer research experience for the
teachers, a twelve week summer research experience for the REU students and
follow up academic interactions between RET teachers, OSU faculty, REU students,
and middle school students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's intellectual and
educational focus is on how engineers understand, design, fabricate, and test
materials and structures engineered so collective interactions give rise to
unique properties. TERMS will recruit participating teachers from low income,
rural, and Native American communities.
