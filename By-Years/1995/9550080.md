Summermath in the City This is a 5-year project to enhance 810 NK-6 teachers of
mathematics in five school districts in New York City. Ten entire schools are
targeted and developed as demonstration/resource sites for the districts as well
as for teacher preparation program through CCNY. By the fourth year, this is a
systemic model available to the NYC Urban Systemic Initiative project. This
project is connected with the Freudenthal Institute, Netherlands, with its
research and school-based focus on teaching mathematics through real world
problems. Video materials developed through the Freudenthal Institute and in NYC
classrooms in this project will be available as the project progresses. The
project has 5 phases: a two-week summer institute, a year-long course involving
in-classroom collaboration (co-teaching, co-reflecting, co-planning), teachers
collaborating with teachers on-site, field research and writing, and developing
teachers as leaders to co-teach institutes totaling at least 30 days of
enhancement for classroom teachers and up to 150 days for leader teachers at the
demonstration schools. The project evaluation has three dimensions: student
outcomes, teacher change, and the development of whole school cultures necessary
for successful mathematics reform.
