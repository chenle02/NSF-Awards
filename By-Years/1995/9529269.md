The goal of this dissertation research is to achieve an historical understanding
of the ways in which religious, cultural, and political meanings were interwoven
into astronomer Harlow Shapley's vision of science and view of the cosmos in the
formative decades of the Cold War. The study focuses on the activities that
dominated the life of Astronomer Harlow Shapley. These include his work in
support of international cooperation in science and his involvement with
'science-society' issues, including the problem of the relationship of science
to humanistic traditions and to questions of ethics and values. Shapley's
postwar activities included the promotion of a vision of science and its role in
society that was grounded in astronomy and popularized as a kind of `stellar
theology.` His activities provide a rich case study for documenting the
reciprocity between scientific thought and wide cultural influences
