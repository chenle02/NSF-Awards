9404672 Wong Technical abstract: It is proposed to study the dynamics of
interfaces in two different types of condensed matter systems. The first is the
movement of fluid interfaces in random porous media under applied pressure, the
second is the metal-electrolyte interface in electrolytic cells under applied
voltage. X-ray and neutron scattering will be used to study the physics at
microscopic length scales while video and x-ray imaging will be used to probe
the macroscopic behavior. Emphasis is on the study of statistical problems
related to pattern formation and the dynamics of pinning as various system
parameters are changed. Non-technical abstract: The flow of water and oil in a
reservoir is controlled by how the oil-water interface moves through the random
porous rock. The performance of a battery and the quality of electroplating
depend on how the structure of the metal- electrolyte interface changes during
the electrochemical reactions. Recent research shows that there is much
similarity in the physics that govern these apparently dissimilar systems. The
results will impact on the technologies in the petroleum and chemical
industries. ***
