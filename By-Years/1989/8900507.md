This award will provide support for an REU site award supporting six students
who will be engaged in mathematical research combining elements of abstract
algebra - group theory - with concepts from probability theory. The primary tool
underlying the work is the high level programming language CAYLEY designed
around the algebraic concepts of structure, set and mapping which uses an
extensive data base of group theoretic and geometric information. The program
allows users to define structures from which one may then extract information.
Problems which will confront the students fall into two classes. The first
concerns what are called typical values in sampling theory, focusing on the
amount of information about population means that one can obtain from
information about subsample means (typical values). With respect to symmetric
differences, the subsamples may form a group. The group structure is both
necessary and sufficient to produce the typical values. The second class of
problems concerns group structures which are not abelian but allow for
quantitative studies of how near or far the groups are from being abelian. There
are many questions one can pursue in this area which can lead to new discoveries
about existing groups as well as an appreciation for the fundamental nature of
group concepts such as cosets, conjugacy classes and subgroups.
