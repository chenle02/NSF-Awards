Atomic absorption spectroscopy has been established as the most important
technique in the identification and quantitative determination of trace metals.
This project educates chemistry, environmental studies, and selected non-
science-majors in the theory and operation of this powerful technique. The
instrument is being used in introductory non-science-major and science majors
labs as well as for advanced chemistry and environmental studies majors courses.
Starting with basic flame atomic absorption of single elements, students advance
to multi-element analyses by graphite furnace atomic absorption. This
effectively ensures proper training in modern atomic absorption techniques for
students who go on to strong industrial positions or excellent graduate schools.
In addition to the students and faculty at the college involved in this project,
the local Mathematics and Science Center has the opportunity to benefit from
this equipment.
