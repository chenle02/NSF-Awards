9319670 Dennison The objective of this project is to image the faint Balmer-
alpha emission produced by the warm, ionized, interstellar hydrogen. Digital
images will be obtained covering a significant fraction of the northern
hemisphere of the sky. The imaging system will consist of readily available
components: a small focal-ratio camera lens attached to a high quantum-
efficiency Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) camera; a narrow-bandpass interference
filter placed in front of the lens will selectively pass only the H alpha line
and reduce the noise contributed by the continuum sky background. The system
will detect H alpha emission far from the plane of our Milky Way galaxy, and
produce images of relatively high angular (arcminute) resolution. The system
will be mounted at a dark site within easy reach of the Virginia Tech campus.
Ultimately the resulting digital atlas will be made available to the
astronomical community.
