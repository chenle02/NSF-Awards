9614001 Kear This grant supports a conference on nanostructured materials with
emphasis on key issues associated with the science and technology of these
materials. Sessions examine the commercialization of nanostructured materials
for both near and long term applications. Topical areas of interest to the
meeting include synthesis and processing of nanostructured materials, including
the issues of high reactivity, contamination and improved consolidation;
characterization of properties of nanostructured materials; microstructural
characterization and related property correlations; thermodynamics and first-
principle calculations, including growth kinetics and atomistic models; near
term and long term applications of nanostructured materials, including the
issues of scale-up production, near-net shape forming, processing optimization,
and cost-benefit analyses. The grant supports student researchers to attend the
meeting and present papers and posters. %%% The conference explores new
developments in the field of nanocrystalline materials. Unique properties have
been demonstrated in a broad range of these materials. The properties derive
from their fine structural features, such as a grain size or layer thickness,
that is on a scale on the order of 1 to 100 nanometers. ***
