1340140&lt;br/&gt;Bowman, Katherine W.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The suite of new
analytical, computational, communications, and other technologies on which
researchers draw may have implications for the tools, facilities, human capital,
and other forms of architecture that enable the life sciences to progress. The
proposed scoping meeting will provide the foundation for a new series of
activities to address systematically the implications of these tools and
technologies in the changing nature of the life sciences. The understanding
gained from these activities will in turn have important implications for how
life sciences research is best organized, conducted, and supported.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of the proposed meeting is of significant
interest to NSF, particularly to the Divisions of CBET and MCB, as it will help
in developing funding strategies for future developments in life sciences and
its derived biotechnologies. Therefore, the meeting will be co-funded by both
divisions.
