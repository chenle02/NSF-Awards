This award supports a project to measure the carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration
in the WAIS Divide ice core covering the time period 25,000 to 60,000 years
before present, and to analyze the isotopic composition of CO2 in selected time
intervals. The research will improve understanding of how and why atmospheric
CO2 varied during the last ice age, focusing particularly on abrupt transitions
in the concentration record that are associated with abrupt climate change.
These events represents large perturbations to the global climate system and
better information about the CO2 response should inform our understanding of
carbon cycle-climate feedbacks and radiative forcing of climate. The research
will also improve analytical methods in support of these goals, including
completing development of sublimation methods to replace laborious mechanical
crushing of ice to release air for analysis. The intellectual merit of the
proposed work is that it will increase knowledge about the magnitude and timing
of atmospheric CO2 variations during the last ice age, and their relationship to
regional climate in Antarctica, global climate history, and the history of
abrupt climate change in the Northern Hemisphere. The temporal resolution of the
proposed record will in most intervals be ~ 4 x higher than previous data sets
for this time period, and for selected intervals up to 8-10 times higher.
Broader impacts of the proposed work include a significant addition to the
amount of data documenting the history of the most important long-lived
greenhouse gas in the atmosphere and more information about carbon cycle-climate
feedbacks - important parameters for predicting future climate change. The
project will contribute to training a postdoctoral researcher, research
experience for an undergraduate and a high school student, and outreach to local
middle school and other students. It will also improve the analytical
infrastructure at OSU, which will be available for future projects.
