A Computer Algebra Workshop is being held to provide undergraduate faculty
(chemistry, mathematics, and physics) from the universities in Puerto Rico, with
a computational tool to enhance and stimulate traditional teaching in natural
sciences. Fifteen participants are receiving intensive "hands-on" training from
experienced instructors in the use of REDUCE, a computer algebra system.
Participants are being encouraged to develop specific applications of computer
algebra in their respective fields. As a follow-up, and also for motivation and
support, a user's group linked via a local network (UPRENET) is being
established.
