Engineers for Exploration (E4E) is an experiential program where undergraduates
perform computer systems research that addresses technology gaps in
conservation, cultural heritage, and exploration. Research problems are framed
by real-world, impactful applications, providing participants with a
multidisciplinary research experience in topics related to embedded systems,
remote sensing, digital signal processing, computer vision, machine learning,
robotics, and data analytics. Participants have an impactful research project, a
multi-tiered mentor network, and structured collaboration with researchers,
scientists, and explorers. Faculty, scientists, and engineers mentor
participants using state-of-the-art facilities to develop cutting-edge computer
systems research. E4E seeks participants from all segments of society,
specifically targeting community colleges, minority-serving institutions, and
other universities whose students do not have opportunities to participate in
graduate research. E4E REU Site will recruit community college students, helping
them benefit most from the REU experience. Graduate and postdoctoral students
will get trained to serve as research mentors, providing them with the
experience needed for their future careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary
goal of this REU site is to expose undergraduate participants to computer
systems research motivated by real-world applications. E4E REU Site projects
develop innovative computer systems deployed worldwide by scientists and
explorers. Collaborators include scientists at the San Diego Zoo Wildlife
Alliance, the UCSD Scripps Institution of Oceanography, The Nature Conservancy,
and the National Geographic Society. These projects target domains such as
aerially monitoring mangrove coverage, wildlife species identification using
acoustic sensors, and underwater 3D computer vision-based fish population
monitoring. REU participants will conduct their research by interacting with
faculty mentors, domain scientists, postdocs, and graduate students who serve as
their mentoring team. E4E projects include developing machine learning
algorithms to assess the effects of climate change on ecosystems, creating
drone-based radio frequency localization systems to track endangered species,
and building 3D capture systems to scan, visualize, and document archaeological
sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
