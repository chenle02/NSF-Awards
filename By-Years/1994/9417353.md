Mutel, Robert L. 94-17353 Mutel will conduct a three-year program to use the VLA
and VLBA to investigate properties of non-thermal radio emissions from close,
late-type binaries which show evidence for enhanced activity. It is a 3-part
program: 1) to determine the spatial distribution of radio emission in the outer
magnetospheres of several binaries with the VLBA; 2) to determine the frequency
dependence of the polarization, spectra and time history of several classes of
active binaries using the VLA; and 3) to use the VLA and VLBA observations to
test and develop quantitative models for the geometry and dynamics of stellar
magnetospheres for close binaries. ***
