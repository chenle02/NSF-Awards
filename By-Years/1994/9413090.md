9413090 Hoover Polytechnic University has teamed with New York City Technical
College, New York City Industrial Technology Assistance Corporation, Alfred P.
Sloan Foundation, KEPCO, Medical Laboratory Automation, Loral Electronic
Systems, IBM, Symbol Technologies, Mini-Circuits, Avon Products, and Steinway &
Sons to expand Polytechnic University's innovative, practice-oriented M.S.
Program in Manufacturing Engineering. The program concentrates on improving the
productivity of small manufacturers in the community. The program relies heavily
on adjunct faculty from local manufacturing firms and its course projects
require solving real manufacturing problems. Many of the students are member of
minorities employed at small firms. The program's approach will allow some
students to complete a master's degree in manufacturing education in one year.
