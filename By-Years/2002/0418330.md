0418330&lt;br/&gt;Phillips&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Pan-American Advanced Studies
Institute (PASI), jointly supported by the NSF and Department of Energy is
proposed on the topic of Mottness and Quantum Criticality, to be held in Tobago,
West Indies during June, 2005. The topic involves problems that are central to
the unsolved problems of the origin of superconductivity in the copper-oxide
materials and organic superconductors, and non-Fermi liquid behavior in U and Ce
intermetallics (heavy fermions). This two-week institute will bring together
leading researchers in the field to focus on both of these problems. The PASI
will consist of approximately 20 lecturers and 30 graduate students, half from
the US and half from the rest of the Americas, to be selected by an organizing
committee. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five questions will comprise the focus of the
PASI: 1) What is the experimental evidence that quantum critical points
influence finite temperature properties of the cuprates?, 2) What role does
spectral weight transfer over the Mott scale play in the normal and
superconducting states of the cuprates?, 3) What is the role played by disorder
close to quantum critical points?, 4) Do model studies of strongly correlated
systems have any predictive power? 5) What can be learned from parallel systems
such as the organic superconductors, heavy fermions and novel metal phases in
low dimensional systems? &lt;br/&gt;To further the impact of the PASI, the
organizers have 1) included both experimentalists and theorists and 2) limited
the scope of the conference to focus on the very specific questions posed above.
Ample time in the workshop will be devoted&lt;br/&gt;to discussions, in part to
enable collaborations that could elucidate the posed questions. As these
questions are central to the current debate on strongly correlated electrons,
the PASI is timely and is likely to generate further activity in the subject
matter.&lt;br/&gt;
