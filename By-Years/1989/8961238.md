A new method for dating polar ice or other environmental Samples which are
50,000 years to 1,000,000 years old is proposed, based on the direct
measurements of cosmogenic 81Kr (half-life = 210,000 yrs.). The method consists
of isotopic enrichment of the krypton extracted from the ice followed by
ultrasensitive detection of the 81Kr using the laser-based technique of
Resonance Ionization Spectroscopy. Feasibility of the 81Kr technique will be
demonstrated by measuring 81Kr in two old ice samples and two modern ice samples
collected from the Allan Hills area of Antarctica. The results will provide the
basis for development of a commercial 81Kr-dating facility which will have
important applications, in addition to polar ice dating, in groundwater dating,
hydrology, solar neutrino studies, and meteorite studies.
