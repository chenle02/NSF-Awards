9418732 Stacey This award supports the participation of six U.S. scientists in a
U.S.- Japan seminar on Molecular, Physiological, and Ecological Aspects of
Symbiotic Nitrogen Fixation, to be held at Kagoshima University, Kagoshima,
Japan in October 1995. The co-organizers are Dr. Gary Stacey of the University
of Tennessee and Dr. Shiro Higashi of Kagoshima University Both the U.S. and
Japan are supporting major efforts in symbiotic nitrogen fixation and
interaction between the research groups of both countries will accelerate
progress. The seminar topic areas encompass both the plant host and bacterial
counterpart in the symbiotic nitrogen fixing interaction, as well as topics
ranging from enzymology, molecular genetics, plant cell biology, whole plant
physiology, ecology, and ultimately to plant genetics and crop production. This
meeting is the third in a series of U.S.-Japan seminars in this field held over
a period of 10 years. Although a core of individuals has provided continuity
from meeting to meeting, participants in the seminars have changed through the
years to reflect an appropriate pairing between U.S. and Japanese participants
and the progress of the research. The U.S. participants provide a broad cross
section of expertise and geographical representation in the overall area of
symbiotic nitrogen fixation, and were selected on the basis of being the most
active researchers in the U.S. Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives
of the Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge through an
international collaboration. ***
