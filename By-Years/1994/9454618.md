This project aims to develop and distribute a curriculum for an associate degree
in the fields of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Global Positioning
Systems (GPS). The projected need for trained GIS and GPS technicians is high
since, within the next decade, every plane, ship and nearly every vehicle on the
highway will use GIS and GPS; and governments will rely on the technologies to
track, tabulate, and map environmental census and tax data. In cooperation with
a network of eight community colleges, an innovative curriculum is being planned
and tested, which would link the environmental, legal, and business experience
of the partner colleges with the lead institution's experience in GIS/GPS and
engineering technology. The curriculum, and all support materials, are being
used as a vehicle to ease articulation between other schools (secondary, two-
year and four-year) which are interested in adding GIS/GPS to their curricula.
The materials will also be disseminated through national publishers, journals,
and a national educational association.
