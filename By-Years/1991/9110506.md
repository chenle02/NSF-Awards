At present, it is unknown whether the neural circuitry which underlies learning
in mature animals is the same as that which underlies learning in immature
animals. However, it is clear that associative learning is possible in newborn
rats prior to development or maturation of many structures and neurochemical
systems known to be important for learning in the adult. Dr. Regina Sullivan
intends to expand our knowledge in this important research area by assessing
whether a specific neurotransmitter system, the norepinephrine system, may
account for at least some of these differences in learning which occur during
development. She will employ pharmacological, neurophysiological, and anatomical
techniques to research this topic. This work is important as we attempt to
understand the developmental aspects of learning.
