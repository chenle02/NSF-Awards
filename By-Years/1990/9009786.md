This is a Research Planning Grant to enable Dr. Newport to initiate independent
studies of the expression of Drosophila neurogenesis genes in the neural crest
of the chick embryo. It is anticipated that this award will help Dr. Newport
obtain the preliminary results necessary to launch an independent research
career.
