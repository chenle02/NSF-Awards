This award supports participation in the international conference Number Theory
at Illinois hosted by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on June
5-7, 2014. The conference will bring together distinguished number theorists to
report on current research trends and recent advances in the field, particularly
in the areas of analytic, algebraic, and combinatorial number theory, all of
which have seen spectacular recent breakthroughs. It will provide an opportunity
for graduate students and young researchers to learn about the latest research
in these areas, to interact with leading experts in the field, and to gain
exposure for their own research through contributed talks. The conference is
expected to attract around 150 participants. It will feature about 20 invited
speakers representing a broad spectrum of areas in number theory, as well as
contributed talks. The proceedings of the conference will be published in a
special volume of the International Journal of Number Theory. The grant funds
will support the participation of approximately 30 graduate students, recent
PhDs, and other research-active faculty without external support, and
approximately 9 invited speakers.

Number theory is a central field of mathematics, one that is rich in history,
but also serves as the theoretical foundation for important modern day
applications such as data encryption and compression. The conference serves as a
forum to disseminate recent advances in this field and to exchange ideas and
engage in collaborative discussions, thus promoting further advances in this
field. The conference will showcase number theory as a lively, attractive, and
important area of mathematics to a broad and diverse group of participants, thus
helping draw more people into this field. Special efforts are made to encourage
participation of graduate students, recent PhDs, and younger researchers who do
not have their own support, including women and under-represented minorities. To
further encourage and facilitate participation by graduate students and young
researchers, a graduate student number theory conference will be held on the
University of Illinois campus on the two days preceding the Number Theory at
Illinois meeting.
