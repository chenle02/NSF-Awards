This research is in many areas of number theory. Montgomery will pursue a
number of basic questions in analytic number theory and related areas of
harmonic analysis, diophantine approximation and the geometry of numbers. Most
of these questions involve sets of numbers or vectors which are almost
independent. The object is to exploit the almost independence appropriately in
order to achieve the desired aim. Masser will study some diophantine problems
which lend themselves into the following groupings: (a) using transcendence
techniques to examine isomorphism classes of elliptic curves; (b) to obtain
upper bounds for the number of points of small height on a fixed abelian
variety; (c) to establish precise conditions for the algebraic independence of
values of certain Mahler-type power series at algebraic points; and (d) to study
the multiplicities of linear recurrences for a finite field. Milne's research
object is to produce a comprehensive set of reciprocity laws describing how
automorphisms of the complex numbers act on automorphic functions automorphic
forms, their special values, their "Fourier-Jacobi series, and the Eisenstein
series attached to cusp forms on boundary components. Keating's research object
is to understand Igusa curves better by studying their function fields including
applications to coding theory and factorization theory. He proposes to use
Drinfeld's theory of extensions of function fields to produce a more explicit
characterization of the function fields. This research is in very broad areas of
number theory, the study of the properties of the integers. Montgomery's focus
is on that part of the subject where classical analysis is used to understand
these deep questions. Masser's research concentrates on using transcendence
techniques (again analytic but of a very different type than Montgomery's
techniques) to study problems concerning solutions of equations in integers.
Milne combines algebraic and modern analytic techniques to study special
functions that arise in number theory. Keating studies special domains that are
important in number theory.
