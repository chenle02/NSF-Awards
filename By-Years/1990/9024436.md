This project comprises the installation, calibration, and operational
preparation of the radome type gust probe system on the two NOAA WP3Ds for the
TOGA COARE program. Fast-response temperature and humidity sensors will also be
included for the measurement of sensible and latent heat fluxes. Previous
experience with the installation of the radome system on an NRL P3 indicate that
high-quality turbulence data will be obtained. The reduction of the raw data to
calibrated time series suitable for analysis by the TOGA COARE investigators is
also proposed. This research is important because it serves as one of the
studies of TOGA COARE that links convective scale physical processes to the
larger scales that impact climate variability in an especially climate sensitive
region of the world, the western Pacific Ocean, the field site of TOGA COARE.
