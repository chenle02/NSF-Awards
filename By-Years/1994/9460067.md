This SBIR Phase I project will explore the potential silver telluride/arsenic
sulfide, an inorganic resist system, as a photoresist for the new lithographic
wavelength of 193 nanometers (nm). This system exhibits high contrast, is a top-
surface imaging resist and exhibits an edge effect not observed in other resist
systems. All of these features can contribute importantly to the lithography of
sub 0.5 micron linewidths. High contrast can extend the high-frequency
capability of a deep UV optical system as well as contribute to linewidth
control. Top-surface imaging will permit good lithography with the limited depth
of focus available from a deep UV lithography system. The edge effect which has
only been observed in inorganic resist systems has played an important role at
longer wavelengths in achieving submicron linewidths. This may play an important
role at 193 nm in obtaining sub 0.5 micron linewidths. Having examined the
inorganic resists at g-line (436 nm), the proposing firm has examined the
proposed system at I-line (365 nm) and measured its sensitivity at 193 nm.
Results suggest that the proposed system is a reasonable candidate for
exploration as a 193 nm resist.
