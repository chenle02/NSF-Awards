The goals of the project are to find an efficient method for calculating cross
sections for dissociative attachment induced by electron impact on molecules and
to develop a new kinetic theory for electron plasmas ("swarms") in molecular
gases. Both projects seek to answer a common scientific question: what
underlying physical mechanisms control the changes in the vibrational dynamics
of a molecule that occur when an electron collides with the molecule? The
research will investigate the applicability of density functional theory to low-
energy collisions of electrons with molecules. The non-adiabatic R-matrix method
will be used to treat the electron-nuclear dynamics. The project on kinetic
theory of gases will try to resolve a long standing discrepancy between
vibrational cross sections measured in beam experiments and those from swarm
experiments.
