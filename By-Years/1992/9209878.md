This proposal seeks funding to develop seismic tomography software for three
dimensional anisotropic media. The software will be used in geophysical and
geotechnical applications. It would incorporate a method of estimating
uncertainties that is based on quantifying the effect of a fixed number of
random perturbations of observations on the solution. The software would be
tested using seismic data obtained from small scale isotropic and anisotropic
models constructed in the laboratory. The proposed study represents a new
direction of research for the principal investigator that should lead to more
interdisciplinary studies with colleagues in computer science and civil
engineering.
