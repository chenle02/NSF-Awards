ABSTRACT

Proposal Number: CTS-02233687 Principal Investigator: Conrad, Hans and Balik, C.
Maurice Affiliation: North Carolina State University Title: SGER - An
Exploratory study into the effect of composite particles and addition of
nanoparticles on the properties of electrorheological fluids

The main goal of the proposed exploratory project is to find a method for
substantially increasing the yield stress in electrorheological (ER) fluids,
removing the last obstacle to widespread application of this material to a host
of mechanically coupled devices with applications in automotive, aircraft,
architectural and military components. The approach is based on a systematic
investigation of the effect of addition of core-shell composite particles and a
host of nanoparticles of PbTiO3 and other materials with high dielectric
constant.
