The goal of this project is to synthesize and characterize biomaterials for use
in the drying of gases and organic vapors. The biomaterials will be formulated
from polymers of glucose (ie., starch and cellulose) and pentoses (ie., xylans
and hemicellulose) to give a sorbent which is robust, biodegradable, and
compatible with existing fixed bed gas separation processes and hardware.
