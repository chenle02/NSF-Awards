This award will support a special month and a conference on stochastic flows at
the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. March, 1990 is the special month,
and the conference will occur on March 16-18. Ludwig Arnold of the University of
Bremen, Germany will visit during the special month, and interact with the
Mathematics Department's probability group. Professor Arnold will also be the
main speaker of the conference. The goal of the conference is to bring together
researchers--especially those of the Southeast--who are working on different
aspects of stochastic flows, and to encourage an interchange of information and
to stimulate cooperative efforts.
