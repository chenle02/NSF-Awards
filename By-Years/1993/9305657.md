This awards supports the research of Professor D. Gieseker to work in algebraic
geometry. He will study stable bundles on algebraic surfaces and the theory of
isospectral deformations of difference operators, in particular a two
dimensional version of the Toda lattice will be studied. He will also
investigate a possible method for computing Donaldson polynomials. The research
is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of the oldest parts of modern
mathematics, but one which blossomed to the point where it has, in the past 10
years, solved problems that have stood for centuries. Originally, it treated
figures defined in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely polynomials.
Today, the field uses methods not only from algebra, but also from analysis and
topology, and conversely it is extensively used in those fields. Moreover, it
has proved itself useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical computer
science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics.
