The principal concept of this research is that the combination of a spring
pulse of detrital addition to estuarine sediments and relatively low
temperatures maximize the production of animal biomass. The nutritive value of
the sediment is hypothesized to be low, except just after the detrital addition
in the spring. This study will assess seasonal changes in the nutritional value
of sediment under experimental conditions of varying temperature and detrital
addition; it will seek to understand how sediment nutritional value changes. The
conversion of sediment carbon and nitrogen to animal flesh will be compared with
the conversion efficiency from detritus. The importance of the anoxic zone as a
factor limiting the depth of feeding access will also be investigated.
