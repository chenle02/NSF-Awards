This research project is in the discipline of descriptive set theory: the
analysis of sets of numbers by the complexity or simplicity of their
description. While abstract set theory is replete with counterintuitive
pathologies (such as splitting a ball into five pieces and reassembling them
into two copies of the original ball), many of these are circumvented by
imposing constraints on the definition of the sets involved. Moreover, the
search for definable solutions to some question is often tied closely with the
study of algorithms in computer science. In this fashion, algorithms for
analyzing configurations in large finite networks often correspond to
descriptive set-theoretically simple solutions to infinite problems, and there
are notable examples of the infinite analysis shedding light on the finite
counterparts as well. Drawing out further connections between these finite and
infinite settings is a major focus of the project, which is accessible to
student researchers as well as more advanced mathematicians. The project
includes the training of undergraduate and graduate students.

More specifically, the project applies descriptive set-theoretic methods to
examine the structure of definable graphs. Such graphs often arise in
topological dynamics and ergodic theory, and in particular their combinatorial
properties are often intertwined with algebraic aspects of the acting group.
Specific combinatorial problems under investigation include: determining
definable chromatic numbers of graphs, identifying when matchings and
circulations can be found, and characterizing when such graph admit useful
acyclic subgraphs. The project also explores applications of these ideas towards
finding tilings of group actions and understanding the equidecomposability
relation arising from such actions. These topics are all closely tied with the
local model of distributed computing in theoretical computer science and also
have interactions with finite combinatorics, graph limits, probability, and
geometric group theory.
