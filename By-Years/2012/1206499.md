This project seeks to advance understandings of teacher professional knowledge
in science. It focuses on bringing greater clarity to the pedagogical content
knowledge (PCK) construct, the model of professional knowledge in which PCK is
embedded, and its implications for enhancing teacher practice and student
learning.

Thirty participants from eight countries will take on the task of contributing
to and/or completing this synthesis through a summit and follow-up activities. A
set of recommendations will be made to guide future research aimed at advancing
this field of study.

This is a very worthy project in science education research. It is innovative
and brings together world-wide experts in science education to develop products
that will communicate refined models for teacher professional knowledge. The
project draws on past NSF-supported research and builds on a highly diverse body
of literature. It yields a wealth of information that could lead to a commonly
accepted agreement among science education researchers about PCK and articulates
future directions for collaborative research as well as instrument development
and/or refinement.
