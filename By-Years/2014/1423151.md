The number of smartphones in use worldwide reached 1.038 billion units during
the third quarter of 2012, and smartphone users are expected to be over 2
billion by 2015. With this fast-growing and a large asset of tablets and
smartphones, the sheer number and density of wireless devices has overwhelmed
network resources to support the level of quality expected by users. Utilizing
cloud computing, mobile cloud computing (MCC) has been recently introduced to
facilitate mobile users to take full advantages of cloud computing, even with
the reduced available network capacity. The objective of this project is to
explore fundamental issues that advance our understanding of using mobile clouds
in delivering wireless data traffic. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work
aims to (i) explore sufficient and necessary conditions of mobile cloudlets
through one-hop communications to ensure short delay and easy management of task
dispatch; (ii) identify theoretical limits of mobile cloudlets by harnessing the
latest understanding of link-level dynamics with the focus on the discrepancy in
homogeneous and heterogeneous mobile nodes in the evolution of mobile cloudlets
over time; (iii) investigate new algorithms that detect mobile clouds that are
based on not only their spatial locations, but other factors, such as power-
saving, tethering access points, non-exponential inter-contact time
distributions, as well as social connections among mobile devices; (iv) find how
long and how far it could take before data arrives at the cloud in a hybrid
network model.
