This research addresses issues important to the study of theoretical and
computational methods of obtaining solutions to nonlinear hyperbolic
conservation laws when shock waves are present. The main objective of the
research is to understand nonlinear waves and their interactions in physical
processes, and in numerical methods that simulate these processes. Topics
include a study of the stability of wave patterns and the stability of numerical
methods in systems exhibiting nonlinear resonance due to coincidence of wave
speeds; a program for constructing a general theory of resonant wave
interactions in inhomogeneous systems or conservation laws (including systems
that arise in transonic gas dynamical flow in variable diameter pipelines); and
the study of gravity waves in general relativity from the point of view of
nonlinear waves. The project is in the area of applied mathematics dealing with
the study of shock waves. The results of this research impinge upon the fields
of nonlinear partial differential equations, functional analysis, geometry,
numerical analysis, scientific computing, and mathematical physics.
