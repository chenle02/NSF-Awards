The purpose of this research is to model empirically the distributed processing
network responsible for certain higher brain functions in humans. The models to
be achieved will have medical relevance (EEG analysis) and relevance to the
design of parallel pattern recognition and decision systems. In previously
funded research, the group has used a large array of scalp electrodes to specify
the origin of EEG signals associated with specific functions. To solve some of
the problems encountered in prior work, a larger array (128 channels) will be
implemented along with an appropriate finite-difference head and brain model.
These will allow deconvolution of the scalp-recordings to just above the
cortical surface. Magnetic resonance images will be used to arrive at the model
which will be validated against independent data sets.
