This project develops an undergraduate course in reactor concepts utilized in
most environmental engineering processes, and demonstrates these principles
using advanced laboratory methods. The environmental engineering field is
currently undergoing dramatic increases in the demand for engineers with the
sophistication to design treatment processes and implement site remediation
strategies. These increases have resulted from the promulgation of federal
standards for the remediation of contaminated sites and the removal of trace
concentrations of hazardous compounds from water supplies. Improvements in
environmental engineering education to meet these challenges has lagged behind
the increased sophistication in environmental engineering technology. The
objective of this project is to provide students with a more diverse
environmental engineering background through the development of the course and
its laboratory component. Specifically, an Ion Chromatography System, pH/Ion
Selective Electrode Meters and an Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer are being
incorporated into the laboratory to address this issue.
