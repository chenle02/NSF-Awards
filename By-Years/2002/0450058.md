Professor Daniel Nocera of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is
supported by the Division of Chemistry for his research exploring how light can
be used to drive multielectron transformations of small molecules with emphasis
on energy related substrates. New insights into the design of multielectron
reagents, of electronic structure predisposed to multielectron reactivity, and
of the mechanism of multielectron transfer processes will emerge from this
research. The development of two-electron mixed-valence chemistry holds similar
promise for developing multielectron photoprocesses of small molecule activation
and energy conversion.

Meeting global energy needs over the next century requires greater understanding
of key fundamental science issues for the elaboration of new carbon-neutral
energy conversion schemes. To understand the chemistry of the activation and use
of small molecules of energy consequence, including carbon dioxide, nitrogen and
methane, in addition to hydrogen, water and oxygen, new multielectron inorganic
redox reactions will be investigated with the aim of understanding of the
reactivity of metal complexes in electronic excited states beyond conventional
one-electron transfer. The combination of synthesis with photochemistry and
spectroscopy will give undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs a unique
training experience in a forefront inorganic chemistry program.
