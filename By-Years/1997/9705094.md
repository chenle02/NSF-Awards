9705094 Bhattacharya It is apparent that a new class of quantum wells, formed
with indirect-indirect heterostructures, give highly efficient luminescence in
the visible region of the optical spectrum. In spite of the staggered type II
lineup in these heterostructures a sufficient overlap of the electron and hole
wavefunctions can be engineered by appropriate confining layers on either side
of the quantum wells. Preliminary experiments with AIP/AIO.6GaO.4P quantum wells
grown on GaP substrates by metalorganic vapor epitaxy have been carried out by
the author. In addition to a strong no-phonon emission near green, a very strong
emission is observed near orange. The emission is believed to be from the (-
point in the quantum well and can be shifted to longer wavelengths by changing
the material parameters. The P.I. will engineer the bandgap of the
heterostructures to shift the dominant luminescence peak into the blue region.
