In the study of local rings of equicharacteristic p, the &lt;br/&gt;tight
closure has proved very useful, This closure also extends &lt;br/&gt;nicely to
local rings of equicharacteristic zero. Unfortunately this &lt;br/&gt;closure
does not naturally extend to mixed characteristic rings. &lt;br/&gt;This project
is designed to fill this void. In earlier work, the &lt;br/&gt;principal
investigator defined four variants of an extended plus &lt;br/&gt;closure. As
the name suggests, these closures are based upon the &lt;br/&gt;plus closure of
an ideal, the set of elements which are in the &lt;br/&gt;extension of the ideal
in some integral extension of the original &lt;br/&gt;ring. In the earlier work,
a number of properties of the closures &lt;br/&gt;were demonstrated, In this
project, additional properties will be &lt;br/&gt;demonstrated, While the
benefits of this project will probably not &lt;br/&gt;be restricted to these,
the objectives are the properties which shall &lt;br/&gt;allow the extended plus
closure to fill the role of tight closure. &lt;br/&gt;Assuming the program is
successful, the following will be &lt;br/&gt;demonstrated. Ideals in regular
local rings will be shown to be &lt;br/&gt;closed. The colon-capturing property
will be proved. The &lt;br/&gt;persistence property will be proved - an element
in the closure of an &lt;br/&gt;ideal will remain in the closure upon taking
homomorphic images. It &lt;br/&gt;should also be shown that an element which is
not in the closure of &lt;br/&gt;an ideal of a local ring will also not be in
the closure when the &lt;br/&gt;ideal is extended to the completion. A
successful project will have &lt;br/&gt;major ramifications for the homological
understanding of mixed &lt;br/&gt;characteristic rings. Among other things, this
will imply the truth &lt;br/&gt;of the Direct Summand Conjecture.&lt;br/&gt; One
of the most fundamental subjects in algebra is the &lt;br/&gt;understanding of
ideals and modules in local rings. For those local &lt;br/&gt;rings which
contain a field, tight closure has evolved as a way to &lt;br/&gt;give a unified
presentation - and a simplified one - for many of the &lt;br/&gt;known
properties of these objects. As a natural byproduct, it has &lt;br/&gt;also led
to the discovery of new properties. Understanding of local &lt;br/&gt;rings
which do not contain a field has always lagged behind. The &lt;br/&gt;principal
investigator has proposed several closely related and &lt;br/&gt;highly
promising candidates to play the role of tight closure in the
&lt;br/&gt;alternate setting. In this project, the investigator will attempt to
&lt;br/&gt;determine to what extent these new closures fill the void.
