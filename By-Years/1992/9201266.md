We propose to carry out research on the analysis and development of iterative
methods that possess good convergence rates when applied to solving linear and
nonlinear systems arising from 3D partial differential equations and that also
possess sufficient inherent degree of parallelism for efficient implementation
on advanced parallel computers. We focus on two representative types of
iterative algorithms, one fine grain (multiscale preconditioners) and one coarse
grain (domain decomposition), that we feel offer the best hope as a basis for
developing efficient algorithms for their respective architectures. We shall pay
particular attention to problems with rough and discontinuous coefficients,
convection-diffusion problems and model Navier-Stokes problems. In addition, new
classes of parallel machines have also emerged (e.g. CMX and MASPAR), and we
propose to investigate the suitability of some of these new architectures for
these two classes of iterative methods.
