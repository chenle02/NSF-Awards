The 2004 IEEE INFOCOM Conference on Computer Communications will be held in Hong
Kong from March 7 to March 11, 2004. This preeminent technical conference is the
primary venue for presenting new research results in the area of computer
communications, and is widely attended by researchers and practitioners in the
field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attending conferences such as INFOCOM is of
paramount importance for the development of graduate students, post-doctoral
researchers, and junior faculty members. Participants have the opportunity to
present their work, attend panel and keynote sessions, and interact with
hundreds of others performing leading-edge research in the field. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The travel awards will target graduate students, since attending
conferences is an important part of their educational experience, and they often
have limited travel funds. The proposal requests funding to aid approximately
twelve graduate students to attend this conference. &lt;br/&gt;
