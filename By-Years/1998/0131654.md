Within the brain there are cells called glial cells that are intimately
involved with the functions of neurons (nerve cells), and astrocytes form a
whole class of glial cells. In mammals, astrocytes and neurons in an area called
the arcuate nucleus show sexual dimorphism; during development, the cells in
males become structurally different from the cells in females. This
differentiation is hormonally mediated by the steroid hormone estradiol, even
though the astrocytes lack molecular receptors for estrogens, and there is
evidence that the neurotransmitter compound GABA (gamma-amino butyric acid) is
involved. This project uses biochemical and molecular approaches to test the
hypothesis that estradiol modulates the release of GABA, which in turn modulates
calcium influx, promoting the formation of gap junctions throughout the
population, so the whole population can differentiate together despite the lack
of estrogen receptors.&lt;br/&gt; Results from this work will have an impact
beyond neuroendocrinology, including developmental neuroscience and cell
biology, and the relatively new area of glial neurobiology. In addition, the
project continues the PI's excellent record of training graduate students and
community outreach.&lt;br/&gt;
