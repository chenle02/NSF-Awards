To increase device performance, most materials are often subjected to uniaxial
and biaxial states of stress. The material under these types of loadings must be
well controlled to achieve the desired gain. Currently, uniaxial compression is
considered the easiest method for achieving strain in electronic materials, and
widely used in manufacturing advanced semiconductor chips. However, uniaxial
strain is limited in its effectiveness in tailoring material properties compared
to biaxial strain, hence, its future prospects are restricted. Biaxial stress-
strain tests are generally difficult to perform. Some of the challenges include:
small sample sizes; grip integrity to the substrate; and deformation homogeneity
within the substrate. This effort aims to develop a prototype compressive
biaxial strain chamber which can cater to customers who need a reliable biaxial
strain measurement system without the limitations of the aforementioned issues
that exist in current systems in the market. The proposed project is aimed at
advancing the performance of electronic materials used in the semiconductor
industry. In particular, those who are seeking to increase device performance,
and are looking beyond post-uniaxial solutions for increased efficiency.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three phases that materials can be categorized
into are metals, semiconductors, and insulators. Although, it is expected that
these materials would maintain their electrical properties, when compressive
strain is applied, the material's conductive properties can be tuned. This
modulation of the electronic material properties with strain is known as strain
engineering. This I-Corps team proposes that using the biaxial strain system,
one can increase device performance not only for silicon based electronics, but
also for next-generation nanoscale electronics based on graphene and other two-
dimensional materials. In this project, the team will use the biaxial testing
setup to measure the strain and pressure-dependent electronic, vibrational,
optical and structural properties of multilayered molybdenum disulphide and
other 2D materials up to high strain rates (&gt;10%).
