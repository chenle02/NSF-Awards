9522171 Gulliver The objective of this project is to conduct experimental
investigation of the dissolution and droplet formation processes in riverine
environments as a step toward formulation of better mathematical models than are
currently available for use in prediction of the transport and fate of slightly
water-soluble pollutants of surface waters. The experiments will be performed in
a moving-bed flume that was specifically designed for conduct of interfacial
transfer experiments. The flume simulates conditions in flowing streams that
affect dissolution, rate of droplet formation and the equilibrium concentration
of the target pollutant in the polluted water. Spills of slightly soluble
liquids on surface waters result in the formation of surface slicks that move in
the direction the water is flowing while dissolving, evaporating and forming
droplets in the flowing water. Environmental issues associated with spills of
these liquids relate to the transport properties of the spilled liquid and the
characteristics of the bed over which the liquid flows. Results of this research
are expected to improve the engineering design of mitigation measures that can
be applied to reduce the pollutional impact of these pollutants on the quality
of surface water supplies in preparation for their intended use.
