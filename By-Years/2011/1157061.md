This project renews a highly successful and long running REU site in the
Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Texas at
Arlington with a research focus on national priorities in healthy living, care
technologies, and aging in place. As the population ages and chronic health
conditions become of increasing importance in health care, the use of
intelligent environment technologies to improve health, reduce the need for
institutionalization, and improve quality of life is becoming increasingly
important as a health facilitator and a tool to help address spiraling care
costs. The goal of this site is to offer unique training opportunities to eight
undergraduate students per year to become involved in on-going,
multidisciplinary research in these areas and to prepare them for successful
graduate careers in this field. As part of the program, REU participants will be
trained in the underlying areas by a group of faculty mentors from Computer
Science and Nursing and will conduct independent research projects under the
greater envelope of the interdisciplinary SmartCare research effort at the
University of Texas at Arlington. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program will
provide new opportunities for highly talented and qualified upper division
undergraduates, with a particular emphasis on women, minority, and disabled
students. The goal is to augment the students? educational experience and to
attract qualified undergraduates to graduate studies and careers in health
technologies. The student participants will be recruited nationally, but with an
emphasis on women and minority institutions as well as non-research institutions
in the southwest region.
