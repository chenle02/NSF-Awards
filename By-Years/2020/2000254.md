Laws of nature, in particularly those of physics, satisfy basic symmetries. In
mathematical language, these symmetries are most often expressed in terms of Lie
groups and their representations (named after Sophus Lie, a 19th century
mathematician who pioneered these concepts in his study of solutions of
differential equations). This project is concerned with properties of unitary
representations. The modern study of unitary representations stems from quantum
physics. In addition, they play a crucial role in many other applications such
as tomography, crystallography, and signal processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In
more technical terms, this project is focused on properties of unipotent
representations, which are the building blocks of the unitary duals of real and
p-adic reductive groups. The determination of the unitary dual is a major
problem in the representation theory of such groups. The PI will formulate and
sharpen conjectures on the signatures of hermitian forms for modules of the
affine Hecke algebra. These are essential for the determination of the unitary
duals of p-adic groups. Another focus of this project is to make explicit the
role of unipotent representations in the description of the unitary dual. In
addition to linear groups, the PI will study these notions for nonlinear and
disconnected groups that arise in mathematical physics and in the study of
automorphic forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
