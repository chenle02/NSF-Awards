Committed to ensuring the provision of high quality mathematics and science
education to all students in this majority-Hispanic community, the El Paso
Partnership for Excellence in Teacher Preparation represents a major deviation
from the historic paradigm of teacher education. The Partnership is an integral
part of the El Paso Collaborative for Academic Excellence and the El Paso Urban
Systemic Initiative and joins the Colleges of Science and Education at the
University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), the El Paso Community College, and three
major public school districts in El Paso County in a fundamental transformation
of teacher preparation that is grounded in and contributes to systemic reform in
K-12 education. The Partnership, which will be led by Arturo Pacheco, Dean of
UTEP's College of Education, and John R. Bristol, Interim Dean of the College of
Science, will sponsor activities contributing to four major goals: (1) to
recruit more students into mathematics and science teacher preparation,
particularly more minority students, and provide support and financial
incentives for those planning to become teachers; (2) revise and enhance
curriculum at both the lower- and upper-division levels so that prospective
teacher achieve high levels of both content knowledge and pedagogical skills;
(3) to enhance the teaching skills of mathematics, science, and teacher
education faculty so that they can both better impart content knowledge and
model exemplary pedagogical behaviors; and (4) to provide support for new
mathematics and science teachers as they enter their profession.
