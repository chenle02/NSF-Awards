This REU is an eight-week summer research experience in mathematics to be held
at SUNY Potsdam for nine undergraduates mathematics students during summers. The
areas of the research are Group Theory, Algebra, Quantum Walks on the Graphs,
and Graphs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SUNY Potsdam is widely known for its
undergraduate mathematics program founded by Clarence Stephens, and Clarkson
University has an international reputation in scientific research. Each
institution has its own special attraction, and together they create for
students a unique atmosphere of learning and research. In addition to providing
a superb intellectual atmosphere, Potsdam is a quiet and peaceful village,
located within two hours of Lake Placid, Thousand Islands, Ottawa and Montreal.
Summer weather is generally cool and comfortable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed summer program is built on the policy that the students will be
colleagues with the faculty advisors and will be treated as such as they jointly
pursue unanswered mathematical questions. The approach will be one of
collaboration and, therefore, will not carry the negative overtone inherent in
grading/evaluation approaches. Faculty advisors and student leaders provide
guidance, structure and leadership.&lt;br/&gt;
