AST-9615610 F. Peter Schloerb The primary goal of this project is to observe the
evolution of gases produced by volatile ices in the nucleus of Comet Hale- Bopp.
A series of regular observations of the submillimeter lines of a number of
cometary volatiles is underway at the James Clerk Maxwell telescope on Mauna
Kea, Hawaii. This work will continue through perihelion of the comet in 1997
until the comet receeds past 6 astronomical units in order to study the nature
of the gases produced at different heliocentric distances. This award is
supported jointly by the Division of Astronomical Sciences and the Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical
Sciences at NSF. =================================
