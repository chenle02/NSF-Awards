A typical starting point for a financial model takes an asset price as given and
manipulates it to determine results. A less studied path asks what makes an
asset pricing model good, and where do such good models come from? Equilibrium
theory studies the formation of asset pricing models at a fundamental level
where an economy's total supply meets its total demand. This award will study
two overarching equilibrium projects set in incomplete settings, where not all
risk can be captured by trading. The projects use mathematical tools that are
now within reach to describe equilibrium-based "good" models involving (i) the
formation of interest rates, and (ii) the formation of stock prices in the
presence of proportional transaction costs. Both interest rates and transaction
costs are highly relevant to financial markets but currently poorly understood
in incomplete equilibrium settings. The award will involve collaborations and
the involvement and training of graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award will study two related problems involving equilibrium of stochastic
systems in mathematical finance. The first goal is to prove the existence of a
finite-agent Radner equilibrium in incomplete market models with stochastic
interest rates and proportional transaction costs. After obtaining existence,
the investigator will analyze the effects of incompleteness on the endogenously
determined asset prices. Mathematically, the analysis draws from systems of
fully coupled quadratic backward stochastic differential equations (BSDE), which
are doubly reflective in the case of transaction costs. Existence results for
such BSDE systems are nonconstructive, which complicates the analysis of
incompleteness effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
