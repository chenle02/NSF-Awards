This Biological Facilities Center proposal requests funds for the purchase of
ancillary protein sequencing equipment, peptide synthesis and purification
equipment, and equipment for x-ray structure determination of native and
engineered proteins. The equipment will be shared by the staff of the Institute
of Molecular Biology, one of the leading centers for the study of macromolecular
structure and function, and its subsidiary program in Cell Biology. The
equipment will be used to identify and/or study proteins involved in the
mechanism and control of DNA replication and transcription, the effect of
changes in primary structure on stability and tertiary protein structure, the
interaction of subunits within protein complexes and between membrane proteins
and lipids, the export of proteins by eukaryotic cells, and the mechanism of
signal transduction in bacterial chemotaxis. This instrumentation will
facilitate the collaborative research that has resulted in important scientific
contributions in areas such as the stability of proteins, protein-DNA
interactions, DNA replication and DNA transcription.
