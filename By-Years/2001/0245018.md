The Stony Brook Superconducting Linear Accelerator provides heavy ion
beams&lt;br/&gt;for basic research in nuclear and atomic physics, and an
infrastructure for&lt;br/&gt;the recruitment, development and training of
students in the areas of&lt;br/&gt;radiation detection, hardware development and
experimental analysis. The&lt;br/&gt;planned research with the accelerator and
at other facilities will build&lt;br/&gt;upon the activities currently in
progress, and will continue the educational&lt;br/&gt;program of current and new
PhD and other students. The research program in&lt;br/&gt;gamma ray spectroscopy
will investigate several areas of nuclear structure&lt;br/&gt;including two
projects that were started at Stony Brook and are now very&lt;br/&gt;active
areas of research. The first studies the fingerprints of
chirality,&lt;br/&gt;which involves the existence of right-handed and left-
handed geometries in&lt;br/&gt;certain special nuclei, and the second project
studies the limit of how much&lt;br/&gt;angular momentum a nucleus can carry.
Another research project uses the&lt;br/&gt;unique capability of our LINAC to
provide intense Fr beams of 107&lt;br/&gt;particles/sec. The effort will focus
on polarizing, cooling and trapping of&lt;br/&gt;Fr for precision measurements
of the nuclear magnetic moments that are&lt;br/&gt;needed to test the atomic
calculations of the Fr atom. The Fr beams will&lt;br/&gt;also be used to
continue the development of weak interaction measurements in&lt;br/&gt;atoms.
The Stony Brook Nuclear Structure Laboratory also serves as a focus&lt;br/&gt;of
many educational activities. Students at the high school,
undergraduate,&lt;br/&gt;graduate, and postdoctoral levels participate in the
research program with&lt;br/&gt;various intensities, from beam line construction
to running actual&lt;br/&gt;experiments. In addition to these students, high
school students, incoming&lt;br/&gt;students, and various classes tour the
laboratory as an example of an&lt;br/&gt;accelerator research
facility.&lt;br/&gt;
