The Computing Community Consortium (CCC) is a catalyst and enabler for the
computing research community. Its various activities strive to unite the
community to contribute to shaping the future of the field; provide leadership
for the community, facilitating revolutionary, high-impact research; encourage
the alignment of computing research with pressing national priorities and
national challenges (many of which cross disciplines); give voice to the
community, communicating to a broad audience the myriad ways in which advances
in computing will create a brighter future; and grow new leaders for the field
as a whole. The CCC operates under a Cooperative Agreement between the National
Science Foundation and the Computing Research Association (CRA), a membership
organization of over 200 computing research entities in academia, industry, and
government.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the founding years of its existence, the
activities of the CCC had a significant impact on the status, direction, and
prospects of the computing research community, catalyzing new Federal
initiatives in robotics and big data to name a few. Opportunities during this
second phase of the CCC are every bit as great. The CCC is an investment that
promises to pay off in important ways for the field and for the nation.
