9631670 Wu This project should lead to a fundamental understanding of the marrow
microenvironment, the role of neurotransmitters, and the genes and molecules
regulating hemopoiesis and lymphopoiesis. The information obtained will be used
to formulate strategies for engineering ex vivo bone marrow mimicry. It will
ultimately lead to a novel bone marrow technology for clinical applications in
treating hematological disorders. Moreover, design of a bone marrow bioreactor
based on this information should be an extremely valuable tool for further
delineating the hemopoietic microenvironment, and for examining drug efficacy,
toxicity, and pathogenicity. ***
