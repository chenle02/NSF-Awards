This project aims: 1) to determine the sequence signals requiredfor accurate
processing of E. coli ribosomal RNA; 2) to purify the enzymes and factors
required for the maturation of the 5' and3' termini of 16S rRNA; and 3) to
assess the nature of the real substrate for maturation (and help analyze the
relation of protein synthesis and maturation). The work will be based on
previous studies which have analyzed the pathways of 16S and 23SrRNA formation;
have provided good assays for maturation; and have started to determine some of
the sequence requirements for maturation by studying the extent of processing in
constructs lacking particular spacer sequences.
