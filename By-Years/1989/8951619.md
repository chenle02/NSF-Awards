The Biology, Chemistry and Mechanical Engineering departments are incorporating
the use of electron microscopes into their curricula. Both a scanning and a
transmission electron microscope have been received as donations. This project
provides the equipment needed for sample preparation. In addition to courses
offered by each of the departments, a multidisciplinary course devoted to
techniques of sample preparation and operation of the instruments is offered.
The grantee provides funds for this project that are an equal match for the NSF
award.
