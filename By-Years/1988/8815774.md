This award is to explore the feasibility, areas of application, and strategies
for implementing rapid prototyping facilities in U.S. manufacturing research
communities. The work will be guided by a committee selected by the
Manufacturing Studies Board, and will be comprised of experts in machined parts
fabrication, advanced materials development and application, computer-integrated
design and manufacturing, and small machine shop operations. Co-supporters of
this effort are Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the
National Bureau of Standards. The anticipated result of this work is a report
describing possible strategies to implement the rapid prototyping facilities
concept.
