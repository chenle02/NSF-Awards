The tubular pinch phenomenon will be investigated for potential application to
harvesting of bioparticles. A separation from a dilute suspension will be
attempted using a branched flow path. Variables such as branch length diameter,
angle and number will by systematically investigated. Systems where the
bioparticle concentration exceeds 1% on a dry basis will also be examined.
Though the Segre-Silberberg tubular pinch effect has been known for 40 years it
has yet to see significant industrial application, though it has seen some
successful application in concentrating red blood cells. Though successful
application of the effect in biotechnology applications is uncertain, the
potential for an alternative complement to membranes is well worth pursuing.
