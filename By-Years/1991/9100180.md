This project continues and expands the very successful REU site program at the
San Diego Supercomputer Center to a Southern California regional REU site.
Twenty students will be brought to SDSC for 10 weeks during the summer of 1991
to work on research projects in a variety of areas of computational science.
Students are teamed with faculty advisors form their home institutions as well
as SDSC researchers. This program interfaces with other summer programs on the
UCSD campus. Research project areas include modelling human locomotion, electron
transfer interactions,, fluid dynamics, visualization of earthquake dynamics,
and neural networks.
