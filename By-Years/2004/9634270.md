9634270 Past efforts to apply TQM techniques to construction engineering and
management have not been successful due to the dissimilarity between the areas
of manufacturing and industrial engineering to construction engineering and
management. This proposal suggests that the area of construction engineering and
management needs immediate information feedback techniques such as those
developed for manufacturing and process engineering. The competitive environment
of the construction industry urges the necessity to know current status of
budgets, quantities, materials, procurement, and crew locations. As technology
has increased, the ability to track money, time, and materials has also
increased through the use of scheduling, estimating, and database software.
There remains the problem of a significant time delay between events and knowing
the status of those events. This research will adapt TQM techniques to the
construction industry to achieve immediate information feedback and event
status. It will identify events in the construction industry in which immediate
information is highly desirable, as well as methods to achieve immediate
feedback. finally, this research will develop a plan by which to realize actual
immediate feedback techniques in the construction industry.
