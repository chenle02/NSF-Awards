Dr. Bauer, a highly regarded laboratory chemist at Cornell University, will
directly measure rate constants for association and evaporation reactions for
selected metal oxides, nitrides, and silicides. These data are needed to
correctly model the condensation sequences proposed for the formation of proto-
planetary grains and particles in planetary atmospheres. Extraterrestrial dust
with which the Earth is constantly bombarded is one of several primary sources
of knowledge of our Universe. Its origin, its distribution in space, the
morphology, and the chemical composition of the solid particles designated as
cosmic dust are topics of great interest. One important means of learning the
nature of cosmic dust is to study the properties of possible constituents in
laboratories on Earth.
