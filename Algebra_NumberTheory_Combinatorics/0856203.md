The principal investigator is interested in the study of the geometry of moduli
spaces, especially those that are birational to modular varieties of orthogonal
or unitary type (examples include the moduli space of K3 surfaces or low genus
curves). Laza's work exploits the existence of multiple birational models for a
moduli space (e.g. obtained by using different compactification methods, such as
Geometric Invariant Theory (GIT) or Hodge theory) to extract useful geometric
information about a given moduli space. The principal investigator plans to
apply this type of ideas to various projects involving moduli spaces. A first
question that the PI proposes to investigate is the problem of finding a
geometric compactification for the moduli of polarized K3 surfaces. The methods
of the variation of GIT quotients and ideas coming from the minimal model
program offer a promising approach to the low degree cases. A second project
addresses various questions about the moduli of compact hyperkaehler manifolds,
higher dimensional analogues of the K3 surfaces. In particular, the PI plans to
investigate from an arithmetic and geometric point of view the case of moduli
space of double EPW sextics (introduced by O'Grady). A third project is
concerned with some concrete questions about the birational geometry of moduli
spaces of genus 4 curves and cubic threefolds.

The general area of the proposal is algebraic geometry, the branch of
mathematics that is concerned with the geometric properties of algebraic
varieties (geometric objects defined by polynomial equations). A simple example
of algebraic variety is the complex torus, that has the shape of a doughnut.
While in other branches of mathematics (such as topology) all doughnuts have the
same shape, in algebraic geometry the precise shape (in this case the ratio
between the diameter and width) is very important. In fact, the precise
quantification of the shape of the geometric objects within a given topological
class is the subject of the moduli theory. Moduli theory is a central field of
study in algebraic geometry and has numerous applications in mathematics and
modern physics.
