A conference on ?Groups and Computation? will be held on March 17?21, 2008, at
The Ohio State University. The conference will focus on recent progress in
computational group theory and its applications, including new algorithms and
data structures for permutation groups and matrix groups, Lie-type groups, and
p-groups. Connections with computer science, probability theory, and symbolic
algebra will also be explored. A panel discussion on future directions of
research and on the coordination of software development will shape activities
in the topic in the coming years. The conference will explore applications in
these disciplines and will contribute to the development of a computing
enviroment widely avalaible for applications and educational purposes. The
emphasis on participation of students and recent PhD receipients contributes to
the development of the nation?s science personnel base.
