In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in phylogenetic
reconstruction. Molecular techniques have provided a wealth of new and promising
approaches for understanding phylogenies, and the application of phylogenies,
and the application of phylogenetic analysis to a diversity of interesting
biological questions is becoming common. The purpose of this symposium is to
assess the utility of phylogentic analysis for studies of the natural history of
plant breeding systems. Topics included in the symposium include the radiation
of pollination systems, mechanisms in conifers that compensate for strong
inbreeding depression, the origin of self- incompatibility and floral
trimorphism in a tristylous family, the origin of outcrossing from selfing in a
hermaphroditic, self- compatible species, the origin of androdioecy from dioecy,
and the origin of dioecy from hermaphroditism.
