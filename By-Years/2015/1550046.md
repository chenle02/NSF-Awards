This workshop proposal focuses on helping faculty, instructors, advising and
student affairs staff, and other higher education administrators from 2-year and
4-year Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) to gain greater understanding of the
factors that most often contribute to Hispanic students' academic success and
retention at these institutional types. Efforts to improve engineering
educational outcomes among Hispanic students, especially at 2-year and 4-year
HSIs, are a national priority. There is a tremendous need for the STEM
workforce, especially in engineering, to be reflected of the nation's
population. Current data suggest that progress is slow. The proposed workshop
offers important research-based information that aims to improve college
outcomes for Hispanic students by increasing higher education professionals'
awareness, knowledge, and skill level with working with this student group.
Targeting faculty, instructors, advising and student affairs staff, and other
higher education administrators from 2-year and 4-year HSIs, it offers great
potential to yield important diversity and broaden participation outcomes in
engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project proposes to recruit engineering
faculty, instructors, advising and student affairs staff, and other higher
education administrators from 2-year and 4-year HSIs to attend the workshop.
This project will support their attendance to a preconference of Mid Years
Engineering Experience. A variety of formats is proposed to deliver the
professional development content (e.g., workshop style with questions and
answers, panel discussions, and networking activities). A website will be used
to broadly disseminate the content from the workshop.
