This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
evaluate hollow CaP microspheres for the delivery of antibiotics in orthopedic
and dental infections. The key objectives of the Phase I project include : (1)
Development of optimal microsphere properties for the delivery of antibiotics to
site-specific infections, (2) Evaluation of alternative methods for antibiotic
loading within the CaP hollow microspheres, (3) Determination of antibiotic
elution profiles, and (4) Development of cost models for producing these
microcarriers.

The commercial applications of this project will be in the orthopedic, dental,
and allied soft tissue markets.
