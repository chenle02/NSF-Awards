Objective: The objective of this program is to develop nanostructured coatings,
nanoparticles, and plasmonic architectures that will lead to the development of
fluorescence-based biosensor platforms for point-of-care diagnostics. Through
the use of engineered plasmonic structures and nanostructured high surface area
coatings, optimal field coupling to sensing elements will be achieved.
Thermodynamic interaction occurring within nanoparticle?polymer composite films
and the substrate interface will be investigated to achieve a high degree of
control over the evolved nanostructures. These structures will be integrated
with various plasmonic architectures, and the long range and short range surface
plasmon polaritons will be studied. These unique sensor architectures will be
validated via the detection of Botulinum and
thrombin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit is
that a scientific study on integrative nanostructured sensing architectures will
advance research in the area of point-of-care sensing technologies. The ability
to control the entropic-enthalpic interplay between nanoparticles and polymer
systems will enable ?bottom-up? fabrication of complex nanostructures. Such
custom engineered thin films will serve as unique substrates for biological
assays as well as novel optical coatings for plasmonic nanostructures enabling
the detection of extremely low level fluorescence
signals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The broader impacts are the
development of health-related diagnostic tools, in which the technology can be
translated into diagnostics for national security, environment, energy, food
safety, and manufacturing. The program includes an educational component
involving recruitment of underrepresented students and hands-on learning
opportunities in the field of plasmonics, nanostructure studies, and biosensing
for secondary, undergraduates, and graduate students.
