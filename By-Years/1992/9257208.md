The proposed research is in the area of exploring and analyzing new
computational algorithms for the dynamic security assessment of large power
systems. To be investigated are the interactions between stressed highly
nonlinear, discrete/continuous systems (modelled by mixed differential/algebraic
equations) and the numerical methods used to analyze system behavior. The
inclusion of discrete controls and limiters are known to cause numerical
instabilities. The study of numerical robustness and error detection of
computational algorithms of ill-conditioned systems is increasingly important as
system descriptions become more realistic and complex. The interaction of system
structure, numerical robustness and problem conditioning, must be better
understood for these more complex models.
