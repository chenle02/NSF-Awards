CBET - 0842682&lt;br/&gt;W. Krajewski&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A June
2008 flood affected the lives of thousands in Eastern Iowa. Particularly
affected were the communities of Cedar Rapids and Iowa City, the home of the
University of Iowa. The losses at Cedar Rapids are estimated to exceed $1B; the
University suffered losses of nearly $250M. This SGER award is for urgent
research in the aftermath of this devastating flood by investigating hydrologic
characteristics of the flood in order to improve the existing flood
forecasting/warning system. A better flood warning system would give residents
of endangered communities more time to prepare. The urgency of this proposed
work lies in the need to quickly gain knowledge and better understanding of the
principles of watershed hydrology and open channel hydraulics that should guide
design of a local flood warning system. The proposed research - in the areas of
the rainfall-runoff models, channel routing, and rainfall monitoring and
estimation - will be conducted at the University of Iowa research institute
IIHR-Hydroscience &amp; Engineering. The ideas that the PIs will explore in this
project are not ad-hoc, they are a result of their continued work on the
geophysical theory of floods.
