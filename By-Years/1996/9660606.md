This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a new
approach to detection and classification of damage to a structural composite
part, thus providing a means for sensing structural degradation such as
delaminations, fatigue and other damage. Piezoelectric transducer technology
provides a means for sensing various structural properties such as stress,
strain, and elasticity when these sensors are mounted on, or embedded within, a
material structure. Structures may degrade due to improper manufacture, duty
cycle wear, impacts, and material corrosion. Embedded sensors may be used to
signal changes, likely to be damage, to a structural composite part and permit
off-line diagnosis independent of the long-range geometry of the part, so that
the diagnostic instrument need not have records for individual parts. This
project uses high-frequency acoustic signals to diagnose damage, calibrating for
local properties (density, thickness, stiffness). Standard acoustic test pulses
from the piezoelectric devices can be used to probe for damage located between
pulse generators and sensors. By using only the leading portion of the received
signal it is possible to avoid the effects of geometry-dependent reverberation.
This greatly simplifies the interpretation of changes in the response as clues
to structural degradation. The advanced structural monitoring concepts being
sought have potential of commercial use in the civil transportation industry for
aircraft, automobiles, trucks and boats, and in the commercial space industry
for boosters and satellites. Other application areas include the use of
structural composites in load-bearing bridges, composite railroad cars, and
numerous other areas where light-weight high-strength structural composites are
replacing heavy metallic structures.
