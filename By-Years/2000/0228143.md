0228143 Wei The proposed work will fabricate robust, antibody-conjugated gold
nanoparticle films as substrates for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), a
sensitive spectroscopic method with unmet potential for label-free chemical
sensing. The SERS activities of the nanoparticle-based substrates will be
optimized as a function of interparticle spacing and periodic order. Initial
tests will be performed to recognize 2,4-dinitropohenol (DNP) in gas and aqueous
environments and in the presence of several other aromatic compounds as a
control for selectivity. The demonstration of substrates for selective chemical
detection of DNP can be immediately parlayed into the development of Raman-based
sensors of chemical warfare agents, including explosives, nerve gases, and
mustard gases and vesicants.

The structure-activity relationships are based on theoretical considerations
alone and have no experimental precedence. However, the proposed research is
hypothesis-driven and addresses both short-term objectives for chemical sensor
development and fundamental issues on the plasmonic properties of nanostructured
metal films, with subsequent potential for applications beyond chemical and
biological sensing.
