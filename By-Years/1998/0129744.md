This project uses functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging to investigate
biologically plausible brain mechanisms that produce economic behavior.
Traditionally experiments in economics have taken place either in the field,
where individual behavior can be observed before and after a treatment variable
has been manipulated, or in behavioral laboratories where, in addition, there is
greater control over incentives, information, and the rules of the game. The
purpose of such experimentation is to better understand both the behavioral
mechanisms that produce particular types of behavior, such as investor
overconfidence in 'bull' markets, and the resulting behavior of markets, such as
price bubbles. While a great deal of progress has been made in understanding
market behavior very little progress has been made in understanding individual
behavior. Recent advances in functional brain imaging now makes it possible for
economists and neuroscientists to collaborate to study how brain activity is
linked to economic decision making. This project studies how the human brain is
genetically designed, and environmentally influenced, to solve the problem of
mutually advantageous cooperation. This research is likely to have a significant
impact on economic thought, and institutional design, by linking observed
economic behavior to the biological mechanisms that produce this behavior.
