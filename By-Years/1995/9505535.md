9505535 Kambysellis Dr. Kambyselis requests funds for a small Grant for
Exploratory Research (SGER). The project aims to develop an experimental
methodology whereby specific genes can be transferred from the genome of one
Drosophila species into another, without the use of genetic markers in the
recipient species as traditionally required for such genetic manipulations.
Whereas there is a vast array of genetic mutants available for the species
Drosophila melanogaster, most other Drosophila species of interest to
evolutionary and developmental biologist lack available mutants, limiting their
genetic analysis. To rectify this situation and facilitate analysis of gene
expression and the evolution of gene regulation in the endemic Hawaiian
Drosophila and other groups, novel vectors using as markers neomycin resistance
or the green fluorescent protein will be developed to establish a transformation
system applicable to any Drosophila species. The successful development of this
methodology will have broad application, facilitating genetic analyses of basic
phenomena such as behavior, evolution, and the role of pattern formation is
development, as examples. Even wider application may ensure if the general
approach of transgenic insect formation can subsequently be extended to insects
of economic importance, enabling novel approaches to agricultural problems.
