The University of Northern Iowa will use a computerized telescope controller
with an existing 0.4 meter telescope to enhance the utility and ease of use of
the telescope. With the controller, students can spend less time with the
mechanics of operation and more on methods of astronomy and gathering of
astronomical data. The improved accessibility of the telescope will foster
greater interest in astronomy among existing students, attract students who may
have been intimidated by or hindered from using the telescope, and enhance both
the depth and educational quality of the courses. The university will match the
award with an equal amount of funds.
