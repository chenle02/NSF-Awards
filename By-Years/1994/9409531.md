Many decision problems are faced not once but repeatedly. For instance, the
choice of a residential location, the selection of a travel mode for a trip to
work, or the purchase of consumer brands within a product-class are recurrent
choice situations. It is therefore not surprising that much of the work on
understanding choice behavior changed its emphasis from the analysis of single
to the investigation of intertemporal choices. However, despite the importance
and promise of this research and the availability of numerous data sets in
microeconomics, sociology, geography, and epidemiology, many issues encountered
in the analysis of choice data over time await satisfactory solutions. The major
focus of the proposed research is to extend the applicability of latent
structure choice models to the analysis of different types of longitudinal
choice data. These extensions address taste changes over time, dependencies
between choices, non-stationarities in the decision-environment (including
changing choice sets), and interactions among these factors. The availability of
flexible, easy to interpret and parsimonious longitudinal choice models will
lead to important insights about decision-making over time, and they will be
instrumental for the development and testing of economic, psychological, and
sociological theories about the dynamics of choice behavior.
