Raad 9632798 The development of the commercial microwave technology depends on
the design of reliable devices, which requires a thermal analysis technique
technology that is capable of resolving at the device level both the spatial and
temporal scales of submicron Integrated Circuits (ICs). Current capabilities ate
inadequate in addressing these issues. The proposed GOALI research project will
develop a numerical simulation method to investigate transient heat transfer in
submicron features as well as an experimental capability both to measure their
thermal properties and to provide temperature data to validate the simulation.
The GOALI research project is in collaboration with Texas Instruments and
Hewlett-Packard. The outcome of the study has potential to advance the process
understanding of low cost design for electronics manufacturing.
