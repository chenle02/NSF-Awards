Their program will consist of four topics. (1) Direct electromagnetic generation
of ultrasound in alkali metals. This includes looking for lattice instabilities,
charge-density wave (CDW) structure, and measurements in high magnetic fields.
(2) Single crystal growth and neutron diffraction studies in alkali metals, in
collaboration with people at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, University of
Missouri, and National Institute of Standards and Technology. They will look at
sodium, lithium, and lithium magnesium alloys. (3) Ultrasonic attenuation and
velocity in high temperature superconductors using primarily their own samples.
They will look at a variety of samples and include pressure effects. (4)
Ultrasonic studies near the melting point in alkali metals (sodium, potassium,
cesium). They hope to reach within 0.1 mK of melting point.
