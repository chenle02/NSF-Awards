This project would use mathematical modeling and computer simulations to help
evaluate the potential capabilities of a commercial scale implementation of
microbial fuel cells. The mathematical modeling we will employ is a continuum
model using a combination of the level set method with the extended finite
element method for solving a coupled system of reaction diffusion equations that
incorporates the diffusion of various elements such as oxygen, substrates, and
byproducts, as well as the growth of biomass consisting of multiple bacterial
species attached to a fixed surface, or substratum. We have successfully applied
this strategy to other biofilm systems such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a common
bacterium often associated with mortality in people with cystic fibrosis, and
heterotroph/autotroph symbiotic systems present in activated sludge water
treatment processes. In this project, we will develop the necessary reactions
and growth processes to simulate the microbial fuel cell system and use it to
study various control strategies for optimizing energy production.

Microbial fuel cells are an attractive potential alternative energy source that
are currently only at an experimental stage. These systems take waste water
streams, e.g. pig manure, and convert them directly into electricity without the
use of combustion. At the same time, the water is being cleaned of harmful
elements such as ammonium, that is one stage of a comprehensive water treatment
process currently in use. It is estimated that microbial fuel cells have the
potential to generate as much as 25% of the current worldwide power demand, all
while using a negative cost energy source in waste water. Experimental systems
are currently limited to bench scale reactors in closed systems that have a
limited lifespan. To take these systems to the commercial scale, these systems
need to be better understood for potential power per cost to demonstrate that
they are feasible on that scale.
