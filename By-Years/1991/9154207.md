A one week workshop on computer-aided spectroscopy involving Fourier transform
infrared and Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies. The
workshop consists of both lecture and laboratory sessions with extensive hands-
on experience with the instruments. A handbook containing the materials,
experiments and data files used in conjunction with the workshop will be
available for use at the participants' home institutions.The week long workshop
is followed by a three-day seminar on the initiation and funding of
undergraduate research programs. The emphasis will be on attracting financial
support, motivating students, and developing curricula to support undergraduate
research programs.
