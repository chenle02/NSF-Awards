The Morehouse School of Medicine proposes to develop a unique framework for
stimulating and increasing interest in science, mathematics, engineering and
technology within the predominantly minority K-12 student population of Atlanta.
The program provides a formal structure for coordinated science enrichment
activities concentrated in the summer, and for year-round science outreach and
partnership programs with schools in the Atlanta, Fulton and Dekalb school
districts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project builds on several well established
programs at the medical school such as Elementary&lt;br/&gt;Science Education
Partners (ESEP). Ten Saturday Academy sessions per year providing 22.5 "contact
hours" per student combine with a four-week Summer Science Camp of six hours per
day, five days per week providing an additional130 "contact hours" per student
for 25 elementary and middle school students in grades 6-8. The program expands
to include the high school student population by providing experiences in the
laboratory with medical school faculty and research scientists. The Science
Education Resource Center (SERC) will serve as a conduit for the delivery of
inquiry-based educational experiences and hands-on science materials.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A parental support group is involved via the Ben Carson
Science Academy Parent Association.&lt;br/&gt;
