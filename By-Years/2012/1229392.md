ABSTRACT Sankar 1229392&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is requesting funding for
instrumentation suitable for 'large' animal testing and characterization of bio-
implant materials. They are specifically considering a HR micro-CT with XRF
feature and a multi-photon confocal microscope. These two pieces are used in
tandem to completely image whole bady animal models. The requested capability
will enable Micro-surgery in animals, in vivo real-time 3D monitoring and in
vivo imaging, for evaluating deep tissue. The implants will be designed to
provide optimum therapy when required and to bio-dissolve when no longer needed.
Such innovations would particularly benefit pediatric cleft palate patients,
angular deformities of long bones, limb length discrepancies, or trauma
including fractures that require pins and screws for repair. Other areas of
application include osteoporotic fragility fractures in aging baby boomers
(wrist, hip and spine) and reconstruction of multiple rib fractures (trauma).
