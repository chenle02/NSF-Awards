9602170 Goldman This project will create an archive of U.S. Supreme Court oral
arguments in 500 cases raising constitutional issues. The archived arguments
will be made available on the World Wide Web to researchers, teachers, and
students. Audio files will be digitized at near compact disc quality and will be
stored on a dedicated audio server. Information files about the cases will be
stored on a database server to allow complicated searches. Previously, research
on the Supreme Court was rarely based on direct behavioral evidence. Scholars
who wished to use available audio tapes of oral argument were sharply limited in
their ability to do so because of limitations on availability. The relative ease
with which audio can be deployed on the World Wide Web will enable scholars and
students to reexamine landmark cases and current controversies. %%%%%
