The proposed research deals with topics in Higher dimensional Algebraic
Geometry. It is mainly focused on natural questions in the birational geometry
of projective varieties such as the study of questions related to the minimal
model program. The PI will investigate the existence of minimal models for
varieties not of general type, abundance and the termination of flips, the
existence of flips for 3-folds in positive characteristic, the geometry of Fano
varieties (in particular the boundedness of log-Fanos), the singularities of
normal varieties and multiplier ideal sheaves, the pluricanonical maps of
algebraic varieties and the birational geometry of irregular
varieties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The birational classification of surfaces was
understood by the Italian school at the beginning of the twentieth century. If a
surface is not covered by rational curves then there is a natural choice of a
birational surface (known as the minimal model) which has many useful
properties. The Minimal Model Program aims to generalize these results to higher
dimensions. This program is complete in dimension 3 (by work of Mori, Kawamata,
Kollar, Reid, Shokurov and others) and is known to work for complex projective
varieties of general type (by work of Birkar, Cascini, Hacon, McKernan, Siu and
others). This project hopes to answer some of the remaining questions and
conjectures that naturally arise in this context.
