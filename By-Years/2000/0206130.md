This effort focuses on the underlying physical causes of the Sun's radiative
variability using helioseismic information as input to the equations of stellar
structure. The tasks include, (1) the construction of solar models with
differing magnetic field configurations, (2) the analysis of Global Oscillation
Network Group (GONG) and Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) data to monitor
helioseismic signatures of solar variability, (3) checking whether the models
constructed under the first task satisfy these helioseismic constraints, (4)
determining additional inputs necessary to improve the models which fare poorly
in this comparison, and (5) developing two-dimensional stellar structure models
capable of incorporating magnetic fields in a consistent, and non-perturbative
fashion.
