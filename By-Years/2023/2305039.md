With the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program
in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Teri W. Odom at Northwestern University
will develop approaches to create complex nanostructures whose surface features
resemble that of a corona. These corona features will be prepared by combining
bottom-up chemistry and top-down fabrication methods. Control over both the
geometry and chemical functionality of the coronas is expected to improve the
properties of the designer nanostructures for sensing and quantum technologies.
Students trained on the project will gain skills in synthesis, nanofabrication,
modeling, and spectroscopic tools. Outreach activities will build on the benign
and environmentally friendly synthesis of the patterned nanostructures. This
project aims to design new classes of nanomaterial heterostructures by
controlling the growth of nanoscale surface features (a corona) on nanoparticle
scaffolds. The proposed work is directed at establishing how local surface
chemistry and reactivity of metal nanoparticle scaffolds affect corona formation
and function. The three objectives include (1) the design and in situ
characterization of nanoscale coronas grown on gold nanoparticle arrays with
different crystallinity; (2) the preparation of coronas based on catalytic
materials and 2D electronic materials; and (3) the application of the nanoscale
heterostructures for enhanced sensing, photocatalysis, and optoelectronics.
