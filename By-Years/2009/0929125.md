This award supports travel and attendance by US doctoral students to the
Doctoral Consortium at the 5th International Conference on Open Source Systems
(OSS 2009) to be held June 3, 2009. OSS 2009 brings together a wide range of
researchers from the fields of software engineering, information systems, social
science, and information science. This conference is a critical link between
researchers who study the formal practices of software engineering and those who
study the less formal practices of the Open Source Software movement. The focus
of the OSS 2009 Doctoral Consortium is the intellectual content of the students?
doctoral dissertations. These dissertations represent state-of-the-art research
in the study and development of complex software systems. The Doctoral
Consortium will help initiate an intellectual community in an emergent research
area. Students and faculty are anticipated to be a diverse group on several
dimensions (nationality, scientific discipline, gender, institutional
affiliation, under-represented minority status), therefore participation in the
consortium will broaden the students? intellectual and social perspectives at a
critical stage in their professional development.
