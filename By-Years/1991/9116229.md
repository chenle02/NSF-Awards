A group of four investigators requests funds to purchase a "Sensitive
Manipulation and Recovery Technology" (SMART) System, which is a newly developed
instrument with combined high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and fast
protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) capabilities for microanalysis and
purification of proteins and peptides. Two of the projects involve high
resolution biochemical analysis of bioactive peptides in neuroendocrine tissues.
Dr. Victor May's research program is examining the regulators of neuropeptide Y
biosynthesis, secretion, and mRNA expression using cultured primary superior
cervical ganglion neurons. Drs. Karen Braas and Edith Hendley are examining the
roles of neuroendocrine peptides under different physiological states. Dr.
Judith Van Houten is examining the chemosensory transduction pathway using
Paramecium as a receptor cell. The instrument offers exceptional sensitivity for
the detection of peptides and will allow reduction in the use of experimental
animals and radioactivity and will enhance the speed of data acquisition.
