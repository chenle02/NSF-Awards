The goal of this research is the development, implementation and evaluation of
efficient numerical methods for certain partial differential equations on high
performance parallel architectures. Problems studied will include the time-
dependent Schrodinger equation, the Poisson-Boltzmann equation and a
(simplified) global spectral model from meteorology. The Schrodinger equation
apÄ±ears in various application areas such as computational chemistry, atomic
physics molecular dynamics, and also in certain approaches to modeling acoustic
propagation in the ocean and in optics. The families of numerical methods to be
considered include operator splitting methods (e.g. ADI), multigrid, spectral
methods, cyclic reduction and Pade-based like preconditioned Krylov subspace
methods will be included. In this project, the PI will build upon past
experience with the Intel hypercubes, the Connection Machine, multiprocessor
Crays and the Alliant, to develop and implement parallel methods for the new
generation of parallel supercomputers, such as the CM5 and the Intel Touchstone
machines. This research will shed light on what numerical methods are
appropriate for high performance parallel architectures.
