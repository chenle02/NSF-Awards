Proposal Number: ECS-9529565 Principal Investigator: Noah Hershkowitz/University
of Wisconsin Title: Helicon Wave Studies In this research, a high density
helicon plasma source will be developed. The helicon plasma source is
anticipated as the highest density plasma source for semiconductor plasma
processing applications. In these experiments the high density helicon source
will be generated through use of increased rf-power and multiple antennas to
couple efficiently to all regimes of the helicon dispersion relation: one
antenna for low power operation in the collisionless regime to initiate the
plasma and a second antenna operating at higher power to increase helicon plasma
density in the collisional regime. A short pulse (10 ms) of 50 kW of rf will be
injected via the second antenna into a low power steady state to obtain
densities of > 1014 cm-3. In addition to providing a high density large volume
plasma source, these experiments will test the parameter scalings and physical
models in regimes not fully explored. The non-appearance of the m=-1 mode, an
open fundamental question, will be especially explored using an antenna
configuration designed to force its generation. A very important part of the
proposed research is the development of new diagnostics needed for such high
density plasmas. Diagnostics for these experiments will include a ruby laser
Thompson scattering system for electron temperature measurements, to replace the
Langmuir probes which would not operate under the experimental conditions; and a
microwave interferometry system available from he Phaedrus-B Tandem mirror to
allow measurement of wave dispersion. Segmented endloss detectors, retarding
field energy analyzers, and Pt grid bolometric radiation detectors will provide
data to determine power scaling and power balance of the high density pulsed
plasma.
