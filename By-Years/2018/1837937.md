The proposal seeks funds to partially cover travel expenses of invited speakers
and student participants and organizing expenses related to the workshop
entitled "The Center for Turbulence Research Summer Program," to be held at
Stanford University during June 24-July 20, 2018. This would be the 18th time
that this biennial program is organized by the Center for Turbulence Research
(CTR). A competitive process is used to select the participants, based on the
merits of their research proposals and their research credentials.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CTR summer school program is an immersive, hands-on
meeting that focuses on interrogation of numerical simulation databases for
testing of models and hypotheses proposed by the participants. The meeting
covers many important areas of turbulent flow research, such as instabilities
and transition, large eddy simulation, Reynolds averaged modeling, multiphase
turbulent flows, combustion, and turbulent transport of mass and heat.
Additional calculations to generate new databases are often performed during the
Summer Program. The participants are divided into focus groups based on their
proposed areas of research. The meeting will be attended by both prominent and
young scientists from around the world, who will be discussing future directions
of research and research challenges. The meeting will also foster cross-
fertilization of ideas among researchers and will address modeling challenges
involved in advancing the field for the next two to five
years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
