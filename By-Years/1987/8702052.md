Professor Garland proposes to carry out high-resolution calorimetric
measurements on a variety of polar liquid crystal molecules containing long
aromatic cores and on binary mixtures of such molecules. There are two competing
order parameters in these systems, and in general they exhibit smectic
fluctuations in the nematic phase at two characteristic wavevectors that are
incommensurate. Such frustrated compounds can form a wide variety of ordered
smectic-A and analogous smectic-C phases. Thus there are many interesting
nematic-smecatic transitions and smectic-smectic transitions involving two
different smectic-A phases or a smectic-A and a smectic-C phase. An automated,
computer-controlled ac microcalorimeter will provide high resolution heat
capacity data for second-order phase transitions, special critical and
bicritical points, and even weakly first-order transitions. Analysis of such
data allows one to characaterize the critical energy fluctuations associated
with smectic ordering. The results will test the validity of current theory and
should stimulate new and more realistic theoretical models.
