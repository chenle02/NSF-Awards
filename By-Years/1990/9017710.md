This grant supports the research of a group of scientists at the University of
Texas with the common theme of star formation in molecular clouds. Drs. Frank
Bash, John Davis, Neal Evans, and Daniel Jaffe use a variety of observational
techniques, ranging from optical imaging to radio wavelength aperture synthesis,
but the primary focus is on submillimeter wave observations at the CalTech
Submillimeter Observatory in Hawaii. This group studies star formation in
external galaxies, in giant molecular clouds in our Galaxy, and in nearby
molecular clouds which are forming low mass stars. The observations are used to
answer general questions about the forces which control star formation,
exploring in particular the role of spiral density waves and already formed
stars in stimulating or preventing further star formation. Examination of the
physical conditions in star forming regions in our Galaxy can elucidate those
conditions and processes which favor star formation at a level of detail not
possible when observing other galaxies. Comparison of regions forming stars of
very different masses can lead to a better understanding of what determines the
initial mass function. On the other hand, studies of other galaxies can more
easily assess the role of stimulated star formation, especially in ring galaxies
and in galaxies with strong spiral density waves. The research of Dr. Bash and
his colleagues concerns the overall environment of star forming clouds both in
our Galaxy and in external galaxies.
