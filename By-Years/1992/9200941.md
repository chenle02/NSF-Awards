This grant supports the Quebec-Vermont Number Theory Seminar. The participants
in this seminar come from both research institutions and principally
undergraduate institutions in both the United States and Canada. This grant will
allow the seminar to continue its tradition of inviting outstanding number
theorists to report on the most exciting new results thereby benefiting the
research of the student and faculty participants. Number theory, the study of
the properties of the whole numbers, is the oldest branch of mathematics. In
modern days, problems in number theory have furnished the driving force to
creation of new mathematics in the fields of pure algebra, analysis, and
geometry; some of the most recent and most astonishing applications of number
theory have appeared in theoretical computer science and coding theory.
