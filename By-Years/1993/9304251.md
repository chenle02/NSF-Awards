This renewal award, with participation by the Divisions of Chemistry, Materials
Research, Physics and Biological Instrumentation and Resources made to the MIT
Laser Research Facility will provide core support for thirteen Chemistry and
Physics faculty. A number of new collaborative research projects will be
started. In physical chemistry, these include development of modulated-
spectroscopy techniques, with application to two dimensional optical
spectroscopy and free radical detection; exploration of singlet and triplet
molecular potential surfaces at high levels of excitation; and collision
processes involving vibrationally excited atmospheric species. Fundamental
physics studies will include atom-cavity quantum electrodynamics and
explorations of quantum chaos in Rydberg atoms. In materials science, quantum
crystallites, surface-functionalized quantum particles, and acoustic properties
of polymer films will be investigated. Studies of enzyme model systems,
including methane monooxygenase and ribonucleotide reductase, and the mechanisms
of light transduction in photosynthesis and visual pigments will be the focus of
research in biological and inorganic chemistry. All of these projects require
the high resolution, multiple-laser, and/or ultrafast-pulse equipment provided
by the facility. %%% This facility also provides students with hands-on
experience and training in advanced spectroscopic techniques. The interaction of
the investigators leads to new collaborations and research programs which would
not exist in the absence of the facility
