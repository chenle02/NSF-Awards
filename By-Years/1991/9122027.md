Description: This project supports the travel and living expenses for Dr.
Pervez Hoodbhoy of the Department of Physics, Quaid-I- Azam University (QAU) in
Islamabad, Pakistan, to participate in a research project with Drs. John W.
Negele and Robert L. Jaffe at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Cambridge. The project will be in the area of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the
role of quarks and gluons in determining the structure and properties of hadrons
and nuclei. This area has been subject of research by the theoretical physics
group at MIT for some time. Broad issues of the joint research include:
development of nucleon models incorporating known constraints imposed by QCD;
spin structure of the nucleon; calculation of elastic scattering form factors
for composit systems of quarks and gluons; direct excitation of quark and color
degrees of freedom in various reactions; direct measurements of quark momentum
in very high energy deeply inelastic electron scattering from hadron targets;
and creation of abnormal states of hadron matter and detecting their signatures
in relativistic heavy ion collisions. Scope: This project extends collaboration,
by the Pakistani scientist with the MIT group, that has started in the late
1980's and that has resulted in a number of joint publications. The past
collaboration produced significant results in the field and enhanced the
capability of the QAU group to conduct research and to publish. In addition,
there has been exchange of scientists and garduate students between the two
groups. The project meets the objectives of the Science in Developing Countries
program.
