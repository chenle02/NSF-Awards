The Drexel University Noyce Scholarship Program (DUNS) addresses the increasing
need for high quality teachers in the School District of Philadelphia. The
School District of Philadelphia is partnering with Drexel University to prepare
highly qualified teachers to fill current and expected K-12 needs, especially in
mathematics and the sciences. The Noyce program enables 10 science, technology,
engineering and mathematics (STEM) undergraduates from Drexel and 15 STEM mid-
career professionals from the community to earn the credentials they need to
teach mathematics and science in Philadelphia's high-need schools. These 25
Noyce recipients will be new teachers in addition to the (typically 60) high
school teachers produced annually at Drexel, for a roughly 40% increase in
production of highly qualified high school teachers in science and mathematics.
Because these schools have large low-income student populations and shortages of
highly qualified teachers, the need for high-quality instruction in these
subject areas is critical. The program objectives are to: 1) recruit qualified
STEM students and professionals dedicated to teaching in high need urban
districts; 2) provide strong preparation addressing content knowledge,
pedagogical content knowledge, and technology integration; 3) provide well-
designed mentoring and induction to support and retain these teachers in high
need urban districts; 4) emphasize recruitment of minorities, and persons with
disabilities; 5) instill personal accountability for meeting pedagogy and
content knowledge standards for outstanding performance in the classroom; 6)
increase the number of students from partnering schools and at Drexel who may
see teaching as a viable career choice for mathematics and science majors.
