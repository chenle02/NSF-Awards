This project will increase the quantity and quality of secondary school
teachers, especially minority and women candidates, who aspire to teach in the
urban setting. The project represents a collaborative activity between Queens
College and the New York Hall of Science and will be conducted over a two year
period. The objectives of this program are as follows: 1. increase the pool of
candidates through a program of targeted recruitment; 2. enhance professional
awareness and deepen science content knowledge; 3. and increase educational
perspectives and build peer- support networks. The retention of the participants
in the program will be enhanced and mentor tutoring. Professional awareness and
additional content depth will be enhanced by participant student involvement as
student interns at the New York Hall of Science. The students will be "paid"
explainers at the museum.
