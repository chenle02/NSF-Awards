This archaeological project will investigate two Late Pleistocene/Early Holocene
archaeological sites and carry out surveys on the Kisarilik and Holitna River
drainages in Southwest Alaska. The purpose is to define the artifact, settlement
and land- use relationships of ancient Siberian hunter-gatherer societies which
first settled Alaska. This project addresses the need to define the earliest
origins of Native peoples and cultures in the New World.
