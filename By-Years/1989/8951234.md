This project introduces state-of-the-art computing equipment into the
laboratory work for a digital control and an introductory robotics course. The
plan combines the two laboratories of the courses into a single laboratory,
using existing equipment from both and replacing the obsolete computers with
modern workstations. Each workstation is outfitted with analog-to-digital and
digital-to-analog converters and parallel and serial input-output interfaces.
The laboratory also includes a file server and networking support equipment. The
result is a much more modern environment comparable to that found in industry.
This award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal investigator's
institution.
