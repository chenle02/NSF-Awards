ABSTRACT Because in social life there are ties or linkages between persons,
scores of persons are nonindependent or related. For instance, children in
classrooms are linked together by friendship and spatial proximity. Although
specialized models on nonindependence have been developed (e.g., the Social
Relations Model), a general approach to the estimation and testing for
interdependence has yet to be developed. There is as yet no general approach to
the measurement of the strength of the ties between people. This research
explicates such an approach. A statistical model will be developed, an
interactive computer program will be written, and the software will be evaluated
using previously collected data. This will enable us to estimate the strength of
ties for designs in which we already have methods, for designs we currently know
of but do not yet know how to estimate linkage, as well as for designs that have
yet to be discovered. The work should be useful to many areas in social
psychology: social influence, small group research, intergroup relations,
interpersonal perception, social support, and personal relationships.
