Dr. Richard Steiner and other members of the Chemistry Department at the
University of Utah are being supported to continue a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 1996-98, ten
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in
basic research projects drawn from the traditional areas of chemistry and
biochemistry. Participants are recruited nationwide, with particular emphasis on
students of ability whose `middle tier` academic performance may dispose them to
drift out of chemistry. The structure of the program fosters student-student and
faculty-student interaction.
