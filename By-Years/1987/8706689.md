This project will assess the effects of contract farming on household diets and
child nutrition in the Western Province of Kenya. The diets of families that
engage in contract farming will be compared with those who do not. The project
will help resolve questions concerning the effects of commodity production on
subsistence agriculture and the effectiveness of contract farming in promoting
economic development.
