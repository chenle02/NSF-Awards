This project will permit a productive senior scholar to gain training in GIS, a
computer intensive technique employed to create geographic data bases that can
be spatially manipulated. An important part of the work will be developing ways
in which to link ethnographic data with spatial data in order to deal with the
problem of agricultural intensification in an area of Mexico that is
economically realigning itself as a result of decline in the oil boom of the
1970s. This training will allow the research gain methodological expertise that
will permit the analysis of ethnographic phenomena on a regional basis, a major
improvement over a usual narrow ethnographic perspective. As a result,
ethnographic trends over entire regions will be described in greater detail than
would otherwise be possible and questions about regional trends that could not
otherwise be asked without this new technique will be studied. In addition, the
researcher will be able to train graduate students in this important technique.
