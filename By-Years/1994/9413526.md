9413526 Wenner This is a Career Advancement Award to Dr. Patricia Wenner at
Bucknell University. Dr. Wenner, a member of the Computer Science Department at
Bucknell, will be at the San Diego Supercomputer for a year's sabbatical working
with visualization scientists at the center. Her project centers on developing a
research plan which will explore the feasibility of extending visualization
software with the use of object-oriented methods. Work in visualization systems
will be extensively examined, to more thoroughly understand the approach in the
current commercial and research systems. The applicability of object-oriented
data based management systems will be studied. Her work will also be oriented
toward the massive amounts of data needed to describe the earth's climate.
