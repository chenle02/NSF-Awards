9321212 King Located at the Harvard Government Data Center is an extremely
detailed and extensive set of election data from numerous offices in electoral
precincts in every state and the District of Columbia. This project will make
these data useful for academic purposes; specifically, the data will be cleaned
and documented, supplemented with variables from the U.S. Census (such as race,
income, occupation and education), and then made generally available to the
scholarly community. In addition, these data will be used to help solve an
important problem in generalizing individual-level behavior from aggregate data.
