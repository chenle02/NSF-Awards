This project funds student work stations, a network server, and classroom
equipment to reinforce and expand dramatically the capabilities of the
laboratory portion of an introductory psychology course that serves as the
science distribution requirement for half of the student body. With this
equipment, hypertext is used to integrate the materials from lecture,
laboratory, library, and video resources, making them available both at 15
laboratory work stations and to individual students through the campus network
(dormitories and computer work rooms). This instructional lab network makes it
possible to use new types of pedagogical material: QuickTime video segments,
animated illustrations of dynamic processes, and a readily accessible file of
slides, overheads, and graphics currently scattered among faculty. The intended
effect is fourfold: to give students experience with methodologies that were
previously unavailable at the introductory level; to provide the means to
explore more actively the methologies and often encyclopedic content of
introductory psychology; to teach the use of network-available library
resources; and to exploit the potential of networked stations to collect,
collate, and display data so that students have more time for interpretation and
consideration of possible alternative hypotheses.
