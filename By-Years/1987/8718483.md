This proposal describes experiments that will attempt to elucidate details of
the transport functions (i.e. reabsorption from urine to blood) in the avian
kidney. Such details for this vertebrate group have been lacking until recently.
The bird kidney appears morphologically like a hybrid of kidneys found in
reptiles and in mammals. This makes the bird kidney an interesting model for
study of the adaptative features of the two kidney types. In addition, the avian
kidney appears to possess some transport features that may be unique among
vertebrates, and may therefore provide new insight into cellular diversity of
function. This work will specifically use micropuncture and electrophysiological
techniques to study fluid and electrolyte transport in superficial, "reptilian-
type" nephrons. In addition, hormonal regulation of transport activity will be
studied.
