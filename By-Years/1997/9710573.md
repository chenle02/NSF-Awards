This starter grant award to the University of Minnesota supports the research of
Professor George O'Doherty. The research is directed toward a new phase transfer
and palladium(0) catalyzed method for the introduction of fluorine-18
radioisotopes into biologically important molecules. The reaction of interest is
a palladium(0) catalyzed allylation of fluoride using various allyl carbonates.
This method for introduction of fluorine to organic substrates may replace older
methods that require expensive, toxic, and explosive reagents, resulting in
significant environmental benefits. The research aims at developing a procedure
that is so expedient and clean that it can be used for positron emission
tomography, a technique which enables the investigation of small volumes in
biological systems. The ultimate application would be study of the movements of
molecules through membranes and other intra-cellular events. ¢ ┴?╝,
