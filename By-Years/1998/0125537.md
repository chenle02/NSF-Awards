Hodgins&lt;br/&gt;0125537&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports American
participation in the first Asia-Pacific Advanced Studies Institute. The meeting
will take place in Tokyo from July 20-29, 2001 on the subject of "New Frontiers
in Intelligent Robotics." The general purpose of this meeting, and of those that
hopefully will follow, is to bring young, promising researchers from around the
Pacific together with their senior mentors and colleagues to discuss a leading
area of scientific research. It is hoped that by meeting for an extended period
of time the participants will be able to engage in in-depth discussions and that
they will form lasting professional ties. The objective for the younger American
participants is to provide them with a significant international experience in
their field that will encourage them to think globally about their research
careers.&lt;br/&gt;
