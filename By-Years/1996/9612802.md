In the past 15 years, there have been several major conceptual and practical
advances in coding, modulation, and signal processing for digital data
transmission and storage. These have resulted in the realization of data rates
approaching theoretical limits for voiceband data modems; areal densities
approaching one gigabit per square inch in disk-drives for desk-top computers;
and, most recently, end-to-end data transfer reliability achieved at signal-to-
noise ratios only slightly beyond the Shannon lower bound. These advances
include: the development of trellis-coded modulation for bandwidth-limited
channels; the application of communication theory to digital recording channels
; the emergence of a theory of code design for input-constrained channels; and
the development of iterative, "turbo"- decoding techniques for long "random"
codes. Despite this progress, there remain many fundamental and practical
problems that must be addressed, both to better our understanding of existing
approaches and their applicability, as well as to offer new tools for use in
building future data communications and storage and communication systems. This
project will focus on problems in coding and modulation, particularly for
application to high density digital recording and multi-user wireless
communications. The objective is to develop coded-modulation techniques for
efficient data storage and transmission in the presence of various channel
impairments, including: input constraints, inter-symbol interference (ISI), co-
channel interference (CCI), additive noise, and signal fading. A component of
the research will be the investigation of the complexity of algorithms and
architectures that implement these techniques. Another goal of the project is to
enhance the educational infrastructure by integrating the research results and
relevant background material into existing and new engineering courses at UCSD.
Courses will be developed on the topics of 1) Coded-Modulation for Data
Transmission and Storage, and 2) Symbolic Dynamics and Constrained Coding. --
