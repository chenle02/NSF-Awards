This project represents an integrated effort by researchers working in the
areas of information storage and retrieval, computational linguistics, and
artificial intelligence (E.A. Fox and J.T. Nutter at Virginia Tech, and N.M.
Evans at IIT) to organize lexical knowledge so that more effective interactive
information retrieval will be possible. A large English lexicon (i.e., a
knowledge base integrating various kinds of information about words, their usage
and meaning) will be created, and methods will be developed to use that lexicon
to improve the effectiveness of online information retrieval systems. This
lexicon will be used as an essential part of experimental tests of two knowledge
based information retrieval systems, enabling empirical evaluation of the
effectiveness of various approaches to interactively using an English lexicon to
support information retrieval. The importance of this research is that the
amount of information available today in the form of documents has grown far
beyond the ability of any individual person to manage without computer
assistance. This work, bringing together strategies from artificial
intelligence, natural language processing, and information retrieval, will
result in far more powerful, knowledge-based computer systems able to act as
intelligent "assistants" to help people effectively access the information
available to them in documents.
