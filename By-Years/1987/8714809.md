The principal investigator will develop an automated inspection system that
bridges the gap from computer aided design (CAD) models to machine vision
algorithms. The system will start with a CAD model of a part augmented by
information on the material and texture of the part, constraints on the camera
and lighting configurations, and a set of inspection specifications. It will
produce a vision model and a vision procedure that can be used to automatically
inspect the part. The main thrust of this research will be to develop an off-
line system that can (1) predict features that will appear in images of the part
under various conditions, (2) suggest alternate lighting and sensor arrangements
for certain objects, and (3) automatically generate the vision procedures for
inspecting the part.
