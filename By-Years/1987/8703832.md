The objective of this research is to examine the coherent structures of air
flow in the vicinity of a plant canopy and the role they play in the turbulent
exchange of heat, mass and momentum between the forest and the atmosphere above.
To accomplish this, a field experiment will be conducted at an almond orchard
site concurrently with Project WIND which will be sponsored by the Army and the
USDA Forest Service. Measurements of temperature, humidity and three dimensional
wind components will be made both within and above the orchard. Statistical
techniques such as quadrant and octant analyses will be used to identify the
coherent structures. The results should increase our physical understanding and
modeling ability of the interaction between the forest and the atmosphere.
