9604134 Hildebrand Many insects, including significant agricultural pests, use
their olfactory system to recognize and select plants for egg-laying sites and
food. This multidisciplinary project analyzes the way volatile chemicals emitted
by plants are used by insects to do this. Parallel studies analyze the release
and chemical composition of plant chemicals and investigate the behavior of
insects during odor guided recognition, orientation, and flight towards plants
or their released chemicals. This project is one of the very few to address the
important issue of insect-plant interactions comprehensively with attention
given to the biology of plants, the chemistry of plant compounds, and the
behavior and neurobiology of insects. Findings of this research will benefit
ongoing basic research into plant chemistry and into the way organisms
recognize, analyze, and respond to complex odors. It addition, the project
should yield insights into insect-plant interactions that will be useful in the
agricultural arena for designing new strategies for protection of crop plants
from insect predation.
