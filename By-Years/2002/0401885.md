0401885&lt;br/&gt;Logan&lt;br/&gt;As bacteria metabolize organic substrates
(electron donor), electrons are transferred via respiratory enzymes to an
electron acceptor. Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) take advantage of this basic
metabolic process by transferring the electrons from the bacterial respiratory
enzymes directly to an electrode (anode), which is wired to a second electrode
(cathode) that is exposed to air (or the electron acceptor, O2) in a separate
compartment. The flow of electrons between the electrodes creates a current, and
forms the basis of the fuel cell. Although the amount of electricity generated
is small at this point, the potential economic benefit for wastewater treatment
is enormous. The investigators seek to systematically evaluate the effect of MFC
design and configuration on power generation. The researchers specifically seek
to identify system components that can be re-designed to improve economic
viability of existing configurations, and to improve overall rates of energy
generation. These include cathode-to-anode surface area ratio and spacing, PEM
material, cathode material, and anode material.
