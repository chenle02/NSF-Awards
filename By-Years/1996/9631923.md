The investigator will study the theoretical and numerical analysis of nonlinear
partial differential equations (PDEs), especially those of mixed type and
generalized Monge-Ampere (MA) equations. These equations arise in several
applications. The first application is that of optical system deign and
analysis. The second is the design of fuel-efficient axisymmetric bodies and the
study of axisymmetric jet flows. Ultimately in both of the above applications,
one must solve a nonlinear Monge-Ampere equation which may be of elliptic,
hyperbolic, or mixed type. As with most completely nonlinear PDEs, one does not
expect to find existence or uniqueness results for these equations except in
special cases. However, in order for work on these applications to maintain
interest outside the mathematics community, one must demonstrate solidly how the
techniques in modeling optical systems or airplane wings can be use to design
such objects effectively. Therefore, some questions which must be considered
are: -What are well-posed boundary value problems? -Are there cases of interest
for which one can establish existence or uniqueness results? -What numerical
schemes would provide the best solutions to the MA equations? -What can we say
about these numerical solutions mathematically? While the MA equations
describing the two applications are considerably different, progress in
answering these questions for one MA equation may lead to the answers for other
equations. The investigators planning activities will include several visits to
the University of Delaware to meet with Professors L. Pamela Cook and Gilberto
Schleiniger who will advise her as she seeks answers to the questions posed
above.
