This project involves the use of an adaptive pseudo- spectral method to compute
solutions of models of solid and gaseous combustion that display spatio-temporal
patterns. In particular, the principal investigator will study how flames
undergo transitions to increasingly complex states through the mechanism of
pattern formation. The study of how flames propagate is an important area that
has attracted the attention of scientists, mathematicians and engineers. In this
proposal the principal investigator will find numerical solutions of combustion
problems that model the evolution in time of pulsating flames, cellular flames
and travelling flame fronts.
