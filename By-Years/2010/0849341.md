The flow of heat from the interior of the Earth through the sea floor is of
fundamental importance because it relates to or reflects a wide variety of Earth
System processes. In spite of its increasing importance related to methane
seeps, hydrothermal flow, gas hydrates (a potential alternative energy source),
and other applications, there has been a gradual decline of U.S. heat flow
measurement capability. Currently, there is no heat flow system available to the
US research community. This project will establish and maintain a U.S. heat flow
capability at modest cost, using existing equipment under the umbrella of the
coring facility at Oregon State University. The broader impacts are clear; the
proposed heat flow facility will save the U.S. heat flow capability, thereby
enabling essential research.
