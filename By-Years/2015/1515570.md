This proposal investigates properties of newly formed massive clusters of stars,
which are thought to be analogs of the large star clusters (so-called "globular
clusters") that formed very early in the history of our Milky Way Galaxy and
many other galaxies. The team will acquire molecular-line and dust-continuum
data, using the most advanced millimeter and submillimeter radio telescopes such
as the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array, to investigate the star
formation efficiency in these young massive clusters. Characterizing this
efficiency has important ramifications for a star cluster's survivability, as
well as for how star formation will progress near the cluster and throughout its
host galaxy. The team's low-resolution pilot study of a young massive cluster
hints at a surprisingly efficient conversion of gas into stars. To make
progress, that cluster and a similar one will be studied with the high angular
resolution and sensitivity that have only recently become available for
southerly clusters. A low-resolution study of a northerly cluster will also be
undertaken to begin exploring this important topic in a third setting. The PI
will continue her successful efforts to involve women and other underrepresented
groups in her research. She will also continue to give public talks
