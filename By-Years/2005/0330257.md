0330257&lt;br/&gt;Hamers&lt;br/&gt;This research is aimed at developing a new
generation of biological sensors with two unique elements. First, the sensors
are based upon the use of direct electrical impedance measurements as the basis
for signal transduction, providing a direct electronic bio-interface and the
possibility of real-time, continuous monitoring of biological molecules,
including a wide variety of pathogens. Secondly, the sensors are based upon the
use of carbon-based materials, including diamond and diamond-like carbon, as
ultra-stable supports, to provide a robust chemical and electronic interface to
biological molecules. The researchers will conduct experiments aimed at
developing optimized biological modification of the carbon-based materials
(including glassy carbon, thin-film diamond, and a variety of thin-film diamond-
like carbon materials) and the subsequent use of the biologically-modified
surfaces as the basis for direct electronic sensing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research will have broad impact by leading to autonomous sensing systems that
are able to detect and identify a variety of biological pathogens in real time
on a continuous basis. The development of these sensors could lead to complete
low-power, battery-operated sensing systems that could be inexpensively and
widely distributed to provide greatly increased security against hazardous
biological agents. Much of the proposed research would also have broad
commercial applicability in areas such as food safety, by enabling improved
methods for continuous monitoring of a wide variety of biological pathogens. The
proposed research will also effectively link research with education in several
ways. The principal investigator is actively involved in a number of outreach
activities linking the university to K-12 education. Additionally, graduate
students trained through this proposal will be exposed to an unusually
interdisciplinary field. &lt;br/&gt;
