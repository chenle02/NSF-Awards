9354995 Fichman Carnegie Mellon University if proposing an innovative GRT
program that focuses on the joint impact of groups and technology on
organizational effectiveness. As the primary work unit in organizations
continues to move from individuals to groups, organizational effectiveness
increasingly depends on the effective use of group-oriented organizational
designs. At the same time, the expansion of new technologies in organizations
both enhances opportunities for the formation and maintenance of work groups and
poses new challenges for effective work group functioning. The ability of
organizational scientists to contribute the organizational effectiveness in the
future will depend on an understanding of groups, technology, and their
interaction. We propose a GRT program that is innovative in form. It is a
university wide program, operated by faculty in the schools of business, social
sciences, and public management. This structure will expose students to a range
of theoretical and methological approaches to studying groups and technology in
both basic and applied settings. Training will be interdisciplinary in nature.
Students will have opportunities to bridge theory and application in newly
designed internships and project courses. ***
