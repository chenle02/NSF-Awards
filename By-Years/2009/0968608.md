As information technologies become unremarkable elements of everyday life,
opportunities arise to employ them to help introduce and reinforce lifestyle and
behavioral changes in which people are invested, in areas such as health and
wellness, or environmental sustainability. Most previous research in this area
has taken the individual user as its primary focus, asking, first, how
interactive technology might make people more aware of their own behavioral
patterns, and, second, how interactive technology might provide people with
incentives and rewards for changing those behaviors. The challenge - especially
for topics such as environmental sustainability - is how to scale up from
individual actions to the sorts of large-scale, societal change that makes for
long-term impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research examines an alternative
approach to technologically-based behavior change with a focus on questions of
scale. We draw on two main sources. The first comprises sociological
investigations of social movements and the processes through which they are
formed. The second is the contemporary interest in social networking and social
media. Our goal is to be able to link people together into larger socio-
computational systems that align with and motivate civic engagement and social
responsibility. We will develop, deploy, and evaluate online tools on both
traditional and mobile platforms that foster the creation of social movements
through the alignment of individual actions to collectivities. These systems
will be built around our fundamental principle that social groups are a more
intelligible and more compelling way to understand environmental actions than
arbitrary scales or abstract scientific measures such as CO2
tonnage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will provide new understandings of
the processes of social movement formation, with an emphasis on the role of
online tools and the potential for social networking technologies. We will
operationalize these understandings through a focus on design practice. Our
research provides insight into the potential for information technologies to
help people connect with local communities, increase civic engagement, and
achieve personally desirable behavior change.
