9625370 Spivak Quantum interference phenomena in small size metals and
superconductors are going to be studied in this grant. The general area is
better known as mesoscopic physics. In this grant the specific projects also
involve interfacial phenomena. There are planned studies of small metallic
samples, of alternating ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic metallic layers, of
superconductor-normal metal junctions and of small superconductors. All of the
work will be carried out using Green function, diagrammatic techniques and
procedures developed by the PI and his collaborators. %%% Given the shrinking
size of the electronic devices, a new area of physics has developed, called
mesoscopic physics. In this area the focus is on quantum interference and its
consequences in small metals and superconductors. The PI has been active in
studying this subject and is widely recognized for his seminal contributions. As
a continuation of this program, the present grant contains planned extension of
these ideas to situations where interfaces play an important role. ***
