This project is a five-year longitudinal study designed to examine early
foundations of formal mathematical learning. Approximately, 250 children in
Missouri will be assessed twice per year from preschool through first grade.
Specific competencies to be measured include number, number relations, and
number operations as well as language, executive function, attention, IQ, and
social behavior. Symbolic and non-symbolic quantitative skills are considered.
Data collected on this project will link to the Missouri Longitudinal Study of
Mathematical Development and Disability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Competence in
arithmetic and basic algebra has been shown to be strongly related to
employability, wages, and on-the-job productivity. Children who begin school
behind their peers in mathematical competencies tend to stay behind throughout
their schooling. The goal of this project is to conduct a longitudinal study
with at-risk 3 year olds to improve the field?s understanding of the development
of early numeracy development in young children and its relation to school
mathematics outcomes. The project hopes to shed light on how domain general
executive functions, nonverbal intelligence, and verbal intelligence interact
with quantitative knowledge to lead to math achievement at the end of
kindergarten.
