The International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) is the premiere
international conference for researchers in neural networks and related areas.
This annual conference is organized jointly by the International Neural Networks
Society (INNS) and the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (IEEE-CIS), with
each society taking the lead in alternate years. In recent years, a concerted
effort has been made by the organizers to include areas such as computational
neuroscience, cognitive science, distributed intelligence, embodied robotics,
etc., in the conference. The effort is now being made, through NSF support, to
expand this interdisciplinary component by organizing a formal, multi-faceted
program within the conference with the theme "From Brains to Machines." This
program will bring together researchers from a broad spectrum of areas ranging
from neuroscience to biomorphic robotics, and to showcase exciting research in
these areas.
