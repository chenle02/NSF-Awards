The Catalogue of Endangered Languages (ELCat) is the most significant resource
on the endangered languages of the world. It is a unique, multipurpose resource
for endangered language work, valuable to a range of audiences. ELCat has shown
that 3230 languages are endangered today; this represents 43% of the world's
7106 living languages. It is imperative to know not only how critically
endangered a language is, but also how much it can contribute to scientific
knowledge and how well it has already been described. In the two years since its
launch, ELCat has been regularly used not only by scholars, communities and
individuals struggling with language endangerment, but also by funding agencies
seeking guidance in the allocation of limited resources, by educators, students,
and media representatives, and by the general public, with applications ranging
from those seeking scientific knowledge to those wanting general information, to
pedagogy, to language policy and planning to community action, to seeking help
with language documentation and revitalization projects. This workshop will
bring together the Regional Directors of ELCat to discuss plans for the long-
term sustainable maintenance of the project. Topics to be discussed include
assessment of personnel and technology needs; plans for continued curation; the
creation of an ELCat Board of Directors; and increased functionality for site
users including crowdsourcing, a question-and-discussion area, and activity-
based user experience paths. The workshop format has two components: (1)
Presentations by invited participants, to present overviews of the outcomes and
achievements of the Catalogue of Endangered Languages project, challenges ELCat
faces and must address for its future, desiderata for infrastructure for a
sustainable Catalogue, candidate strategies for providing for ELCat's long-term
survival and maintenance; and (2) Working group sessions. Each working group
will be composed of four to five members, addressing a specific question,
challenge, or need in designing a sustainable future for the Catalogue.
Membership in the working groups will be determined by participants' choices
based on their experience, expertise, and interest in a specific topic. Working
groups will be provided with suggested discussion questions, open-ended enough
to allow discussion of other themes and ideas that group members may want to
add. Discussion of these questions should lead to formulating specific goals and
to recommendations about how to achieve those goals.
