9513256 Carter This proposal is for partial support for a conference that will
deal with the neural and physiological underpinnings of social and affiliate
behavior in higher vertebrates. A unique feature of this conference is that it
will bring together scientists representing fields as apparently diverse as
social psychology and neuroendocrinology with the intent of integrating
knowledge concerning affliative behavior gained from these different
disciplines. In addition, the biology of social and affiliative behavior will be
examined in a variety of species. The integration of knowledge gained from
comparative as well as multidisciplinary approaches should facilitate
advancement of our understanding of the biological basis of affiliative
behavior.
