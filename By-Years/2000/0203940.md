The 2002 Japan-USA Symposium on Flexible Automation co-organized by Georgia Tech
will be held in Hiroshima, Japan, July 15-17, 2002. The symposium will consist
of three days of technical presentations, panel discussions, and keynote
speeches, followed by tours to major university research laboratories and
industry production facilities in Japan. The financial assistance will make it
possible for many promising U.S. researchers such as faculty, postdoctoral
fellows, and graduate students to attend the conference and learn about
research, development, and implementation of flexible automation technologies in
Japan. It will also enhance the ability of the symposium organizers to attract
top university researchers in U.S. to contribute to the symposium.
