This conference grant will bring Science, Technology and Society (STS) scholars
together to address equitable consequences of current contemporary societal
science issues, questions, and challenges. Outcomes will be distributed through
a broadly shared report to the STS research community. A set of readings that
translate cutting edge STS research into accessible and interesting articles for
undergraduate students, and development of a master syllabus for teaching
undergraduate courses on societal science issues will be developed. These
materials will be freely available and of interest to policy makers, citizens
and educators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop brings together senior STS
scholars with an established track record of research along with newer STS
scholars (graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, assistant professors) to
help shape future STS research. The workshop is organized around several topical
areas: emerging public environmental problems, effective communication of
science and its public understanding, governance, and possibilities for opening
more policy options and broader democratic participation, environmental
inequality and injustice, and how new socio-technologies and societal
visionaries become integrated into existing systems. Workshop participants will
be recruited in each area of research to summarize what is known, open
discussion of unanswered questions, and contribute to the report and pedagogical
products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
