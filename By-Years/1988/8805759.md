This proposal is concerned with the problem of determining control laws which
guarantee asymptotic stability for linear systems with uncertainty. Uncertainty
can arise because the physical parameters are not known exactly or because the
parameters change as the operating conditions change. A control design based on
a nominal system may be inadequate to achieve satisfactory performance if the
system is perturbed from the nominal. .h.>Much of the current research on robust
control is concerned with determining the degree of robustness for a specific
controller, i.e. the analysis problem. The emphasis here is on the synthesis
problem development of a systematic procedure for determining a control law
which guarantees asymptotic stability. Problems with time.varying uncertainty as
well as constant uncertainty will be treated. In addition, the simultaneous
stabilization problem will be addressed. Numerical algorithms to implement the
design problems will be developed and applied to models of real physical
systems.
