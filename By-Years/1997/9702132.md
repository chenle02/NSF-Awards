The award supports research into a methodology under which autonomous agents can
develop commonly shared rules of interaction and commonly shared communication
languages, while interacting in a multi-agent environment. Interaction and
communication are viewed as agents' attempts to maximize their performance,
measured as expected utility of outcomes. The research aims to enable agents to
benefit from rules of behavior that are shared and that could emerge among
interacting agents without the necessity to recompute currently optimal courses
of action. The research also seeks to enrich the agents' communicative abilities
by formalizing the role and usefulness of shared communication languages. The
continuation of this thread is the precise formalization of a mechanism of
language formation. The most significant impact of this research will appear in
multi-agent scenarios characterized by unanticipated change, such as those in
hazardous environments, distributed management of communications networks, and
flexible manufacturing systems.
