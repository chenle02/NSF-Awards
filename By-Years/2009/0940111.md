Novel MEMS Biosensor for Real Time Study of the Attachment of Cancer Cells

The objective of this proposal is to design and fabricate a novel biosensor
with capabilities of detecting in real time the adhesion and stiffness of normal
and cancer cells. This biosensor will merge two biosensing techniques namely
resonant frequency measurements and impedance spectroscopy technique on a single
device. The approach is to situate the detecting microelectrodes for impedance
spectroscopy technique on the acoustic path of a piezoelectric resonator.

The proposed biosensor will be able to simultaneously perform, in real time, two
different types of electric measurements on the same cell and will represent an
analysis platform for in vitro diagnosis of cancer cells. This biosensor will
have novel capabilities to test different subcellular regions of a cell, using
an array of microelectrodes for impedance spectroscopy detection. During this
research mathematical models that will predict the relationship between the
electrical measurements and the mechanical properties of the cell will be also
formulated. The proposed research is exploratory work in early stage and will
offer novel cell analysis capabilities provided by integrating two separate
measurement methods in a single device.

This biosensor could have other important applications as: detecting different
cancer biomarkers, and facilitating steam cells differentiation. The principal
investigator is interested in integration of this research with education and
especially to increase the participation of underrepresented students in the
engineering field and attract women to the doctoral program. The educational
plan also includes mentoring high school students from minority population and
involving underrepresented students in international research in Japan.
