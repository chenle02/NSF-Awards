This grant co-funded between Materials Theory, and Ceramics and Electronic
Materials initiates a program of research combining theoretical and experimental
studies of the surface morphology of primarily sputtered materials.
Theoretically, numerical and analytical studies will be undertaken on a model
that embodies some of the key features of sputtering. Experimentally, the
scanning tunnelling microscope will be used to study the surface structure of
films grown in situ by sputter deposition and on surfaces formed by sputter
etching.
