The past decade has witnessed a sea change in the way that computing systems are
designed, programmed, implemented, and evaluated. The advent of multicore
technologies has fundamentally reshaped the long-standing contract between
hardware and software - no longer can we simply rely on improvements in clock
speeds to have our programs run faster. Instead, the burden for improvements in
program performance now falls squarely on software and algorithms. Devising new
techniques to efficiently and safely exploit multiple cores is the central
question facing language designers, compiler writers, and system
architects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To help address these challenges, this NSF
sponsored workshop will identify future research directions related to High-
Level Programming Models for Parallelism, and the transition of such research to
industrial practice. The workshop will bring together researchers from academia,
industry, and government research labs working in the area of parallelism,
including algorithms, architecture, language design and implementation, and
runtime systems. The workshop will identify primary challenges in the field,
both foundational and infrastructural, and will address the transition of ideas
from research to practice.
