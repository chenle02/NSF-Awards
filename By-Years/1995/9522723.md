This proposal supports the collaboration of Dr. Mukul Kundu of the Department
of Astronomy , University of Maryland at College Park and Dr. Takashi Sakurai of
the National Astronomical Observatory, Mitaka, Japan. Project funding will
permit Dr. Kundu to spend 6 months in Japan, resident in Mitaka, in order to
study the sun's corona using simultaneously obtained X-ray and radio
observations with the Japanese Space mission Yohkoh and ground based radio
telescopes. Dr. Kundu has made pioneering contributions to the knowledge of the
sun's corona using combined radio and X-ray imaging data. Dr. Sakurai will bring
his theoretical expertise to the problem of studying solar active regions and
flares from the point of view of magnetic energy storage and trigger mechanisms.
They will jointly study a broad range of solar coronal phenomena : study of
X-ray emission above sunspots, study of radio emission associated with coronal
jets, study of the evolution of active regions in terms of flare productivity.
This proposal brings together research scientists from two countries working in
the area of solar coronal physics. The U.S. scientist will have the opportunity
to become familiar with research techniques related to Yohkoh X-ray techniques
while contributing to the overall research effort. Therefore this proposal
fulfills the objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of
scientific knowledge through an international collaboration.
