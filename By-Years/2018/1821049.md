Part 1. The investigators will present scientific information about Arctic
change to a broad range of international leaders by establishing a meeting and
demonstration area, described as an Arctic Basecamp 2018, in association with
the annual World Economic Forum in Davos Switzerland. The investigators will
hold panel discussions and will provide demonstrations of the instrumentation
used to make environmental measurements in the Arctic in an interactive format.
The events will emphasize the linkages between long-term measurements and
climate models, while also bringing forward the economic considerations of risk
and opportunity related to Arctic change.

Part 2. This conference will emphasize scientific outreach to a broad audience
of leaders in business, government and other international organizations who are
interested in the pace of change in the Arctic. The investigators will establish
a meeting and demonstration area, described as the Arctic Basecamp 2018, for a
two-day period in Davos, Switzerland concurrently with the World Economic Forum.
The outreach materials presented at the Arctic Basecamp 2018 will be widely
distributed and will be used by the investigators subsequently for other
outreach activities.
