9422499 Wakimoto Physical forcing that occurs on small spatial and time scales
(mesoscale) often determines the timing, location and severity of various
weather phenomena. The Principal Investigator proposes to apply principals of
mesoscale analysis to a variety of weather phenomena including tornadogenesis,
study of convection in the boundary layer along what is termed horizontal
convective roles, and to the study of oceanic cyclogenesis. The tornadogenesis
study is focused on determining the physical factors that cause some severe
thunderstorms to produce tornadoes while others do not. The Principal
Investigator will participate in the second phase of the Verification of Origins
of Tornadoes Experiment (VORTEX) as well as continue analysis of data collected
during the first phase in the Spring of 1994. A unique aspect of this
investigation is the first use of airborne Doppler data for the study of
tornadogenesis. The study of horizontal convective roles is a continuation of
analysis of data collected during the Convection and
Precipitation/Electrification. This study is focused on one of the most common
types of boundary layer convection and will include a study of how horizontal
convective roles interact with the sea breeze. The third component will
investigate the fine scale details of oceanic cyclogenesis using data from the
Experiment on Rapidly Intensifying Cyclones over the Atlantic. Preliminary radar
syntheses have revealed shallow mesoscale circulations that form along an
intense warm front. This mesoscale feature appears to be the incipient
circulation that can lead to rapid cyclogenesis when it comes into a proper
phasing with an upper-level short wave trough. ***
