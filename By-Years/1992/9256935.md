This project will support five graduate research traineeships over a seven year
period in the Computation and Neural Systems (CNS) Option at the California
Institute of Technology. The CNS option brings together biologists, engineers,
computer scientists, and physicists with an interest in learning how computation
is done by the nervous system, and applying that knowledge to the design of
computers. Work in this area is expected to lead to significant advances in many
engineering applications as well as neurobiology.
