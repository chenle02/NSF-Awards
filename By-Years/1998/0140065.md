McBay &lt;br/&gt;OIA-0140065&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quality Education for
Minorities (QEM) Network, a non-profit organization, has been instrumental in
improving the education of under-represented groups that have been historically
undeserved by the nation's educational system. A successor to the Quality
Education for Minorities Project based at MIT, QEM continues to develop
effective strategies for STEM education for minorities, and focuses on issues
and barriers that prevent minorities from receiving a high quality education.
This project continues to provide internship opportunities for students at the
National Science Foundation as a mechanism to increase students understanding of
science policy; encourage potential for becoming leaders and proponents for
increased STEM participation by students from low-income communities; and
encourage interns to continue STEM interests and studies through the doctoral
level. Complimentary to the internship experience at NSF, students are required
to engage in a science-oriented community outreach activity during the following
academic year at their respective institutions.
