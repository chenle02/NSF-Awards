There are an estimated 45 million inpatient surgical procedures per year in the
U.S., where critical incidents account for 832,500 deaths and between 1,350,000
and 7,650,000 cases of significant harm to the patient. Of these errors,
teamwork failures (e.g. misunderstanding procedural instructions and not
acknowledging and repeating back drug dosage levels) are a significant factor -
up to 70% for medical operations such as surgery. Reducing teamwork failures
requires team training using effective protocols; however, few team training
opportunities on these protocols exist. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
merit: To address this deficiency in training, the project will substitute
unavailable human team members with mixed reality humans (MRH). MRHs will plug
into roles of unavailable human team members to facilitate training in multi-
party scenarios. The research team will first develop systems capable of having
MRH inhabit training environments alongside human trainees. Then, they will
develop novel conversational modeling techniques to support a training
experience to be conducted with any combination of human trainees and virtual
human teammates. Finally, the team will conduct a set of user studies with the
system to explore the effect of mixed reality humans, the impact of mixed
reality humans on team dynamics, and the efficacy of team training with mixed
reality humans. The result of this work will be effective self-contained,
portable MRH systems that integrate into clinical training
environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The project will result in
important educational tools for team training that will ultimately lower the
high social and financial costs of team errors in medicine. Better trained teams
make fewer and less serious mistakes, thereby improving patient outcomes. The
tools and findings will be integrated into the curriculum of continuing medical
education and new hire orientation at the University of Florida. While initially
applied and evaluated in a clinical setting, the investigators anticipate that
mixed reality human team training will be applicable to other multiparty
scenarios in aviation, the military, education, and crisis response.
