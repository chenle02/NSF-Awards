This project will develop and install an experimental computer-based Psychology
curriculum designed to increase the depth of understanding of psychological and
statistical concepts through computer-based graphic demonstrations, simulations,
tutorials, and the mathematical modelling of psychological phenomena.
Preliminary progress has been achieved on a relatively small scale by individual
faculty who, over the years, have been writing educational software for the use
of their own students. Now the Department feels it is time to make a coordinated
effort to tap this resource by expanding the use of this currently available
educational software and by encouraging the development of new software. The
primary limitation to implementing such a program in the past has been the lack
of available hardward. The courses where this program will have a major impact
are the Analysis of Psychological Data, Research Methods in Psychology,
Experimental Psychology, Topics in General Psychology, and Advanced Research
Methods, plus the Independent Study and Honors Research Programs. This computer-
based curriculum is expected to make possible dimensions of academic pursuit
that would be unattainable without the thorough integration of the computer into
the day-to-day coverage of course material.
