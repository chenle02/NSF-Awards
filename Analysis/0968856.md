Professor Simon will study various problems in the spectral theory of orthogonal
polynomials. He intends to study the zero structure of the polynomials
associated to self-similar measures like the Cantor measure, thereby linking to
recent research in dynamical systems and harmonic analysis. He also intends to
look beyond the classical spectral theory regimes of the real line and unit
circle. This research piggybacks on recent progress by Professor Simon and
coworkers, extending it in new directions.

Orthogonal polynomials have impacts on a wide swath of science and engineering,
including filter theory in electrical engineering, problems in statistics, and
recently, problems in quantum computing. The kinds of basic research that
Professor Simon does, has long term spinoff in these more applied areas.
Professor Simon has directly supervised over thirty graduate students and
mentored about that number of postdocs. His papers and books have had
considerable impact, as seen by the 8,645 citations in MathSciNet (over roughly
the past ten years). He is one of a handful of mathematicians with over 5,000
citations.
