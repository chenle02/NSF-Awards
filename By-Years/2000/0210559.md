This proposal was received in response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering
Initiative, NSF 01-157, category NIRT. Our interdisciplinary team is
investigating a new process for nanoscale machining employing field emission of
electrons from carbon nanotubes. High-precision nanomachining will be obtained
by the concentrated thermal power transmitted by electron beams to a thin-film
workpiece. In order to investigate the nanomachining process, we will develop a
staggered probe that integrates multiple carbon nanotubes on a single probe for
integrated nanometrology by scanning probe microscopy and nanomachining by field
emission. Such probes will enable the experimental demonstration and
investigation of nanomachining with field emission from
nanotubes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will demonstrate a new high-
precision manufacturing process for producing nano-scale patterns that will
impact many disciplines such as nanoelectronics, nanoscience, biology, and
energy. The research will foster a multi-university, interdisciplinary
partnership in the areas of precision manufacturing, nanoscale thermal sciences,
solid-state physics, and material science. A broad set of educational and
outreach activities will include nanotechnology&lt;br/&gt;workshops chemistry
and pre-engineering students at Kentucky State University (KSU) and a summer
microscopy fellowship for KSU minority students at the University of Kentucky's
microscopy facility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
