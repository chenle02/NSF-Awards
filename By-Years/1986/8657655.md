This is a Presidential Young Investigator award. The subject of this research is
the development of a relative humidity sensor based on the permittivity
properties of polyimide (PI). Emphasis on the development of this sensor will be
on reliability and lifetime, particularly in hostile environments. Empirical
evidence indicates that prolonged condensation of water on the PI surface leads
to device failure. This research will seek to characterize the expected changes
in surface chemistry that may lead to reliability and aging problems. Also, the
mechanical properties of PI will be characterized, particularly the thermal
coefficient of expansion and swelling due to moisture, with the aim of
specifying structures with reduced stress levels and greater reliability.
