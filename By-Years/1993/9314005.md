Tivey 9314005 This study will apply a variety of techniques to characterize
samples taken from hydrothermal flange deposits. The PI will determine porosity,
mineralogy, texture and chemistry of pore fluids and sulfur minerals. These data
will be combined with temperature and fluid composition measured by others, and
used in a computer model to quantify mass and energy fluxes. The project should
provide valuable insights into the formation of the flanges, which are the best
analog known for massive sulfide ore deposits.
