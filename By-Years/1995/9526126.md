9526126 Zreda Sequences of mafic lavas contain records of the cosmic ray
intensity on earth. Such lavas, however, are difficult to accurately date,
especially beyond the 14C range, because of their fine-crystalline texture an
low potassium content. The in situ accumulation of cosmogenic nuclides can be
potentially used to approach this problem. I propose to test a new cosmogenic
approach to determine the age of now-buried mafic lava flows and/or the cosmic-
ray intensity in the past. It uses two cosmogenic nuclides with different half-
lives. The accumulation up of a longer-lived or stable nuclide is used to
determine how long the lava had been exposed at the surface. the decay of a
shorter-lived nuclide gives the burial duration. The feasibility of this novel
approach will be tested using selected samples from the 1056-m core at Hilo,
Hawaii. This preliminary study has three objectives: (1) to evaluate the
retention of cosmogenic noble gases; (2) to evaluate the utility of long-lived
cosmogenic radionuclides as a measure of the exposure duration; and (3) to
assess the utility of shorter-lived cosmogenic nuclides as a measure of the
burial duration. If the approach is successful, it will enable us to
simultaneously determine cosmogenic ages of lava flows and the cosmic ray
intensity during their exposure to the atmosphere. Preliminary results in this
project will be used in future proposals to perform a comprehensive cosmogenic
study on this and other volcanic sequences.
