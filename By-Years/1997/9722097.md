A number of theoretical investigations in theoretical elementary particle
physics will be carried out, focusing primarily on the physics of the strongly
interacting particles as described by the quantum chromodynamic theory which is
widely accepted as the correct fundamental description of the nuclear force. The
methods used will involve extensive computations on massively parallel dedicated
computers. An important specific aim of the research is an accurate (few
percent) calculation from the fundamental theory of the electromagnetic fine
structure of the spectrum of strongly interacting particles. This will be one of
the first precise tests of quantum chromodynamics, which up to now has only been
tested at best at the 5-10% level. In addition, this research program is the
first to allow an accurate determination of the masses of the quarks, the
fundamental building blocks of all known strongly interacting particles.
