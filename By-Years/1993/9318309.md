9318309 Grodzicker Funding is requested for a Cold Spring Harbor summer course
in Arabidopsis molecular genetics. The use of Arabidopsis as a model plant for
the course reflects the current research interests of many US and international
laboratories. The course is designed to fulfill a growing need within the plant
science community for training in this area. The intention is (1) to teach state
of the art molecular techniques to scientists who are already involved in
research with plants so that they can apply these technologies to their own
future research and (2) to teach scientists who are familiar with microbial,
animal or plant systems about current research in plant biology using
Arabidopsis as the model plant system. The course consists of a rigorous lecture
series, a hands-on laboratory and informal discussions. Speakers will provide
both an in- depth discussion of their work and an overview of their specialty.
The laboratory sessions provide intensive training in modern techniques in plant
biology. It also introduces approaches used in yeast that have the potential to
be utilized for the advancement of Arabidopsis molecular genetics. ***
