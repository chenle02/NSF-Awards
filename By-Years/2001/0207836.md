0207836&lt;br/&gt;Pratt&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Continental
Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP) is funding the drilling of a 2km hole in the
Chicxulub impact crater on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. NSF is funding US
investigators to analyze core samples from the Chicxulub Scientific Drilling
Project (CSDP). The Chicxulub crater is one of the world's largest impact
craters and has been linked to the mass extnction event at the Cretaceous -
Tertiary boundary ~65 million years ago. As part of the CSDP Science Team, the
Principal Investigators will look at the Sulfur (S) isotopic systematics of the
Chicxulub impact site. They will investigate the mixing between target rocks and
the bolide at the drill site. This will be an important contribution to the
complete characterization of the Chicxulub drill core samples.
