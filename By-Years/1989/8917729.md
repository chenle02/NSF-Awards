The primary goal of this research is to gain insight into the role that the L
and M polypeptides of the bacterial photosynthetic reaction center play in
determining the parameters of electron transfer between reaction center
chromophores. To this end, sophisticated spectroscopic techniques will be
combined with molecular genetic manipulation of the amino acid sequences of
these polypeptides for the analysis of reaction center function. Specific
methods to be employed include picosecond resolution fluorescence decay
measurements, subpicosecond resolution transient absorption spectroscopy of
electron transfer intermediates, cassette mutagenesis of reaction center genes,
and the production of chimeric reaction centers by forcing deletions in the
reaction center genes of one organism to be repaired by reaction center
sequences derived from a related organism. This work will result in a better
understanding of the specific electron transfer reactions involved in the
primary events of photosynthesis and provide new insights into the dielectric
nature of proteins in general.
