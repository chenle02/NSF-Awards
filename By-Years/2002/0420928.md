With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin in Eau Claire will
acquire a transportable pulsed laser system. This equipment will enhance
research in the following areas: a) UV-IR double resonance spectroscopy in small
organic molecules; b) excitation or probe pulse in studies of HF
photoelimination; c) cavity ringdown spectroscopy of atmospheric species and
photochemically-produced radicals; d) stimulated emission pumping studies of
polyatomic molecules in excited vibrational states; and e) velocity mapping to
probe the excited-state behavior of NO-containing molecules.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This transportable pulsed dye laser system will address
the needs of participating research groups at four undergraduate institutions
located within the Midwest. The individual research groups will have periodic
access to the new dye laser at their home institutions, with transportation,
maintenance and technical support coordinated by scientists at Purdue
University. . &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
