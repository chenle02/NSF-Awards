This award will provide funding for a two-day workshop on the Design of
Engineered Complex Systems, to be held in Arlington, VA, in September 2009. The
workshop will focus on methodologies for the conceptual design of engineered
complex systems. Many of the most challenging engineering design problems today
involve engineered complex systems. An especially challenging research area is
conceptual design, i.e., making design decisions when major aspects of the
system are only vaguely specified, and where mathematical descriptions are
elusive. It is anticipated that the workshop will involve about 100
participants, split between industry and academia. The speakers will be experts
in a variety of disciplines related to engineered complex
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the workshop will identify
promising research directions in this challenging and relatively unexplored
research area. Because of the many areas in which engineered complex systems
arise (energy production, transportation, climate modeling, nanotechnology,
etc.) there is the potential for significant societal impact in a vast number of
applications. The ideas and directions identified at the workshop have the
potential to influence a variety of fundamental research areas (optimization,
dynamic systems, control systems) as well as influence research in the
application areas mentioned above (energy, etc.).
