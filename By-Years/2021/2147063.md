This research addresses how new and emerging technologies are used to mediate
social, political, and economic relations, and the kinds of techno-futures they
are building. It focuses on the socio-technical practices of non-state actors
who produce and distribute digital technologies across regions. The project will
fund training for undergraduate and graduate students in Science and Technology
Studies (STS). It will contribute to the publicâ€™s understanding of how AI,
facial recognition, Internet of Things, etc. are becoming embedded into the
everyday world. The findings will be of interest to innovation and technology
policy makers, technology users, and
educators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is conducted primarily
through multi-sited ethnography along with discourse analyses, focus groups, and
artifact analyses. It seeks to answer the questions: 1) who is at forefront in
the design, manufacture, and distribution of AI, computing hardware, and data
flows, particularly outside state-sponsored activities? and 2) what are the
socio-technical practices governing these processes? Researchers will examine
the commercial activities linking specific technologies to consumers, including
the constellation of software and hardware that establish cross-regional data
flows. It will focus on networks of entrepreneurs, makers, manufacturers, and
investors who actively build and circulate personal/consumer technologies as
well as those working in the startup ecosystem of agriculture and finance. The
research contributes to STS scholarship on techno-politics as well as histories
of digital technology and critical computing research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
