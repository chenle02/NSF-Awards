The workshop in undergraduate computer science education to be held on March 10
and 11, 1988 at the Marvin Center of The George Washington University will bring
together 30 leaders in undergraduate computer science education and five to ten
NSF personnel concerned with computer science education and research. The
organization of the workshop into working groups on curriculum, delivery of
curriculum, laboratory infrastructure, and faculty will provide an excellent way
of identifying the major problems in undergraduate computer science education
and how NSF and other organizations can help to solve those problems. Because
the National Science Board has recommended that the NSF take the lead in
improving undergraduate science and engineering education, the workshop is quite
appropriate. The guidance that can be provided by the workshop can thus be of
great benefit to NSF as well as the discipline of computer science.
