The workshop took place November 19-20, 2004 at MIT. It served as the 14th in
the ongoing series of Fall Workshops on Computational Geometry, which originated
at Stony Brook in 1991. The workshop on computational geometry is a forum for
reporting ongoing state-of-the art research in many areas of theoretical and
applied computational geometry. The focus of this particular workshop is to
highlight open problems and ongoing challenges to the field, with the intention
that formalized statements of open problems will help form a catalyst for new
investigations and innovative solutions, while motivating new researchers,
particularly students, to engage in attacking some of the outstanding questions
in discrete and computational geometry. A key focus of the workshop will be an
Open Problem Forum in order to promote a free exchange of questions and research
challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the workshop will be widely
disseminated by means of the internet, with talk abstracts and a detailed list
of open problems raised. Many of the open problems will be highlighted in The
Open Problem Project (TOPP) web pages, a recently established open problem forum
moderated by three of the workshop organizers (Demaine, Mitchell, and
O'Rourke).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
