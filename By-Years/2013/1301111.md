The objective of this project is to establish a sparse grid filtering framework
for accurate estimation of nonlinear and non-Gaussian dynamic systems under
computational constraints. This research is motivated by challenging situational
awareness problems. Situational awareness is concerned with what is happening in
the environment and what will happen in the future. It is critical to decision
making in a variety of domains containing large uncertainties and rich dynamics.
The research approach is to use a high-accuracy sparse grid as an efficient and
accurate representation of non-Gaussian uncertainty and recursively propagate
and update the sparse grid. The research will result in a unified point-based
filtering framework, computationally efficient nonlinear filtering algorithms,
and a solution to the estimation problems in space situational awareness.
Deliverables include documentation of research results, a MATLAB toolbox for
sparse grid filtering/space situational awareness, engineering student education
and seminars, and student hands-on experience in space object tracking.

If successful, the situational awareness solution will help provide timely and
accurate information, data, and services regarding the space/ground environment,
and reduce hazards to infrastructure in orbit and on the ground. It will make a
great contribution to the safe operation of space and transportation systems and
thus have a direct impact on the economy and national security. The sparse-grid
based estimation, in a broader perspective, provides a class of accurate and
computationally efficient algorithms to solve complex estimation problems for
many high dimensional and nonlinear dynamical systems such as multi-agent
systems, sensor networks, and power systems. The integration of the research
results into the education programs through a variety of activities in
curriculum design, student project involvement, and outreach will help recruit
and retain minority students and motivate young students to pursue their careers
in engineering or science.
