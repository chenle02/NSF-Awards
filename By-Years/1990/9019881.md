Antarctic fish live in waters that are perennially at the freezing point of body
fluids. These waters would be devoid of fish if these fish had not evolved
biological antifreeze molecules to avoid freezing. The evolutionary aspects of
antifreezes in Antarctic fish possess considerable scientific interest. Dr.
Arthur DeVries began his studies on antifreezes in Antarctic fish over three
decades ago and has systematically investigated the mechanism by which
antifreezes confer freezing avoidance on the whole animal. This research project
will continue the study of how antifreezes evolved in the Antarctic fishes by
examining the physiological and mechanistic processes involved in freezing
tolerance. Physiological studies include synthesis of antifreezes and factors
that govern synthesis, secretion, fluid and tissue transport, and conservation
of antifreezes. Mechanistic studies focus on understanding how antifreezes
adsorb to ice and inhibit ice crystal growth. Aside from the intrinsic value of
the project, freezing avoidance in fish could have implications to the fields of
human pathologies, in nucleation theory, and in crystallography.
