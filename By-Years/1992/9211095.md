This award is to support a postdoctoral associate to work in experimental
computer science. The associate, Calvin P. Lin, will work with Dr. Lawrence
Snyder on portable parallel programs. The research will concentrate on three
areas: parallel languages, parallel algorithms, and portable scientific
applications. Two parallel languages will be developed based on the Phase
Abstractions programming model. This model has already been shown to produce
portable parallel programs for both shared and distributed memory architectures.
Additionally, important scientific algorithms, such as the Fast Fourier
Transform, will be studied to identify the "algorithm of choice", an algorithm
that is optimal on most architectures and competitive on all. Finally, work will
continue on the development of portable scientific codes concentrating on a
large molecular dynamics program.
