Principal Investigator: James Lawler Title: Research on Plasma Light Sources In
this research, investigations into the use of suitable atomic systems for High
Intensity Discharge (HID) plasma lighting will be carried out. The research has
three parts: (1) investigation and measurements of the radiative lifetimes of
the rare earth elements Dysprosium (Dy) and Holmium (Ho) as promising candidates
for use in high intensity discharge lamps, (2) development of a two photon
absorption technique as a diagnostic for high intensity discharge lamps (3)
investigation of atomic Barium (Ba) as a possible atomic radiator of much
greater efficiency than is currently available. This third investigation could
represent a breakthrough for the plasma lighting industry. The lighting industry
consortium ALITE has identified the search for new HID gaseous radiating systems
as a research topic with the highest priority for the development of improved
light sources. Improved light sources is an area of significant economic and
environmental importance for the Untied States and for the world.
