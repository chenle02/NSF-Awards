This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from Software
Engineering, Inc. will investigate applicability and refinement of program
analysis tools to domain-specific business rule extraction. A business rule is a
declarative description of how an entity of a company's business process is
defined. A program slice with respect to a variable reference consists of all
program statements that potentially affect the value of the variable at that
reference. Slicing has obvious relevance to business rule extraction, but
requires refinement and elaboration if it is to be incorporated into a
reengineering environment that interactively assists an analyst identifying
business rules. Slices are often too large and too inaccurate. This project will
explore methods to restrict slices based on domain knowledge expressed as
domain-specific typing rules and will filter slices based on syntactic and
semantic constraints specified by the analyst. The modern computer environment
of client-server architectures, internet and intranet capabilities, component
support for enterprise-wide computing, and platform-independent systems afford a
significant competitive advantage to the companies that exploit these
capabilities. Technology derived from this investigation can assist in this
reengineering task.
