This project is an equipment grant under the activity Grants For Scientific
Computing Research Equipment For The Mathematical Sciences program. The project
involves the purchase of special purpose equipment dedicated to the support of
research in the mathematical sciences. In general, this equipment is required
jointly by several research projects and would be difficult to justify on one
project alone. This research equipment support from the National Science
Foundation is coupled with discounts and contributions of equipment from
manufacturers and significant cost-sharing from the submitting institution. This
project provides a good example of university, industrial, and government
cooperation in the support of basic research in the mathematical sciences. The
equipment in this project will be dedicated to support research in the
mathematical sciences in projects in dynamics and ergodic theory, differential
geometry, and 3-manifold topology.
