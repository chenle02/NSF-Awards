In random matrix theory, various limiting distribution functions arise and many
of them are universal. This project studies the extent of the universality of
random matrix distribution functions and also of asymptotic properties of these
functions. The project will explore three specific situations in which such
functions are expected to appear: random matchings, nonequilibrium interacting
particle systems, and Hermitian matrix models with external sources. They
illustrate the diversity of the appearance of random matrix theory. The
principal investigator also intends to study the asymptotic properties of random
matrix distribution functions.

The study of the intrinsic properties of random matrix distribution functions is
expected to shed light on the universal nature of random matrix theory. The
distribution functions from random matrix theory indeed describe a wide variety
of objects from both mathematics and other fields of science. In statistics,
physics, economics, finance, and electrical engineering, a complicated system is
often modeled in terms of random matrices. More importantly, some systems that
are not modeled in terms of random matrices do exhibit random-matrix-like
behavior when the size of the systems tends to infinity, a curious phenomenon
that is known as the "universality" of random matrices. This project will study
some of the basic properties of the distribution functions that arise in random
matrix theory and also investigate further instances in which such functions
arise, all in an effort to understand what it is that makes random matrices so
universal. The project will incorporate undergraduates and graduate students
into the research activities.
