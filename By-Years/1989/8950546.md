Many of today's science and engineering students are pursuing careers in such
new fields as superconductors, photonics, NMR imaging, and very-large-scale
integrated circuitry. To understand these new technologies, students need to be
well versed in the fundamental concepts of matter that are found in a physical
chemistry course. With this in mind, Tennessee Technological University is
modernizing the physical chemistry laboratory. This project implements a laser
spectroscopy system consisting of an argon-pumped tunable dye laser, scanning
double monochromater, and detection electronics. The experiments provide graphic
demonstration of fundamental concepts in quantum chemistry, atomic and molecular
structure, photochemistry, and spectroscopy. These instruments provide students
with hands-on experience with this state-of-the-art instrumentation. The
institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
