This three-year award supports U.S.-U.K. cooperative research in probability
theory between Carl E. Mueller of the University of Rochester and Roger Tribe of
the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom. The objective of their research
is to investigate the relationship between stochastic partial differential
equations (SPDE) and superprocesses. The U.S. and U.K. investigators bring
complementary expertise in probability theory and SPDE. They will use
superprocesses tools, such as the historical process and the Laplace function,
and study traveling waves for supercritical Brownian superprocesses in higher
dimensions. The project will advance our understanding of how stochastic partial
differential equations describe natural phenomena.
