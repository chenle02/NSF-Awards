The principal objective of this research project is to quantify the
relationships among melt bulk composition, temperature, and structure by using
micro-Raman spectroscopy with a high-temperature heating stage. Laboratory
experiments will be conducted on alkali and alkaline earth aluminosilicate melts
at temperatures up to 1700oC. Results of the experiments will enable
identification of the predominant structural units in the melt as a function of
bulk composition and temperature, derivation of quantitative estimates of
equilibrium constants, and computation of thermodynamic and transport
properties. The results will be applied to the study of chemically complex
natural magmatic liquids and will ultimately find application in elucidating the
behavior of melts within and on the Earth's surface.
