This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing work of
Professor Richard H. Smith at Western Maryland College. Various cyclization
reactions of haloalkyl triazenes to hitherto unknown classes of triazenes will
be studied. The mechanism and the role of the metal ion will be investigated for
the formation of linear chloropropyl triazenes, and of the new cyclization
products, azimines and triazinines, that result from the reaction between
3-chloropropyl azide and Grignard reagents. The chemistry of these new non-
aromatic azimines and the hydrolytic decomposition of triazinines will be
explored. The ultimate goal is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the
relationship between the chemistry of linear triazenes, cyclic triazenes, and
non-aromatic azimines. %%% Cyclic triazenes and non-aromatic azimines are new
classes of compounds of which the chemistry and hydrolytic decomposition will be
studied by Professor Smith and his undergraduate students. The compounds are of
interest for physical organic studies to delineate the mechanism of metabolism
and triazene degradation in cellular systems.
