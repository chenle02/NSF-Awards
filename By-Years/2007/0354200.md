This award supports a synergistic effort of astronomical observations and
laboratory spectroscopy. In the astronomical observations, the H3+ molecular
ion, the simplest polyatomic species which is produced abundantly by cosmic ray
ionization of H2, plays the central role. The large amount of observational data
accumulated for H3+, as well as for the diffuse interstellar bands in the
visible region of the spectrum, have revealed several new problems all related
to the basics of physics, chemistry, and astronomy. The laboratory and
analytical efforts are geared to solve these problems and provide new molecular
information for astronomical observations. The project will analyze the
thermalization of H3+ among the rotational levels, provide spectra of important
molecular ions and radicals, and attempt to analyze and reproduce laboratory
spectra for the diffuse interstellar bands. In terms of broader impact, this
work provides an excellent vehicle for the education of students across multiple
fields. At the same time, disciplinary boundaries are broken down in the attempt
to study two fields from a unified point of view.&lt;br/&gt;Support for this
project is provided by the Divisions of Physics, Chemistry, and Astronomy in the
Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.&lt;br/&gt;
