Foothill-DeAnza Colleges request support from NSF for connection of their
campus networks to BARRnet. BARRnet is the midlevel network located in the Bay
Area of California. It will provide operations management and information
services and it will give Foothill-DeAnza Colleges a 56 thousand bits per second
connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second)
National Backbone network. The Colleges needs greater functionality and network
speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers
along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system. Students and
faculty research will benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity
for the schools to explore innovative educational resources.
