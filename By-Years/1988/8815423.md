In the fish genus Poeciliopsis (Poeciliidae) all female clones coexist in
Mexican desert streams with males and females of closely related sexually
reproducing species. Past work has confirmed that genetically fixed differences
in the use of food resources and habitat space contribute to the coexistence of
sexual and asexual lines. The proposed study consists of two parts. (1)
Competition experiments within and between two clonal lines and a sexual line
will be conducted in artificial streams to test whether genetically variable
populations show lowered intraspecific competition relative to monoclonal
populations. Results from this study will shed light on the ecological advantage
of sexual reproduction. (2) Field studies will quantify natural densities and
relative frequencies of the two clonal lines and the sexual line. Results from
these collections will show the relative reproductive success of the above three
lines in a range of densities and relative frequencies. Such ecological studies
are necessary for increasing knowledge of the costs and benefits of genetic
variability in natural populations. However, this study also has potential
applied value as well. Genetically uniform populations can grow well in
controlled environments, such as well fertilized and well watered agricultural
fields, but are unlikely to perform as well in uncontrolled environments. Both
aquaculturists and conservationists are confronted with maintaining populations
in uncontrolled environments, and therefore need to understand the ecological
benefits of maintaining genetic variation in these populations.
