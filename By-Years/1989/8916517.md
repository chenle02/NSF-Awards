This research is designed to determine the structure of the enzyme proline
endopeptidase, an ubiquitous cell constituent. The enzyme plays a unique role in
the breakdown of proteins due to the special feature of the propyl residues
which have the properties of breaking alpha helices. One form of this enzyme is
membrane bound and accumulates in synaptosomes isolated from vertebrate brain.
It is possible, therefore, that the enzyme has a particular role in protein
breakdown in the nervous tissue. The goals of this project are as follows: 1) to
determine the structure of the enzyme through isolation and sequence analysis;
2) to identify the specific residues which are critical for enzymatic activity
and 3) determine which factors are involved in the heath-mediated conversion of
the enzyme in an inactive form.
