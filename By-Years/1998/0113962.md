The Archive of the Indigenous Languages of Latin America (AILLA) will be a web-
accessible database of audio and textual data from the indigenous languages of
Latin America, focusing on naturally-occurring discourse. Scholars, students,
and indigenous people will be able to access the AILLA database using their web
browsers, search and browse the contents of the database, and download audio and
text files from the database onto their own computers, which they can then
listen to or read immediately, using free, downloadable software. AILLA will
archive primarily unpublished and previously unavailable audio recordings and
texts, and both preserve them and make them easily accessible by creating a
centralized and organized repository of digitized copies of these materials. In
developing and implementing the database and web-browser interface, AILLA will
create a robust information infrastructure for use by researchers, students, and
indigenous peoples. It will also develop: search tools for comparative,
typological, and historical research on language; language data related
protocols including a metadata scheme, data structures, and applications; and
standards and tools to address ethical issues of privacy and intellectual
property rights for language materials on the web. The fundamental goal is to
create an infrastructure for distributed scholarship in language-related
disciplines concerned with indigenous Latin America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In
addition to making data available for basic research, AILLA will provide a wide
range of data for use in teaching courses in anthropology, linguistics, and
other language-related fields. It will facilitate the interchange of data
between Latin American, North American, and European scholars and between
scholars and indigenous communities, and will form an important new link in the
network of people working with the indigenous languages of Latin America. AILLA
will also be a resource for indigenous communities working to preserve,
maintain, and revitalize their languages.&lt;br/&gt;
