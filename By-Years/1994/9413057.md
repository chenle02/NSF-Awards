9413057 Theoretical and computational research will be conducted on the physics
of fractional statistics. The work builds on previous research on anyon
superconductivity and contributes to the physics of the fractional quantum Hall
effect. Three specific projects are proposed: (1) A quantum Monte Carlo study of
the metal-insulator transition for anyons; (2) The physics of a new quantum
number which is a measure of Hilbert space exclusion, that is, a generalization
of the Pauli Principle; (3) The application of a dissipative mapping to the
problem of stacking polytypes in metals and insulators. %%% This theoretical
research will focus on the study of particles with fractional statistics, that
is, particles unlike the common ones found in the real world. However, there is
evidence that these particles exist under special circumstances and may also
underlay other more common phenomena. This research will study the foundations
of these particles and study a number of their possible manifestations.
Additional effort will also be expended in investigating various complex
materials systems using a new technique derived from nonlinear dynamics.
