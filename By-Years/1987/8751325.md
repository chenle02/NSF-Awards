This three year collaborative between Emory University, Atlanta Public Schools
and IBM will develop a proto-typical model for teaching middle school teachers
to incorporate mathematical/computer microworlds into the mathematics
curriculum. Each year teams of three teachers from five middle schools will
participate. Thirteen of the 15 teachers will be minorities. The teachers will
participate in intense three day session at IBM, two half-day monthly meetings
during the academic year, and with on-site assistance of Emory staff, use the
computer microworlds in their regular mathematics classes. Five of these
teachers will be chosen to be mentors to the fifteen new teachers of the next
year. During the third year, the project will be taught by the Atlanta Public
School teachers and staff. Anticipated project products include curriculum
materials integrating microworlds into the matheamtics curriculum, teachers
development training materials, and complete descriptions of all project
activities so that the project can be replicated.
