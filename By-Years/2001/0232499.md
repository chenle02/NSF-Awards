This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a process
to significantly lower (up to 74%) the cost of forging dies, improve die life,
and at the same time lower the cost of forgings. The project method involves the
use of a near-net-shape manufacturing process, called the RCC process. This
process, once optimized for die applications, will be replacing several high
energy, expensive steps in the existing methods. The process allows localized
control of surface chemistry, which can lead to better metal flow and die cavity
filling, improved resistance to wear and heat checking. The process combines the
shape capability of investment casting with structural uniformity of full-
density powder metallurgy, and strength of forgings. The process has been used
successfully to manufacture several complex shaped superalloy, titanium alloy,
and stainless steel prototype parts. The potential commercial application will
be a new die making process. It is projected that an annual cost savings could
be as much as $1.2 billion if successful.
