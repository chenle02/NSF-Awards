A new class of regularizations is proposed for the classical Perona-Malik
equation of image processing, along with a modification thereof. It differs from
more standard regularization procedures in that it allows one to more finely
tune the regularization degree. It can be interpreted as a slight non-local
weakening of the standard nonlinear diffusion coefficient. The regularized
equations obtained in this way have desirable analytical properties such as
local classical well-posedness or the fact that piecewise constant functions are
stationary solutions. These properties are welcome from a practical image
processing point of view since they lead to discretizations which perform the
task of denoising remarkably well while avoiding the blurring common to standard
regularization techniques and the ``stair-casing'' phenomenon known to occur for
discretizations of Perona-Malik.

Partial differential equations have a long and successful history as
mathematical, quantitative models for the often nontrivial dynamics of a variety
of nonlinear phenomena of practical interest. Traditional application fields
include all branches of physics, chemistry and some subfields of biology. More
recently they have found a whole variety of new domains to which they can
contribute. Among them are econometrics, molecular biology, information
technology and a vast number of industrial and/or engineering problems. This
proposal deals with nonlinear diffusions and their application to image
processing. In the last two or three decades many mathematical models have been
successfully utilized to process raw digital data in the form of images obtained
by various devices of which medical ones are maybe a prime example. Often raw
data needs to be processed before it can be properly interpreted, like in
medical scans, sometimes one would like to be able to develop software to
automatically extract useful information from raw data without human
intervention, as in surveillance devices. In both cases methods based on the use
of partial differential equations have proven useful. The proposer and his
collaborator take on the task of furthering the theoretical understanding of
complex nonlinear systems and of enhancing state-of-the-art techniques based
thereupon of relevance in information technology and image processing, in
particular, but that are quite general in nature, thus opening the possibility
of applications to other fields, too.
