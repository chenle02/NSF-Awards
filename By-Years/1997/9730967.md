9730967 Sims Temporal constraints on mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) magmatism
both on- and off-axis are critically needed to better understand problems
associated with MORB petrogenesis and the processes of crustal accretion at the
MOR. At present, several fundamental questions related to the temporal component
of MORB magmatism remain unanswered, for example: 1) How does crustal residence
time affect the degree of crystal fractionation of MORBs and what is the time
scale of this residence? 2) Is MOR magmatism and crustal accretion focused at
the axis or is there a significant component of off-axis volcanism? To better
understand how the chemistry of MORB varies through space and time as a function
of source chemistry, melt generation and transport, and crustal fractionation we
will be measuring U-series disequilibria, major- and trace-element compositions
and isotopic compositions (Nd, Sr and Pb) in a spatially and geologically well-
characterized, two-dimensional grid of MORB samples from the 9 50'N area of the
EPR. Knowing the eruption ages for these axial samples is unique with respect to
most deep ocean basalt suites and eliminates a large uncertainty in the
interpretation of the U-series measurements. This zero age suite also provides
an important baseline from which to evaluate the off-axis samples whose ages are
not known.
