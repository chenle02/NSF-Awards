Selected shape memory alloys are synthesized using electrochemical deposition.
Three alloy systems are selected for the initial research, In-Ti, In-Cd, and In-
Pb. The structure and shape memory transformation behavior are compared to
conventionally-processed alloys. Layered shape memory Fe-Ni alloys are to be
produced in a modulated, nanolayer form using pulse plating. Characterization
methods include X-ray diffraction, internal stress measurement, scanning and
transmission electron microscopy, and Auger spectroscopy. %%% Electrolysis
offers potentially valuable synthesis capability, which has been improved with
recent advances in technology. Direct deposition in the form of thin films or
multilayer configurations can be used to produce unique materials.
