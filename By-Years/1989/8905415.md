The goal of this project is to design efficient algorithms for graph
optimization, recognition, and isomorphism problems. The research focuses on two
large classes of graphs: perfect graphs and intersection graphs. Techniques are
drawn primarily from graph theory, design of algorithms and computational
geometry. Experience has shown that many problems possess some mutual underlying
properties. The approach of this project in analyzing a problem is to consider
various representations of the graphs in interest and to develop decomposition
or reduction schemes for identifying the core of the problem. The intent is
either to conclude that most solvable cases of the problem adopts some well-
known techniques in a disguised manner or to discover genuinely new algorithms.
