***&lt;br/&gt;9732629&lt;br/&gt;Moncrief&lt;br/&gt;The main aim of this project
is to develop a rigorous approach to inhomogeneous cosmology on a wide variety
of possible spacetime manifolds and with a variety of physically interesting
matter sources and to investigate potential applications of this theory. As a
first step Vincent Moncrief plans to complete his investigations of the long-
time existence of large families of inhomogeneous, non-symmetric, vacuum
spacetimes which explode from a big bang singularity in the past and expand to
infinite volume in the future. These spacetimes, though representing certain
sufficiently small (though fully non-linear) perturbations of known reference
solutions, can have arbitrarily large spacetime curvatures in the early stages
of expansion. The next step will be to include a variety of interesting matter
sources in the analysis and attempt to extend the long-time-existence results to
non-vacuum solutions containing, e.g., electromagnetic and Yang-Mills fields,
perfect and Vlasov fluids and perhaps imperfect fluids of stable-causal
type.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will clarify the foundations of modern
gravitation theory and cosmology.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
