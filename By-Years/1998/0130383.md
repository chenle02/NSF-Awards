&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Quantum Computing with Superconducting
Qubits&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is exploring quantum computing based on
superconducting Josephson quantum bits (or qubits) coupled through microwave
fields. More specifically, the quantum dynamics of a Cooper-pair box with a
superconducting loop, as well as the flux-based qubit, in the presence of either
classical or non-classical microwave fields are being
investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The control of quantum coherent Rabi
oscillations in a superposition of two charge states, for both single-and multi-
photon processes are being studied. Under this project very novel quantum
computing schemes for Josephson qubits coupled through photons, including the
implementation of quantum communications between qubits is being investigated.
The local gate voltages and a microwave field can be used to control the device,
which should be scalable to at least 10^8 qubits. Thus ways to implement
scalable and well-controlled quantum computers, which are expected to be capable
of performing certain tasks which no classical computers can do in practical
time scales are being investigated. Indeed, the Cooper pair box is a viable
candidate for the implementation of quantum gates since it is a macroscopic two-
level system that can be coherently controlled. Finally, young researchers are
being trained in the fast growing area of quantum
computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
