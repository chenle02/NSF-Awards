We propose to create a Laboratory for Undergraduates in Computer Science where
students will be exposed to programming issues in a variety of real world
problems. The Laboratory will give students a basic understanding of real time
programming, distributed systems, communication, simulation, and graphics by
exposing the students to applications in robotics, computer vision, and 3D
modeling. Students will gain leadership skills and experience with project teams
by going beyond textbook exercises in areas such as computer hardware,
interfaces, distributed systems, communication, and real-time control. The
Laboratory will be used both for independent projects for undergraduates and for
assignments in specific courses, from the sophomore year through the senior
year, including senior and honors projects. The Laboratory will have a major
impact on the quality of Computer Science education by giving students access to
state of the art equipment they would not otherwise see until they find
employment. As has happened with recent improvements in our curriculum, this Lab
will have a major impact in higher education throughout the State of Minnesota.
We envision this Laboratory as a collection of reconfigurable workcells, each
equipped with cameras, manipulators, and other specialized devices, where
students can conduct a large variety of experiments. Equipment will be
standardized to simplify the reconfiguration of the workcells and for ease of
maintenance. We will acquire off-the-shelf equipment that can be used in
different combinations for a large collection of projects. This will increase
the flexibility in the use of the Lab and will easily accommodate student
initiated projects.
