The objective of this research is to lay the groundwork for establishment of
data and knowledge bases and tools to support strategic product design.
Strategic product design seeks to combine functional and manufacturing design of
a product, including life- cycle issues. The research will provide a needed
scientific basis for the growing move toward concurrent engineering which is
presently carried out by dedicated teams of experts with few or no computer
tools to aid them. Prior work has pointed to three areas where results are
needed and the means to achieve them are available: generation and evaluation of
alternate assembly sequences, combination of the above with economic analysis
and synthesis tools for designing assembly systems, design of test and quality
control strategies, and equipment selection and task assignment. This research
is based on the results of NSF Grant DMC- 8417949 entitled Computer-Aided Design
of Flexible Assembly Systems.
