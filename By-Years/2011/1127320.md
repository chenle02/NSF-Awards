The proposed work will advance scholarship on the statistical post-processing of
ensemble weather forecasts. Innovations are promised in several key areas:
efficient specification of the forecast problem and training dataset, the
possibility of automating predictor selection, the automation of the choice
between statistical models, the integration of quality norms derived from the
particulars of a given decision problem, the creation of an expert system to
define the underlying node structure of the multi-period decision value
calculation, and an automated algorithm for analyzing the meteorological and
predict and outcome training data to specify the parameters of each decision
node. The overall project goal is to develop and code these algorithms, and to
prepare a full technology transfer plan for the commercialization of the
system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will lay the basis for a wide
range of applications in which weather forecasts are fed directly into automated
decision systems. The approach envisioned will allow the value of fully
probabilistic forecasts to be exploited in scientific, data-driven approaches to
risk management across a wide array of weather-sensitive sectors, including
energy, insurance, tourism, transportation, aviation, construction, and public
safety.
