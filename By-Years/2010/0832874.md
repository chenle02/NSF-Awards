The University of Colorado Institute for Behavioral Science provides the
coordination and oversight for implementation of a group of research projects
designed to engage four-year college educational researchers with two-year
college faculty in research to foster deeper understanding of the context,
challenges and opportunities of technician education at two-year colleges.
Twenty researchers from eight institutions propose ten diverse, but
interrelated, research studies on program improvement, curriculum and materials
development, and crosscutting themes such as recruitment and sustainability in
the ATE program. Collectively the research represents various technical
features, including survey development and piloting, model development and
definition, and workshop and support materials development. The research is
coordinated and guided by the Research Review Committee made up of ATE Center
directors, educational researchers and industry representatives. The research
into practice should provide useful information for ATE projects and centers and
build capacity to do research in technician education.
