This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Plant
Biology. The applicant received his Ph.D. from Indiana University. His Ph.D.
research was on the molecular genetics of Rhodobacter. He plans to carry out his
postdoctoral fellowship research in the laboratory of Dr. Sam Beale at Brown
University. The proposed research entitled "Biochemical analysis of the Mg-
protoporphyrin IX monomethyl ester oxidative cyclase from Chlamydomonas" will
broaden the training of the Fellow into biochemistry and enzymology.
