This is a study of downsizing in the Russian military, part of a larger
comparative project to survey the social consequences of reduction in military
manpower in both the United States and Russia. An interview questionnaire will
be administered to 1,800 officers in the Russian Army, 1,200 of whom are about
to be separated from military service due to downsizing, and to their
approximately 1,440 spouses. The Russian officer sample will be drawn randomly
from military populations at and around bases that are closing and bases that
are remaining open. Topics to be covered in the interview include prior work
history, reemployment plans, financial hardships experienced, and such potential
consequences of downsizing as depression, drinking problems, and family
conflict. The spouse survey will ask questions both about the spouse's own
reactions to the transition and about how the solider is coping with the
process. %%% This study takes advantage of an historic opportunity to study
disruption in the life course of soldiers and their spouses whose livelihood and
community status are threatened by loss of military employment. Not only will
the results contribute to several branches of the social and behavioral
sciences, but the knowledge gained will be helpful to the governments of Russia
and the United States as they attempt in partnership with each other to reduce
the size of their military establishments and create a safer and more peaceful
world.
