ABSTRACT The object of this work in Phase II of this Small Business Innovation
Research is the construction and testing of an airborne version of a high volume
particle spectrometer for atmospheric research. This device will be used to
measure droplet spectra, and should be able to sense the larger drops which
existing commercial models systematically underestimate.
