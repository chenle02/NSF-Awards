One of the principal unsolved problems in modern astrophysics is the formation
and evolution of galaxies. Astronomers wish to understand when galaxies
&amp;#64257;rst develop, as well as how star formation evolves over the history
of the universe. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop a physical
understanding, informed by observations of galaxies in the nearby and distant
universe, of some of the main processes that shape
galaxies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigator and collaborators will
use new observations, including those with the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Plateau de Bure Interferometer
(PdBI), to study a number of topics that are required to improve our
understanding of galaxy evolution. In a multi-pronged strategy, the team will
study the evolution of gas fractions and depletion time scales in main sequence
galaxies during cosmic time, the mass dependence of gas fractions, the dominant
feedback and quenching mechanisms in field galaxies, the physics of galaxy
outflows, and the physical conditions in molecular clouds in low metallicity and
starburst galaxies. This research will lead to a greatly improved understanding
of galaxy evolution, with ALMA observations forming a central component of the
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will also work with the Graduate Resources
Advancing Diversity with Maryland Astronomy and Physics initiative (GRAD-MAP),
which is a program designed to lessen the barriers faced by minorities to enter
astronomy and physics graduate school. Finally, the PI will continue the
development of the Astronomy Workshop Extragalactic (AWE) website, which
provides a suite of online demonstrations of astronomical concepts.
