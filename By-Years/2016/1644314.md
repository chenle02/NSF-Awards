The purpose of this proposal is to convene scholars at a two-day conference to
closely examine validity-related measurement issues, create a guidelines for the
field of mathematics education research that addresses key ideas (e.g.,
validity, validity arguments, evidence for validity and measurement at-scale),
and set a clear pathway for scholars to discuss quantitative measurement within
mathematics education. Invitees will include a mix of young, older and diverse
scholars in mathematics education research. Products include refereed journal
articles along with a website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will engage the
Mathematics Education, Policy, Statistical, Psychometrics and other education
research communities in examining and critiquing measurement validity evidence
of mathematics education research with the long-term goal of increasing the
quality of quantitative inference in mathematics education research (to include
improvements in the training of doctoral students).
