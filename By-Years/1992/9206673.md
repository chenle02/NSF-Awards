Running and flying require a substantial increase in energy expenditures and
therefore a substantial elevation of respiration. Mammals and birds may have
evolved mechanisms to achieve these large increases in breathing with exercise
that minimizes the added cost of the breathing itself. The body of a bird is
full of air sacs that are used as bellows to move air in and out of their lungs.
The muscles and bones that are active and moving during flight may
simultaneously assist the movement of air through its respiratory system by
expanding and compressing the air sacs. This project will investigate the ways
in which the muscular activities of flying and breathing are coordinated. It
will provide insights into fundamental questions about the control of breathing
in vertebrates, especially during exercise. Comparative studies of different
species of birds and of different classes of vertebrates will also address
questions about the evolution of the control of breathing during exercise. Such
studies are also of value to those interested in human performance and
rehabilitation.
