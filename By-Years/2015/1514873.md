We have a new computational method (MELD) for predicting protein structures.
Unlike others, it is based on physics of atomic interactions. The power of
physical methods is that they help us understand how proteins perform their
biological actions as catalysts, motors, pumps, transporters and transducers of
energy and light. With such algorithms, computers can work hand-in-hand with
experiments to provide narratives of the microscopic mechanisms of biology. In
the past, physics-based structure prediction was much too computationally
costly. The power of MELD is in harnessing weak external knowledge in a way that
preserves the power of physical methods (satisfies Boltzmann's Law), and scales
up to tackle larger problems of biology than before. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our
work with MELD so far has shown that we can use atomistic molecular dynamics to
fold 15 out of 20 small proteins to their correct native structures, and to fold
3 small proteins with very high accuracy in the blind test called CASP11 (last
summer). No MD simulation can yet fold a protein larger than around 120 amino
acids. But, most biologically important proteins are bigger. We have shown that
MELD should scale well to larger systems. With this Blue Water allocation we
hope to achieve the computational folding of larger proteins. The code we use
and the way to implement it is already available in the public GitHub
repositories as a plugin to the popular OpenMM molecular dynamics package. With
Blue Waters' GPU resources, we hope to bring the power of atomistic MD to
folding and mechanisms that can tell some of biology's most interesting stories.
