This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project will develop a class of
new, stable, highly responsive Electro Active Polymer (EAP) hydrogel actuator
materials. Incorporating dendrimers (dendritic macromolecules) and hyper
branched polymers as chemical cross-linking agents into a poly(ethylene glycol)
(PEG)-based EAP hydrogel to increase cross-linking densities at low polymer
concentration will introduce systematic control of physical properties and
performance through structural variables provided by the dendrimer (e.g.
generation; end groups; branching ratio; subunit structure). Our research
objectives involve the preparation of dendrimer containing PEG hydrogels and the
investigation of dendrimer mole fraction, structure, and molecular weight on the
stability, strength, physical and responsive properties of the hydrogel
material. The new hydrogel actuator materials will enable low cost miniature
infusion pump technology. These actuators will be the pump mechanism of a
disposable (low cost), small patch like, device being commercialized by Medipacs
as the Mini Infuser. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Mini Infuser is a miniature,
disposable, programmable drug delivery device designed to significantly lower
the cost of patient care while improving a patient's lifestyle with increased
pharmacological safety, patient mobility and fewer needle sticks. Medipacs is
collaborating with the University of Arizona Chemistry Department to develop the
first generation commercial prototype in the Phase II project. Broad application
of this technology will impact and lower the cost of healthcare not only for
millions of infusion patients but also the industry providers. The projected
market in the United States alone is greater than $3 billion. The impact to
poorer regions though out the world is immeasurable; life-improving drug
therapies such as low cost continuous insulin delivery will be enabled and
become available for the first time to patients within these regions.
