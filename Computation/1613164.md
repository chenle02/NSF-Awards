In mathematics, point processes are pure-jump stochastic processes, which means
they are time evolutions that jump at random times and may have random jump
sizes. These processes are useful to model the complex systems that arise in the
study of sociology, biology, criminology, seismology, finance, and many other
fields. The most standard point process is the Poisson process that has
independent time increments, which means that future jumps are independent of
what has occurred in the past. However, one does not often observe independent
time increments in real-world data. For example, as seen during the 2008
financial crisis, credit defaults have a contagion effect -- a default of one
company can trigger more companies to default. In social networks, the
possibility for users to re-share the content posted by their social connections
may cascade across the system. In seismology, after an earthquake hits, the area
often experiences aftershocks. In criminology, gang-related violence has the
property that a murder or shooting by one gang often provokes retaliation by
another gang. All these examples have in common the self-exciting property: an
event can trigger more events to come. Self-exciting point processes, the
subject of this research project, constitute a class of point processes that can
describe such phenomena. Despite their importance in applications, many key
central facts are still unknown. This project will investigate the theoretical
aspects of self-exciting point processes, as well as their applications. It aims
to advance understanding of how complex and large stochastic systems self and
mutually excite, interact, cluster, and effect contagion. The results derived
from this framework will be applied to better understand the big data sets
arising from complex systems in the real world.

More specifically, this project studies a class of self-exciting point
processes, with a focus on the Hawkes process and its extensions, including the
nonlinear Hawkes process. To date, the limit theorems for this model are
restricted to large time asymptotics, and they have been well studied except the
multivariate nonlinear case, which will be investigated in this research. The
investigator intends to understand the large asymptotics on a fixed time
interval, which will be very useful in the context of many applications. These
large asymptotics will differ from the Poisson process and phase transitions are
anticipated. The investigator will also study the fluctuations and large
deviations of the mean-field limit of a multivariate Hawkes process when the
dimension is large, which is useful in applications to neural networks,
financial networks, and others. The project will also explore the spatial Hawkes
processes, the space-time Hawkes processes, and other types of self-exciting
point processes that have been suggested for modeling but still lack some key
theoretical results. The investigator also aims to study applications of the
self-exciting point processes, including theoretical applications to queueing
theory and to fitting these models to real world big data sets, which requires a
better understanding of some theoretical aspects of the simulations and
calibrations of self-exciting point processes.
