Over the last several decades, Arctic Ocean ice cover has become substantially
thinner and more prone to melting, extending the period of open water.
Associated with the loss of sea ice has been an increase in light penetration
and a dramatic rise in the productivity of phytoplankton. The PIs? primary
objectives are to determine the spatial distribution of large under-ice
phytoplankton blooms on the Chukchi Shelf and the physical mechanisms that
control them. The project proposed herein will utilize new data obtained from
both remote instrumentation (e.g. moorings and satellites) and an
interdisciplinary ship-based field program to gain a better understanding of the
physical/chemical conditions that favor under-ice bloom development as well as
the physiological adaptations that allow phytoplankton to flourish beneath sea
ice. Outreach and education components of this project include participation in
Stanford?s Summer Program for Professional Development for Science Teachers and
Stanford?s School of Earth Sciences high school internship program, a
compilation of professionally written short stories in the website by WHOI
group, and incorporation of results by CRREL.
