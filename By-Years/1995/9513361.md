This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in computer
architecture between Tao Yang at the University of California, Santa Barbara and
Michel Cosnard of the Laboratory for Parallel Computing at the Ecole Normale
Superieure, Lyon, France. Dr. Apostolos Gerasoulis of Rutgers University will
also participate in the project. The investigators propose to study symbolic
scheduling of tasks for parallel distributed memory architectures. Efficient
scheduling computational task execution and data movement is considered
essential to high performance computing on massively parallel machines and
workstation clusters. The U.S. investigators have developed scheduling
algorithms and software tools. This is complemented by French expertise in
techniques for automated parallelization of sequential FORTRAN programs. The
project takes advantage of a prototype system developed by the French research
group.
