This project will address the issue of inhomogeneity in the observed climate
record in several regions of the U.S., within 45 km of Huntsville, Alabama and
Central California. The method developed by the principal investigator makes use
of homogeneous segments of the surface air temperature data record, taking into
account the re-location of stations, and merging them into a single, homogeneous
time series for the Huntsville area. This method is also to be applied to data
sets at different altitudes in California. The approach will provide
mathematical rigor to a task which is often in danger of being subjective,
employing a matrix reduction method already developed by the P.I. A least-
squares fit to all the entries using an interative/cumulative technique will
generate the most probable, non-unique solutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
results of this work will be submitted to major scientific journals and
conferences. The mathematical method developed for this work (aimed at reducing
biases between proximate data stations) is expected to have applications to
variables other than temperature. The resulting records will add clarity to the
extent of changes in several localized temperature records spanning the 20th
century.
