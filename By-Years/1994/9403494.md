This SBIR Phase II award addresses laser crystallization of spin-on
ferroelectric thin films for applications in ferroelectric non-volatile random
access memories (FNVRAM). This process affords precise control of temperature in
fabrication of lead zirconate titanate (PZT) ferroelectric thin films on large
area aluminized silicon wafers. Commercial applications of the technology
included VLSIC manufacture and production of FVNRAMs, surface acoustic wave
filters, high speed packages, piezoelectric transducers, pyroelectric sensors,
and electronic and electro-optic devices.
