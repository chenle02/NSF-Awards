The present generation of resonant mass gravitational radiation detectors are
limited in sensitivity by the electromechanical transducers which convert the
antenna vibration to an electrical signal which may be analyzed to search for
candidate gravitational wave events. Professor Bocko is developing a
superconducting - radio frequency transducer in an effort to improve the
sensitivity of existing gravitational radiation antennae. The same transducer
scheme may be used to continuously monitor a very small, but macroscopic,
mechanical resonator he is working to achieve a sensitivity level at which one
may explore the quantum mechanical limits of weak force detection. The results
of these experiments may have a profound influence on quantum measurement theory
and will serve as a guide in the development of the practical applicator of
quantum measurement theory to ultra-low noise measurements.
