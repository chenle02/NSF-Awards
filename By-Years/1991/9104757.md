Insects, like mammals, use hormones to regulate their body functions. In
mammals, the digestive system is a major source of hormones. Increasing evidence
indicates that the insect digestive tract also secretes a large number of
hormones; the proposed study will focus on these. Preliminary studies suggest
that a hormonal factor from the midgut of the black blowfly, Phormia regina,
activates brain neurosecretory activity after the female fly has taken a
sufficient protein meal. The brain activity then leads to the completion of egg
development. The proposed study will provide comparative information on hormones
from insect as well as mammalian digestive tracts. It may also provide
information for future insect control programs.//
