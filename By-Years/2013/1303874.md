Global environmental change is an issue of major concern for Arctic communities
but there is little understanding of how these factors mediate longer-term
processes of social and cultural change. This dissertation research project
proposes to improve our understanding of the potential social and cultural
impacts of environmental change in the Arctic by relating short-term
environmental variability to different social and economic outcomes at the
household level. To explore these relationships, observational and weather
station data on short-term climate variability, on seasonal and daily scales,
will be used to analyze variation in the success rates of hunting activities and
in household expenditures for store food. These patterns will be further
explored by examining their articulation with different strategies of engagement
with the subsistence and cash economies, country food-sharing networks, and
household food security. The project will gather both qualitative and
qualitative data and has the potential to increase our insights into how rapid
environmental change is affecting social and cultural change.
