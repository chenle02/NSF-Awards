This award supports basic research in theoretical nuclear physics. A
reassessment of the pion-coupling constant will be undertaken and research in
relativistic nuclear many-body physics is proposed which will extend the Dirac-
Brueckner approach to nuclear collisions and will seek to include the density
dependence of meson masses and coupling constants.
