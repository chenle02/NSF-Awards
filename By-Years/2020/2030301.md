The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is an new way of imaging the entire chest and
lungs, a critical capability in assisting physicians treat COVID-19 patients.
Identification of COVID-19 patients with lung conditions enables accurate triage
to appropriate care levels. Current imaging modalities are limited: CT scans are
limited by logistics of patient flow, re-sterilization after use, cost, and
radiation risk; and conventional ultrasound cannot penetrate the full depth of
lung tissue. The proposed project will develop a portable ultrasound system for
bedside low-cost, non-invasive, highly accurate imaging of the lung, delivered
via remote streaming and control, for the complex logistics of COVID-19 patient
care.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase
I project will develop a portable ultrasound system for bedside non-invasive,
highly accurate imaging of the lung parenchyma, mediastinum, and pleura. This
project will develop core transducer components for integration into ultrasound
probes, creating a 2-D imaging probe using 1-D transducer arrays. These 2-D
arrays could ultimately be extended into a 3-D probe with full tomographic
capabilities. The project will demonstrate the capability for lung imaging with
sufficient quality to distinguish COVID-19 related issues without the need for
accurate positioning, alignment, or registration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
