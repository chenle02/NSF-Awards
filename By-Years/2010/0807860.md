The effort supported here will analyze data from the MOJAVE (Monitoring Of Jets
in AGN with Very Long Baseline Array Experiments) program, which consists of
multi-epoch, submilliarcsecond-resolution full polarization images of a complete
sample of the brightest known Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)jets. The work will
serve to enhance the scientific impact of the upcoming GLAST observatory
mission, by providing key physical parameters for large numbers of bright gamma-
ray AGN. The existing dataset will be augmented via several parallel programs,
including centimeter-wave radio monitoring, X-ray spectra and imaging, and
targeted optical and TeV monitoring campaigns.

The broader impacts of this work include making the data archive available to
the astronomical community, and training of students.
