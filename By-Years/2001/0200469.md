This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2002. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Effects of environmental change on a
generalist microbial pathogen: barley yellow dwarf virus in wild grass
communities." A major challenge for microbial biology is understanding how
environmental change affects microbes. Pathogenic microbes infecting multiple
host species are influenced by altered host community composition. This research
is testing how three other components of environmental change - nitrogen
deposition, decreased species diversity, and land-use change - interact with
host community composition to affect barley yellow dwarf virus, a generalist
viral pathogen of grasses.
