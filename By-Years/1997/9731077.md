ABSTRACT This project will develop the readout electronics for a mosaic of 96
CCDs. The design for the mosaic and readout system will be based on a successful
16 CCD mosaic developed for the QUasar Equatorial Survey Team (QUEST). The
larger camera, also to be used in the QUEST project, will improve on the
prototype in a number of significant ways, including improved angular
resolution, UV sensitivity, and the ability to extend the survey from +/- 6
degrees declination centered on the celestial equator to +/- 24 degrees.
