9617400 Watson This project will provide assistance to the NSF's PAEMST Program
by planning and implementing a meeting for the state coordinators for the
Program. The primary goal of the meeting is to provide participants with
opportunities to provide advice to NSF on the future of the PAEMST Program.
Specifically, the conference will: (1) promote more uniformity in the state
selection process; (2) increase the number of applicants to the Program
(particularly applicants from underrepresented groups); and (3) establish an
ongoing relationship between the state coordinators and the newly created
umbrella awardee organization.
