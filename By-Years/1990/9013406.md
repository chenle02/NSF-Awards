Recent oceanographic surveys by Dr. Charles Paull and others along the West
Florida Escarpment discovered cold water brine seeps that support chemosynthesis
in isolated biologic communities, and contribute to erosion at the base of the
carbonate platform. Evidence is mounting that the spectacular discharge of hot
vent waters along spreading ridges may be volumetrically dwarfed by discharge
along continental margins. Dr. Speiss has been awarded funds to conduct a Deep-
Tow survey in collaboration with Dr. Paull to extend investigations of suspected
brine seeps to the eastern side of Florida. Two regions will be surveyed: a salt
diapir on the continental rise off Georgia, and the base of the Blake-Bahama
Escarpment. The diapir breaches the seafloor, and will be examined to establish
the chemistry of pore fluids and sediments brought to the seafloor, and to
determine the effects of this discharge on local erosion and biology. The nature
of erosion will be examined along the precipitous Blake-Bahama Escarpment, and
the possible contributions of tectonic, bottom current, and chemical destruction
will be evaluated.
