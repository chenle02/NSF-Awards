The Principal Investigator will study the role of stochastic noise to
determine, in particular, whether the effects of small random perturbations can
accumulate to drastically alter the long term behavior of dynamical systems. She
will also investigate the relationship between the dimension of an attractor and
its Lyapunov exponents, and consider generalizations of Katok's theorem
concerning positive entropy and homoclinic points, to higher dimensions. Chaotic
systems such as weather models have the property that small errors in the input
data result in large errors in the prediction. But all realistic models must
incorporate noise. The Principal Investigator will answer technical questions
which focus on the effects of accumulated noise on the model's long term
behavior.
