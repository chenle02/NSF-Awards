The research of the planned I/UCRC for Advanced Vehicle Manufacturing aims to
integrate multiple universities and disciplines to advance research that is
intended to extend knowledge in the fields of smart assembly, logistics, and
process diagnostics through data analytics and statistical modeling. Moreover, a
better fundamental understanding of adapting emerging manufacturing methods and
advanced materials with environmentally friendly (waste, fuel, emissions)
vehicle designs will be explored. Research will also include an improved
understanding and integration of the health, safety, and environmental issues of
emerging manufacturing techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vehicle manufacturing is
a sector of significant economic impact to the U.S., especially to the
southeast. The Center intends to address the major challenges faced in advanced
vehicle manufacturing and in the process have a major economic impact. With the
cross-disciplinary expertise of the faculty and industry support, the center
will also provide opportunities for interdisciplinary education. Workforce
development and cross-training will be addressed through collaboration with a
consortium of community colleges that work closely with the auto industry. The
research team has significant involvement in diversity, veterans and K-12
outreach initiatives and the mentoring of graduate and undergraduate
researchers.&lt;br/&gt;
