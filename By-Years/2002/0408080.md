Studies of new gene origination provide insight into the mechanisms by which
biological diversity is created. Dr. Manyuan Long and James Emerson will employ
microarray technology to identify genes in the fruit fly that have originated so
recently that they have yet to spread through the entire population. Subsequent
analysis using comparative genomics will allow us to determine how new genes
come to be preserved. They will estimate the fitness effects of these new genes
by comparing data within one species (Drosophila melanogaster) to data between
species (D. melanogaster vs D. pseudoobscura). They will make the most accurate
estimate of the gene duplication rate to date, which will be the first such
study of new gene acquisition in any organism. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These
studies will influence human welfare: for example, duplications of resistance
genes frequently confer pesticide resistance, and gene amplifications frequently
lead to tumorogenesis. For this project we plan to train young scientists from
institutions that do not have access to facilities that allow such research to
be conducted.&lt;br/&gt;
