This project is for a planning grant to facilitate development of a more
extended comparative research project on the process of adoption in the United
States and Sweden. The project will investigate the connections between (1)
global market processes of economic exploitation (specifically the
commodification of poor and Third World children); (2) transnational legal
processes of juridical production and expansion (specifically the expansion of
legal ideologies and practices through the activities of legal practitioners
involved in handling adoption); and (3) local practices, epistemologies, and
policies surrounding adoption in the United States and Sweden. The planning
phase of the research will involve interviews with attorneys, social workers,
staff, and officials of adoption agencies and organizations in the United States
and Sweden to explore commonalities and variation in the assumptions informing
adoption practice and to develop more formal instruments for subsequent,
extended interviews. In addition, this phase of the research will involve a
review of appropriate literature on adoption, on legal practitioners, and on the
economic, cultural, and political contexts of adoption in each country. The
research will contribute to our understanding of theories of legal pluralism as
the interpenetration of global (world-system) processes with local knowledge and
practices. The approach will set in question the polarity of "official" law and
plural social fields by examining the ways global processes both appropriate and
are domesticated by "local" and regional processes.
