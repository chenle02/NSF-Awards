This proposal seeks to test whether secondary metabolite production can be
increased through: - the development of an understanding of the effects of
immobilization on biochemical and structural differentiation in plant cells, and
- the study of reactor design and operation for the growth and the effective use
of organ tissues for the production of secondary metabolites. Results from the
current project suggest that immobilization can result in a significant increase
in biochemical and structural differentiation. The PIs plan to test the role
that mass transfer gradients, cell matrix interactions, and cellular association
play in such responses.
