This proposal addresses the feasibility of searching out a "tell- tale" protein
of fruit maturation initiation. If positive the method will provide a totally
new tool, based on a factor known to be primary to maturation, with which the
orchardist, the storage operator and even the seller could determine the onset
of ripening. This tool could markedly reduce costs of storage and reduce losses.
The overall goal of Phase I research will be to produce polyclonal antibodies to
malic enzyme and post initiation protein No. 5. These antibodies could be used
to develop an immunoassay during Phase II which detects or quantitates changes
in specific proteins that occur in synchrony with or just prior to the onset of
the ripening process. %%% Production of antibodies against these ripening
specific proteins for development of a maturity test kit is highly desirable and
would circumvent the need for complex techniques involved in current maturity
programs, including various gas chromatographic analyses for ethylene.
