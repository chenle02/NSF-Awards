The genus Dasymutilla (Hymenoptera: Mutillidae) is a relatively large group of
parasitic wasps distributed predominantly in North America. There has not been
an extensive study of the genus since 1928, and even that study dealt only with
species inhabiting America North of Mexico. Less than half of the species
belonging to this genus are known from both sexes. The overall objectives of
this study are to complete a taxonomic revision of the genus Dasymutilla,
including correlation of the sexes of more species, updating of biological and
distributional data, providing current keys to the species for both males and
females, and phylogenetic analysis. The specific goals to be accomplished
through the funding of this project are: 1) visit appropriate museums and
university collections in order to examine the holotype specimens of the genus
Dasymutilla; 2) study the general collections of Dasymutilla in museums and
universities, noting geographic distribution, dates of collection, and looking
for specimens taken in copula; and 3) visit as many known collection sites as
possible, collecting specimens and biological data, especially for species for
which key taxonomic data are lacking.
