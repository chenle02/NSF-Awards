9412646 Meller The objective of this faculty internship project is to
investigate the use of decision models that integrate problems of design and
operation in an apparel distribution center. Two distribution centers are the
targets of the project. These centers are located in Alexander City and
Montgomery, Alabama. The models to be investigated will incorporate problems of
order accumulation/sortation, warehouse layout, and order picking. The reason
for the integration comes from the interactions between these problems in
affecting the performance of a distribution center. The project is in an area
that American industries face steep international competition. The results from
the project will be used by warehouse operators and managers to design and
operate more efficient warehouses and distribution centers that are more
responsive to time-based service issues such as just-in-time delivery and quick
order turn around time.
