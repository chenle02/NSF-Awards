Eukaryotic type I topoisomerase (topo I), by virtue of its ability to introduce
transient nicks into double-stranded DNA, has been hypothesized to provide
temporary swivels for such processes as DNA replication, transcription, and
possibly DNA recombination. The objectives of this proposal are to use a
combination of genetics and biochemistry to identify the functional domains of
the topo I protein and to elucidate the biological role of the enzyme in the
mammalian cell. A cDNA corresponding to the human topo I mRNA is available and
serves as the starting point for many of the proposed studies. Experiments are
designed to introduce specific mutation into the topo I gene with the aim of
identifying the minimum region required for enzyme activity. It is possible that
these experiments will, in addition, functionally distinguish the sensitivity to
the drug comptothecin from the catalytic activity. The possibility that the
N-terminal portion of the protein is important for targeting the enzyme to the
nucleus and for the association with other nuclear proteins that direct its
function in vivo will be investigated. Experiments are proposed to explore
further the basis for the preferential association of the enzyme with
replicating SV40 DNA. Using technology developed in the SV40 system, the nature
and basis for the association of the enzyme with cellular DNA will be
investigated. The long range goal of these studies is to understand the
relationship between the structure of the topo I protein and its role or roles
in the cell.
