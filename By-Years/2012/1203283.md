Doctoral Dissertation Research: Managing Teacher Labor Markets&lt;br/&gt;Ryan
Seebruck, University of Arizona,
Sociology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;I investigate the organization
of education labor markets: how teachers' careers are managed and the effects
this has on teacher distribution, school performance, and job satisfaction. I
compare the public and private education sectors in Japan since the former
features a centrally governed system characterized by compulsory teacher
rotation (jinji idou) while the latter features a locally governed system
lacking compulsory teacher rotation. I gather original data via a stratified
random sample to test the following hypotheses: H1, the presence of jinji idou
produces a more equal distribution of teachers (i.e., the public sector should
have a smaller variance); H2, the distribution of teacher quality will be
positively related to the distribution of school performance; H3, the presence
of jinji idou produces greater job satisfaction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts: This study could illuminate how the organizational structure of
education labor markets, particularly a teacher transfer system, affects
educational equality. This could benefit local and national societies by
complementing extant scholarship on educational egalitarianism and
organizational theory. Findings could provide an empirical basis for policy
makers to consider how the governance of teachers? careers affects educational
egalitarianism.
