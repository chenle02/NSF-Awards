It is planned to apply the dc SQUID (Superconducting Quantum- Interference
Device) to mesoscopic systems. The P.I.'s technique of "stochastic cooling" will
be further developed, beginning with studies of electron-phonon thermal
transport in mesoscopic samples. Studies will also be conducted of the
properties of a "mesoscopic atom" -- an isolated, submicron-size, normal-metal
ring.
