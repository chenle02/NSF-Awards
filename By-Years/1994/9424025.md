Dr. Jerry Adduci and other members of the Chemistry Department of the Rochester
Institute of Technology are being supported for a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates site in chemistry. For the period 1995-97, ten undergraduate
students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a variety of
research projects. The projects include a full range of chemical, theoretical,
biophysical, and instrumentation approaches to the advancement of polymer
science. A special feature of the program is involvement with local industry
through on-site seminar and plant visitations.
