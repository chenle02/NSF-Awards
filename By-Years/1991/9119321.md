This award provides partial support for a week-long conference of U.S. Embassy
Environment Science and Technology Officers in Washington in late September or
early October this year. The Environment, Science and Technology
Counselors/Attaches are key parts of Embassy country teams. They work in support
of USG interests as the focal points in Embassies on topics including
environmental, space, health, energy, nuclear non-proliferation, economic
competitiveness, oceans, population and other issues. They advise Ambassadors
and report and make representations on these issues. These officers also conduct
and manage bilateral science and technology agreements. OES has held such
conferences annually in recent years. They have proven to be highly successful
not only in updating the Embassy representatives on current developments, but in
providing Washington officers an opportunity to debrief them directly. The
conferences have also enlisted much attention and participation from the
Congress and technical agencies. During the last conference in 1989, the House
Science, Space and Technology Committee held a well-attended session with the
Embassy officers. The conference presents an important opportunity both for NSF
staff to consult directly with many of the officers with whom they deal and for
the Science Officers to improve their understanding of NSF concerns and
priorities.
