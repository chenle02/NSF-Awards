The emplacement of large, far-traveled Nappe complexes or thrust stacks are
common features of A-type collisions. Recently, extensional processes have been
shown to be active, at least during parts of the collision process. This project
will examine the deeply eroded roots of the Scandinavian Caledonides to study
the relations between a far traveled nappe complex and continental plate
subducted beneath. Mapping and laboratory work on the kinematics within this
zone, the geological relations between the allocthon and underthrust Baltic
Shield and the PTt evolution of the underthrust Baltic shield are the main focus
of this project. Results are expected to determine the involvement of the Baltic
basement below a thin zone of basement thrusting and to test the extent of
extensional displacement of the allocthon.
