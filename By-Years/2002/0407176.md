AST-0407176&lt;br/&gt;Cen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent observations from the
Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey together
suggest that the universal reionization may be prolonged and much more complex
than previously thought. This research will systematically study all of the
astrophysical processes relevant to the universal reionization and heating
process, to set up a working framework for proper interpretation of major
observations of the high redshift universe. Semi-analytic methods and state-of-
the-art hydrodynamical and radiation hydrodynamical simulations will be used
both for this, and to focus on gaining a fuller understanding of star formation
at high redshift. Informed comparison between observations and theoretical
predictions should help with working out the correct cosmological model.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will feed into a continuing outreach program
intended to enhance the scientific understanding of cosmological research by the
general public. Results will be visualized and presented through various
channels, including planetaria and public television. The technological demand
of the simulations will also test advances in high performance computing.
