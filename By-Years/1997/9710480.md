9710480 Mijovic This grant concerns a fundamental investigation of the dynamics
of dipole motions in crosslinking polymers. Dynamics of glass-forming materials
are currently a subject of considerable activity in the scientific community,
but no comprehensive study has been reported hitherto on the dynamic of systems
that undergo a temporal evolution of structure as a result of chemical
reactions. The advancement of chemical reactions alters the very nature of the
material and adds a new dimension to the study of dynamics of molecular motions.
Changes in the chemical composition, physical characteristics and morphology are
accompanied by a continuous variation in the time scale for segmental motions or
relaxations. When a signal (electric field in this study) is applied to a
polymer, a number of molecular segmental must respond in unison. That requires
cooperation on the molecular level, and hence the fundamental argument should
begin with the proposition that the relaxation processes are governed by
intermolecular cooperativity. The principal objectives of the research are to
investigate the changes in dipole dynamics during crosslinking and utilize the
results to: 1) describe the molecular origin of various relaxation process at
all stages during network formation; 2) formulate a methodology for relating the
chemical and physical state of the network to dipole dynamics; and 3) provide an
interpretation of network dynamics in terms of intermolecular cooperativity. %%%
The proposed methodology is of an interdisciplinary nature and will permit a
fundamental understanding of reorientational dynamics and intermolecular
cooperativity in crosslinking polymers. It is expected that the research, when
completed, will afford a molecular-level insight into the reorientational
dynamics of polymers that undergo a temporal evolution of structure as a result
of chemical reactions. ***
