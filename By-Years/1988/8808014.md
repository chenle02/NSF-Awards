The archaeological collections at the Museum of Anthropology, University of
Kentucky, contain over one million items, documents and photographs that are the
result of over sixty years of systematic scientific research. These
irreplaceable resources are important for understanding the development of
Native American society and culture in the eastern United States from the
Archaic period to the present. Due to past neglect, these materials are
presently unavailable for research and are rapidly deteriorating. The paper and
photographic documents that provide the all-important provenience information
needed to effectively use the collections are in immediate danger. To remedy
this problem, the staff will reorganize the 35,000 written field note records
and 33,100 photographic documents contained in the collection. Materials will be
inventoried, microfilmed or duplicated, and preserved in archival quality files.
The reorganization, curation, and preservation of these fragile materials will
stop their deterioration and make them accessible for anthropological research.
