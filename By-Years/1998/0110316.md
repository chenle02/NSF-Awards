This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and
test algorithms for active control of blade vibration and engine stability
(stall and surge) using an eddy current sensor (ECS) array. The approach
utilizes signal analysis and diagnostic tools in active control algorithms for
the detection of engine faults. Phase II will extend the functionality of the
ECS system beyond diagnostics to active and automatic real-time control of gas
turbine engines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An ECS array is currently the favored
sensor system for installation on the Joint Strike Fighter, in which a software
system upgrade capable of using ECS data to compute the necessary indicators and
estimate the disturbances needed is desirable for active vibration and engine
stability control. It would reduce the number of new sensors needed for active
control and potentially save millions of dollars. Large commercial markets are
indicated in commercial aircraft and gas turbine power plants.&lt;br/&gt;
