ABSTRACT DMS-9706793 Wang Wang proposes research in self-affine tiles and
tiling by inflation, dilation equations in several variables, and certain
problems concerning mathematical quasicrystals. Two scale dilation equations
arise in a wide variety of applications, including orthonormal wavelet bases and
subdivision schemes for computer generation of curves and surfaces. Self-affine
tiles are closely related to two scale dilation equations in the sense that the
characteristic function of any self-affine tile satisfies a two scale dilation
equation. While the study of two scale dilation equations in higher dimensions
has always attracted attention, the study of selfaffine tiling has gained
considerable momentum recently due to its applications in constructing
orthonormal wavelets and the growing interests in aperiodic tiling and
quasicrystals. Wang intends to study non separable wavelet bases in higher
dimensions, self-affine tiles, and mathematical quasicrystals. Orthonormal
wavelets in dimension two or more are extremely important for numerous
applications, especially in signal processing and image compression. In the
later case, for instance, a wavelet transform is applied to a given image and
compression is then carried on the transform. The wavelet used will be two
dimensional, as an image. Up to now, we have not had a good method to construct
these wavelet other than by multiplying two one dimensional wavelets. These
wavelets lead to subtle artifacts in the decompressed images such as jagged
diagonal lines and slight blackness. It is believed that those artifacts can be
reduced by using genuinely two dimensional wavelets. Wang has outlined certain
approach which may potentially lead to the construction of this kind of wavelet.
Recently Schechtman and others have formed metal alloys that have aperiodic
atomic structures, generating great interests among chemists, physicists, and
mathematicians in the study of quasicrystal . Wang proposes to study this
quasicrystals from the mathematical point of view.
