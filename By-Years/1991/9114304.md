This is a proposal for funds to support a symposium on applications of 3D
imaging and analysis in neurobiology. The basic correlations of morphology and
physiology as investigated by confocal light microscopy and three-dimensional
electron microscopy will be addressed. Ion imaging, such as calcium gradients,
will not be emphasized. The symposium meeting is in New Orleans November 10-15.
