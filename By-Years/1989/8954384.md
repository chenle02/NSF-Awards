Computer Graphics represents a new discipline in engineering curricula and a
significant new tool for Engineering Design and Drafting. The two week seminar
is incorporating 16 participants with the faculty continuing as their mentors
both during and after the completion of the seminar. The seminar includes
presentations, discussions, demonstrations and other forms of interaction
between participants and faculty that aid in teaching and research in the area
of Engineering and Computer Graphics. A follow-up meeting a year later at the
annual ASEE Conference will include presentations of research papers initiated
during the seminar and discussions of the course development efforts made by
participants at their home institutions. This project attracts, interests,
enlightens and initiates those experienced and promising undergraduate
instructors teaching traditional Engineering Graphics, needing motivation,
background and know-how in developing new Computer Graphics laboratories and
applying leading-edge technology to the teaching of modern, CADD-based
Engineering Graphics courses. Also, participants are motivated in becoming self-
reliant in making their own research contributions to the field of Engineering
Education. The home institutions are contributing the travel costs for their
faculty to attend the meeting.
