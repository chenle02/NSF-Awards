This project continues the development of new techniques to extend the operating
frequency range of ground-based laser interferometers. These interferometers are
primarily used in gravitational-wave research and other sensitive measurements.
The techniques involve use of laser beams to monitor and reduce the disturbing
effects of ground vibrations. They will allow ultra-sensitive measurements to be
performed down to lower frequencies than currently practicable.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The initial objective of the research is to facilitate ground-based
searches for gravitational waves from a wide range of possible astrophysical
sources, including black holes and rotating neutron stars. The same
interferometers may also eventually be useful as sensitive gravity gradiometers
to measure changes in local gravity arising from geophysical phenomena or
motions of other large masses. When sufficient sensitivity is achieved,
detection of gravitational effects of ground motion at distant earthquakes may
be possible. This may provide a signal slightly in advance of the arrival of
ground vibrations, and give a new tool for earthquake research.&lt;br/&gt;
