This award will support the development of a new monitoring array for measuring
energetic radiation associated with lightning. Recent observations have shown
that X-rays and gamma rays are produced by lightning, through mechanisms that
are not yet understood. These investigators will install an array for measuring
such radiation at the International Center for Lightning Research and Testing, a
facility operated by the University of Florida. The new instruments will be
placed around a tower at this facility where rockets are launched to trigger
lightning. The 32-element array will measure X-rays produced by dart leaders and
return strokes associated with rocket-triggered (and occasional natural)
lightning, and they will also monitor gamma rays and cosmic rays (which may be
deflected by the high fields present in thunderstorms). Complementary
measurements already made at the Center include electric and magnetic fields,
electric currents, and optical emissions. The combination of existing and new
sensors will provide comprehensive characterization of the electromagnetic
radiation from lightning. The new instruments, like the existing Center, will be
made available to outside users and visitors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expected
results from this development project include: new capabilities for
characterizing the broad spectrum of electromagnetic radiation from lightning,
including the poorly understood high-energy components; ability to collect
observations that document the nature of the breakdown process involved when
lightning is initiated and so constrain theoretical models of that breakdown
process; and support for an emerging new community of scientists interested in
these new phenomena. The installation of this instrument array at a widely used
center for lightning research will advance the study of newly discovered and
largely unexplored kinds of radiation produced by lightning and will also
provide opportunities for many investigators to integrate these observations
into their studies of the properties and nature of lightning.
