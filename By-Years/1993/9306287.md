Rubin works in the area of the arithemetic of elliptic curves and the Birch and
Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture. The major focus of the proposal is to generalize to
modular elliptic curves a new method discovered by Rubin which uses special
values of p-adic L- functions to construct rational points of infinite order on
rank-1 elliptic curves with complex multiplication. This is research in the
field of number theory. Number theory starts with the whole numbers and
questions such as the divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among
the oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for purely
aesthetic reasons. However, within the last half century, it has become an
essential tool in developing new algorithms for computer science and new error
correcting codes for electronics.
