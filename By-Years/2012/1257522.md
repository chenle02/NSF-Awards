The genomes (total cellular DNA) of flowering plants, including all crop
species, have undergone multiple rounds of whole genome duplication (WGD,
polyploidy). The availability of duplicated genes, combined with extensive
genome remodeling that follows WGD events, gives rise to a wide range of novel
traits. It is clear that gene expression mediates many of these responses, and
selection on gene dosage may drive gene family and network evolution. Yet
surprisingly little is known about how genome duplication affects individual
gene expression or the entire transcriptome (the combined expression of all
genes in the genome in a given tissue). This project will use a suite of novel
approaches to estimate whole transcriptome size and to assay expression changes
of genes across the genome in response to WGD. Several synthetic and recently
formed natural polyploids and their diploid progenitors will be studied in order
to determine both the immediate and longer-term effects of genome duplication on
gene expression. This project is of broad significance and impact because
quantifying dosage responses on a genomic scale will clarify our understanding
of how selection on gene dosage has shaped plant evolution, leading to important
traits in species of agricultural importance, such as soybean, whose close
relatives are the targets of this project. In addition, the project funds
opportunities for undergraduates to participate in the research, and facilitates
scientific collaboration between a major research university (Cornell) and an
undergraduate-only institution (Reed College).
