This project is developing contemporary physics activities, including a
laboratory component, in two courses for future teachers. In the laboratory the
future teachers complete in depth a variety of experiments in atomic, nuclear
and condensed matter physics. Parallel to the experiments the future teachers
study methods of teaching by exploring the use of simple equipment, analogies,
computer simulations and interactive video. The parallel approach of an in-depth
study coupled to methods of teaching the same material prepare future teachers
to teach modern physics.
