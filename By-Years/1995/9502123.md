9502123 Conway This CAREER type award is to support research in cord mechanics
applied to biomechanics and in composite structures. In particular the role of
helical construction of biological ligament and tendon structures will be
evaluated. Existing models of tires exclude some aspects of the helically wound
wires which may be important to their failure. The research will attempt to
provide better failure models for the tire industry. In addition report writing
assignments will be incorporated into the undergraduate design curriculae and
mentoring will be increased at the graduate level. ***
