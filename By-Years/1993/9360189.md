9360189 Weissman This research is to develop a constitutive law for binder-
aggregate mixtures that are used in pavements. These materials are in elastic
and develop ruts and cracks due to cyclic loads at elevated temperatures. A
nonlinear viscoplastic constitutive law with damage included will be developed.
This model will be based on micromechanical considerations and will take both
thermal and mechanical cycling into consideration. The model will be
incorporated into a finite element program to simulate binder- aggregate
pavement behavior. ***
