9732431&lt;br/&gt;Xiao&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the utilization of
atomic coherence effects and quantum interference between energy levels in an
approach to the design of an improved atomic clock. Experiments include studying
the noise properties of the interaction between electromagnetic fields with
different photon statistics and multi-level media and control of the statistical
properties of a strong light beam with weak light using electromagnetic-induced-
transparency effects.&lt;br/&gt;
