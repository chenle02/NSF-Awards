This project combines mathematical analysis and numerical algorithm design for
the solution of linear and nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs).
Algorithms will be incorporated in the scientific software library PETSc which
is widely used in the scientific community for physical modeling. These
algorithms are bscalable, and easily parallelizable, and thus useful for large
scale multidisciplinary simulations. Additionally the PI's research provides a
solid theoretical support for the algorithms.&lt;br/&gt; The PI's research
promises to have a major impact in several areas: computational fluid dynamics,
material sciences, and acoustic scattering. The PI and her collaborators plan to
publish archival articles on the new algorithms and also present results in
conferences. Graduate students at the University of Kansas are impacted through
the PI's plans to incorporate research results into her graduate level class on
numerical methods. This course is available to a broad group of students from
mathematical and engineering departments.
