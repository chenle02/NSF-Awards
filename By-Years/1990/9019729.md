Scripps Institution of Oceanography will upgrade a suite of bottom mounted
electromagnetic field sensors and bottom pressure gauges developed by Jean
Filloux and his group. These prototype instruments have been used in both
oceanographic and geophysical investigations. Their modernization will enhance
the instruments' reliability for future research applications. The upgrades will
incorporate advances in electronics and materials which have occurred over the
past years. Modern data storage capabilities will be added and acoustic releases
will be mounted allowing long- term deployments for up to 24 months.
Incorporation of new ceramic materials and electronics will also increase the
reliability and stability of the sensors. The upgrades acknowledge the
importance of EM measurements as a component of future ocean science
investigations including the Global Geoscience initiatives.
