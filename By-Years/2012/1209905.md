This action funds Yair Korenblit of Georgia Institute of Technology to conduct a
research project, entitled "Nanometer-sized manganese oxide: applications in
high energy density batteries," during the summer of 2012 at Ulsan National
Institute of Science & Technology (UNIST) in Ulsan Metropolitan City. The host
scientist is Dr. Jaephil Cho.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in continued development of
low-cost catalysts for metal-sir batteries to compare with such expensive and
unsustainable catalysts as platinum-carbon composites. These substitutes are
made by adding a pseudo two-dimensional catalyst on a conductive substrate.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
