This research will examine new methods of using light to manipulate matter, from
individual atoms, to small but macroscopic objects. The research has three main
objectives: (1) To enhance the basic understanding of the processes that govern
the manipulation of matter by light. (2) To apply understanding toward the
creation of permanent structures which are scientifically and technologically
useful. (3) To accelerate understanding by providing for a close collaboration
between diverse groups, and enhance the human resource base. ***
