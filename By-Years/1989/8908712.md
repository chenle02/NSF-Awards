Medium-term Research: Theoretical Computer Science at Hebrew University This
award recommendation is made under the Program for Long and Medium-Term Research
at Foreign Centers of Excellence. The program is designed to enable young U.S.
scientists and engineers to conduct long-term research abroad at research
institutions of proven excellence. Awards provide opportunities for the conduct
of joint research and the utilization of unique or complementary facilities,
expertise and experimental conditions in foreign countries. The award will
support Dr. Joel Friedman, Princeton University, for a five-month visit with
Prof. Avi Wigderson, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel. The award
recommendation provides funds to cover, as appropriate, international travel,
local travel abroad, stipend, dependents allowance, if applicable, and a flat
administrative allowance of $250.00 for the U.S. home institution.
