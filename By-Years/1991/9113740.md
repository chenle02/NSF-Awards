The PI's prior work on an essential problem in geophysical fluid dynamics
showed that a randomly turbulent mean flow can self- organize into slowly
varying zonal jets with flanking patches of high-frequency smaller scale eddies
("storm tracks") under certain conditions. The principal requirement is that the
fluid contain vertical and horizontal shears of flow and temperature differences
that combine to provide a particular type of instability often found in real
atmospheres and oceans. This realistic behaviour developed, and was maintained,
in a model with a highly idealized set of theoretical restrictions. His proposed
strategy is to gene- rate a small suite of less restricted, but still highly
abstract, models by judicious removal of carefully selected simplifications.
These would be chosen to illuminate the specific model properties responsible
for producing these realistic features as well as for limiting their degree of
verisimilitude when compared with planetary-scale atmospheric and oceanic
circulations. Another stated purpose is to test the robustness of the
verisimilitude already achieved, and to demonstrate that this degree of realism
is not an artifact of the mathematical simplifications imposed in earlier
models. Such stepwise building of basic understanding will contribute to future
advances in extended-range forecasting and climate modelling.
