A national glass fiber network to serve 100 million households with two-way
symmetric data communications service at 100 Mb/sec per household will
inevitably be constructed during the next few years. The barriers to the
creation of such a network are not simply questions of deployment issues or the
cost of the network. Rather, fundamental innovations will be required in the way
networks are organized and managed.

The project uses a three pronged approach to investigate the possibilities and
technical consequences of this once-in-a-century event.: (1) a holistic network
architecture designed from first principles, (2) interdisciplinary fundamental
research that addresses the design of an economical, robust, secure and scalable
100x100 network, and (3) proof-of-concept network implementations to demonstrate
how the network of the future can be built.

The results from the project will take several forms. First, the blueprint for
the 100x100 network will offer a coherent intellectual framework on how the next
generation network could be built. The resulting architecture and design can
serve as a compass to guide investment in network development, and will be
disseminated to government and industry through presentations and partnerships.
Second, in preparing the 100x100 blueprint, fundamental research advances will
be made in security, economics, protocol design, switch architecture, and
network management. These will be disseminated through the research community.
Third, the physical testbeds created through the project can be used as a
platform for further studies, for example, the development of applications
demanding high bandwidth or social science research on the impact of
connectivity in the home. Forth, the software and tools used to design and
validate the 100x100 network, particularly the emulation systems, will be used
to create new curricula for network education for two- and four-year colleges.
