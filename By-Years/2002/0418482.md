POLITICAL BUDGET CYCLES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This purpose of this project is to
study fluctuations in fiscal policy&lt;br/&gt;induced by the election cycle from
both a theoretical and empirical&lt;br/&gt;perspective. Conventional wisdom is
that incumbents use economic policy,&lt;br/&gt;especially fiscal policy, before
elections to influence electoral&lt;br/&gt;outcomes, with electoral
considerations often seen as a key factor in&lt;br/&gt;policymaking around
elections. Among economists, however, opinion is&lt;br/&gt;divided. One view is
that fiscal expansion is indeed used in election&lt;br/&gt;years in many
countries to generate desired economic and hence electoral&lt;br/&gt;effects,
the other is that fiscal manipulation is punished rather than&lt;br/&gt;rewarded
at the polls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent work of by the PI suggests that the
nature of political budget&lt;br/&gt;cycles depends on the experience of the
voters with the electoral&lt;br/&gt;system. What accounts for these differences
between new and established&lt;br/&gt;democracies? Is deficit spending
electorally rewarded in the first group&lt;br/&gt;but punished in the second?
What are the characteristics of new&lt;br/&gt;democracies that may explain the
strength of the budget cycle. &lt;br/&gt;Especially important here is the
information voters have about fiscal&lt;br/&gt;magnitudes. Drazen proposes
several ways to measure this, including fiscal&lt;br/&gt;transparency indices.
The project will attempt to compare this&lt;br/&gt;explanation with others, such
as the fluidity of voting patterns or the&lt;br/&gt;greater amount of rent-
seeking that it is argued may characterize new&lt;br/&gt;democracies. The
project also studies why experienced voters respond to&lt;br/&gt;election-year
economics, focusing on the importance of the amount of&lt;br/&gt;information
they have when they enter the voting booth. &lt;br/&gt;
