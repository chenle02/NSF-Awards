The chemistry department is purchasing two relatively inexpensive graphics
workstations for use in its undergraduate curriculum. Sophomore students in
Organic Chemistry Laboratory are being instructed in molecular modeling by the
molecular mechanics (force field) procedure. Two new experiments, the
stereoselective reduction of 4-t-butylcyclohexanone by kinetic and equilibrium
methods, and the metathetical polymerization of dicyclopentadiene, are being
used to show students how these calculations can help rationalize laboratory
results. Molecular mechanics, semi-empirical and ab initio MO methods, and
density functional methods are being used in two different senior Capstone
Experiences which are part of the recently adopted plan for liberal education
reform. One of these is a course in the theory and practice of ab initio MO and
density functional methods. The other course is an independent research Capstone
which involves modeling of enzyme-substrate interactions, nitrenium ion
reactions, or conformational preferences of tetrahydropyran derivatives.
