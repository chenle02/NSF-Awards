Abstract

This proposal was received in response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering
initiative, NSF 03-043, category NIRT. The project will explore biological
nanoarchitecture and apply this knowledge to create ordered arrays of quantum
dots and semiconductor nanowires. The focus of the research is on S-layers,
self-assembling protein arrays found in bacteria. Learning from self-assembling
biological nanostructures such as S-layers will provide a framework for novel
approaches to fabricating nanometer features over a large-scale area, which
remains a major challenge in nanotechnology. Moreover, the successful
fabrication of nanostructuresbio-templated using S-layers will provide a unique
opportunity to study collective quantum effects.

The future of nanoscale devices will depend upon the discovery of an increasing
array of novel materials which have robust properties and can be vast number of
materials and along with a systems engineering approach these materials can be
vastly improved. Bioinspired nanoarchitecture will find utility in existing
devices and also spawn a new generation of devices with functionalities that
have yet to be fully realized with existing materials.
