963330 Sample The study will attempt to characterize the temporal and spatial
evolution of sources of pore fluids in SOP sites 891 and 892 on the Cascadia
accretionary prism. Various mass spectrometric techniques will be used to
characterize the chemical and isotopic composition of authigenic carbonates on
microdrilled samples across large vein and vug linings. The samples will be
dated radiometrically through Th230 method.
