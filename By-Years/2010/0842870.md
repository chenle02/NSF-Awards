This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Present knowledge on what processes
are necessary for organ regeneration is highly limited. This project uses an
animal with striking regenerative capacities, the sea cucumber, to probe at the
genes and signal pathways that are associated with regeneration processes. The
working hypothesis is that some of the identified genes (and their associated
signal pathways) are important players in the regeneration of the intestine and
that by studying them the mechanisms involved in the control of regenerative
processes will be discovered. The project focuses on genes that are known to be
involved in embryonic development and cell death in order to define their role
during regeneration of the intestine. The results will advance our understanding
of organ regeneration and in particular on the limits that might be encountered
in humans and higher vertebrates. The work will take place at the University of
Puerto Rico, a Hispanic serving institution. Most of the participating students
are underrepresented minorities and women. Thus, the project will impact the
training and professional development of underrepresent groups in science.
