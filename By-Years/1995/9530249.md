OCE 9530249 Brown This project will investigate atmospherically forced, winter
convection in the Gulf of Maine and consider the relative importance of wind and
convection in mixed layer deepening. Both the general process of winter
convection and the specific issue of Maine Intermediate Water formation will be
addressed. Two field experiments, including moored arrays and hydrographic
surveys, will be conducted during consecutive winter seasons. The experiments
will determine the scales of convective overturning, the relationship between
mixed layer variation and surface fluxes, and the relationship between
convection history and the volume of winter water produced in a season.
Observations will also be used to assess the fidelity of a numerical model of
convective plumes.
