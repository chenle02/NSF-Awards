We propose to explore design, control, and motion planning for robotic parkour
---the highly dynamic form of locomotion that includes ascending chutes by
leaping back and forth between opposing walls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our broad
goal is to give robots access to difficult-to-reach places by taking full
advantage of their dynamics and the potential reaction forces afforded by the
environment. The proposed work will address two challenge
problems:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. To design, build, and control a planar robot
to dynamically climb in a rigid vertical chute, and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. To
design, build, and control a planar robot to reliably move from an initial state
to any dynamically reachable goal state in a complex vertical environment of
footholds at various orientations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The true goal of this
work is not to build speci&amp;#64257;c-climbing robots, but rather to address
scienti&amp;#64257;c issues fundamental to dynamic legged locomotion in non-
trivial terrains by confronting these two challenges.
