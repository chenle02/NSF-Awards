Database systems that facilitate the storage and analysis of data are the
backbone of modern data-intensive applications, from machine learning to the
Internet of Things, and represent a significant market force with an estimated
worldwide market value of over 50 billion USD. Many new database applications
demand fast complex analytics over changing data. However, the slowdown in the
growth of hardware performance, coupled with the continued increase of data and
data-intensive applications creates a crisis, as existing database systems are
not well suited for applications that want to trade-off performance and resource
efficiency. To address this gap of queries over fresh data with controlled
resource utilization, a new database system paradigm is
needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award investigates a new query execution
paradigm, Intermittent Query Processing, to answer the question: how should
database systems provide low latency for ongoing queries with bursty data
arrival or periodic queries while minimizing resource utilization? This
framework allows a query to initially execute as a batch, with subsequent
intermittent processing to update the result while minimizing the resources
required to update the query result by selectively persisting artifacts from the
initial query execution and by exploiting knowledge about expected data arrivals
and models for how amenable a query is for incremental computation. This project
will investigate methods for predicting query and data arrivals, scheduling and
placement decisions for workloads where queries partially overlap, opportunities
for state sharing, resource allocation, and new query optimization
techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
