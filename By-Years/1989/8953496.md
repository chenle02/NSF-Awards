A set of computer programs that permit calculations for : (1) reactor design and
(2) fluid mechanics, heat and mass transfer, and their combination, with easy-
to-use post-processing graphical output. The software also allows the
calculation and graphical display of sensitivity of the results to the
parameters of the problem. The programs will facilitate improved understanding
of basic chemical engineering phenomena by the student, an increased ability to
think while developing and testing computer models, and more realistic design of
reactors. The grantee institution is contributing funds to this award.
