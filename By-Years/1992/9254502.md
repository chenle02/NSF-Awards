This is a proposal to hold the Eighth Annual EPSCoR Conference in Las Vegas,
Nevada on October 14-15-16, 1992. The proposal presents a reasonable conference
organized to 1)inform individuals capable of producing short-term systemic
changes; 2) provide a format to discuss, examine, and critique ideas and
activities which "work" in EPSCoR states; 3) examine new modes of inter-
university collaboration and working relationships; 4) discuss new ways to
stimulate interaction between the research and educational community; and 5)
provide additional travel to the EPSCoR science and private sector community to
broaden the base of participation and interaction. Travel stipends will be
provided for five additional participants from each EPSCoR state to attend.
Conference proceedings will be a new significant product.
