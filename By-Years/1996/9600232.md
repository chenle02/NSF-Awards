9600232 Redner This Americas Program award will support collaborative research
between Dr. Sydney Redner, Boston University, and Dr. Francois Leyvraz, UNAM,
Cuernavaca, Mexico, on the dynamics and resulting spatial organization of dilute
inelastic gases. The project has three distinct parts: development of
qualitative methods to understand the dynamics and clustering phenomena of
inelastic gases, studies of the spatio-temporal behavior of a simple exothermic
reaction model, and introduction and investigation of simple models of
cooperative and competitive behavior that may lead to analytic advances. The
problems to be studied are relevant to current studies in the theory of complex,
non-linear systems. The research will lead to significant increases in our
understanding of important technological processes and involves novel models
that are of interest and potential relevance to the social sciences as well. ***
