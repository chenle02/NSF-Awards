As the ocean observing community moves forward into the next phase of IOOS,
federal agencies remain committed to cooperating among themselves and with
partners throughout the ocean community. Coordination among the federal agency
partners will remain the responsibility of the (IWGOO) along with NOAA as the
designated lead federal agency for IOOS. The IWGOO is a formal chartered body,
and will see IOOS through this transition period. The IWGOO decided that some
Ocean.US activities would continue under the leadership of the IWGOO. This
proposal requests funds for partial support for the Interagency Working Group on
Ocean Observations (IWGOO) Support Office hosted at the Consortium for Ocean
Leadership.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interagency collaboration is essential to achieve
ocean science and technology priorities and, in particular, for planning and
coordination of an ocean observation system. The IWGOO support office provides
administrative assistance the federal agencies on all of the IOOS planning
activities. &lt;br/&gt;
