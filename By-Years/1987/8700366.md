Several forms of intracellular transport, or movement, which are essential for
normal cell growth and function depend on linear intracellular elements called
microtubules. One example is chromosome movement during cell division; another
is the transporrt of neurotransmitter-containing vesicles from one end of a
nerve cell to the other. Two molecules have been described which serve as
"molecular motors;" i.e., which are able to convert the chemical energy of ATP
into mechanical force associated with the microtubules. One is called kinesin,
and the other is called dynein. The objective of this proposal is to test the
idea that an unusual form of dynein found in sea urchin eggs is the motor for
microtubule-associated motility in this system. The specific goals of the
project are: first, to obtain specific antibodies against the sea urchin egg
dynein and use these to localize and quantitate dynein during embryonic
development; then, to obtain a DNA clone for the sea urchin dynein using
recombinant DNA techniques, and to use this clone as a probe to determine
whether there are multiple, and possibly even tissue and stage-specific dynein
genes. The anticipated results will add new and important information regarding
the molecular basis of microtubule-based motility.
