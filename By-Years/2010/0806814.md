This project providing scholarships to ten academically talented and financially
needy students majoring in biology, chemistry or physics is increasing the high
technology workforce of the Appalachia region. These scholars join twenty five
computer science and mathematics scholars being supported under a concurrent
S-STEM project at the institution. The students are participating in
interdisciplinary seminars and projects being led by faculty mentors from the
five cooperating STEM departments. These activities coupled with a wide array of
student support services are enabling the students after graduation to pursue
advanced degrees or find employment in regional high technology companies.
