This award supports a unified program of research and education in parallel
input-output systems for high-performance computing. Research activities will
include development of tools for I/o performance evaluation, applying the tools
to characterize I/O performance of scientific codes, and provision of compiler
support for parallel I/O. Educational activities span the needs of graduate and
undergraduate students, and include outreach to K-12 and the community. These
include development of a graduate course, augmentation of undergraduate
curricula, and workshops for participants outside the university.
