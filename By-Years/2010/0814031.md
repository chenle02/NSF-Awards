ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and the
University of Washington propose a conference, conference proceedings, and book
that will build capacity and new collaborations at the intersection of the
learning sciences and informal science education. These activities continue to
expand on the outcomes of several recent conferences, publications, and projects
related to research on the learning sciences and their application to varieties
of educational settings. Fifty participants in this initiative will include both
emerging and established researchers and practitioners, as well as international
professionals. &lt;br/&gt;
