This is a theoretical analysis and laboratory study of social exchange, based on
an expected value model of social power. In this model a power structure
indicates opportunities for exchange relations and a sample space of exchange
networks. The approach incorporates a micro-model of bargaining that predicts
exchange outcomes in each of these possible exchange networks. When drawing on
observed relative frequencies of exchange networks (such as arise during
repetitive trials of an experiment), the expected value model currently provides
the most accurate account of the distribution of benefits among actors in
exchange networks. However, the model does not predict the relative frequency of
exchange networks that may arise during the exchange process and, in one
instance, it fails to account for the observed distribution of exchange payoffs.
The model now has been elaborated to include an account of the incidence of
exchange networks, and it addresses the anomalous finding reported in the
literature. The present project will assess the elaborated model both
analytically and empirically, in comparison with a competing graph-theoretic
model, employing a set of networks that have not been previously examined in the
literature, for which the two approaches make markedly contrasting predictions.
%%% This is fundamental research on exchange, bargaining and power in social
networks, an area of research that is rapidly coming to a clear consensus about
the mathematical laws that describe a range of important phenomena. Rigorous
understanding of the dynamic and structural factors that influence the
concentration of social capital in real-world networks of exchange depends upon
working out the abstract relationships in theory and laboratory experiments such
as conducted in this project.
