BIOTECHNOLOGY WORKS! University of Southern Maine P. I. Libby Cohen
Biotechnology Works! recognizes the National Science Foundation's priority to
facilitate the participation of persons with disabilities in mathematics and
science. During two summers and two school years (1996-1998), this project will
demonstrate that an existing curriculum for high school students in
biotechnology can be adapted for students with disabilities. In addition, the
project will demonstrate that high school teachers, who work along side their
students, are able to modify their instruction and laboratories. Specifically,
the project staff will: 1) offer intensive sessions in biotechnology, and
mathematics that are related to biotechnology, for students in grades 10-12; 2)
train the students' high school biology teachers to adapt high school science
coursework in immunology and genetics for students with disabilities; and 3)
disseminate project information and products. The project goal is to demonstrate
that students with disabilities can participate successfully in existing high
school level biotechnology educational activities that have been modified and
adapted to meet their needs. Ten teachers and 10 students with disabilities will
participate in the project which will be offered in three locations: the
University of Southern Maine, Foundation for Blood Research, and the Maine
Medical Center. This will give the students and their teachers the opportunity
to work in real laboratories with scientists. ***
