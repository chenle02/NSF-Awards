This is an investigation of the extent to which parallelism can be used to speed
up the execution of certain software development tasks. Parallelism is becoming
commonly available in software development environments, in the form of
multiprocessor workstations or in the form of networks of (uniprocessor)
workstations. This research attempts to capitalize on the availability of
parallelism to speed up existing software tasks as well as to contemplate the
use of more ambitious software tools. Concentration is on software tools for
performing language translation, including traditional programming language
translation with optimization, as well as text formatting, proof checking and a
variety of other software tools that can be viewed as implementing the
translation of a context-free language. These language translation problems are
specified as attribute grammars. These provide a high-level, functional
specification of the translation process which allows the automatic construction
of efficient parallel translators. There are three principal issues: 1.
Strategies for efficient parallel attribute grammar evaluation and their
performance relative to sequential evaluators and more traditional compilation
techniques. 2. Specification of various global compiler optimization techniques
in an attribute grammar framework. 3. An assessment of the generality of
attribute grammars for specification of various problems not related to
traditional programming language translation, including extending their use for
specifications of computations on graphs rather than on trees.
