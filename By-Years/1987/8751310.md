The goal of the proposed project is to work with a group of forty-five
accomplished secondary school mathematics teachers who have responsibilities to
provide mathematical experiences for gifted secondary school students in their
home districts. Topics in advanced mathematics that are closely related to
modern research results are expounded by world renown mathematicians in a
companion project for the high school students and which is funded from outside
sources. The teacher participants attend the lectures and discussion groups and
learn about the mathematical topics as well as approaches that they could use in
their home districts to offer some of the ideas to gifted students. The
participants observe the students in the companion workshop and analyze the
interaction between the students and the modern mathematical ideas.
