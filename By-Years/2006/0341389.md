Interdisciplinary (99) In this proof-of-concept project a team of Imaging
Science faculty is developing a set of learning and teaching modules to support
a new interdisciplinary course, "Imaging in the Physical Sciences", that
introduces first-year university science and engineering students to the basics
of imaging systems and imaging applications. The "imaging chain" - observation,
data capture, processing, display, and perception - provides both motivation and
context for the study of concepts in physics, chemistry, materials science, and
mathematics. A comprehensive textbook with teacher's and laboratory manuals is
also planned.
