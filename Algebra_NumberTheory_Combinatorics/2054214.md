The project focuses on two of the most accessible areas of mathematical
research: combinatorics and number theory. Generally and broadly speaking,
combinatorics focuses on counting objects that are hard to count directly, and
number theory studies the rich properties of whole numbers. The proposed
research aims to increase even further the use of combinatorial arguments in
studying questions in number theory. The project also has an educational
component, on training the next generation of mathematicians and advancing
scientific literacy and public engagement with science. The project will support
the activities of the Math Team of a local Title I High School.

The intertwined areas of arithmetic and geometric combinatorics are the focus of
this proposal. Three groups of related open problems will be investigated. The
first concerns the size of sets whose Minkowski sums is contained in the group
of non-zero quadratic residues modulo a given prime. The second investigates
distance and sum-product questions for large subset of finite fields. The third
is on obtaining a characterization of sets that exhibit near maximum growth
under repeated set addition.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
