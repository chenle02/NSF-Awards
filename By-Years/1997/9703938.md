9703938 Allen This award provides funding to enhance technology transfer
operations between university laboratories and the private sector in Vermont.
The Vermont Technology Council has established four Centers of Excellence as
part of the state Science and Technology Plan and funding is provided to help
bring three exemplary research projects from three of these Centers to fruition
and commercialization. The three projects are 1) utilization of whey-based
edible film technology, 2) development of a reagent kit and instrumentation for
rapid determination of platelet activation thresholds (of use for various
clinical cardiovascular applications), and 3) development of a thin film blister
testing system for microelectronics manufacturing. Salary support is provided
for a technology transfer assistant to Dr. Paul Huyffer, Executive Director of
the Vermont Technology Council and recently appointed University of Vermont
Special Assistant for Economic Development. Emphasis on facilitating technology
transfer is expected to strengthen partnerships between university researchers
and industry and contribute to economic growth and development for Vermont.
