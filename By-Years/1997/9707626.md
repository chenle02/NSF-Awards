This project is designed to study the evolutionary history of Arctic Brown
Bears (Ursus arctos) in Southeast Alaska as means of understanding the general
biogeography of arctic vertebrates. The PI proposes to construct nuclear
phylogenies from 1) introns of two aldolase genes, and intron of a histone gene
and an exon from the major-histocompatibility-complex, DQa gene; and 2) the sex-
determining region (Sry) and the last intron of the zinc-finger locus (ZFY) on
the Y chromosome. These loci do not recombine yet have a high rate of
interspecific variation, and thus provide a nuclear paternal analog to the
cytoplasmic, maternally inherited system previously described by the PI. If
nuclear DNA diversity between polar bears and brown bears exceeds diversity of
mtDNAs of brown bears alone, mtDNA paraphyly via hybridization would be
indicated. If nuclear and mitochondrial phylogenies are congruent, paraphyly via
emergence from a common ancestor would be indicated. The results of this
research will indicate the relative roles of geographic isolation, biogeographic
patterns, and philopatry in the development of endemic taxa.
