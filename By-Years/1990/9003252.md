Dr. Bezdek intends to extend the generalized fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering
algorithm to include the Minkowsi norm family, suitable for detecting clusters
in "boxy" data distributions. He will then elaborate the relationship between
FCM and Kohonen's self-organizing feature maps, strengthing the theoretical
foundations of each. These advances will be tested against standard algorithms
using data from medical image analysis (radionuclide angiocardiography, EEG
brain maps) and multisensor target detection.
