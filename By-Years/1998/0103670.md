EIA-0103670&lt;br/&gt;Rastislav Bodik&lt;br/&gt;University of
Wisconsin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NGS: Wisconsin DOVE: Distributed Optimizing
Virtual Environment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wisconsin DOVE proposes to improve the
performance of modern distributed and parallel applications as well as increase
the productivity of application developers and system maintainers. Building on
recent advances in distributed control, dynamic program optimization, and
hardware-supported performance monitoring, our project will build a Distributed
Optimizing Virtual Environment (DOVE) whose power will stem from two primary
innovations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The VM-in-OS paradigm. Dove will implant into
the operating system an optimizing virtual machine (VM), whose ability to
analyze a running program and correlate the analysis with hardware-based
performance monitoring will achieve vertical integration, spanning the
application, the kernel, and the hardware. The VM-enabled operating system will
be intimately aware of both the application above and the hardware and network
below, and hence it will be able to schedule resources more intelligently and
adaptively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A clan of optimizing virtual machines.
Expecting that future distributed applications will be assembled from
distributed components written in Java (or a similar mobile language), we
propose to organize the VMs underlying the individual distributed components
into a clan, in which the VMs exchange profiling and program-analysis
information about their clients. By supporting "gossip" among the distributed
VMs in a clan, we will be able to compute a run-time communication and
dependence profile of the distributed application and, in response, perform a
dynamic repartitioning of the application.&lt;br/&gt;
