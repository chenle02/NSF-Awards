Currently, many implementations of multimedia into a community college involve
using commercially produced laser disc technology. The results from this type of
implementation have been excellent (Miles, 1990). But this community college
environment requires addressing the specific cultural, vocabulary, and
nontechnical background of the students. The campus is a Community College
branch of the New Mexico State system and serves a population which is 65%
women, 24% Native American, and 26% Hispanic. Satellite programs are held on
nearby reservations where the population is 99% Native American. The Branch,
therefore, will produce its own interactive video material (Griffith, 1988;
McCool, 1984). Until the recent development of the PC-VCR, the cost for
developing interactive video presentations in-house was prohibitive. The general
procedure for this institution is to integrate interactive video systems, in-
house production facilities, and the creative talent of Branch faculty and
students. Implementation will affect four major areas: the Computer Literacy
course, presentations to public and reservation schools, the Branch faculties
class preparation work, and the Branch students' assignment preparation.
