In this period, ideas and techniques from Ergodic Theory have been percolating
in many areas of mathematics and of applications. This project aims to expanding
these interactions and to investigating the related problems in Ergodic Theory.

Of particular interest will be the horocycle flow on infinite type surfaces and
the related questions in analytic number theory and on Teichmueller spaces, the
noncommutative ergodic theorems in relation with geometric group theory and the
ergodic theory of partially hyperbolic dynamical systems.
