This research concerns ways in which experience fine-tunes perception. Examples
are the practiced worker's ability to detect subtle flaws in a product, or a
person's ability to identify quickly a familiar face in a crowd. The research
will follow two lines. The first concerns a relatively short-term effect called
priming, seen when advance information about a stimulus leads to its more
efficient detection. Experiments will determine the precise nature of such
perceptual changes and will address the manner in which primed expectancies are
learned. A second line of research concerns more permanent perceptual learning.
Experiments will investigate what changes in perception occur with practice, how
changes in one task may affect performance on others, and the possibility that
perceptual learning involves costs as well as benefits. In order to study such
learning it is necessary to control the subject's visual experience. The
Bloughs' experiments use pigeons, whose excellent vision is well understood;
pigeons and primates, including humans, process visual information in many
similar ways. This work is unique in its focus on relations between perception
and learning. The use of relatively simple stimuli combined with the tools of
psychophysical anslysis will permit the Bloughs to distinguish among stimulus-
based variables and several classes of experiential factors as determiners of
what is seen.
