This grant supports the research of Professors Costa and Keller to study the
normal subgroups of the linear, classical and Chevalley groups over rings. They
want to extend the results already obtained for the special linear and spin
groups to the linear groups of type B, G and F. They also intend to study the
relationship between subgroups of the special linear group of dimension 2 over a
local field and Hilbert symbols. This is research in the field of algebra. This
area can be thought of as the study of symmetry in the abstract. As such, this
area has direct applications to many areas of physics and chemistry. Moreover,
within the last 30 years, many connections to problems in data transmission have
been solved using techniques from group theory. There are also direct
connections to the error correcting codes that are vital for modern computing
such as working with CD-ROM's as well as to theoretical computer science in
general.
