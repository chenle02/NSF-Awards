Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Governments finance part of their budgetary needs
by selling bonds through sovereign debt auctions. The price at which they can
sell these bonds play a critical role in determining their cost of financing
deficits, their implementation of monetary policy, and even the extent to which
they can successfully navigate macroeconomic shocks. These auctions commonly
come in two forms - uniform-price auctions (UP), in which all bidders pay the
same price for the bonds and discriminatory-price auctions (DP) in which all
bidders pay what they bid. This project will explore the determinants of bond
prices and how sensitive those prices are to available information about
governments and about macroeconomic variables. The project will further look at
how these different auction protocols affect the revenue of governments as well
as the likelihood of debt crises and the exposure of bond prices to changing
economic conditions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research consists of two
projects. The first project develops a tractable theoretical framework to
understand investors' bidding behavior and information choices in response to
different auction protocols. The project uncovers a theoretically relevant
trade-off between these two protocols when information is asymmetric. On the one
hand, UP auctions allow governments to obtain an average higher price for its
bonds. On the other hand, this protocol increases the sensitivity of bond prices
to demand shocks. The second project consists on exploring the testable
implications of the model utilizing detailed auction data in a setting where
auction protocols have changed intermittently for the same country and sovereign
interest rates went through periods of high turbulence and periods of prolonged
stability. The project will also digitize this data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
