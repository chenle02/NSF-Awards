Today's urban population is isolated from the producer (farmer) by a myriad of
intermediaries, resulting in ever increasing periods from harvest to consumer.
Many researchers have studied innumerable techniques to extend the acceptable
post-harvest time. Numerous investigators have conducted in-depth analysis of
the ongoing metabolic chemical processes during the post-harvest era. Adel Kadar
(reference 1) illuminated the magnitude of this subject "...post-harvest
losses... is estimated to be 5 to 25 percent in developed countries and 20 to 50
percent in developing countries." Many others concur that respiration rate is
the singular most important process in determining a product's post- harvest
life tenure. Many address retention of moisture, vapor pressure deficit,
temperature and relative humidity. The third controllable parameter- pressure -
is appears, has not been addressed. This research examines the metabolic rate as
a function of positive pressure.
