The project is designed to measure properties of silicate liquids (magmas) such
as volume, thermal expansion and compressibility, and how they vary with
chemical composition, pressure, and temperature. The data obtained can be
applied to natural silicate liquids. Densities and chemical potentials
(effective activities) of low-melting silicate liquids will also be measured
using a high-temperature centrafuge. The thermodynamic properties derived from
the experimental data can be used to predict the behavior of natural magma.
