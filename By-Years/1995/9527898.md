This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at Syracuse University acquire a modern
single crystal X-ray diffraction system. This equipment will enhance research in
a number of areas including the following: (1)metal oxide clusters and solid,
(2) boron hydride clusters, (3) metal-thiolate chemistry, (4) alkaline,alkaline-
earth and lanthanide chemistry, and (5) the development of technetium and
rhenium radiopharmaceuticals. The X-ray diffractometer is used to make accurate
and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule.
The information obtained gives the precise values of all the bond distances and
bond angles of a given molecule and it gives accurate information about the
spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboping molecules.
