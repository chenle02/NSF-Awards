&lt;br/&gt;The investigator explores and develops new principles for the
design&lt;br/&gt;of statistical software to take advantage of modern computing
power.&lt;br/&gt;Particular emphasis is placed on exploring the effective use
of&lt;br/&gt;parallel computing, compilation, and code analysis for
statistical&lt;br/&gt;languages. Pilot implementations are incorporated in open
source&lt;br/&gt;statistical software systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Effective
statistical methodology made available through statistical&lt;br/&gt;software is
critical to the ability of researchers to make maximal use&lt;br/&gt;of
experimental and observational data, and for the ability
of&lt;br/&gt;instructors to teach good research practices. The design
principles&lt;br/&gt;developed by this research lead to software that improves
the ability&lt;br/&gt;of researchers, instructors, and other users of
statistical&lt;br/&gt;methodology to apply this methodology more effectively in
scientific&lt;br/&gt;research and teaching and to take full advantage of
modern&lt;br/&gt;high-performance computational resources. These principles also
lead&lt;br/&gt;to software frameworks that can be used to more rapidly deliver
new&lt;br/&gt;statistical methodology to end users. Applications in a range
of&lt;br/&gt;areas serve as testbeds for methods and principles developed in
this&lt;br/&gt;research.&lt;br/&gt;
