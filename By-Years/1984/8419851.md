The investigators have designed and constructed an innovative cyclic shear
testing device and developed a new approach to obtain undisturbed soil samples
for dynamic testing. This project will apply these developments to assess ;itin
situ;ro factors such as prestrain, preshaking, soil fabric, and aging of soils
to assess the liquefaction potential of sand deposits. The specific
investigations to be completed under this project will include: upgrading the
cyclic shear test apparatus and performing laboratory and ;itin situ;ro tests to
assess the effect of preshaking, prestrain, aging, and fabric on the dynamic
response of sands and developing an integrated and verified methodology using
the laboratory and field test data to assess the liquefaction potential in at
least three selected field sites in California where data on soil parameters
have been extensively recorded by the USGS, CDMG, and NSF programs.
