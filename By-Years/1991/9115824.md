This proposal requests funds for the purchase of an electrospray triple-
quadrupole mass spectrometer with on line HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry
capability. It is planned that the instrument will serve primarily by nine user
groups at the W. Alton Jones Cell Science Center. A broad range of independently
supported studies are ongoing and all require the requested instrumentation.
Most of the projects are directed at analysis of peptides and proteins and the
proposed instrument will be located and operated within the institutional share
Protein Chemistry Facility. The instrument will provide the user groups with
ready access for the first time to low to sub-picomole level accurate mass
spectrometric analyses of peptides and proteins covering a relatively broad mass
range. There currently are no mass spectrometry instruments at the Cell Science
Center. Mass spectrometry has become an indispensable tool for peptide and
protein structure- function studies and is essential for satisfactory progress
in the ongoing and future biological research at the W. Alton Jones Cell Science
Center.
