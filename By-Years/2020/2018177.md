Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the last decade many central banks,
including the US Federal Reserves and the European Central Bank (ECB), have
grown tremendously to become much more important players in financial markets.
Furthermore, advances in information technology have led to proposals of an even
larger footprint through Central Bank Digital Currencies as well as looming
competition from private monies. As a byproduct of these developments, central
banks have dramatically increased their short-term liabilities and are
considering further increases to sustain a massive increase in liquidity
provision. This project explores the role of the recent transformation of
central banks for the conduct of monetary policy, and the implications of
digital currencies on the efficiency of the payment
system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops a new framework to analyze
monetary policy. The existing framework on monetary policy views the Federal
Reserve as directly setting the nominal short-term interest rate at which
households save and firms finance their investments. This view does not explain
recent empirical evidence in the bond pricing literature which has documented a
convenience yield on short bonds. This convenience yield is not only
quantitatively large on average, it also varies over the business cycle. The
model does not explicitly describe the behavior of banks, which are thought of
as a veil. The framework developed in this project considers the role of
financial intermediaries on monetary policy and takes into consideration the
quantity of reserves in addition to a Taylor-type interest-rate rule. Finally,
the project considers implications of central bank digital currency on monetary
policy and the payment system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
