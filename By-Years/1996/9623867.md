The proposed research is directed towards the advancement of the exploration of
complex multi-dimensional timing control for multimedia streams in distributed
multimedia systems. To achieve this goal, this research effort focuses on the
exploration and development of a true generic system for the advanced timing
control of resources used by multimedia streams. Timing control is particularly
important for interactive multimedia distributed applications such as
telerobotics, teleoperation in manufacturing, and virtual reality applications
with force feedback including telesurgical training and audio-video
conferencing. The focus of this research is on the study of algorithms and
techniques to provide distributed control of multi-dimensional timing behaviors
over different resources in an integrated fashion. While there have been
advances in the control of the one dimensional case (timely delivery), and of
the two- dimensional case (media synchronization), there has been little
improvement in providing a third dimension in which the systems can control the
adaptation of timely delivery and/or media synchronization specified by quality
of service (QoS) parameters such as end-to-end delay and jitter. This research
addresses integrated time-variant QoS management for the above defined three
dimensions. To achieve this integration, the research effort calls for:
development of concepts for time-variant QoS management; development of a
theoretical framework for formal specifications for time-variant QoS and the
modeling of distributed control to accommodate QoS requirements; provision of an
experimental testbed for multimedia transmission according to QoS requirements;
and, evaluation of the framework through an experimental verification. ***
