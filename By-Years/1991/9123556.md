The West Indies harbor many different types (species) of plants and animals
found nowhere else in the world. They are rapidly disappearing because of
demands on the environment, especially the felling of trees, due to a high human
population density. It is important to find out how many species exist and where
they are located on the islands os that conservation areas, such as national
parks, can be established to protect them. The four largest islands in the
Caribbean basin, the Greater Antilles, have the greatest number of unique
species. This research involves exploration of poorly known areas and
identification of the herpetofauna (amphibians and reptiles), which are the most
abundant and diverse of the land animals with backbones (vertebrates).
