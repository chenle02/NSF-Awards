This project continues previous work on nonlinear and stochastic networks. The
basic research involves the design of efficient algorithms for large-scale
network optimization problems. Attention will be paid to the inclusion of
uncertainty within the model - stochastic networks - and to nonlinearities in
the objective function. Many problems in engineering and management can be
represented as a network in which some (or all) of the parameters are
stochastic. Examples include: air-traffic control, hydroelectric power
scheduling, financial investment strategies, transportation planning,
productions/distribution, and personnel planning systems. Adding uncertainty to
an optimization model greatly complicates the search for efficient algorithms.
This research will focus on a new decomposition method, called diagonal
quadratic approximation (DQA), that combines a penalty and an interior-point
barrier approach. Initial results indicate that the DQA method is competitive
with the leading stochastic programming algorithm - progressive hedging. Both
methods are amenable to parallel implementation. The DQA method can be designed
for a massively parallel computer. Thus, DQA applies to the multi-stage
stochastic program, whereby large numbers of scenarios are required. The
research will consider alternative versions of DQA and will study the
theoretical aspects of convergence. Extensive computational tests will be made
on a variety of serial and parallel computers, including a massively parallel
SIMD machine. The research promises to make substantial progress in the handling
of stochastic programming problems with a very large number of scenarios. The
significance of the project is indicated by the wide range of applications that
can be solved as network optimization problems under uncertainty.
