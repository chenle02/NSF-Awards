9419200 Gould Dr. Gould will develop new methods of extracting additional
information about the massive compact objects (MACHOs) that have recently been
detected in ongoing experiments. Dr. Gould will undertake several inter- related
investigations aimed at laying the basis for practical measurements of
additional MACHO parameters. There are three basic approaches to extracting
additional parameters: (1) measure the MACHO parallax; (2) measure the MACHO
proper motion; and (3) measure the distribution of MACHOs. The PI will pursue
all three approaches.
