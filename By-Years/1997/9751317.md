This project provides a new high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) system
that is crucial to the chemistry and environmental chemistry teaching
laboratories and replaces a 12-year old HPLC used for all chemistry teaching and
research laboratories. The new instrument can be used at all curricular levels
from introductory chemistry laboratory to senior research projects. The HPLC
system is the centerpiece of the separations instrumental analysis course and
plays an important role in the environmental chemistry program. It is one of the
principal tools used to teach trace analytical methods for water and soils, as
well as the analysis of foods, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals and the
semipreparative scale separations of proteins and organic reaction products. The
acquisition of this essential analytical technique allows the university to
provide undergraduates with the training, background, and experience in modern
instrumentation that is expected by employers and graduate schools. *
