The ITR project "Human Activity Monitoring Using Simple Sensors" explores the
use of binary sensors typically found in home security systems to monitor human
behavior. We envision systems that might&lt;br/&gt;remind a user that the stove
was left on, detect situations that might lead to a fall or injury, or help a
caregiver diagnose a treatable mental condition. Science advances include new
machine learning techniques to extract more information from simple sensors. The
project focuses on Bayesian or probabilistic methods to analyse the sensor data.
One implication of this work is that it may help the elderly live in their own
homes longer than they might otherwise. The significance of this work is that it
focuses on developing the potential of inexpensive sensing and minimizing the
invasion of privacy of behavior monitoring systems.
