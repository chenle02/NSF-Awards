This award supports continued operations of the Computational Infrastructure for
Geodynamics (CIG) facility to build and sustain essential cyberinfrastructure
and computational capacity for geodynamics and seismology. Since 2005, CIG has
developed and disseminated widely used, open-source software for research and
education in computational seismology, mantle convection, magma dynamics, short-
and long-term lithospheric deformation, and geodynamo modeling. CIG continues to
shape the culture of computational geophysics research by improving scientific
software development practices and by advancing the education of hundreds of
geodynamicists. CIGâ€™s approach toward scientific software development and
dissemination has become indispensable to geodynamics and related scientific
communities and includes established and sustained deep ties to computational
sciences. Scientific computation is integral to solid Earth geosciences,
allowing us to understand and quantify the processes that not only shape but
also influence the habitability of the Earth. Computational models provide an
essential link between observations and quantitative models describing the
evolution and connections between the Earth's interior and surface, as well as
relationships between solid Earth processes and atmospheric changes. CIG models
also inform applications to geohazards, natural resources, and national
security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CIG continues to enable frontier research in
geodynamics by supporting sustainable software development, cyberinfrastructure,
and human resources. Guided by collaborative community governance, CIG focuses
on 4 cornerstones: 1) Modeling software: Providing powerful software to solve
computational models, motivated by important science questions, and built on
best practices in open source software and scientific computing; (2)
Computational workflows: supporting workflows that facilitate the set-up,
execution, analysis, and exchange of complex computational models; (3) Training:
Enabling a well-educated, well-trained, and diverse workforce that can
effectively use and extend computational models for reproducible discovery and
reuse, and that can fully exploit high-performance computing resources; and (4)
Community: Building and sustaining a diverse and sustainable community of
disciplinary and interdisciplinary researchers working together on challenging
geoscience and software problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
