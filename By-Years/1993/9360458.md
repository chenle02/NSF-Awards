9360458 Robertazzi SIS heterodyne receivers integrated with on-chip local
oscillators for use in radio astronomy will be developed. The receivers will
incorporate superconducting tunnel junctions (SIS junctions) as the mixing
elements together with Josephson junction local oscillators to provide mixing in
the 50-700 GHz frequency band. Local oscillators based on the ac Josephson
effect have demonstrated operation up to frequencies in excess of the
superconducting tunnel junction gap frequency, about 1.5 THz for Nb and 3 THz
for NbN. These oscillators may be tuned electrically, are extremely compact and
dissipate small amounts of power. Recently, Josephson junction array oscillators
have been fabricated from which more than 125 nW has been coupled into a 10 ohm
load at 105 GHz. The oscillators will be used to produce monolithic
millimeter/submillimeter wave heterodyne receivers. These receivers have
intrinsic utility for radio astronomy, and would have application in advanced
communication and radar systems as well. ***
