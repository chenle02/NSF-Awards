Presently there is a need for more effective ways to integrate statistical
methodologies such as Design of Experiments (DOE) into the engineering
curriculum. We are using a fundamentals-based numerical simulation of chemical
vapor deposition (CVD) to develop a virtual reactor where students will learn
and then actually apply DOE. Associated educational materials are also being
developed. The simulation of the virtual reactor is based on fundamental
principles of mass transfer and chemical reaction, obscured by added "noise."
However, rather than having access to the entire output of model, the film
thicknesses are given to students only at the select points within the wafer and
from wafer to wafer that they have decided to "measure." Student assessment will
be based not only on the ultimate reactor performance but also on the cost of
experimentation. The virtual reactor allows students a broader and more
realistic experience in using the DOE methodology for process improvement - as
if they were operating an actual industrial reactor. The Northwest Regional
Educational Laboratory is leading the project evaluation while a five-member
advisory committee consists of engineers and statisticians from academia (OSU,
University of Oregon) and industry (LSI Logic, Intel, WaferTech).
