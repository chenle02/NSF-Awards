Reaction Engineering International proposes to develop a chemistry sub-model for
the incorporation of detailed chemical kinetic rates and equilibrium
considerations into reacting flow models. The objectives of this project include
demonstrating the feasibility of including chemical equilibrium considerations
in a method designed to reduce chemical kinetic mechanisms, creating a chemistry
tool that is accessible to a generic reacting flow model, and demonstrating the
utility of the sub-model. It is the intent of the proposed research to develop a
strategy through which the underlying physics of specific reaction processes can
be extracted from detailed chemical kinetic and thermodynamic data, and
subsequently used in reacting flow computations. The approach will not rely on
partial equilibrium or steady-state assumptions and will allow one to accurately
determine non-equilibrium levels of species. Furthermore, the chemical sub-model
to be developed will accurately account for and be able to consider entities (or
species) for which there is no chemical kinetic information.
