Since the process of initiation and growth of cracks which lead to fracture in
concrete must surely be influenced by the various components in the mixture (as
well as state of stress, curing conditions, moisture content, etc.), it would be
desireable to verify that the proposed testing standards are suitable for a wide
range of key mix parameters. Concomitantly, the influence of different mix
parameters on fracture properties including the shape of the crack front and
process zone also may be determined. The successful completion of this work will
provide further evidence that fracture mechanics is a viable and useful tool for
the characterization of the behavior of cementitious materials subjected to
stress and for the development of design formulas for shear strength, bond
strength, deflection response and crack width of reinforced concrete structures
in which size and brittleness effects can be considered explicitly.
