ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is to support US students and
postgraduates to participation in the 2003-2004 Special Year in Geometric and
Spectral Analysis at the Centre de Recherches Mathematiques of the University of
Montreal, Canada. The program presents a unique training opportunity for
students and postgraduates interested in aspects of analysis motivated by
mathematical physics, singularity theory, and number theory. There are very few,
if any, other possibilities for students and postgraduates to get such a
systematic exposure to current research directions in such a wide and
interrelated range of mathematical analysis. Mathematical analysis is an
especially powerful tool for science and technology. The research themes of the
2003-2004 Special Year arise from the areas of mathematics and physics with the
greatest overlap with science and technology.
