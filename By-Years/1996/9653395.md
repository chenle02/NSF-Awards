More education is needed to teach undergraduate civil engineering students how
to use geosynthetics to provide more cost-effective designs to construct and
maintain the U.S. infrastructure. Industry and government need graduating
engineers well-versed with geosynthetics, while universities seek a method to
meet this need. The Professor training Course in Geosynthetics will meet this
need. Geosynthetics are starting to be used in civil engineering structures, but
few graduating civil engineers receive instruction on how to use them.
Currently, many of the practicing engineers that use them do so without an
adequate background. Because geosynthetics can provide less expensive, more
elegant and more efficient designs, there is a need to improve the education of
undergraduate civil engineering students, so they can design with geosynthetics
with confidence. Geosynthetics (polymeric materials used in civil engineering
projects), can provide cost-effective materials to engineers building and
rebuilding the infrastructure. Geosynthetics are used in roads, landfills, earth
slopes, dams, retaining walls, erosion control, drainage structures and
agriculture. This Professor Training Courses for Geosynthetics is designed to
answer these problems. The Course objectives are to: 1. teach Civil Engineering
professors about geosynthetics, so they can teach undergraduates about
geosynthetics. 2. provide class notes for the professors to use in incorporating
geosynthetic designs in their undergraduate university courses, and 3. provide
motivation, samples, informational contacts, and instructional materials to the
professors to incorporate geosynthetics instruction in the classroom, and allow
continued learning. The Courses will be offered, once a year, tuition-free, to
thirty five professors unac- quainted with geosynthetics. These objectives will
be met through an intense week-long series of seminars. The professors receive
instruction from experts from government, academic, and the private sector who
are teachers, researchers and practitioners in geosynthetics.
