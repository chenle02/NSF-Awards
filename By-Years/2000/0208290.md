The purpose of this project is to enhance African American parental involvement
with high school student children by developing skills and strategies for
effectively managing the educational careers of their children. It would create
a capacity for collaborations with the schools that service African American
children by developing the social and organizational infrastructure for
continued parental involvement in educational careers. It seeks to increase
enrollment and success of Black students in higher-level mathematics and science
courses to diminish the race gap in math and science track placements. It uses a
quasi-experimental design to implement a series of community workshops designed
to enhance knowledge, skills, and strategies for managing placements of children
in science and math tracks.

The research would create an intervention designed to change the outcome of
students. It would conduct ethnographic work to map successful pathways to
enrollment in higher-level math courses. It would use findings from these
studies to implement workships within the Black communities, and conduct
statistical analysis of the growth in achievement as a result of the reduction
in course taking.
