Computer Science (31) This project offers professional development opportunities
for Information Technology instructors at the secondary and post-secondary
levels in a rural setting by: 1. Providing Information Technology two-week
internships in regional businesses during the summer for secondary and post-
secondary instructors. 2. Allowing instructors to keep their curriculum current
by accessing training available on-line or at industry-sponsored conferences and
educational seminars. This project expands the academic preparation of
information technology teachers from the classroom to the "real world" of work.
Interaction with business and industry will enable instructors to bring that
"world" back into the classroom for more relevant and meaningful experiences for
both high school and college students by integrating real world scenarios into
the classroom. The business experience by instructors is the piece missing in
the training of regional instructors. By integrating business and industry
contacts with secondary and post-secondary education in the 11,000 square mile
region, participants will learn how business and education can partner for the
benefit of students in a rural, isolated area.
