This Presidential Young Investigator Award is for research in the general area
of aerosol reactors for fine particle production. It will address such topics as
particle precursor gas phase kinetics, heat and mass transfer relevant to
aerosol reactors, and aerosol dynamics including coagulation and sintering. The
research will involve both experiment and theoretical modelling. Aerosol
reactors offer a promising technology for producing fine powers of controlled
size, shape and chemical composition. The should contribute to high tech
materials including ceramics, optical wave guides, and superconductors.
