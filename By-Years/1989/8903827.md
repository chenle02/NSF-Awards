This Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) project will examine
the long-term effects of disturbance on tropical rain forest ecosystems, the
effects of high irradiance on photosynthesis in tropical tree seedlings, and the
systematic studies of endemic tropical organisms. Studies on the patterns of
revegetation on landslide areas will continue and plant species diversity will
be examined as a function of size, elevation, and microhabitat. The
physiological responses of early and late successional tree species will be
compared by transplating them into the open landslide center, partially
recolonized landslide edges, and into treefall gaps. Nutrients will be added to
the various systems to examine the role of nourishment limitations in
revegetation. This comprehensive investigation of how disturbance may play a
major role in creating and maintaining diversity in rain forests will
significantly increase the research capability of a predominantly minority
institution. The principal investigators have excellent training and have
published in solid refereed journals. Faculty and students working on this
project will further strengthen those research skills for improving the
institution's tropical biology program.
