This proposal includes research in several areas of high resolution
spectroscopy using laser techniques. Work on Stark Spectroscopy is a
continuation of past work and is directed towards providing precise measurements
of electric fields. Work on laser cooling and studies of laser noise are also
proposed and the author also proposes to devote some effort to improving the
technology used in atomic physics using some of the new techniques that have
recently become available.
