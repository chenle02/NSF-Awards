Title: A National Network for Critical Technology Assessment: A
Pilot&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract: The National Network for Critical
Technology Assessment Pilot seeks to lay the foundation for the ability to
assess U.S. global competitiveness on key emerging technologies and identify
where and how Federal science and technology investments can be applied to
advance U.S. competitiveness and the well-being of U.S. citizens. Using data,
advanced analytics, and expert insights, the national network pilot effort will
identify methods that could be employed to derive policy insights and develop an
understanding of where additional analytical tools and data resources are needed
to drive comprehensive analysis and decision-making.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bringing together a multidisciplinary group of experts,
the national network will pair a top-down approach to scan global capabilities
in knowledge, production, and human capital with a bottom-up approach to develop
and demonstrate methods to identify opportunities for science and technology
investment to advance national competitiveness. The bottom-up approach will be
accomplished through deep dives in four key technology areas: artificial
intelligence, biotechnology, energy storage, and semiconductors. The outcomes of
both approaches will be synthesized into a final Critical Technology Assessment
report.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
