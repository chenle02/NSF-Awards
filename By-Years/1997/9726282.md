9726282 Dietrich Molecular Phylogeny of Membracoidea (Insecta: Hemiptera): A
Test of Alternative Evolutionary Scenarios Comprising over 25,000 described
species, the Membracoidea (leafhoppers and treehoppers) are a highly diverse and
successful lineage of plant-feeding insects. Conflicting morphology-based
hypotheses of phylogenetic relationship have hindered attempts to understand the
evolutionary origins of various unique ecological and behavioral characteristics
(e.g., ant-mutualism, parental care, anointing behavior) and the possible roles
that the acquisition or loss of such traits played in the diversification of the
group. This project will provide increased resolution of the phylogenetic
relationships among membracoid family-group taxa by adding characters from
nuclear ribosomal (28S) and protein-coding (elongation factor l-alpha) gene
sequences for a large sample of leafhopper and treehopper species. Analyses of
these data will address a number of long-standing questions, including: (1) Did
the initial divergence of treehoppers coincide with the loss ofjumping ability
and acquisition of a sessile, cryptic juvenile stage, or are these retained
ancestral characteristicsT; (2) Did treehoppers arise prior to the break-up of
Gondwana, as implied by one morphology-based phylogeny, or did this lineage
arise in South America after the isolation of that continent, as implied by the
fossil record?; (3) Did shifts in habitat, host, and/or feeding stragegy promote
the diversification of certain leafhopper and treehopper groups?; and (4) Were
ant mutualism and egg-guarding behavior acquired independently in several
different lineages?
