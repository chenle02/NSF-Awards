The goal of the proposed two-day Computing Alliance of Hispanic-Serving
Institutions (CAHSI) &lt;br/&gt;INCLUDES Community workshop is to bring together
researchers from Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) to co-develop an action
plan to increase HSI representation in the Computer and Information Science
&amp; Engineering (CISE) directorate's portfolio. The investigators will
facilitate focused discussions on the factors that support and impede HSIs in
securing funding. It is critical for the health of our nation to build capacity
at HSIs to conduct research and advance educational attainment in computing of
Hispanics and other underrepresented students, including first-generation and
low-income populations &lt;br/&gt;who are enrolled in high shares at most
HSIs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
