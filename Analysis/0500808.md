Fully Nonlinear Equations Project Abstract

Yu Yuan

This project focuses on the regularity and solvability of fully nonlinear
equations. The first topic is to investigate Bernstein/Liouville problems for
various equations. Here the aim is to prove that the only solutions of certain
problems are certain very simple or "trivial" solutions. Another topic is to
prove regularity results for the solutions of fully nonlinear second order
elliptic equations in 3d domains and also for the Isaacs' equation of control
theory. The project will also look at deriving necessary conditions for the
local isometric imbedding problem for 2-dimensional Riemannian manifolds.

The partial differential equations in the project arise not only in geometry but
also in science and engineering. Results on these problems should have
applications to string theory in modern physics, for nonlinear elasticity in
mechanics, and for stochastic optimal control theory in engineering and
economics.
