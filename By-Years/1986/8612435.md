The objective is to provide undergraduate engineering students with both basic
principles and practical aspects of material testing and to explore avenues for
improved cooperation between the university and industry. The university will
teach the basic principles of the subject, while an industrial laboratory will
provide the practical aspects of materials testing. The course consists of one
semester credit laboratory course, which has about 13 3-hour periods. Seven of
13 periods are supervised by the faculty and staff of the university. In the
other four periods, the students go to the industrial laboratories to see the
actual commercial testings, state-of-the-art equipment, and the demonstration of
special testing techniques. The remaining periods of the course are used for
special lectures given either by engineers from laboratories on the testing
projects that could not be scheduled for student observation, or by faculty
members who are involved in experimental research projects. All activities that
are performed by industrial laboratories are to be videotaped; these tapes will
be made available for other students who will take the course in the future.
