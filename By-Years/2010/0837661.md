Engineering Mechanical - (56)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Often it is difficult for
freshman engineering students to conceptualize the professional roles of
mechanical engineers and learn fundamental concepts vital to mastery of the
mechanical engineering curriculum. This project creates and assesses freely-
available, agent-monitored internet chat-based course materials for integrating
computer-aided design, modeling, and manufacturing skills within a freshman
mechanical engineering undergraduate course. These tutorials allow students to
navigate complicated software interfaces, conceptualize what mechanical
engineers do, and learn fundamental concepts through dynamic dialogues between
tutorial agents and student groups. Additional chat-based tutorials will be
developed as a unique, efficient outreach tool, allowing middle school students
to become excited about engineering and other technical professions. These
project tasks are structured to be the basis for long-term transformational
changes in how we teach engineering.
