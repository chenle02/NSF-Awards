The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project stems from the
critical need for a low-cost point-of-care (POC) microdevice for rapid detection
of pathogen infections, such as whooping cough, in low-resource settings.
Whooping cough is the only vaccine-preventable infection that remains endemic in
the US. Conventional pathogen detection methods either take a long time or
require costly and bulky instruments, limiting their applications for low-
resource settings. The new microfluidic device can provide low-cost, rapid and
accurate detection of whooping cough at the point of care, enabling rapid and
accurate POC detection of whooping cough in rural clinical settings and other
venues. The microfluidic device may also be used to detect a variety of other
pathogens, such as foodborne pathogens. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps
project is primarily intended to commercialize the microdevice for POC detection
of pathogens. The core technology is based on integrated DNA isothermal
amplification on a low-cost paper/polymer hybrid microfluidic device. The
instrument-free detection by the naked eye minimizes instrumentation
requirements, while DNA amplification and 6 primers specific to the target
ensure high detection sensitivity and high accuracy, respectively. These
significant features allow for low-cost, rapid (45 min), and accurate POC
detection of pathogens in low-source settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
