This award provides funding for a Regional Center for Ocean Sciences Education
Excellence with administrative offices located at the University of Southern
Mississippi's Marine Education Center and Aquarium in Biloxi, Ms. The proposal
would establish satellite centers in Louisiana, and Alabama and expand existing
USM teacher professional development efforts into these states. This Center
would make extensive use of the expertise of regional marine educators as
interpreters of ocean and coastal marine science research in professional
development institutes for formal and informal educators. This center will be
one of seven regional centers that represent the initiation of the COSEE
network. The initial set of centers covers most of the East Coast, Florida, the
Gulf Coast, and California. A central coordinating office for the seven centers
will also be funded.
