A liquid hydrogen target capable of operating with a heat load of 500 Watts and
a Cherenkov radiation detector based electron spectrometer will be constructed
for use in a new generation electron scattering parity violation experiment
which will measure the flavor singlet anomalous magnetic moment of the proton.
This measurement will be sensitive to the presence of strange quarks in the
proton. The experiment will be conducted at the MIT/Bates electron linear
accelerator facility.
