9309393 Allman One of the many mysteries of human perception is that after
seeing random contours linked together just a few times, observers cannot help
but see them as a whole, even when they are later unlinked. These illusory
contours have been called "cognitive" contours because they exist only in the
mind, not in the stimulus. With this new three year grant from NSF, Dr. Allman
will investigate the neural basis of this phenomenon. In pilot work, he has
found that animals develop the ability to see these cognitive contours as
rapidly as humans. He has thus created a completely novel paradigm for the study
of perceptual learning. He will now record in visual cortex to search for the
actual neuronal changes that occur during the formation of the perceptual
illusion. He will thus be able to describe the neurobiological correlates of a
perceptual phenomenon, making this a first attempt to describe events at the
mind/brain interface. ***
