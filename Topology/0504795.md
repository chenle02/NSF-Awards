Mitchell's project has two principal components. The first is a study of
K(1)-local homotopy theory and its applications, including applications to
algebraic K-theory and general linear group homology. The methods incorporate an
Iwasawa theory for K(1)-local spectra. The second component is an investigation
of the topology and geometry of loop groups and symmetric spaces, including a
homology Schubert calculus for the Pontrjagin ring and questions about stable
homotopy type.

Algebraic topology is the branch of geometry that studies qualitative properties
of geometric objects, especially properties that remain invariant under
continuous deformation. Topology has many connections to other branches of
mathematics, and in recent years has appeared with surprising frequency in the
sciences, including physics and even molecular biology. Mitchell's project is an
investigation of intriguing new connections between algebraic topology, number
theory, and the geometry of Lie groups (groups of transformations of manifolds
and other geometric objects).
