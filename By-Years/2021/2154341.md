Called for in the FY 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, the National
Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine has convened the Roundtable to
bring together individuals from the research agencies, national intelligence,
law enforcement, academic research, and business communities to explore critical
issues related to protecting U.S. national and economic security while ensuring
the open exchange of ideas and the international talent required for American
leadership in science and technology. The Roundtable is tasked with: 1)
exploring critical issues related to protecting US national and economic
security; 2) identifying and considering security threats and risks associated
with federally funded&lt;br/&gt;research and development; 3) identifying
effective approaches to communicating threats and risks; 4)sharing best
practices for addressing and mitigating the threats and risks; and 5) examining
potential near and long-terms responses by stakeholders in the research
enterprise to mitigate and address the risks associated with foreign
threats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
