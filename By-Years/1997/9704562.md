This research deals with issues related to the efficient use of parallel I/O
systems. These include problems of data placement, caching, and prefetching and
their interaction in determining system performance. The project involves the
development of robust parallel I/O models that incorporate these requirements,
and designing new algorithms to obtain desired performance levels. This includes
identifying the appropriate policies for resource management in the context of
both single and multiple interacting computational and I/O streams, and the
development of suitable algorithmic strategies. The focus is on on-line buffer
management and prefetching algorithms with bounded lookahead. The use of
randomization in data placement and replacement, and issues arising in their
implementation are under consideration. Theoretical analysis of the algorithms
is based on a competitive framework to compare different on-line methods, and
identify promising candidates. Suitable candidates will be implemented and their
performance validated empirically. The areas of impact include, though are not
restricted to, data-intensive applications like modern database and multimedia
systems.
