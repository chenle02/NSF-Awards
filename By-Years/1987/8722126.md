Dr. McCray, in collaboration with Dr. Mike Norman at the University of Illinois,
will apply newly developed computer simulations to a number of theoretical
problems associated with interstellar hydrodynamics. They will use the
computational facilities at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications
at the University of Illinois. It has been recognized for some time that
supernova explosions and stellar winds have a major influence on the structure
and dynamics of the interstellar medium (ISM). Modern observations at radio,
optical and infrared wavelengths reveal a complexity of detail in the structure
of the ISM that is not adequately described by the existing theoretical models.
Dr. McCray will attempt to better understand the complex structure of the ISM
and the nature of influencing phenomena through his theoretical simulations.
