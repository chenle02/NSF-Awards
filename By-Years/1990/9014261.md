Intercellular communication is important in development. Two genes thought to be
involved with cyclic AMP protein kinases in Drosophila will be studied. Cyclic
AMP is a common cell to cell communicator. The P element, an inserter and
disrupter of gene function, will be categorized by PCR and their effect on
development studied. Understanding how cells "know who and where they are" is of
fundamental importance to an understanding of the genetic control of
development.
