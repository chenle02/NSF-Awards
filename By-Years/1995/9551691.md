The university's chemistry department serves a student population that is
attending graduate school in rapidly increasing numbers. To help these students
and to stimulate even more to pursue this path, the department is developing an
engaging new program of upper-level electives. This program must provide the
advanced electives required for the professional major, excite students about
continuing their education, and convey to them the true interdisciplinary nature
of chemistry. The chemistry department has chosen to design a program to teach
air-sensitive synthesis to undergraduates. This program fills the departmental
need for advanced synthetic course work with electives designed to illustrate
the interdisciplinary nature of chemistry seen in fields such as organometallics
and material science. As the focal point, the university is currently building
an undergraduate teaching lab dedicated to the art of air-sensitive
synthesis/manipulation. This project specifically funds a single station inert
atmosphere glove box as the one remaining item required for the completion of
this facility. Since much of air-sensitive chemistry involves producing and
handling air-sensitive products, it is unrealistic to omit these from a
student's training. Glove box use is not only the best way to handle these
products, it is also the most efficient, student friendly, way to teach a
laboratory class of this type. Its acquisition allows electives in
Organometallics and Advanced Synthetic Techniques to include a complete and
relevant lab component.
