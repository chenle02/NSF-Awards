This interagency transfer to the Office of Naval Research (ONR) supports ACE-
Asia (Aerosol Characterization Experiment) which took place in Spring, 2001.
ACE-Asia was aimed at improving our understanding of the physical, chemical, and
radiative properties and distribution of natural and anthropogenic aerosols
emitted in Northeast Asia and transported over the Pacific Ocean. ACE was
supported by NSF, ONR, NOAA, and other national and international agencies.
Specifically, this transfer covers part of the deployment and operational costs
for the ONR supported Twin Otter aircraft. It also funds satellite support for
the Twin Otter and the NSF C-130 aircraft in the field.
