Abstract ATM 97-13858 Wang, Wei-Chyung State University of New York at Albany
Title: Atmospheric Trace Constituents and Global Climate This grant is for
continuation of research on the development of the climate chemistry model to be
integrated into the climate system model. The topics of focus are 1) GCM
simulations of the climatic effect of observed changes in atmospheric 03, 2)
Effects of climate and climate change on the distribution of UV-B flux in the
troposphere, 3) Diagnoses of the systematic biases of GCM simulated large scale
climate relevant to atmospheric chemistry, and 4) GCM study of indirect effect
of sulfate aerosols. This research will enhance the capability of the climate
system model, which in turn will enhance the national capability of climate
prediction.
