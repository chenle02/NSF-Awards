Preliminary field tests by Plant Growth Development Corporation (PGDC) have
established that dramatic increases in plant growth can be obtained by foliar
treatments of plants with preparations of succinic acid derived from
fermentation. Subsequent tests in the greenhouse have shown that fermentation
succinic acid is much more active at stimulating plant growth than equivalent
amounts of synthetic succinic acid. Analysis of other components in fermentation
succinic acid preparations showed that gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) is also an
ingredient. Laboratory and greenhouse tests have shown that synthetic GABA
stimulates plant growth, and that bioactivity is synergistically increased by
combination with succinic acid. Although GABA is ubiquitous in the plant
kingdom, its function is unknown. Funding is being requested to establish the
most effective way for using formulations containing GABA to increase plant
growth and productivity, and to elucidate the mechanism of GABA bioactivity.
