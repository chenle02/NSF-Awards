>>> > The "scaling up" from laboratory results to commercial sized fluidized bed
reactions has remained only partially successful. This study is investigating
the scale effects on the gas and solid flow patterns in fluidized bed systems.
The studies are two integrated efforts. The first involves studying the flow
patterns in three similar circular beds and in three similar rectangular systems
with aspect ratios of 2:1. The second study is investigating the fundamentals of
emulsion phase stability, bubble dynamics and associated flow of particles, gas
backmixing, and solids dispersion. The study is divided into four tasks: 1)
Recognition of Gas.Solid Contact Using Chemical Reactions, 2) Gas and Solids
Flow Patterns in Fluidized Beds, 3) Development of Fluidized Bed Instrumentation
and 4) The Effect of Configuration on Flow Patterns of Solids and Gases. This
two year study is being cost.shared by DuPont Union Carbide, the Electric Power
Research Institute and West Virginia University. The Co.Principal Investigators
and their colleagues are noted experts in their disciplines and are well
qualified to conduct this study. The project has been coordinated with Dr. M.
Ojalvo, ENG/CBT/PMP. The Program Manager recommends that West Virginia
University be awarded $100,000 for the first year of a two.year continuing
grant. Second year funding is to be contingent upon satisfactory research
progress and companies cost sharing at least $100,000 to complete the project.
