This award by Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) program supports work by
Professor Isiah Warner and his collaborators at Louisiana State University &amp;
Agricultural and Mechanical College to explore the theoretical foundation of
using quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) for both mass and molecular weight
determination of volatile organic compounds at the presence of a group of
uniform materials based on organic salts (GUMBOS) and cellulose acetate (or
other polymers). This research is based upon the researcher's recent discovery
that in the presence of aforementioned composite sensing materials, the ratio of
two parameters, which are simultaneously acquired during QCM measurements, can
provide molecular weight estimates of absorbed molecules. In the proposed
studies, the research groups will (1) conduct a detailed examination of sensing
composites to achieve a full understanding of their characteristics to provide
an appropriate ratio of df to dR; (2) develop computational methods and
theoretical models to better understand how these composites function at a
fundamental level; and (3) evaluate overall morphology and other properties of
composites that contribute to optimal use in QCM measurements and analytical
applications. Professor Warner will continue to actively engage undergraduate
and graduate students of diverse backgrounds in science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education.
