Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is
experiencing the most rapid warming of any marine ecosystem on Earth and is thus
an ideal place to investigate the interactions between climate change and marine
ecosystem response. The productivity of the WAP is supported in part by
microbial activity and therefore an understanding of microbial processes is
essential to understanding biogeochemical cycling in this region. Marine viruses
are a source of mortality and disease of ecologically and economically important
marine species from plankton to vertebrates, yet aside from a few estimates of
viral abundance there is no information about viral ecology in Antarctic waters.
This study will compare the temporal variation of total virus abundance, viral
diversity, virioplankton composition and the frequency of infected cells in the
microbial assemblage with variations in biological, chemical and physical
parameters over two summer field seasons in the Palmer Basin. It will be the
first temporal examination of virus-induced mortality and virus diversity in
this globally important region. During the proposed research, the post doctoral
fellow will collaborate closely with members of the Palmer Long-Term Ecological
Research (LTER) program. The interactions will be mutually beneficial. The
proposed research will address an unknown factor in the plankton ecology and
biogeochemistry in the WAP, while the post doctoral fellow will gain valuable
experience working with an experienced research team, learn new methods, and
conduct new and exciting research in microbial oceanography. In addition to the
research, the fellow will participate in the outreach activities of the Palmer
LTER program and the University of Hawaii at Manoa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
