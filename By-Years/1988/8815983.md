The Federation of American Societies of Experimental Biology (FASEB) has
sponsored summer research conferences since 1982. The intent was to emphasize
areas not covered by annual or biannual Gordon Research Conferences and to
stress multidisciplinary approaches to problems to best represent the
constituent member societies of FASEB. The format and venues of these
conferences are conducive to scientific exchange, and prompt ready and direct
scientific discussions. The 1989 meeting will feature 9 scientific sessions on
diverse areas of calcium research, and is the only US meeting devoted entirely
to calcium related events. The topics for discussion include: hormonal
regulation of calcium homeostasis, calcium regulation in excitable cells,
calcium release mechanisms, calcium regulation of smooth muscle, calcium and the
protein phosphorylation cycle, calcium in growth and development, novel calcium
control mechanisms, genetic analysis of calcium function (including studies in
Drosophila, yeasts, fungi, paramecium, and transgenic mice), and structure and
function of calcium binding proteins. This conference should contribute greatly
to the progress of basic research on this important subject.
