One of the major topics within the CEDAR program is the study of the mesosphere
and lower thermosphere region of the atmosphere (80-110km). One technique used
to study the structure and temperature of the region is to observe the intensity
variation of particular emissions from constituents such as hydroxyl (OH) and
molecular oxygen at night and during twilight. This award will allow the use of
an existing high sensitivity infrared Michelson interferometer in various
campaign activities located at different CEDAR stations covering low, middle and
high latitudes. 3/3/89
