Investigation of the biology of a lineage of amphibians, the Order Gymnophiona
or caecilians, will provide information important to understanding 1) their
structure and function, 2) their relationships to each other, to other
amphibians, and to other vertebrates, and 3) patterns of evolution and
adaptation in animals that have modified bodies, and patterns of evolution in
general. The study will integrate developmental, functional, and structural
biology in a multi-disciplinary approach using a diversity of research
techniques. These tropical amphibians live in habitats that are fast
disappearing, so their study will provide information on their ecological
relationships and especially their contribution to the biodiversity of the
world.
