Position Measurement (PM) is a vital component in modern construction practice.
The current technology for PM is sophisticated but does not accommodate real-
time input/output. The focus of this research is to examine the data structure,
data presentation format, data distribution process, and the data gathering
issues as they relate to the broad based integration of Real-time Position
Measurement (RtPM) with Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided Engineering
(CAD/CAE). The research will also study human factors as they relate to
implementation including cultural, political, and industrial issues. It is
anticipated that the successful introduction of RtPM/CAD- CAE technology will
have a very significant economic and quality impact, both in the United States
and in enhancing the competitiveness of U.S. construction firms engaged in
global construction ventures.//
