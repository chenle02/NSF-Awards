Professor Daniel M. Downey and other members of the Chemistry Department of
James Madison University are being supported to conduct a Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1990-92, eight (8)
undergraduate students will spend ten (10) weeks each summer actively engaged in
a variety of research projects. Projects range from oxidation-reduction of free
radicals by metal ions to isomerization of metal complexes of crown ethers.
Students will also be invited to participate in a two-week course entitled
"Introduction to Research". Faculty from neighboring institutions will be
invited to participate in the summer research projects in order to foster long-
term research collaborations in this geographic area.
