An integrated microwave circuit design and measurement package for teaching
modern microwave engineering to undergraduates is being developed. The package
is controlled by a computer allowing automated measurements. A network analyzer
provides magnitude and phase responses of microwave devices and circuits, while
a spectrum analyzer provides frequency domain characterization of signals
emanating from circuits. All measured data is collected and stored by the
computer and is available for analysis and design under the direction of a
CAD/CAM software package. This project provides undergraduate students with
powerful tools for the complete cycle of design, fabrication, and measurement of
microwave circuits. This project is being matched by an amount equal to the
award.
