This starter grant award to Kansas State University supports the research of
Professor Daniel A. Higgins. The research focusses on the fundamental physical
and chemical properties of mesostructured materials as studied by near-field
scanning optical microscopy. Thin films of polymer-dispersed electrochromic
materials including phthalocyanin-based materials are studied. Film morphology
is characterized and its effects on local organization of the electrochromic
molecules are elucidated. Since local properties of these inherently
mesostructured films are dramatically different from their average properties,
the research promises to provide a better understanding of these and other
highly structured materials. From a technological perspective, polymer-dispersed
materials are being developed for diverse applications in optics, display,
detector, and data storage technologies, as well as in catalysis. The research
contributes to the advancement of these technologies.
