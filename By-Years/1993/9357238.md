9357238 Rogers This NYI award will support the research of a promising and
accomplished young investigator. His research will include an experimental study
of interactions between electrons and electromagnetic fields in high energy
colliders. This will include such processes as beam environment and beam- beam
dynamics, and the generation of coherent high energy photon beams. ***
