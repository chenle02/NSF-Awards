The Allegheny Observatory trigonometric parallax program utilizes some of the
most accurate equipment of its kind to determine very high precision parallaxes
and masses for astrophysically interesting objects within 250 parsecs of the
Sun. The program has sufficient precision to obtain reliable trigonometric
distances of such luminosity standards as nearby star clusters, giant stars, and
variable stars; to define portions of the mass-luminosity relationship
previously outside of the domain of trigonometric techniques; and to detect low
mass orbiting nearby stars. The determination of stellar parallaxes is of
fundamental importance to almost all areas of astronomy, since the determination
of many physical parameters requires knowledge of distance. The limitation in
parallax determination up until quite recently has been the presence in most
astrometric systems of systematic errors that limit the true accuracy of the
determined distances. All indications are that efforts at the Allegheny
Observatory have successfully rectified this problem. The development phase of
Dr. Gatewood's program is now complete, and production observing is proceeding.
