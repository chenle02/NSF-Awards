This Americas Program award will support Dr. Frederico C. Furtado of the
University of Wyoming and Dr. Bradley J. Plohr of SUNY at Stony Brook in
collaboration with Dr. Dan Marchesin of the Instituto de Matematica Pura e
Aplicada, Brazil and Dr. Felipe F. Pereira of the Instituto de Politecnico da
Universadade do Estado Rio de Janeiro. The team will join complementary
expertise and technical accomplishments in mathematical analysis, numerical
analysis, and multiphase flow to investigate the equations and solutions of
multiphase flows in geologically heterogeneous porous media.

This project involves five tasks: (1) development of multiphase flow models that
accurately account for important physical effects; (2) computational
investigation and stochastic analysis of fluid mixing dynamics for these models
in the presence of stochastic geologic heterogeneities; (3) construction of up-
scaled multiphase flow models based on these results; (4) mathematical analysis
of the solutions and non-linear wave structure; and (5) application of the newly
developed models to technologically important flows such as Water-Alternating-
Gas enhanced oil recovery.
