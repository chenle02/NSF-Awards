This research is designed to identify and characterize the domain of the rabies
virus glycoprotein, the protein forming the coat of the virus, that binds to the
nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, a neurotransmitter receptor present on the
surface of muscle and nerve cells and which may also act as a rabies virus
receptor. The segment of the virus glycoprotein that binds to the receptor will
be identified and isolated and the role of the individual amino acids and of
conformational shape of the protein in binding determined. Once the binding
domain is identified, antibodies
