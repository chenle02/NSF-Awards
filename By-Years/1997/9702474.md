9702474 Wilson Our research focuses on modelling both the function and
architecture of biological olfaction in developing practical chemical sensing
Microsystems. The research is integrated with teaching efforts via traditional
senior-level courses taught in the area and in a novel outreach to elementary-
level students in Central Kentucky. Interactive demonstrations will be developed
for the elementary level student that link the physical (engineering) sciences
with biological sciences via our research in biologically-inspired, artificial
sensing systems. ***
