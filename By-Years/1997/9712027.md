This is a near-bottom magnetic survey and sampling program on the southern East
Pacific Rise designed primarily to evaluate the possibility that lineated shore
wavelength variations within the Bruhnes magnetic anomaly, and the central
anomaly magnetic high in particular, reflect geomagnetic intensity fluctuations.
Two long Deep Tow profiles will be obtained in a corridor at 17.5 degrees south,
and an additional four long Deep Tow lines will collected at 19.5 degrees south.
If fluctuations in the earth's field intensity do account for much of the tiny
wiggles commonly observed in oceanic magnetic profiles, these short wavelength
anomalies May provide new information on past geomagnetic intensity variations
as well as finer- scale temporal markers for evaluating ridge crest processes
than are available with polarity revesals alone.
