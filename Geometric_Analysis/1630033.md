The conference "Differential Geometry in the Large" will take place July 11 to
15, 2016 in Florence, Italy. The grant covers travel expenses and hotel expenses
for graduate students, postdocs, and senior mathematicians without other federal
funding. Further local expenses are covered by Italian grants and funds from the
University of Florenz. Participation by women and under represented minorities
is actively sought and encouraged. The meeting will encourage interaction
between recent Ph.D.'s based in the US and their Italian counterparts. Closer
relationships will be formed between graduate students that could well lead to
mathematical collaborations in the future.

The conference will provide an environment for American graduate students and
recent Ph.D.'s in which they can learn about new developments in global
Riemannian geometry, through research talks by international experts. The 4
topics selected, manifolds with lower curvature bounds, geometric flows, special
geometries and min-max theory have been particularly productive over the last
few years. The participants will also be given an opportunity to present their
results through talks and poster sessions, enabling especially younger
participants to initiate conversations with others.
