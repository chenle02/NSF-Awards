The principal investigator will use viscosity solution techniques to analyse
evolutionary phase transitions, singular stochastic controls, and boundary
control problems. The work on mean curvature flows will lead to a better
understanding of the relation between differential geometry and the mathematical
theory of fluids. Motion by mean curvature is one example of evolution of
surfaces determined by their shape. Evolutionary interface problems describe
phase transition boundaries and the motion in physical materials.
