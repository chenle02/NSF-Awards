Four plant growth chambers will be acquired to promote research in the areas of
plant physiology, plant molecular biology, and plant biophysics. Specific
projects will investigate: 1) developmental physiology in plants; 2)
photosynthate partitioning and transmembrane transport; 3) molecular genetics of
chloroplast coupling factor; 4) transfer cells and phloem loading; and 5)
biophysical aspects of photosynthesis.
