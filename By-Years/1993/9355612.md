9355612 Zubrowski This EDC project develops and conducts a pilot test of a
collection of video and print materials for teacher enhancement to support
teacher understanding and use of concrete materials and phenomena in middle
school science education. The materials focus on developing teachers' skills in
observing and supporting "hands-on" investigation and exploration. The videos
provide documentary footage of the many ways in which students interact with a
range of materials common in middle school physical science. Print resources
provide a surround for the videos. The project emphasizes research and
evaluation to identify how the design and content of the materials can maximize
the impact on teachers' understanding and practice, and the use of the materials
by instructors in different settings. The project also explores strategies for
distribution. Following the pilot it is anticipated that a full set of materials
will be produced and distributed. ***
