This award will provide one-half of the funds required to purchase five
portable Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers. The GPS receivers are
capable of rapid and accurate measurements of distance (e.g., better than
centimeter precision over base lines of 100 kilometers) and are important tools
in earthquake and other crustal deformation research. The receivers will be
acquired by UCLA for their research projects and are also to be contributed to a
pool of GPS receivers managed by the university consortium group (UNAVCO), who
will provide maintenance and repair for the instruments. UCLA is providing the
remaining half of the purchase costs. The instruments will be used in research
projects requiring the monitoring of crustal strain related to earthquakes in
the Los Angeles basin, the Parkfield-Cholame area, and the Coachella valley.
