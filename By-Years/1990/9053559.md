This project, "Inservice Teacher Training in Environmental Education", aims at
training 400 Wisconsin K-12 educators to teach environmental education (EE) in
all areas of the school curriculum. It also aims at increasing the amount of
instructional time spent teaching EE by these 400 teachers to a minimum of 5
hours per week. This unique model of inservice teacher training is developed and
implemented as a pilot program by the College of Natural Resources. The project
duration is 12 months, and the cost sharing is 27 percent of the amount
requested from National Science Foundation. The teacher preparation provides
instruction on the goals of EE; provides opportunities to acquire and apply the
knowledge, skills and attitudes inherent in EE; provides participatory and
practice-based training in the methods as well as the content of EE
instructional materials; provides training in using the classroom and the school
yard as sites for EE; and provides motivation for teachers from all backgrounds
and grade levels to teach EE. The teachers are selected from the 481 school
districts and 2002 public schools in the state of Wisconsin. Specific
encouragement is given to women, minorities, and disabled persons to
participate. A series of four courses are offered, starting in the summer of
1990, the second and third in early 1991, and the fourth in the summer of 1991.
Subsequently, there will be teacher evaluation student evaluation, and material
dissemination throughout the state.
