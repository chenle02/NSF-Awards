Research will be undertaken on the quantum mechanics of strongly- correlated
many-body systems. The objectives are to enhance our understanding of novel
phenomena which cannot be addressed by simple perturbation theory. Systems of
interest include the integer and fractional quantum Hall effect; transport in
mesoscopic devices; the interplay among disorder, interactions and
superconductivity in one-dimensional systems; and, the problem of fractional
statistics. An important question remaining in the integer quantum Hall effect
concerns the nature of Anderson localization in the presence of disorder. The
focus of the investigation on the fractional Hall effect will be on the
instability to Wigner crystallization in the low filling factor regime and on
the nature of edge-state excitations and their role in the transport properties
of mesoscopic devices. A central theme of the Hall effect work is the deep and
wide-ranging implications of the analyticity of the quantum wave functions in
the lowest Landau level. Previous work on the superconductor-insulator
transition will be extended to one-dimension and certain exactly soluble models
will be investigated. The notions of fractional statistics will be put to
practical application in the study of quantum spin systems in two-dimensions.
