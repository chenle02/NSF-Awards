This dissertation project explores the interaction of cultural, social, economic
and political factors in the construction of the sciences. The approach is a
comparative study of the neurosciences in the United States and China. The
research strategy includes participant observation, interviews with
neuroscientists in the U.S. and China, and content analysis of the publications
of American neuroscience and Chinese brain research leaders as well as American
and Chinese popular and professional sources on the images of the brain. The
research explores the social and cultural values, and economic and political
systems under which the research agenda for neurosciences has been set; the
formation, impact and transformation of cultural concepts of the brain and
gender as part of general cultural traditions and values; and the ways in which
sociopolitical systems and cultural traditions affect recruitment into careers
in the neurosciences and account for the differences in the research styles,
priorities and methods of neuroscientists in the U.S. and China. The objectives
of the dissertation are to demonstrate how the neurosciences are constructed in
different value contexts by studying the field itself and the careers of its
membership, and to explore the factors that may account for the differences
between American and Chinese neurosciences in research agendas, recruitment
patterns, and scientific careers.
