Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CHE-
0415540&lt;br/&gt;Harrison/Virginia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor Harrison and his coworkers
in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Virginia are exploring the
detailed photochemical dynamics of small molecules on alkali promoted platinum
and ruthenium surfaces. Using a combination of UHV spectroscopic probes and
theoretical calculations, the effects of alkali metal adsorption on the
photodissociation dynamics of molecules such as CO2, CH4, and N2 are being
examined. Information from these fundamental studies is useful in the subsequent
design of energy efficient photocatalytic processes for energy production and
environmental remediation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of solar energy to
drive catalytic processes for the formation of new energy and chemical
feedstocks, and the remediation of environmental contaminants, relies on an
understanding of the detailed surface photochemical processes on the catalyst.
Professor Harrison and his coworkers at the University of Virginia are
addressing these fundamental questions with a research program of experimental
measurement and calculational modeling. They are specifically interested in the
effects of alkali metal promotion on the photodissociation dynamics of small
molecules on well characterized platinum and ruthenium surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;
