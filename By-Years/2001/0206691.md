Nitrogen deposition, habitat fragmentation, and inbreeding can reduce the
likelihood that a plant population may persist. While many studies explore the
effect of a single disturbance, native plant populations are likely to
experience multiple and simultaneous disturbances. The efficiency with which
individuals acquire and use nitrogen (NUE) affects the response of populations
to nitrogen deposition. This response is sensitive to inbreeding caused by
fragmentation that can reduce NUE. It is therefore important to investigate
these perturbations together. Greenhouse studies with experimentally inbred
plants will address the quantitative effect of inbreeding on the acquisition and
use of nitrogen. Field studies of fragmented populations will address the effect
of fragmentation on inbreeding and NUE. The results of these empirical studies
will be used to predict the response of plants in fragmented landscapes to
increased nitrogen deposition. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These studies will examine
the mechanistic basis underlying previously documented responses of populations
to perturbation. The work, involving quantitative genetic analysis of the
ecologically specific attribute NUE will incorporate genetics into ecosystem and
community ecological study. Population persistence is a product of individuals'
varied responses to the environment. Simultaneous consideration of genetic and
environmental contributions to population dynamics is essential as conservation
biologists and other scientists make predictions about future persistence.
