1152924&lt;br/&gt;Moin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides partial travel
support for students and early-career scientists from U.S. universities to
attend the Center for Turbulence Research (CTR) 2012 Summer Program. This will
be the fourteenth biennial CTR Summer Program and the first with NSF support.
CTR Summer Programs involve about 50 participants from outside of Stanford who
join about 30 Stanford participants and NASA scientists for a one-month period
of intense study. The 2010 program was the largest to date with 83 participants
from 13 countries, including participants from 10 U.S. universities and national
laboratories. A competitive process is used to select the participants. They are
selected based on the merits of their research proposals, their proposal?s
relevance to areas of interest to CTR, and their research credentials.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit : The bulk of the Summer Program
involves hands on interrogation of numerical simulation databases for testing of
models and hypotheses proposed by the participants. Additional calculations to
generate new databases may be performed during the Summer Program. The
participants are divided into focus groups based on their proposed areas of
research. The primary objective of CTR is to stimulate and produce advances in
understanding and prediction of complex multi-physics turbulent flows for
engineering analysis. The primary means by which CTR seeks to achieve these
objectives is by bringing together groups of bright and accomplished individuals
in fields bearing on turbulence to address problems of practical interest.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The special biennial Summer School
provides opportunity for a concentrated collaborative effort by about fifty
advanced graduate students, their advisors, research scientists, and engineers
from industry and National Laboratories. An important element of the Summer
Program is the weekly tutorials. These tutorials are delivered by leading
experts in areas of interest to the participants, and typically last about two
hours each.
