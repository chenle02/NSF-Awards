The goal of this research is to develop non-destructive, or lossless, quantum
state detection methods for single trapped neutral atoms in order to realize
robust neutral atom qubits. This work will directly address an important
limitation in neutral atom qubit experiments, which is that quantum state
detection of single atoms results in the loss of the qubit from the trap. This
research will lead to increases in experimental efficiency for neutral atom
systems and enable exciting new developments in the field of quantum
information.

This research will advance the broader field of quantum information science,
which represents a new information paradigm at the cross-roads of information
science and physics that may lead to revolutionary new computing technologies
benefiting all of society. Ultra-cold atoms and molecules provide one of the
most promising experimental platforms for advancing the state of the art in
quantum information science. The results from this research may also impact
other technologically important applications of cold atom research, including
precision sensors for navigation and magnetometry, atomic clocks and emerging
quantum technologies.
