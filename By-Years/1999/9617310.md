CISE Research Instrumentation for an SMP Cluster Testbed This award provides
funds for the purchase of a cluster of symmetric multiprocessors (SMPs),
interconnected by a high-speed switch, to be used in parallel and distributed
data processing research. The SMP cluster will be connected to existing research
facilities, creating a rich research infrastructure. The primary purpose of the
testbed is to support experimental studies in four projects: large-scale
parallel data clustering as applied to image processing; communication
algorithms and libraries for distributed parallel computing; programming support
tools for specification and design, visualization, and resource allocation; and
design of parallel algorithms for feature extraction and matching in large-
scale, distributed, fingerprint databases. The results of this experimental
research will provide a better understanding of the issues and problems that
must be addressed in developing distributed parallel software for SMP clusters.
Moreover, these projects will produce tangible results in the form of
applications software, libraries, and tools for use by other researchers and
developers. The Department of Computer Science, College of Engineering, and
Michigan State University are strongly committed to the success of this project,
as evidenced by significant matching funds, leveraging of existing equipment,
and commitments for maintenance and support of the testbed.
