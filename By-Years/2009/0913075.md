This award provides support to conduct a workshop on energy manufacturing. The
objective of which is to gather a multi-disciplinary group of experts to explore
and define the research challenges in manufacturing required to translate new
sources of energy into petroleum substitutes. The focus of this workshop is to
assess the feasibility and near-term viability of various energy manufacturing
approaches, and to set forth an agenda for research on manufacturing
technologies that will accelerate the emergence of the more promising
approaches. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The benefits of this workshop will include
defining new connections between manufacturing research problems that will arise
as a result of considering them in the context of scaling up energy
manufacturing. It is expected that the challenges will stimulate new ideas about
how manufacturing could be organized, and how liquid fuels could be delivered.
The United States manufacturing industry will benefit from this workshop, and
this industry is a vital component of the United States economy. Delivering new
energy infrastructure is a significant opportunity for the manufacturing
industry to develop a new market for its capabilities. Therefore it is important
to identify the gaps in manufacturing technologies that could be bridged by
fundamental research.&lt;br/&gt;
