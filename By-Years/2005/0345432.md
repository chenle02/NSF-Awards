Professor Janis Louie is exploring new transition metal catalyzed routes for the
use of carbon dioxide as a reagent in organic synthesis. Mechanistic details of
the nickel catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition of diynes with carbon dioxide will be
elucidated, providing input for the design and synthesis of second generation
catalysts with higher reactivities and expanded substrate scope. Cycloaddition
regioselectivity will be evaluated with a variety of differentially substituted
asymmetric diynes, and the general methodology will be applied to the synthesis
of a representative pyrone natural product, tetillapyrone. Professor Louie will
develop an undergraduate honors organic chemistry program, designed to enhance
the quality of the undergraduate experience for highly motivated students, and
will also implement an outreach program within the University of Utah's ACCESS
program, enhancing the opportunities afforded young women scientists through
this scholarship and mentoring program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this CAREER
award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the teaching
and research program of Professor Janis Louie, of the Department of Chemistry at
the University of Utah. Professor Louie is developing novel methods for using
carbon dioxide, an inexpensive, safe (except with respect to its role as a
greenhouse gas) and abundantly available compound, for the synthesis of complex
organic molecules. Her studies are leading to the development of unique reaction
chemistry that will be of general applicability in the construction of organic
molecules displaying important chemical or biological properties. Professor
Louie is also developing an undergraduate honors organic chemistry program,
designed to enhance the quality of the undergraduate experience for highly
motivated students, and will also implement an outreach program within the
University of Utah's ACCESS program, enhancing the opportunities afforded young
women scientists through this scholarship and mentoring program.
