The objective of the proposed research is to use a lab-scale, integrated sensor-
computer technological platform for monitoring urban waste water. The proposed
effort is expected to produce a transformative solution to real-time and online
monitoring of urban waste water runoff for planning and decision making in civil
infrastructures, natural environment protection, and water pollution related
emergency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project proposes to explore a new sensor-
computer framework for monitoring and controlling urban water pollution. The
interdisciplinary team of civil engineering, electrical engineering, and
computer science/informatics will address the complex relevant issues in sensor
instrumentation, hydraulics, computation modeling, data processing, and
communications. This team effort will advance the multidisciplinary knowledge
and turn the relevant technical issues involved into an implement able
technology for broad applications including specific impact to DC waterways
pollution monitoring and control. Further, as the research is interdisciplinary,
students will get a comprehensive engineering education across the conventional
disciplinary boundaries. The project will provide hands-on activities designed
for underrepresented students and minority students. The project team is at a
Historically Black College/University (HBCU) with equal distribution of female
and male groups.&lt;br/&gt;
