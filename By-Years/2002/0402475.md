The aim of this collaborative award is to produce Holocene high-resolution
records of climate variability across the Mongolian Plateau over the past 2,000
years. The Mongolian Plateau, a region of steep climatic gradients and
distinctively zoned vegetation, is influenced by three circulation systems: the
Westerlies, the Asian Summer Monsoon, and the Winter Monsoon. Changes in these
circulation systems are intricately linked to large-scale oscillations in the
global climate system, (i.e., El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), North
Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and North Pacific Oscillation (NPO)).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will involve a combination of geophysical
proxies (i.e., magnetic granulometry, grain size, gray scale), geochemical
proxies (i.e., iron geochemistry, carbon isotopes of organic matter and
carbonate), and geobiological proxies (i.e., pollen, diatoms, phytoliths,
charcoal) to examine the question of whether the Middle Holocene Climatic
Optimum was synchronous across Central Asia. The researchers will use data from
existing lacustrine cores and loess/paleosol sections as well as drilling two
lakes in the region (i.e., Qigai Nuur, Ulaal Nuur) to develop new data.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will enable the collaboration of American
scientists with an international group of scientists from developing countries
(i.e., China and Mongolia) to enhance partnerships in a global network of
paleoclimate research. The research will help establish collaborations among
international institutions as well as promote undergraduate and graduate
education in US and non-US institutions.
