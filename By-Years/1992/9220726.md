This grant in mathematical physics will use the "consistent-history" approach
to resolve some longstanding problems relating to the properties of a quantum
mechanical system. First, the approach will be applied to the relation of
quantum mechanics to the statistical irreversibility embodied in the second law
of thermodynamics. Then it will be used to illuminate a collection of paradoxes
in which quantum mechanics predicts violations of either Bell's inequality or
common-sense notions of reality, locality and the like. A study of the
consistency of various quantum mechanical histories will indicate where the
sources of various conceptual problems are.
