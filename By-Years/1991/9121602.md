Dissertation student: Peter J. Ramberg; Dissertation topic: "The Early History
of Stereochemistry, 1874-1920." Mr. Ramberg is studying several cases in the
early history of stereochemistry that show how chemists became convinced that
they were dealing with a new cause of chemical phenomena. He is investigating
how and why chemists came to the conclusion that spatial characteristics were a
"real" cause of chemical phenomena. Using the unpublished manuscripts of
Johannes Wislicenus and Victor Meyer, as well as the published chemical record,
Mr. Ramberg is examining the birth of stereochemistry and is exploring the
reasons for its appeal to chemists as well as the reasons some objected to its
importance. Following an examination of the birth of stereochemistry, Mr.
Ramberg is also examining three early case studies where stereo chemical
principles were invoked: 1) theories of unsaturation, 2) nitrogen compounds, and
3) the discovery and explanation of the Walden inversion. The story of the
adoption of and resistance to stereochemical principles reveals many assumptions
and undercurrents in chemical theory of the late 19th century. The issues raised
include the role of spatial properties in chemical explanations, the
reinterpretation of the old theoretical language of chemistry, the relationship
between chemical theory and chemical evidence, the shift in focus from
composition to transformation, the autonomy of chemistry from physics, and the
peculiar concentration of stereochemists in Germany.
