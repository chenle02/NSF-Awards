A two year, team taught, well coordinated sequence of courses will be designed
and implemented that will integrate topics in linear algebra, calculus and
calculus based courses in the typical pre-engineering curriculum. The sequence
will integrate topics normally covered in calculus, vector calculus, linear
algebra, differential equations, introductory physics, and engineering courses
such as statics, dynamics, thermodynamics, and circuits. The transitions from
the geometry and analysis of mathematics to the principles of physics to the
engineering applications will appear seamless. Common ideas in mathematics,
physics, and engineering will be presented with mutually supporting viewpoints
in a timely and mutually reinforcing way. The capabilities of calculators and
computers will be used as an integral part of the project to assist the student
in report writing and oral presentations as well as in visualizing the geometric
and analytic interrelations and interdependences of the physical laws, and the
application of these physical laws in solving practical engineering problems.
Course materials suitable for commercial publication are anticipated.
