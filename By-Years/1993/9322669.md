9322669 Popek This project will develop and prototype concepts and techniques
needed to support network access to users even after periodic disconnection of
user workstations from the network. More specifically, the project will develop
a prototype based on the idea of pre-loading the workstations (and portable
computers) with files that are most likely to be accessed during disconnected
mode. In addition, the project will develop software support tools to
resynchronize files on the portable computers with file serves upon reconnect.
Disconnection must be treated as a normal, desirable mode of operation, rather
than as an error condition. Even after days of disconnection from the network,
the disconnected machine should be able to operate and deliver most of the
functionality associated with the network environment, including access to
shared network files and other resources. Providing this capability around the
clock, regardless of the geographic location will make a significant impact on
the future of computing environments and collaborative work environments. ***
