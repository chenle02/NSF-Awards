The objective of this project is to set up a parallel processing facility in
support of courses in concurrent processing. The core of the proposed system is
a Sequent Balance 8000 computer with eight processors, eight megabytes of memory
and an ethernet interface. The parallel processor will be used in several
computer science courses and student design projects.
