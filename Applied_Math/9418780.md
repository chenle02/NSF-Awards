This investigation constitutes an interdisciplinary and international approach
to establishing new mathematical tools and computational models for the study of
localizable and nonstationary chaotic attractors with the statistical behavior
of solitons. These attractors, termed chaotic solitons, have been theorized as
having a role in simple conservative systems with direct relevance to a wide
range of phenomena including elementary particle interactions, atomic
clustering, and biomolecular dynamics such as protein folding and cytoskeletal
assembly. Chaos and solitons have generally been portrayed as being disparate
with the consequence that quantum theory and chaos have been generally
dissociated. However, the present line of research points toward mathematical
affinities between quantum field theory and multidimensional nonstationary
solitons; these affinities indicate simpler methods for describing quantum
processes, derivable from classical chaos and network theories. Algebraic and
topological methods for representing the statistical descriptions of attractor
field states will be explored. Extension of one-dimensional chaotic soliton
models into two, three and four dimensions with constraints relevant to observed
physics will be a fundamental first step. An extensive amount of theoretical
work has been done in particular by a long-standing group of mathematicians at
the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia, under the direction
of Dr. I. Bogolubsky. A major goal of this proposal is to consolidate, evaluate,
and mathematically transform the work that has grown out of this Russian team
into mathematics and computer modeling readily accessible to the U. S.
mathematical, statistical, and physics communities. The proposed effort is based
on the belief that it is time-critical to organize efforts to consolidate and
extend this work through international cooperative study.
