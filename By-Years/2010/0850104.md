Interdisciplinary (99)

The vision of the Rhode Island College S-STEM project is to create a small but
sustainable interdisciplinary community of student scientists. The project is
admitting a group of ten "Quahog Cohort" who are majoring in biology, chemistry,
computer science, mathematics, and/or physics annually. Each Cohort forms part
of a Science, Computing and Mathematics Learning Community that take courses
together for their first two years. S-STEM students are being introduced in a
"Community of Practice" to research in their freshman year and join a research
group as sophomores. As juniors and seniors, participants continue with courses
in their respective majors, mentor younger Cohorts and help recruit new Cohorts,
while becoming more deeply involved in their own research. Supplementary
activities include organized social activities each semester, STEM internships,
and student travel to conferences.
