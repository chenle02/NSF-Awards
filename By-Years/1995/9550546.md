9550546 Fisher IMaST II is a year long eighth grade course that reflects the
strong interactions between mathematics, science and technology. Like the
seventh grade model on which it is built, it requires 120 minute per day for the
year; but students may be in separate classes. The coordinated content focuses
on environmental science including biological, physical and Earth science;
algebra and geometry; and communication, construction and transportation
technologies. The instruction is constructivist, activity-based, and uses the
learning cycle. It emphasizes problem-solving, using real world situations and
applications and exhibits the connections among disciplines and between local
and global concerns. The materials are developed through the collaboration of
master teachers, curriculum specialists and consultants from industry and
education. They are field tested in ten different schools. The modules include
student and teacher editions, an implementation guide for administrators, and
results of ethnographic studies and evaluation data for the program.
