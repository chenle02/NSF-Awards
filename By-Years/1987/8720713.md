A detailed sedimentological study of the Miocene Siwalik deposits of the Potwar
Plateau in northern Pakistan is proposed. Temporally and spatially varying
fluvial paleoenvironments will be reconstructed in terms of paleochannel and
floodplain geometry and hydraulics, chemistry of lacustrine waters, nature of
paleosols, distribution of animal and plant activity, river diversions, and
deposition rates. Changes in these characters will be related to local, regional
and/or global controls including climate, tectonism, and sediment supply. It
will then be possible to understand an important period of evolution of land
organisms in relation to changes in the physical and chemical environment over a
period between 14 and 7 my B.P. The Siwalik deposits offer an unparalleled
opportunity to realise these objectives because of: 1) excellent 3-D exposures
of 3000 m + of strata; 2) previous studies of lithostratigraphy, vertebrate
paleontology, and paleomagnetic age-dating; 3) independent constraints on
climatic change and tectonic activity using geologic data now available for
areas outside the depositional basin. Understanding of the evolution of fluival
deposits (including the fossils they contain) in response to tectonism and
climate has implications for rocks of all ages worldwide. Such knowledge has
economic implications because fluival deposits are commonly reservoirs for
water, oil, and gas, also are sources of coal, gold, uranium, and building
materials.
