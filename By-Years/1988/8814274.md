This award will support collaborative research between Profs. Elizabeth G.
Williams of the University of Kentucky, Lexington and Barbara F. Palser of
Rutgers University, with Drs. John L. Rouse and R. Bruce Knox of the University
of Melbourne, Australia. The investigators will study the pollination and
fertilization processes of Rhododendron. The process of fertilization will be
examined using both light and electron microscopy, and the pistil molecules
involved in control of pollen tube growth will be identified. The project
combines the skills and facilities of the investigators, with Drs. Rouse and
Knox providing samples for pollen bioassays and electron microscopy facilities
in their own laboratories; and Drs. Williams and Palser contributing skills in
microscopy and in the experimental techniques of plant genetics and reproductive
biology. This research will advance our knowledge of the means by which
fertilization is controlled by the female organ of the flower, leading,
ultimately, to an ability to manipulate the reproductive processes of flowering
plants to control seed setting and to facilitate hybridization in plant breeding
programs.
