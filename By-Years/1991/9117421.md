This project is for final development of a new technique that directly measures
volumetric changes of silicate liquids as a function of temperature and
pressure. This new technique will operate over a larger range in temperature and
viscosity than is currently accessible with existing volumetric techniques, and
will measure volume changes to at least an order of magnitude greater precision.
Final development of this technique will include measurements of materials whose
thermal expansivities are well constrained, and comparisons to existing data.
Having completed development of the technique at 1 bar, several measurements
will be made of the thermal expansivity of silicate liquids in the system CaO-
Na2O-Al2O3-SiO2 from below Tg to 1600oC. In addition, in situ measurements of V
of crystallization of silicate liquids that crystallize readily at temperatures
below their liquids will also be explored.
