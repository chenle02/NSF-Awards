The IDEAS program: Increasing Diversity through Engineering Academic
Scholarships increases the numbers of diverse students enrolling in and
graduating from the College of Engineering (CoE). In keeping with the
University's Strategic Plan, and the 3 year plan developed by the Dean of the
College of Engineering, the IDEAS program targets first year students;
specifically African American, Hispanic, and Native American (URM students)
freshman and transfer students of all ethnicities. The specific objectives of
IDEAS are: (1) to reduce the time-to-degree completion of students who transfer
to Virginia Tech, and (2) to increase the numbers of freshman URM students who
enroll in and earn degrees from the CoE. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve the
first stated objective, IDEAS provides scholarships for incoming transfer
students as encouragement to enroll in summer school prior to the beginning of
their first full academic year. Scholarships cover tuition for summer enrollment
in the required introductory engineering course(s) with additional academic 2
year scholarship funds being awarded based on successful completion of the
summer course(s). To achieve the second objective, scholarship funds are offered
to freshman engineering students who are offered admission to Virginia Tech,
specifically targeting URM students. All students will have to apply for the
IDEAS scholarship and a committee will select the scholarship recipients.
